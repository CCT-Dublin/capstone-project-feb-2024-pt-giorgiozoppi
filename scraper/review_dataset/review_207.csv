Without a doubt, we will return.",5,2024,10,13
207,The most wonderful experience,"My daughter had her civil marriage ceremony the other day (bigger wedding in 2 weeks) and the family group celebrated afterwards with dinner in the Saddle Room. From the lovely barman who served us in No 27 to the staff in the restaurant - all were absolutely amazing. We cannot say enough about the staff and the whole experience. From the greeting by the doorman (who recognised them as they passed today and wished them well) until we left later that evening we felt special. 
Other family milestones have been celebrated at the Shelbourne (graduations etc) so it was our no 1 choice to go to after the civil ceremony. The newly married couple have decided to celebrate every anniversary at theShelbourne such was the experience. The food was gorgeous too!

Local pubs and restaurants nearby and a beautiful neighbourhood to walk in. Lovely, comfortable, cozy rooms.

It was a fantastic start to our Ireland and Scotland tour. Lovely establishment!",5,2024,10,04

The room was absolutely beautifully appointed and we didn't want for anything.

207,Two great stays at the Shelbourne,"We had two lovely stays to begin and end our tour of Ireland.  The hotel is beautiful and in a great location close to pubs, restaurants and shopping as well as walking distance to some of the museums.

The rooms are very nice....not particularly large but ample and nicely appointed.  Both stays we had a room overlooking the park with windows that open which is important to us to have fresh air.

The staff was excellent and responsive and seemed to go out of their way to ensure we had a great experience.",5,2024,09,23
207,"great location, but underwhelming with issues suitable of a motel","The Shelbourne Dublin is undeniably a beautiful and historic building, impeccably maintained, and rich with charm. The service is excellent—staff are attentive and professional, although there’s a slightly smug attitude that feels a bit out of place for a five-star hotel.

Unfortunately, the room itself was a disappointment. Despite the grandeur of the hotel, the linens were tattered, and the towel rack was not only dusty but also failed to warm. Details like the toilet paper roll being mounted at a 45-degree angle only added to the sense that the room’s upkeep wasn’t quite on par with the high price point. For €800 a night, these basic amenities shouldn’t need to be mentioned; they should be flawless by default.",3,2024,09,20
207,First class!,"Warm welcome on arrival, first class service! First visit, we did not have much time in the hotel due to hectic schedule. Will be back again soon to take full advantage of the excellent facilities. Great location, happy to say Highly recommended!",5,2024,09,19

207,Excellent Concierge Service,"I didn’t stay at this hotel but I stopped by for some assistance, and Keith the concierge went above and beyond. His kindness, insight, and helpfulness were truly remarkable. His service alone ensured that I’ll be staying here on my next trip to Dublin. Thanks Keith!",5,2024,09,17
207,Great first time experience in Ireland.,"“Nice hotel. Room didn’t have much of a view. Staff and service more than made up for it. Common areas were beautiful. Concierge, front desk and bellmen were great. Recommended restaurants were all good and in close proximity to hotel. Walking tour was good as well. Arranged transportation to outlying areas was a huge help.  No complaints.”",5,2024,09,16
207,"Elegant, comfortable","A perfect location  for touring Dublin. And, of course, an elegant property with tasteful, comfortable rooms and a variety of restaurants, all with delicious options.

The perfect location with Dublin, an amazing classic old hotel with incredibly fine touches and impeccable service at every turn!

207,"Excellent service, ambiance and food","We celebrated my daughters wedding in The Constitution Room, upstairs overlooking St Stephens Green. The food and the service were excellent. This is the room where Michael Collins signed The Constitution, which gave Ireland its Independence in 1921. We had drinks I. The 1824 bar which is fir Residents only.  I loved the walls lined with books and the murals depicting scenes from Irelands past. Would definitely recommend.",5,2024,09,12
207,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"Everything was perfect. The room was huge, comfortable and had everything anyone would ever need when away from home. The room was cleaned every day and someone came for turn down service every night. The staff were so nice and welcoming.

I would highly recommend this hotel. The food was delicious and room service was prompt and would set the table upon delivery. Water and a glass, and slippers, were left by our beds ever night. The towels were changed every day and were left on the warming rack. I felt like a queen while I was here.",5,2024,08,28
207,Hard to match Shelbourne comfort other than the amazing people of Ireland,"An amazing luxury hotel in the heart of Dublin. An ideal home base to explored this beautiful island, its many stunning visual attractions and kind, generous and helpful people.
Do it all with comfort and warm welcomes that all start at the Shelbourne",5,2024,08,25
207,The experience at The Shelbourne?  A “20” out of “10”!!!,"“Every staff member we encountered was the perfect mix of professionalism and friendliness. No request went unaddressed. We would definitely stay at The Shelbourne on our next trip to Dublin! Thank you very much!
I felt the restaurant offerings were different enough to warrant multiple meals onsite. I would have liked to see a few more vegetarian/vegan offerings, but I made it work.  The service was off the charts positive…thank you for a wonderful stay!”",5,2024,08,24
207,Visit to Dublin,"The hotel is very well appointed, luxurious and has excellent food/ service. Pat, the doorman, is charming and very helpful with sightseeing suggestions, directions, and information. He made us feel welcome every day of our stay. One of our best hotel experiences.  A hotel with character. Wonderful variety of restaurants and venues.”",5,2024,08,23
207,Extraordinary,"Deserves its top rating.  Beautifully preserved. Classic.  Great restaurants and bars. Really helpful friendly staff.  Great location.  We stayed two nights and we didn’t want to leave.  If you like the classic style and beautiful interiors, this alone is enough to justify the choice. And the restaurants are first rate.  Make sure you visit the Horseshoe Bar.",5,2024,08,23
207,A special place.,"The Shelbourne has never failed to provide excellent service and accommodation. The staff in the restaurants are excellent and we are always greeted with a smile by everyone.

As a child in the 70s my parents would bring us to the Shelbourne the weekend before Christmas for dinner after we finished our Christmas shopping. We were always amazed by the lights, the tree, the restaurant and the staff who treated us as though we were special.

I moved to the United States 35 years ago and travel 55% of the time for business, staying in hotels across the US and Europe. Some hotels are memorable, and some are not. I have stayed at the Shelbourne twice in the last year and on each occasion, I felt the same thrill as when I was 6 and 7 years of age. It takes a very special place to maintain that aura. Thank you!!",5,2024,08,22
207,Solid hotel in great location!,Very nice autograph hotel in a great location in Dublin. The staff is very friendly and it was nice. They had a private bar for hotel yes on the second floor. It was the best breakfast we had during our entire trip to Ireland. Large rooms and bathrooms and the beds were super comfortable.,5,2024,08,21
207,It Felt Like Home,"“My thirteen year old grandson and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay from the moment we stepped into the lobby until the time we left. The room was well tended, clean and elegant. We loved the breakfasts for the enormous and delicious food selection and the excellent attention by the wait staff to us. I look forward to staying at the hotel in the near future again. It felt like home within minutes of walking in.
The experience was perfection from beginning to end. At one point we wanted afternoon tea and it was fully booked. The hostess physically walked us into the ""bar"" to make sure they would be able to attend to our wishes for tea. I felt very cared for by this gesture.”",5,2024,08,17
207,Hotel 5 - Service 3.5,"The hotel itself is immaculate!  One of the nicest older hotels I have ever stayed at.  Also the location is perfect.  The park across the street was amazing and getting to everything in Dublin was east.  The only thing I would improve on is service...and I noticed this throughout Ireland...but if you're going to call yourself a 5 star hotel, it starts with service.  We ate at the hotel 4 times and everytime the service staff got one thing in our order wrong.  We also went to the Horseshoe bar in the hotel which was absolutely stunning...except the bartender.  Seemed like he didn't really want to be there and took forever to make us 4 of the ""signature drinks"" that were on the drink menu.",4,2024,08,16
207,Gorgeous Property in Perfect Location,"Beautiful property. We can’t wait to stay at the Shelbourne Hotel again. The bellman and check-in ladies were the nicest. Also, the location is perfect to be able to walk to everything. I highly recommend walking to Sweny’s Pharmacy for a reading of the Ulysses and a song.",5,2024,08,15
207,Two Fails by Hotel,"The hotel was persistent in efforts to overcharge me. It charged separately for breakfast even though it was included in my rate. They corrected this when I brought it to their attention. Hotel did NOT correct an erroneous bar tab when I brought it to their attention. I had to ask a second time for my bill to be corrected. 

I rang for dinner reservations. The gentleman took my name, room number, and phone number, and promised to get back to me. Hotel never called and never provided reservations. 

Two hassles and two disappointments.",2,2024,08,15
207,Outstanding Hotel,"Everything was top notch. I appreciate the overall sense of comfort and the variety of amenities (food, bar, gym, etc.)  Really nice hotel, great location, excellent service. Clearly distinguished from other hotels I have used.  I will absolutely stay here again on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2024,08,15
207,Best way to celebrate our 25th anniversary.,"I proposed to my wife at The Shelbourne 27 years ago, and we wanted to celebrate our 25th anniversary in style, so as it is their bicentennial year, it was a “no brainer” to stay at The Shelbourne.

The friendly staff and attention to detail is second to none.  From the moment you arrive at The Shelbourne you are made to feel welcome and all your needs are catered for.  We can’t wait to return!”",5,2024,08,15
207,Highly Recommend,"The attention to details from service, to decor and food service is unmatched.  This is the finest hotel and stay that I can remember having in many years of travel.  everyday a different staff member would inquire if our party needed anything or what could be done to make our stay more enjoyable.  Highly recommend.",5,2024,08,14
207,"Excellent Hotel, especially for first time in Dublin","This was my first time in Dublin, so safety was the top priority. I always felt secure, and the staff was incredible, from the doorman and concierge to room service. The location was perfect for walking to food, shopping and entertainment.  Their in-house restaurants were top notch and had room service many times that was fabulous. 10 out of 10 and 5 stars!  I am a ""hotel snob"" and I literally have zero complaints.  Also, everyone there that asked where we were staying said it was the best hotel in Dublin!",5,2024,08,14
207,Our third trip to Dublin,Bar #27We had an excellent two-day stay at the hotel prior to a cruise.  The service and the attentive staff were outstanding.  Alica at the front desk was particularly helpful.  We received an early check-in and a late check-out.  Breakfast and Bar #27 were enjoyable eating experiences.  We are already thinking about a return trip.,5,2024,08,13
207,Iconic Experience,"To a person, the staff was spectacular (I recognize that this statement sounds preposterous). The physical facility was well maintained and very clean. Truly enjoyed the bones of this hotel that’s served patrons for quite a while. I would return to this property in a heartbeat. Excellence.",5,2024,08,11

We had a wonderful three-nigh stay there!",5,2024,08,08
207,Little America (For the Well-Heeled) in Dublin,"We enjoyed a lovely week at the Shelbourne, which we experienced as a luxury property ideally located for sightseeing, shopping, and more. The staff at all levels and across all guest functions were ever-welcoming and gracious without being oversolicitous, and the physical plant is an impressive showcase. Traditional room furnishings speak quiet elegance. Almost every guest seemed to be American though — like an outpost of the US embassy in nearby Ballsbridge. 

Our only bone to pick was a small matter of capital improvement, but a genuine curiosity: Why provide a hair dryer when none of the bathrooms are equipped with outlets to accept such a higher-voltage appliance? (There were only small shaver outlets in our original Heritage Wing Park-View King and the Junior Suite in the same wing to which we upgraded from night #2 onward). Food for thought when the hotel does its next facilities upgrade.",5,2024,08,08
207,Quintessential Dublin Luxury,"This hotel and bar is well imprinted on Dubliners psyche as the home of luxury. It’s an old hotel the mat has all the 5 Star trimmings of great service, luxurious ambience and decadent interior styling. It’s well worth staying here if you can, or even if you can’t, just stop in to snaps the ambience and enjoy a luxurious Irish Coffee.",5,2024,08,08
207,Amazing Experience,"Our amazing stay at the Shelbourne was stepping into luxury and history all at the same time.  With a prime location overlooking St. Stephen's Green, I cannot rave anymore about the impeccable service. The rooms are a blend of modern amenities and classic charm, which is exactly what we were looking for in a hotel. 
I definitely will be back for sure, and this time stay even longer!",5,2024,08,06
207,A Memorable Stay with Stunning Views,"From the moment we stepped into the lobby, we knew we were in for a treat. The staff were incredibly attentive and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The rooms were spotless, and the amenities were top-notch. We especially loved the rooftop bar with its stunning views. Can't wait to come back!",5,2024,08,05
207,Great for conferences,"It was a great and luxurious 3 days at the hotel.
Rooms are very unique and room service is very well orginised. We held two different meetings at the hotel. One at the first floor with collegues which was smaller but with every facility and nice park view and the other at the big meeting/conference hall with over 200 hundred colleagues in a nice ambience.
The bar and the breakfast hall was excellent. Location is very central.",5,2024,08,04
207,"Terrible rooms, has gone downhill by a big margin","This is my 3rd time staying at the shelbourne, first two times everything was perfect, this time I got a room with a 32"" TV. I would expect a better size TV in a 3 star hotel than the shelbourne. This is an absolute disgrace, specially when you can't even connect your own devices like a roku stick etc. 

Needless to say I’ll be taking my business to the Conrad and the intercontinental in the future as they're much more modern properties.",1,2024,08,03
207,Post cruise 3 days of fun and adventure in Dublin. Our stay at the Shelbourne was icing on the cake. Wonderful 5 star.,"See review title. Post cruise 3 day fun and adventure in Dublin.

207,Excellent Hotel,"This is a beautiful and older hotel in a very nice section of Dublin. Service is extremely good: As an example, we arrived early and the front desk staff worked hard to get us into our room hours before check in. Our room was a good size, comfortable, and with a strong wifi signal and many outlets. 

I would happily return.",5,2024,07,27
207,See Ava at the No 27,"Went to the bar, No. 27.  Had the most amazing fish and chips but by far the best part was our server, Ava.  She was extremely knowledgeable and courteous.  She made us feel warm and contributed to us having a great time.  She taught us Gaeilge, the native language.  If you come here, you must ask for Ava.",5,2024,07,26

207,Love the Shelbourne,"It's the second I have stayed.  The first time we did a PR event there; the food was fabulous, the staff courteous.  That night it snowed badly and 1 night trip ended up being a week as no planes were flying.  Honestly if you're going to be stranded anywhere, that was the place to be!!  This time was also for business.  Again, food is fabulous and the Cinnamon toast for breakfast is the best.  It is in THE perfect position to wander around glorious Dublin too.",5,2024,07,19

207,Shelbourne Luxurious Stay,"We were thoroughly impressed with the Shelbourne staff, accommodations and breakfast during our one night stay. We wish our travel plans would have allowed us to stay longer! Simply perfect all around.  Full Disclosure: The hotel choice was part of our Tauck tour.  We truly wish we had at least two nights at The Shelbourne to enjoy it.",5,2024,07,16
207,An amazing stay at The Shelbourne!,"My wife and I were on our first visit to Ireland for our Anniversary and I can't say enough great things about our stay at The Shelbourne in Dublin! The hotel was beautiful and clean and well situated to key areas of Dublin. And the service was outstanding right from the moment the Bellman greeted us at our car to the staff throughout the hotel. The highlight for us during our stay was an afternoon tea at The Lord Mayors Lounge which was an amazing experience both in the presentation and taste of the food (our compliments to the chef(s), but also to the excellent attention given by our servers Anna and Alana! We highly recommend the Afternoon tea! Thank you for an amazing stay we will always remember!",5,2024,07,15

Would definitely stay there again.   The staff was very kind and friendly.   The bed and linens were great.,5,2024,07,12
207,We will be back,Everyone is so efficient. I was able to check in VERY early (I wasn’t expecting that). On check out my bag was taken down for me and placed in a taxi. By the time I got down and checked out the taxi was outside with the door open ready for me. Thanks so much for paying attention to small details. Our stay was perfect!,5,2024,07,11
207,A Luxury Experience at its finest.....Divine!!!!,"Etore , I hope I am spelling this correctly, and the team at the hotel were absolutely lovely and beyond accommodating and helpful. My experience staying at the Shelbourne historic hotel was grand and extremely comfy cozy. Just absolutely divine.",5,2024,07,10
207,Wonderful Property!!,What a wonderful beautiful hotel. Because of my Bonvoy status with Marriott we were upgraded to the Martin Burke Suite! It exceeded every expectation we had of the hotel. Every aspect of our visit was wonderful! Thanks for making our time in Dublin a truly memorable experience.,5,2024,07,10
207,Classy hotel!,Wonderful hotel! Fabulous location in Dublin. Breakfast was very good. The customer service was great... and I loved the availability of the printed newspaper in the lobby! Great to also have the choice of still and sparkling water in our room.  The decor of the hotel was very classy. Customer service fit the classy hotel - very high class and felt very catered to.,5,2024,07,09
207,"“All wonderful, especially the concierge and reception staff.  Two hundred years of history, well presented.”","A great hotel, from the central location across from St. Stephen's Green park. Easy walking to museums, shopping on Grafton Street, Irish music at night at O'Donoghues across the street and the hop-on, hop-off buses stopping across the street. Reception staff was welcoming and despite the hotel being nearly fully booked managed to keep us for another night. Concierge staff are superb, arranging tickets from Guinness brewery, Kilmainham jail, Book of Kells and other must-sees. Also able to help with questions on where to go, what to see. A fine hotel indeed.",5,2024,07,03
207,The Very Definition of Elegance,"We celebrated our wedding anniversary at The Shelbourne and it was the very definition of elegance. When you enter the door you are greeted with friendly faces immediately followed by lovely fresh flowers that smelled divine.  The staff was welcoming, friendly, and responsive. We enjoyed breakfast daily and cocktails at the bars. The central location enabled us to walk everywhere to enjoy all that Dublin offers, including the International Literature Festival Dublin (a trip highlight). I only wish we had more time to enjoy the spa, salon, and pool. We look forward to visiting again, thank you!",5,2024,07,01
207,Irish Comfort,"My wife and I just returned from a trip to Ireland. Our first stop was five nights at the historic Shelbourne on St. Stephens Green in Dublin. They are currently celebrating their 200th anniversary.

The Shelbourne is part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection Hotels. Having some status with Marriott, we were upgraded to a large, comfortable room with many amenities. We booked our stay with Bonvoy points as we felt the conversion rate is more favorable in Europe than the US.

We also qualified for a complimentary breakfast for two each morning. The hotel is centrally located in a nice part of town, across from a City Park. There is no on-site self-parking, but valet parking is available for a nominal fee.

The Shelbourne has multiple bars and eateries, all good. The service at the Shelbourne was outstanding. The accommodations and food were equally enjoyable. Well done! Keep up the good work.

We highly recommend the Shelbourne for anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2024,06,30
207,Can't wait to return!,"Wonderful, quiet hotel. Great bed and pillows. Good restaurant. Great location. Really nice hotel. The Staff was very helpful. Our flight arrived in Dublin at 4:30 a.m. As Marriot Platinum members, they were able to give as UN early check in, so we basically got a full free day to eat breakfast, shower, and nap upon our arrival.  Expensive and worth it. ",5,2024,06,26
207,Wonderful Two Night Stay,"Wonderful hotel, professional staff and great location.  Maybe the most important hotel, in the most important neighborhood, in the most important financial, government and cultural center of the country. Very happy to have shared a couple of days here.",5,2024,06,26
207,The Reflection of Perfection.,Excellent service. Excellent room.  Excellent hotel. You only have to walk through the doors to immediately become immersed & enveloped in the history of the place & its regard for standards. I’ve encountered it nowhere else & would now stay nowhere else.,5,2024,06,26
207,"chaotic, rude staff, unorganized, misleading expectations","absolutely horrendous service. the staff was extremely rude and harsh with us at check-in, they lie about the state of the rooms to everyone who walks in. we had to wait a long line at 10am to check in, and were lied to that the room would be ready in an hour because it was being cleaned. we took a red eye flight and were exhausted, so we waited the hour and nobody called us. we went back to check they harshly scolded us that they aren’t required to have a room ready till 3pm (which is fine, but why lie about it at 10am if that’s the case?). on our way in, a doorman took our bags and confused them with some other family’s and didn’t even bother to ask us if we were in the same party at them, just assumed. pretty awful all around. I was hoping for a pleasant stay.",1,2024,06,26
207,Fabulous Stay at the Shelbourne,"We loved our stay at The Shelbourne!   The Staff were incredibly helpful and gracious, our rooms were very comfortable, and we enjoyed a great variety for dining and drinks! The location is perfect to walk to and enjoy all of the hot spots in Dublin!",5,2024,06,25
207,Loved it,"Great business hotel destination. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The staff are polite and friendly. The staff in the main bar are excellent and the breakfast was very good. I will definitely be coming back.

I will also have to mention their after check out service. They kindly retrieved my bag from the boot of an errant local taxi and got it back to me at the end of my board meeting. All done with a smile.",5,2024,06,24
207,The Wonderful Shelbourne,Wonderful hotel in a fantastic Location with comfortable rooms & great food & atmospheric buzz. Recent refurbishments were a great addition and always enjoy the horseshoe bar. All in all highly recommended great for family special occasions & couples.,5,2024,06,24
207,Great Hotel!,"Great property with incredible service, the rooms are wonderful and the location perfect!  It is an easy walk from good pubs and restaurants as well across the street from a beautiful park. Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Dublin.",5,2024,06,23
207,Fantastic,"I can't say enough good things about our experience at the Shelbourne! The staff were remarkable in every single way, friendly, welcoming and very helpful. We had a delux king room with no view. It was very spacious and well appointed. The daily housekeeping and turn down service was lovely. We did send out a wee bit of laundry which came back cleaner than it had ever been. While expensive it was worth it. I used the health club daily. As an avid lap swimmer I was very happy with the 18 m lap pool. The steam room was great and while I did not use the rest of the fitness facilities they looked very good. They do offer yoga several times a week. The only drawback was the shower water in the ladies locker room never got very warm.  The breakfast buffet was wonderful and I would say probably slightly better than most of the other Marriott properties we have stayed at in Europe. I have Celiac Disease and while there was plenty for me to eat most of the hot food items did contain gluten. There was packaged gluten free scones, cookies and the staff were able to provide gluten-free toast for me. I did not over anything off the breakfast menu but I believe they could have provided gluten-free hot food for me if I wanted. We also had dinner twice in the No 27 bar. The food was very good but I did encounter an issue with some confusion about if the hamburger without a bun was gluten-free or not. The first night the staff assured me there was not gluten in the actual hamburger meat. I enjoyed it and did not get sick. Two days later the staff told me there was gluten in the meat and I could not have it and they were very firm about that. I did follow up with someone the next morning and was assured there was not gluten in the burger meat but this really left me without confidence in the staff's knowledge. Other than that it was a wonderful stay and we would return in a heart beat!",5,2024,06,21
207,Magnificent Hotel in a charming area of Dublin.,"What a gorgeous hotel right across from St Stephen’s Green. There was shopping nearby and it is close to a lot of the tourist attractions. The staff were very solicitous, I was sick while I was there and they offered extra help. We were there when there was the fire, everyone was professional. The hotel was also scrupulously clean.”",5,2024,06,18
207,Guest only late night options,I really like the attention to providing resident only late night locations for guests only. This is very helpful for US visitors to manage the time change between Ireland and the United States. Plus there is the occasional celebrity sighting!,4,2024,06,17
207,My Shelbourne experience,"“Lovely visit, staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and quiet.
The hotel is unique in its history and decor. It was wonderful to stay in a the Shelbourne.” The hotel had an 18 meter lap pool and a gym with well maintained equipment. After a long day exploring Ireland, it was a treat to swim and work off the Guiness.",5,2024,06,17
207,"Good Hotel, Bad Service","The Shelbourne is a beautiful hotel and in a great location. The staff however, did not impress. After checking in, we entered someone else's room. We went downstairs to rectify the issue and they treated us like criminals instead of admitting they gave us the wrong set of keys. No ""sorry"" or ""we apologize for the inconvenience."" The front desk manager even pointed fingers saying this all happened because we checked in without showing our identification. They tracked down the first employee who confirmed we did in fact show our passports. After a long wait, we were given an empty room.

The service for the remainder of our stay unfortunately did not improve. Fire alarms went off in the middle of the night and security got frustrated when we went downstairs to ask if there is a fire (there was not). They misled us about the breakfast buffet pricing and we ended up spending more on a mini a la carte pancake than the buffet. 

If you are staying at The Shelbourne, save your money and eat at any of the lovely restaurants/cafes nearby. There are also many other nice hotels in the area.",3,2024,06,14
207,A must stay when in Dublin,"Comments:
“Amazing & attentive staff/servers, decor, fresh flowers, amazing smell in lobby. We had an issue with the room upon arrival and staff were efficient, professional & caring in their efforts to make us happy. Loved eating in Bar No. 27 - casual food elegantly served, quick and delicious.",5,2024,06,13
207,A very lovely visit even if we did have to evacuate for a short bit due to a small fire!,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights in a one bedroom suite on the 4th floor. The two room suite was quiet and luxurious. The manager Olya was very helpful getting us into the suite at 1pm instead of the usual check in time at 2pm or 3pm since we were exhausted from the overnight flight. She was extremely kind and went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. Of note we did have to evacuate for a ""small"" AC fire on the roof the morning of June 12th. The staff handled the emergency effortlessly. Later that day we received a note to have a free drink in their bar area. Overall, a true gem of a hotel that lives up to the wonderful reputation. Other friends have stayed here and had similar experiences. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,06,13
207,Must stay if coming from America.,"This hotel continues to be the best in Dublin.   It has a long and wonderful history that continues into ‘24.   The main level bar is spectacular as is the pub on the second floor.   The breakfast buffet has ample choices and one can also order off of the menu.   The checkin service is quick and smooth.   The bellmen working the front door are knowledgeable and helpful.  It is rated 5 stars for many good reasons.  
The location is excellent.   There are dozens of restaurants within a ten minute walk.  The hotel is directly across from St Steven’s Green which is a great park.  Around a 15 minute walk from the Temple Bar area.   5 minute walk from the Grafton Steet shopping area.  10 minutes from Trinity College.",5,2024,06,13
207,Worth it!,"Loved our stay, the on property dining and drinking options were top notch! The staff treated us like royalty and was ver accomodating in meeting our needs. The propery is also perfectly located for both business and entertainment options!",5,2024,06,11
207,"Great Hotel, Best Location, Excellent Service","You cannot find a hotel with better location in Dublin. Across the street from St. Stephen's Green, one block from Dawson Street with great resturants and 2 blocks from the famous Grafton Street. Walking distance to Trinity college and Temple Bar.
Rooms were very well appointed and beautiful, Fantastic Spa, steam room and pool. Friendly staff with excellent service. Great breakfast buffet, which also included ordering from the menu and a very elegant bar. We did not have the afternoon tea but it looked wonderful. We stayed there 3 nights beginning of June and loved it. It might be a bit more expensive than the other hotels, but I think it definitely is worth it especially if you are starting your journey thru Irelan. The hotel asked us what they can improve, and we couldn't come up with anything. Loved our stay.",5,2024,06,10
207,Best!,High Tea service! Wonderful! Location perfect and very historic charming setting. Part of the Marriott Bonvoy portfolio - my friend gluten free- they accommodated - nicely! We were treated like royalty- it’s a must! Little $$ but worth it!,5,2024,06,08
207,Look no further!!,This place was everything we heard and more. The customer service  couldn’t have been better. Food and bars were great. Not enough time to experience as much as I had hoped but now know you really should spend at least 4 nights to divide your time between touring and enjoying the amenities at this hotel. I will admit that I am a bit of a bathtub snob and the tub here was the best one I’ve ever used! Perfect size to lounge and beautiful bathroom. Highly recommend the Shelbourne!,5,2024,06,04
207,Lovely historic hotel,"Lovely historic hotel in great location.   We unfortunately only could stay one night before leaving for the States.  Beautiful art and historic photos thruout the hotel; very welcoming front entrance staff.  We had a delicious lunch at No. 27.  Our room, though small, was beautifully decorated with lovely updated bath.  Appreciated the US adaptors in the room, though we had brought along our own.  Wish we had spent a longer visit and would definitely stay again.",5,2024,06,04
207,Shelbourne doesn’t disappoint,The Shelbourne was an excellent place to stay in Dublin. Great amenities and centrally located. Service was excellent and accommodations were great. Food and wine choices were very nice. The spa and fitness center were super clean and comfortable.,5,2024,05,31
207,More style than substance,"Made a specific trip to Dublin to fulfill a birthday wish - to stay at the legendary Shelbourne Hotel.  Very good beginning with a friendly welcome and an opportunity to upgrade to a suite for a very reasonable additional fee. But that was the end of being made to feel welcome. We took up the offer but layers of dust and a stain the size of a bread and butter side plate was disappointing. Still off we went to explore, returning later in the day and stopping for a drink in the no. 27 bar. Magnificent room - great setting for a drink - more staff in various places both behind the bar and elsewhere in the room than you would normally see in a larger venue , but getting a drink was not easy. One of the many staff finally came over but seemed relatively disinterested and after he returned with our drinks that was the last attention we got until we had been finished (for quite some time). We were not how we wanted to pay - nor were we asked if we were hotel guests - rather we were asked if we wanted to pay by card or cash and when we responded that we wanted to put it to our room he pointed to the leather folder and said - there’s a pen in there and walked away. It made us feel very unwelcome and this lack of caring for a paying customer continued so later that evening that we were not going to pay for the upgrade a second night, nor would we subject ourselves to further opportunities to be made to feel like an inconvenience. The next morning I made a request to be moved to a room that was on our original booking - the first response was ‘but you’ve been upgraded’ - further request made with clear instructions that we would pack our bags, leave them in the room and could they move them in about an hour. The end result was by the time I got back to the room to find my husband sitting in front of a tv no longer working and being told by housekeeping that the room was listed as vacant when she was surprised to see me at the door. Explained to duty managed who while being very sympathetic , other than ensuring our bags would be moved securely while we were out, no attempt to make a clearly disappointed customer feel appreciated and welcome was forthcoming. Comfortable beds in a beautiful building is about the best we can offer as a positive review.",2,2024,05,30
207,Stand your ground. . .,"We started our Irish holiday with a stay here. The Sherbourne is one of those “grand dame” hotels, so we had high expectations.

The property is lovely and in a great location. We found the service generally good, especially the doormen and concierge. Food service was good, but the restaurant was consistently busy. We were unable to secure a reservation for high tea and generally had a brief wait (10-15 minutes) for a breakfast table.

Like many city properties, the hotel has an “older” and “newer” side. We used Marriott points to pay for our stay — and the cash value of those points was quite high. Still, we were shunted to an old, small room on a low floor. After some persistent requests we finally were offered a larger, more comfortable room in a newer part of the hotel. What a difference! My expectation is that if our reservation was later in high season, we would have been stuck.",4,2024,05,28
207,Perfect for couples and families.,"High attention to the details are evident throughout the hotel, from the hotel rooms to the changing rooms for the swimming pool, all the luxury amenities you would expect are catered for and beyond. Each member of staff I dealt with was attentive, courteous and highly accommodating, could not ask for more. All of our meals whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner was extremely fresh, tasty and obviously prepared with great care and diligence.  Would return in a heartbeat, 10/10, perfect",5,2024,05,27
207,The Shelbourne - Dublin,"The Shelbourne Hotel is a beautiful hotel, with a great location - easy walking distance to museums, shopping centers and to Trinity College.

The Shelbourne staffs were very courteous, welcoming, and professional.  Andrew and his team took great care of us and made us feel very much at home.

The breakfast buffet and dinner at the Saddle Room were excellent. The services were impeccable. In-room dinings were always on time and the foods were great. The whiskey tasting session in the hotel and the Afternoon Tea were delightful experiences for us.

The Hotel design was incredibly elegant - the ceilings, the hallway, the carpet, and the sofa in front of the elevator, with lovely cushions. The rooms were very spacious and beautifully decorated. House keeping was very well done. The air-conditioning was exceptionally quiet. The firmness of the mattress was perfect. We were able to have a good night's sleep every night.

We’ve had a marvelous time at The Shelbourne, Dublin. We’ve done lots of travels over the years. The Shelbourne stay has been by far our best hotel experience.  We would definitely return to the Shelbourne if we were to visit the area again in the future. Or, The Shelbourne could be our reason to revisit Dublin.",5,2024,05,27
207,Fabulous,"Food, service and facilities all excellent. ALL the staff were so polite and helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed . Room was of the highest standard, clean comfortable and had everything we needed. You certainly get what you pay for at the shelbourne",5,2024,05,25

207,Wonderful Hotel with a Great Location,"This is a classic Old World place (modernized of course) with an unbelievable location in the heart of Dublin. The breakfasts were outstanding and the service and food at our group dinner were top notch. Our room was comfortable with a very nice bathroom (great shower). The only thing needing improvement was the in room coffee service - you heated water and used instant coffee (other hotels often have espresso makers).
The concierge desk could not have been more helpful with directions and recommendations. We greatly enjoyed our stay.",5,2024,05,24
207,Loved this hotel,"The hotel is beautiful, spotlessly clean. The staff are very friendly and helpful. What a treat to have a nice big bathroom and super comfortable beds. Also special mention to the hairdresser that I was lucky to arrange last minute and who did a great job.",5,2024,05,22

207,Great Dublin Hotel with a Perfect Location,"Hi just returned from a trip to Dublin. Stayed at the Shelbourne and had an awesome time. The service was impeccable and always focused on providing a great experience. We thought the breakfast was great, always hot and fresh. Visited several of the bars in the hotel during our stay and service was consistently great. As a Mariott Bonvoy member, I was acknowledged as a Gold member and treated to the amenities that come with that level. Often the acknowledgement doesn't happen. The room was large and comfortable. Location by the park was also great. Somehow, we had 3 days of sun and warm weather and the location of the hotel by the park came in handy. The ultimate test is, when I go back to Dublin, would i stay at the Shelbourne. The answer is a resounding yes.",5,2024,05,16
207,Dublin,Excellent visit!  Great accommodations and location.  Easy to walk all over Dublin from the location!  Nice size room with a sitting area and comfortable bed.

207,A fantastic 4 days,"We stayed 4 fantastic days in March to celebrate our 25th wedding Anniversary. From the moment we arrived to our departure we had a glorious stay. A nice touch from the concierge was to order a lovely bottle of sparking wine to be delivered to us.
Our room was first class, the shower one of the best we have ever used.
Breakfast was an absolute joy each morning, the attention to detail second to none, every  dietary requirement catered for.
We booked he Saddle Room for our anniversary meal, all I can say it is a must book, you will not be disappointed.
The Afternoon tea in the Lord Mayor’s Lounge should not be missed, but you must book as its always busy.
A pre meal drink in the famous Horseshoe Bar is a must.
The service we received from each part of the hotel team was great.we will certainly be back soon.",5,2024,05,06

207,Best Hotel in Europe!! Amazing history and location,"The Shelbourne exceeded my expectations on my last visit. I have been lucky enough to stay 5 times in the last few years and will be back in June 24.  From arrival to leaving you are treated like one of the family. All the staff on arrival cannot do enough to welcome you. Every time I visit it just gets better and better. The floral displays are magical, the food is exceptional and the rooms all have an amazing layout with each one being different due to the history of the building. I have recently read a book about the history of The Sherborne and it was amazing to read all about the evolution of the hotel and where it began.  Can’t wait to be back next month.",5,2024,05,03
207,5* all the way,"We had the most amazing stay at the Shelbourne. We got an early checkin which was great, allowed us time to have a quick browse down Grafton St before our lunch.

207,Historic hotel in great location,The Shelbourne is in a fantastic location directly across the street from St. Stephen’s Green. There are multiple food and bar options and the front desk staff and concierges are very helpful. I recommend not booking the small queen room but the double bed room. It appears the queen small may be in an older part of the hotel and the bathroom is very small. The vanity top is very low and hit the middle of my thigh. If you’re tall you will be bending over a lot.  Hotel has several elevators and you never have to wait long.  While this is definitely a nice property I wouldn’t say it’s as high end as it sees itself,4,2024,04,29
207,The Shelbourne is the best!!,The location of the hotel is perfect!  Across from St Stephen's Green and close walk to Grafton Street.  It is a beautiful hotel.  The flower displays are gorgeous and seem to change daily.  The service is impeccable.  I had breakfast every morning in the hotel. The buffet was excellent. The workout facilities and locker rooms are beautiful and complete.  The indoor lap pool is lovely and heated. People couldn't have been nicer.,5,2024,04,29
207,10/10 Hotel,"My husband and I travel frequently and choosing our hotel is one of the top priorities once we select a location. The Shelbourne was an absolute 10/10. The room was very large, service impeccable, amenities in the room including turn down, chocolates, water and many towels. The bathroom was spacious and included a large tub and large shower. After running around site seeing it was a joy to come back to a very luxurious and comfortable room. The concierge gave great recommendations. The hotel is across the street from a beautiful park and a stop for the hop on/ hop off bus which made it perfect for us. The breakfast which was included in the American Express booking was delicious.",5,2024,04,29
207,A great base for exploring Dublin,"The Shelbourne is rightly regarded as a landmark hotel in Dublin. The overall  experience did not disappoint. Staff were unfailingly cheerful and always ready to help.  The great service started before we actually got inside. We arrived in a hire car and needed directions to drop off the vehicle. A Doorman was on hand to provide perfect guidance. The hotel enjoys an excellent location close to St Stephen's Green, the National Gallery of Ireland, Trinity College and the Grafton Street shopping area.

The hotel is large and navigation was initially challenging. Any frustration at heading down the wrong corridor was soon soon dispelled by there always being interesting artwork on the walls. The decorative standard of our room and en suite was most impressive. Our bed was large and comfortable. The air condition was effective and unobtrusive. 

We ate in the No 27 Bar on two occasions. Both meals were first-rate. Breakfast was included in our stay. The Saddle Room offered both quiet corners and a more open environment  for dining. The buffet was satisfactory. We tried the a la carte option on our last morning, which was extremely good.

A most pleasing stay!",4,2024,04,25
207,Bucket List Hotel,"This hotel is top notch on every level.  From the greeting at door, check in and lobby fresh flowers, you feel like you are in a hotel like no other.  Appointed rooms, phenomenal bars and overlooking St Stephen’s Green round out a one of a kind experience.   Will be back again and again…",5,2024,04,21
207,Definitely not a 5 star experience,"This is a 3/4 star hotel masquerading as a 5 star hotel due to its location and past reputation.  Lots of warm face time in the lobby makes you feel welcome when you arrive (great!) but after a 5 day stay, I experienced:  1) shoddy breakfast experience two days in a row (impossible to get the attention of wait staff, delays in meals (30 minutes for an overcooked poached egg) and basically had to beg staff for coffee and attention since we weren’t eating at the breakfast buffet; 2) TV in room barely functional, minimal channels with one streaming device in the entire hotel to use for Netflix, etc. that was being used by another guest; 3)  bell caption suggested walking in lieu of getting a taxi when I had someone with mobility issues; 4) no electrical outlet in the bathroom.  Huh?  I don’t mind paying for “5 star service” but this was sadly overpriced and underwhelming.  The Shelbourne is a lovely property in a beautiful location, made into a homogenized experience by cramming in lots of outside people and parties with  hotel guests which doesn’t result in a “memorable “ experience.  Disappointed.  I’ve never bothered to write such a review but thought it useful to others looking at this property.",2,2024,04,20
207,Dublin's best,"The Shelbourne is one of the few hotels in the world where the guests really feel welcomed. The Adlon in Berlin is another.
Everything about The Shelbourne is about comfort and convenience for the guest.
Couple this ambiance with a great location and excellent restaurants and bars, and you know why this hotel is special. ",5,2024,04,15
207,A well deserved reputation for being one of the best hotels in Diblin.,"We had three K rooms.  The hotel is 200 years old and that is both the charm and can be the cause of some inconveniences.  For examples, the bathrooms wouldn’t be quite up to the same standards as an equivalent modern building but the old world charm made up for it.  The bed and in particular the pillows were phenomenal… never slept on better hotel pillows.  The breakfast buffet was varied and delish.  Staff were excellent.  Loved the bar downstairs (horseshoe?).  Location was great. Felt like a bit of a sanctuary in a very crowded center city Dublin!",4,2024,04,13
207,The Shelbourne Hotel,"Didn’t stay here just had lunch. I had a club sandwich which was lovely and tea. The staff are nice, the place is clean tidy with lots of available seating and space. The service was quick. There’s a cosy, relaxed vibe about The Shelbourne. It’s quite pricey.",5,2024,04,07
207,Utterly underwhelming and overrated hotel.,"Not a 5 star experience by any stretch of the imagination. I genuinely don’t think The Shelbourne should have 5 stars after our visit. Guests are made to pay a deposit upon checking in for extras that they may or may not using, never had this before in a 5 star hotel. Small, badly laid out rooms with poor toiletries. Terrible service from bar staff who told me they had done last orders at 10.45 pm! The bar is listed on the website and outside of its door as open until 12.30 am. The one drink I had earlier would have tasted better out of a can.nBreakfast is a buffet style with many items missing or running out with them not being replaced. I’ve had better in pretty much every hotel whether it’s 5 star or not that I’ve stayed in however most aren’t buffets that you have to serve yourself. The piece de resistance was the curdling milk and cream on a hot radiator where we had to make ourselves a cup of tea in a paper cup because they couldn’t seat us for breakfast. Over hyped and over priced for what they are offering their guests. Very very disappointing and I will be telling everyone about our stay. We will not be back.",1,2024,04,01
207,A nice stay with a few issues,"We stayed here with another couple for four nights. The hotel is a historic building, beautiful both inside and out. It is across from a beautiful park, St Steven’s Square. Shopping, eating and sights are all close by. Staff were friendly for the most part. 
Our room was nice and clean. The beds were comfortable, although a little firm. The bathroom was spacious with a nice shower and bathtub. 
We had issues with our plumbing. Every time someone upstairs or we would flush the toilet or run the sink, there was a loud noise that sounded like dogs barking coming out of the shower drain. This happened so many times I lost count. As long as we shut the door to the bathroom it wasn’t too bad. Also the floors and ceilings are thin. We could hear everything the people above us were doing. Luckily I had ear plugs. We are going to ask to change rooms, but we didn’t feel like packing up and moving elsewhere. 
Breakfast was included and was decent. The downstairs bar had ok food and drinks, although very pricey. 
We would probably stay here again. We had a great time in Dublin with our friends. Highly recommend the distilleries in the Liberties over Guinness.",4,2024,03,26
207,A lovely stay,"A lovely hotel. We stayed three nights at The Shelbourne and really liked it. Conveniently located for exploring Dublin, walking distance to a lot of shops and restaurants. The hotel itself immaculately kept, our room had a good size, large bathroom and all we could wish for. We ate twice at the hotel and were rather pleased both times. Can highly recommend the pool and gym too. 
No hickups? Just a few: At arrival we stood for quite some time at the reception desk, nobody there. After a while a young women appeared and asked rather harshly, whether we wanted something? Yes, indeed. Ms. B. might not have had the best of days.  Or that my husband was told by a staff member of the spa that they had Yoga classes and would we like to attend? Yes, we would. Dressed for the class we were waiting in the room for quite some time. The teacher did not show up and the hubby went to the desk again. Oh, she would come in a few minutes. Did not show up. And in the end we were told that the staff member had just forgotten that she would not come at all. No real harm done but there is room for improvement. The breakfast was a bit lacklustre. All very nicely presented but the bagel was not a real chewy bagel for instance and the bread on the dry side. And maybe the hotel should invest in a new toaster.  Went out for breakfast therefore afterwards and found some nice spots. But all this said, we would come back!",4,2024,03,21
207,Business meetings in Dublin,"Spent 2 nights here on a business trip. Outstanding stay, beautiful building and reception/ bar/ restaurant areas. Breakfast excellent. Room was small but very comfortable and super comfy bed. 

Staff all very helpful and friendly especially at breakfast which make a nice change.

Highly recommended!",5,2024,03,13
207,The best in Dublin,"Pre Christmas treat in Dublin at one of our favourite hotels. The staff are so friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere is great. We were there for the turning on of the Christmas tree lights which was very special. Our room was beautiful with classic furniture and a high standard of quality and comfort. 
Breakfast was fabulous.",5,2024,03,07
207,The most wonderful hotel!,"WOW! What a hotel! The whole experience was faultless from beginning to end thanks to the wonderful team! I’d like to mention a few names of who stood out to us. Paul Burke really looked after us, along with Ashley, Bryan, Greg, Pawel, Nimet, Lorenzo, Oisin, Jessie and Patricia and Sudaporn in the Spa. We had the best time and can’t wait to go back soon! Thank you again Xx",5,2024,02,26
207,Lovely Experience,"This is an email to compliment staff member Orla in relation to a tour she gave myself and my family last Saturday.
We had lunch in the Saddle room at 2pm which was beautiful for my Aunts 70th birthday celebration.
After our lunch Orla brought us on a tour of the hotel , which in included the Princess Grace suite and the Constitution room.
Her knowledge of the history of hotel was impressive and myself and my family really enjoyed the tour.

Orla is an asset to the hotel and we all would like to thank her for her time on what was a very busy day in the Shelbourne Hotel.
It really did top off a lovely day spent in the Shelbourne and we will be definitely back , maybe to try the Spa that Orla also showed us.

Thank you

207,Extremely comfortable,"Traditional hotel in wonderful Georgian building overlooking St Stephen’s Green. If one can judge a hotel by a top quality bed, bedding and overall comfort, then this hotel is top draw. The main downstairs bar looked fun but was very busy, so we opted for the quieter whiskey bar, which was great. Strangely the service at breakfast was very slow and below par, we saw a few customers complaining.",5,2024,02,21
207,Whiskey tasting,"Had a fantastic Irish whiskey tasting in the Horseshoe Bar yesterday.  We sampled 4 whiskeys, one from each province and I cannot recommend the whole experience highly enough.  It is also amazing value considering it includes a glass of Midleton Very Rare!  Our host was Mike and he really made the experience so enjoyable for us.  An utterly professional man who imparted his great knowledge of whiskey on us, but did so in such a relaxed and convivial style.  He is a great asset to the Shelbourne, thank you again Mike!",5,2024,02,21
207,Magnificent,What beautiful hotel. Bed was extremely comfortable. Nice spacious bathroom. The staff are the friendliest nicest people ever. First time in Dublin and highly recommend this hotel.  The location is very ery central. Close to all the sights and shopping.,5,2024,02,17
207,A.M.A.Z.I.NG,A.M.A.Z.I.N.G...expect to be treated like a celeb...Gold star service...plush rooms..comfy beds...expensive...but we'll worth every penny...5 mins from main shopping area ..food Delicious..well worth a once in a while treat ..my fav hotel in Dublin.,5,2024,02,17
207,Faultless stay,Everything about our stay was perfect. From the comfy beds with beautiful linens to the Shelbourne umbrellas left in the wardrobe for us to borrow during our stay. The room was spotlessly clean and the staff are wonderful. Even on a busy rugby weekend the staff take the time to chat and make you feel so welcome. I don’t know how they do it but the hotel is in the middle of a bustling city and yet there is no noise in the rooms either from outside or inside the hotel so you get a wonderful nights sleep. We have stayed at the Shelbourne several times now and each time the hotel makes you feel as though you have come home. Fantastic job to all the team. We hope to see you again very soon.,5,2024,02,14
207,Adored our stay!,"I absolutely adored The Shelbourne. It's like walking into a piece of history. I stayed here for a week while hosting a conference several years ago, and the service provided was top-notch. Our conference attendant began remembering how we took our coffees or fresh juice in the morning while we worked and it was perfection. The food was excellent and I couldn't recommend this experience more. Well done, Team Shelbourne!",5,2024,02,12
207,Awful Service!!!!,"Awful service had my work party here in December from which the cloak room staff decided to hand my expensive coat out to someone else who didn’t have the appropriate ticket to do so, I was never compensated for this they never actually bothered to contact me again would never stay here awful customer experience",1,2024,02,10
207,My favorite hotel to travel to in Ireland!,"As always, a five star hotel delivering a five star experience to myself. Any time I return to this hotel its an escape from reality and you get to experience luxury in the heart of Dublin. Always love coming back to the Shelbourne as you can never fault any of their staff, always being so accommodating and friendly. This time I spent the majority of my time in the hotel and their bar. Normally I would go out for drinks but changed it up this time. I had a Main and dessert in the bar as well as my favorite bottle of red wine that I buy when celebrating a special occasion from their No.27 bar.

I want to say a massive thank you to Alex and Keiffer for making my celebration a little extra special and being so charismatic and easy to talk to. As well as the beautiful signature suite I got to avail of with my NUA with Marriott.

I also thing the Accommodation team need a huge round of applause as they always have the bedrooms perfectly presented and clean anytime I come to you for a weekend city break.

I will definitely be coming back to you in a few weeks :)",5,2024,02,07
207,While we stayed at the Shelbourne in the past on this occasion we enjoyed the bars,"While we'd stayed at the Shelbourne in the past on this trip the bars were our primary interest. We'd met a couple from Ireland at Grover Alley and while seated next to each other they mentioned that they were on the way to the Shelbourne for a cocktail and we should join them...and we did. The main bar is at the front of the hotel lobby and is always lively with locals and tourists. Service and cocktails were perfect. Toward the back off the lobby is a whiskey bar which is more intimate. While I enjoyed the visit ir was a bit cramped for me, I would elect the main bar. Upstairs there is yet another bar which we didn't visit but perhaps on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2024,02,03
207,Wonderful stay.,"We had a wonderful stay and the service was amazing, Location was fantastic and near everything. We also got amazing advice on what we should see and how we could get to these places. We also had dinner in the hotel and the food was fantastic. Would recommend.",5,2024,01,28
207,My current visit to the Shelbourne,"This is an ongoing review of the  Shelbourne.  I stayed at the  Shelbourne for 8 nights this past November and am here again for 6 nights this January 

Check-in.  As a Bonvoy Platinum status member I expected a different check in.  When I arrived a gentleman behind the front desk did not check me in—instead he called over a new person or trainee to check me in while he looked over her shoulder.  Clearly an awkward situation as she tried her best and did a good job but it was uncomfortable as she was nervous.  Having stayed at Marriotts over 50 times in 2023 I was expecting a nice warm welcome but despite my advising that I was quite familiar with hotel from my last stay, had to hear everything about the hotel over again —as a trainee I cannot blame her for doing what she was told

Room:  I used points as à platinum member for my stay.  Despite a request ahead of time for an upgraded room as part of the Bonvoy benefits, I was assigned a small room in a hallway only a child can fit comfortably.  The room is tiny and à similar room can be found in any airport hotel—-not sure why an upgrade was not available given staff told be that the hotel is very very slow this time of the year.  I will do my best not to spend a lot of time in this depressing room 

No 27  Bar.  Very nice bar and superb staff.  Again, superb staff!!!  I have been to this bar when it’s standing  room only, but this time of year only about 15% seats were occupied.  Kudos for fabulous service at the bar!!!

Despite trainee at check-in telling me about the 1824 bar, I learned today it’s closed until March.

Therefore I stopped by the Horseshoe Bar.  I ran into great bartender from my last stay (he was in 1824 bar then).  Had great cocktail but was disappointed that last call was approximately 9:00pm

More info to follow",3,2024,01,22
207,Continues to be a first rate hotel,"This hotel is classic and classy. It is old and stately, but continues to wow us. The lobby and downstairs are beautiful and done in a peaceful green, in keeping with the Irish location. The rooms are old and stately. The hallways are quiet when away from the elevators and the beds and linens are first class. There’s a room for every taste and we’ve been here a number of times. The staff are well trained and very helpful and make excellent attempts to meet the visitors’ needs, so be sure to ask. The location is central and upscale. We hope to return again next year.",5,2024,01,18
207,Spectacular Dublin hotel in prime location,"Spectacular hotel in a prime location, directly across the street from St Stephen’s Green, adjacent to Irish government buildings, 5 minute walk to Trinity, 10 minutes to Grafton Street shopping and 15 minutes to Temple Bar. There are numerous ways to eat and drink inside the hotel, and as well, there are great pubs and restaurants nearby on Merrion Street. Easy access to Dublin’s bus system and Pearse Station for trains. Our room was on the fourth floor, overlooking the park- very quiet and the accommodations were perfect for a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 college aged daughters). It’s expensive but in my view it’s worth it. Top notch in  every way. Highly recommend.",5,2024,01,12
207,Hotel in Dublin,"Right across from Saint Stephen’s Green and easy walking distance to majority of sites. When you’re staying there it feels a bit like you’re one of the family in “Home Alone” staying in the fancy NYC hotel at Christmas. This is a five-star hotel, expensive and fancy – packed with visiting Irish-American families. Rooms are perfectly fine, well maintained and have best in class bedding, etc. Hotel kindly gave us adjoining rooms with our now grown-up children which we appreciated (even if they didn’t). Our package included the DELUX breakfast that is served every morning. No need to eat for several meals after that – but reliably delicious. The hotel has three nice bars – two of which serve Guinness. The upstairs bar (which does not) is the nicest of the three to sit in. The hotel gym is serviceable. If money isn’t a primary concern this is an excellent choice, with very good service and a great location.",5,2024,01,10
207,Simply the right place to be,"I highly recommend The Shelbourne Autograph Collection!
It’s a grand hotel worthy of its name! You will have all the modernism with a most successful decoration! Very well located in the downtown of beautiful Dublin!

The extremely friendly, smiling and very professional staffs. I would like to hereby thank all the staffs in the B& F department, like, Ana-Marie, Ana, Silvano, Khshat, just to mention but a few. 

I would also like to thank the front desk staffs, especially, Hugh, Beatriz and few others that I can not remember their names,  from our arrival until departure for their smiles and professionalism. 

Thank you to Greg, Pat and the ever gorgeous Orla McAullife, who welcomed us with a big smile!  Without forgetting Val Cameron, a man with great professionalism and kindness.",5,2024,01,10
207,Wonderful hotel that lives up to its reputation.,"This hotel didn’t fail to impress. Beautiful and impressive hotel with superb staff, a great atmosphere and delicious food. 

The hotel is very central which is so handy when travelling with family.  We were able to visit the museums and exhibitions within a short walk. 

It can be difficult travelling with a larger family however we were catered for with ease at the Shelbourne. The rooms are spacious and super comfortable.",5,2024,01,05
207,Very disappointing,This was a disappointing experience. We held a joint celebration here (40th and 80th) we booked 3 rooms and an evening meal in the saddle room. They were supposed to put chocolates in the rooms where the main guests were staying but forgot. We then went to the saddle room where they messed up the reservation and we had to ‘squeeze’ another chair in which was really uncomfortable. Then the waitress brought the birthday cake and prompted the guy whose birthday it was to sing happy birthday. Despite being told whose birthday it was they couldn’t even get that right. The icing on the cake was when they had no room to host us for a quiet drink after and ended up sending us into the main bar where the music was loud and we had an 8 year old with us. It ended the evening early. Overall a poor showing from a very popular and expensive hotel. Hope this review helps someone.,2,2024,01,04
207,Wonderful!,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff and an amazing  afternoon tea all. It held tradition but didn’t scrape on the amenities.  It was centrally located and you could walk anymore you needed in Dublin. We had a wonderful suite with a living room and separate bedroom. Just wonderful!",5,2024,01,02
207,Good for atmosphere but not for 5 star service,"Check-in is the most important touchpoint of a hotel, whether you’ve stayed before or not. In our case, no welcome to the hotel, no information on facilities, no offer to make reservations and, most basic of all, no breakfast information. It could have been forgiven if the desk was busy/a queue but it was quiet and plenty of staff on hand at the desk. Credit to the doormen who, in all weather, greet guests with a smile - would love if this was extended to the interior. 

The most questionable 5 star service point was housekeeping - surprisingly scant. We actually found a stray sock behind the curtain in our room one morning. Hopefully the original owner didn’t report it to lost and found as it went straight in the bin. Worst of all however was the way housekeeping threw aside items while refreshing the room. In particular, shoes and boots that I had lined up at the foot of the bed were literally thrown in a pile across our room which concerned me when I saw it. I would prefer more care given to our belongings and was surprised that this would even come up as a discussion point at a 5 star hotel. I also found a used shower cap tucked into my toiletry bag on the sink one day. Unlike the unwelcome sock, I had indeed used this shower cap, however, it was placed in my bag wet and I had to dry the contents that it came into contact with. I’m all for sustainability but this was not appropriate. 

No doubt that the Shelbourne is a Dublin institution and a great buzz in the hotel but it seems that the hotel relies on that reputation alone. Doesn’t compare to the other 5 stars in Dublin. ",3,2023,12,22
207,Shelbourne is magnificent,"The Shelbourne is a magnificent, old world hotel with beautiful, comfortable accommodations. There is a sumptuous breakfast buffet daily. Highly recommend afternoon tea at the Lord Mayor’s Lounge and whiskey in the cozy Horseshoe Bar!",5,2023,12,17

207,Don’t go in December,"Too crowded in the hotel during the holidays—could not get a table for 1 for lunch, even though I was staying there, because all of the tourists in from other Irish towns.

Afternoon tea is worth the price. Location is close to the top of Grafton Street for all the great shops and atmosphere. Highly recommend if you want luxury in a leafy area close to the centre.,5,2023,11,18
207,Great hotel and location,"Spent 4 nights at this hotel in a business trip. Great location, nice rooms, good restaurants. The highlight is the Saddle restaurant with its good variety of breakfast and friendly staff. The lowlight and only reason for not getting the 5 stars is the reception guy who did my check in and check out was not welcoming or friendly and was dealing in a slightly careless way showing no sign of attention to my two simple requests and not even sending my invoice to me by email, not a service that should be offered to a platinum member guest . Overall it is a good hotel.",4,2023,11,14
207,We LOVE the Shelbourne,"We stayed there with our kids, the hotel is amazing and right on the park. They hooked us up with an amazing tour guide.

Can’t recommend it enough",5,2023,11,12
207,High level service but lacks the personal touch,"Stayed one night whilst attending a concert in Dublin. I have never stayed here before as have a preferred hotel in Dublin, but I needed to book at the last minute and was challenged for availability. Check in was fast- please note that it is not as seamless as the Merrion or the Marker to get valet parking to facilitate getting an electric car charged. There was a short on-street discussion between several of the doormen and myself upon arrival and a solution was eventually found.  Given the high level of service that the hotel offers and the increasing popularity of e-cars, this should be something that a hotel like the Shelbourne works on finding a permanent and easy solution for. All areas of the hotel- bars and leisure facilities lacked the warm and friendly staff attitude that would truly elevate the guest experience. Our room was fine, but needed some attention to housekeeping- the wine glasses in the mini bar were dusty and one had a dead insect at the bottom. On check out an incorrect charge had been put on my account that was removed but this always leaves a bad impression as it relies purely upon guest vigilance. My stay left me now certain that there are better options for a five star hotel experience in Dublin.",4,2023,11,10

207,"A beautiful lobby, a horrible room","After reading the poor reviews on TripAdvisor and seeing the canned responses from management. I thought I would review while I am still staying here.  
I checked in Nov 2 and departing on Nov 7
I booked my Heritage King Room through my membership with AMEX.  
Along with this membership you are entitled to a few perks when available. One being a room upgrade, which we were told we couldn’t get because we already booked a premium room.  
 When our room was ready we walked into a room that smells like a mixture of mothballs and Lysol.
Apparently that combination is not strong enough to remove the stains on the carpet… 
We immediately called the reception where I received multiple apologies but no action. Another smelly room was our alternative.  We even tried to get another room at a hotel close by, but they had nothing available.  
I am writing this review at 1:30 in the morning because the smell is so bad I can not sleep. 
I have spent my first day EVER in Dublin looking for lodging.  This is not what I would expect out of a 5 * hotel. 
We shall see what tomorrow holds…stay tuned…",1,2023,11,02
207,Shocking ,"We booked to have a birthday lunch at the hotel today. Very disappointed with the service and the lack of attention to detail. No one greeted us as we waited to be seated, had to seek out staff member who had to get someone else. We asked for still water which was plonked on the table with two glasses, no ice, no pouring!! Our main courses arrived without starter plates removed, we then had to physically get up to look for cutlery!  On a trip to the restroom I was greeted with a bin overflowing with tissues. Finally after dessert ,no one to say thank you etc. We decided to have our coffee in the Merrion now that is 5 star from the minute we arrived. Your staff need serious training. Shocking 😲 ",2,2023,11,01

207,Night away in our home city,Fabulous stay in heritage room overlooking st stephens green in this most amazing hotel. Dinner in the saddle room was fantastic both food service and ambiance. Don’t miss as our favorite hotel in dublin ,5,2023,10,30
207,The most wonderful hotel,"I stayed here with my husband for his birthday last weekend.

I can not speak highly enough of the hotel and its staff.

There was a little confusion at check in whereby the system hadn’t registered that I had changed the larger room online but it didn’t matter as they made sure that we were in the most beautiful heritage room. 

The staff went above and beyond to ensure that we had the most wonderful stay. Nothing was ever too much trouble.

We ate in the Saddle Room for a birthday dinner and we had the best meal and we were really well looked after by Caroline, who again, couldn’t do enough for us. Because I don’t drink wine, Caroline, ensured that I was kept topped up with a lovely ‘pear pressure’ cocktail. This goes on my favourite cocktail list for sure! 
They even brought out a lovely ‘happy birthday’ plate with some petits fours at the end of our meal. 

We had breakfast for two days in the Saddle Room too and it was the nicest breakfast either of us have ever had. I didn’t catch the young many’s name who served us (blond hair/glasses) but he was superb and again went above and beyond to look after us. 

Before leaving for the airport, we had lunch in No.27. We had the rib pie and truffle mash followed by red velvet cake and creme brûlée. Another super meal. 

We fell in love with The Shelbourne and already can not wait to come back.

Thank you so much for the most wonderful stay.",5,2023,10,28
207,Lovely Stay ♥️,"My favourite place to stay while visiting Dublin.

We lived in Dublin for 7 years, now we are based in Manchester, we visite here quite often and we make sure to stay at The Shelbourne. It's like home alway from home.

Beautiful place, great rooms, all the staff are just lovely and make sure to look after you so well.  As you step in is like a beautiful travel in time, the chandelier, the flowers and the great stairs make such a wonderful combination.

Breakfast got everything that you ever wanted, all the chefs are just there to help you.

The seafood chowder is just perfection, quite rich in flavour and very taste. The oister were so good too. I had the most delicious Virgin Mary, really taste!! 

A big thank you to Hugh at the front desk and Adam at the Bar. Everyone is so lovely and kind and friendly.

Thank you so much guys for such a lovely stay and to make sure that myself and my husband had a good time.

Warm hugs from Philip Winstanley & Etienne Junior.",5,2023,10,27
207,Lovely stay ,"The shelbourne hotel 

Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff and great location. 
But bar was very busy. Met Pushkar he helped me alot. He is incredible at what he does. Amazed by his service skills. 
I’m definitely coming back again. Had a lovely stay.

207,"Excellent hotel, prime location","Great hotel. Highlights with more details below
-  Service — excellent
-  Bars — excellent 3 to choose from
-  Gym — ehhhhhh
-  Breakfast — Great** (for free otherwise expensive)
-  Location — excellent

All of the staff and service was great. Professional, quick, and helpful in all aspects. Good housekeeping and there is a turn down service at night if that is something you appreciate. 

Hotel has a good breakfast as a Plat I got it included and could eat buffet or a la carte. Otherwise it is like €34 per person — I would not pay $34 for it unless I was in a pinch, but as an included breakfast it was great.  Very busy by late mornings on weekends

Hotel has 3 other bars to chose from. 

Location — it is great and central can walk to a variety of places. 

Gym — not the best. This is only downside of the hotel. I understand it’s an older building and you aren’t going to have the best gym. It is open to Dublin citizens to join as a club and has a pool for laps/exercise. Otherwise the weights are in a very small area, 1 smith machine, then there is a chest, shoulder, back, and leg machine it what feels like a hallway.

Temple bar area fyi — so many other good bars/pubs to chose from. I get it you want to go. Go for 1-2 drinks an GTFO. Temple bar will be $20-24 for 2 drinks other bars in Dublin will be like $14 for 2. 

Taxis — download the Freenow app to order taxis. It is the same cost as Uber and way faster.",5,2023,10,23
207,Excellent choice for Dublin,"Excellent location, comfortable rooms with all the amenities you would expect- bedding was good, toiletries high end, and afternoon teas was superb- the pastry chef is excellent and we have had tea on multiple continents and this is as good as any- And Lauren our server was exceptional",5,2023,10,23
207,Noisy and not enjoyable,"Although the communal areas of the hotel are undoubtedly beautifully appointed and the staff are excellent- extremely polite and welcoming and do their best to help you- the rooms are not worth the high cost and are extremely noisy. We have stayed for 2 nights so far and I’ve been unable to sleep due to a continuous and relentless hum from some kind of machinery of ventilation system which is clearly audible even with the window closed and earplugs in. The room is then quite hot and the a/c unit is extremely loud, so it’s impossible to have a quiet and comfortable night’s sleep. I complained to the hotel and although they offered me an upgrade, the alternative room was smaller, with a smaller bed and not even a chest of drawers to unpack your clothes! I’m not sure how they can justify the price without even providing somewhere to unpack! Also the bathroom fan did not shut off and so that was noisier than the first room. The staff apparently went into every available room that night to try to move us but reported back that all available rooms were noisier than our first. So, whilst I can’t fault them for effort, I must conclude their rooms are noisy throughout. My advice would be visit the beautiful bars and the spa but stay elsewhere; I’ve been in many 4 star hotels with rooms just as nice but far more peaceful and easier to sleep! So visit, enjoy the opulence, but don’t stay!",2,2023,10,23
207,5 Star Hotel Makes You Feel Like a Rock Star!,"This hotel was 5 star in every way!  The service was exceptional from checkin to checkout and the restaurant/bar staff made you feel like a rock star every day.

Our room was large and had so much space for our 5 day stay to make us feel comfortable.

I highly recommend this hotel for a Dublin stay.",5,2023,10,22
207,Lovely historic hotel.,Lovely stay at historic hotel. We had a nicely renovated room on 6th floor overlooking park. Spacious and luxurious. Impression was that other rooms weren’t so nice—definitely with a few extra euros. Breakfast was excellent. Didn’t eat a main restaurant but food at bar was great. Service at bar was very slow but manager addressed this.,5,2023,10,19
207,Beautiful hotel. Wonderful staff. Great location!,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for one night while on a business trip. This was a beautiful hotel and a top of the class hotel, located across the street from the St. Stephen's Green and walking distance to the local pubs, shopping mall and restaurants.",5,2023,10,18
207,The Shelbourne Hotel,Great location in Dublin. Excellent service. Really comfy rooms which are well appointed. I used the swimming pool and the sauna quite a few times. I found the whole experience to be very pleasant and enjoyable. I look forward to my return.,5,2023,10,15

207,Don't waist your money. It doesn't deserve it....,"Very very expensive... 650 eur for one night without breakfast. Not customer oriented.... not a pleasant stay with the expectations awaited. 
The positive: the bed was confortable.

Super cher. Plus de 650 euros sans petit déj. Aucun retour servie clientèle, pas de plaisir.
LE point positif le lit était confortable.",1,2023,10,14
207,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for four nights before departing on a cruise. The hotel is spectacular, with a wonderful location on Saint Stephen’s Green. The city is very walkable, and easy to get around. The staff was lovely and as a platinum elite. I was able to upgrade to a suite, using my suite night awards. The room was wonderful, very spacious and comfortable. Beautiful views of the green, with a large marble bath. There are several restaurants and bars on site, and breakfast is served as a Buffay or à la carte. Highly recommend for your next stay in Dublin.",5,2023,10,06
207,Great Look but skin deep,"The moment you walk in the hotel hits you with a visually impressive but a bit overwrought lobby area. All marble and iron. Two decent bars and a restaurant.  As a person more used to austere hotels like The Conrad, it left me cold.  It might have worked better if the service and rooms measured up to the lobby, but they don’t.  To be sure, there’s tons of people around, but they don’t seem to do much or care passionately about customers.  Ask for something out of the ordinary — like a smoothie on the in-room menu but not the restaurant — and you get a flat “no”.  The rooms are nice, but the old floors creak and you can hear footsteps from above like they were in your room.  Bed is fine and shower fine, but nothing special.  My room slanted — again age showing — leaving the floor uneven.  Charming but I almost tripped on the floor between the bathroom and bedroom.  It does have a great gym — three people were working there but didn’t interact at all with anyone — so bring workout clothes.  Didn’t use pool but it’s impressive.  The hotel is in the middle of everything and has a reputation for being fancy, but that applies more to the lobby scene than anything else.",4,2023,10,04
207,Enjoyable Stay,"My stay at The Shelbourne Hotel was undeniably fancy, and while it may be a bit on the pricey side, the experience was well worth it. The luxurious atmosphere and excellent service made my visit memorable. I'd definitely consider coming back.",5,2023,10,03
207,"Excellent stay, extraordinary staff!","The hotel is lovely, although some of the rooms are a bit dated. We are writing this review to express our gratitude for the ***extraordinary service*** provided my Ms. JULIA POPESCU at the front desk, Ms. ANA at the Saddle Room restaurant, and another employee who was working at the champagne bar. We are indebted to all three for making our stay memorable. Ms. JULIA POPESCU kindly helped my parents at check in, when her language skills came in handy. Most sincere thanks to all!",5,2023,10,01
207,Don’t stay on the top floor if you want a quiet room.,"I requested a quiet room- they put us on the top floor of the hotel. The wind noises on that top floor were terrible especially our first night when there was a major wind storm in that area. I used a sound machine, ear plugs and a pillow over my head to no avail. It sounded like a hurricane and the windows were going to give way.",3,2023,09,28
207,Shelborne is outstanding,This is truly a 5 star hotel. Service is impeccable. Staff can’t do enough for you. Every staff member we encountered was well trained. The head door man went above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction. Perfect location on St. Stephens Green. Walked every where. Stayed one night in another 5 star hotel in Dublin on St Stephens Green and there was no comparison. Not even close.,5,2023,09,21
207,"Meh hotel, fine staff, awful food","I was there for a week. The foam bed was impossibly cheap and uncomfortable. Rooms are tiny and the carpet, while vacuumed, was stained. The staff was lovely. I ordered both the hamburger and the plant-free burger from the bar on separate nights. Both were terrible and I could not tell them apart. I had the waiter check that I was served what I ordered. A very disappointing experience. ",2,2023,09,19
207,We Loved It!,"Had a wonderful two night stay here. Beautiful hotel, staff and service were very good, breakfast was incredible - so many fresh, healthy options. Didn’t eat any other meals there, but used the Saddle Room bar and it was perfect. Our room was very nice, had a balcony but we didn’t use it. View wasn’t good, but we didn’t care. I’d probably ask for a different view next time. Fantastic location.",5,2023,09,18

Best to all",3,2023,09,16
207,Living on past glories,"We have been visiting Dublin on and off for the past 37 years. For the last few times we have stayed at The Shelbourne. Don’t think we’ll be staying there again! On arrival late afternoon this time the room we had specifically booked due to my wife’s mobility issues was not ready. We said that we were willing to wait. Instead we were allocated an inferior room which did not meet our requirements. Eventually, after complaining, we were moved to the original room requested.

The “Heritage Rooms” are in desperate need of renovation, and are certainly not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel, especially when 3 nights set me back £3.5k. The carpets were wearing thin; the shower had loose leaking floor tiles, and the general decor was poor. On the 1st morning I discovered nails sticking up through the carpet. When I complained to reception they assured me that it would be attended to immediately. No repairs were undertaken - I gashed my foot on the exposed nails a couple of days later which caused significant bleeding and discomfort for several days afterwards. I complained to reception again and asked for a discretionary reduction. Whilst apologies were forthcoming, I still paid the full bill.

In the meantime, during our stay, on several occasions I didn’t receive the food I ordered. Also the benches in the restaurant are in desperate need of repair.

I’ll definitely be investigating alternative venues for my stay next year!",1,2023,09,13
207,Worldwide Hotel Hall of Fame,"The Shelbourne has earned its way into my hotel hall of fame and I have traveled extensively world wide. Arriving as many do on the red eye from the US we found ourselves at the hotel at 6am- our room wasn’t understandably ready so we were offered a complimentary full breakfast and baggage store while we started our city exploration early. We found the staff professional and cheerful, always greeting us with a smile and a conversation. The bartenders are excellent in all the bars with even the most junior demonstrating a knowledge of whiskey that I could only dream of. The happily mixed na cocktails for my wife that weren’t on the menu and showed pride in their work and being selected for special training such as a bourbon seminar in Kentucky. Room was large and immaculate, breakfast was one of the top 5 breakfast buffets I have had. Concierge, bartenders and doorman all made spot on recommendations, expertly steering us away from the tourist meccas and in to the local places as we asked. Make no mistake, nothing about the Shelbourne is cheap, but you get what you pay for and it’s well worth it. Great treat for a city break and a lively place to celebrate our 30th Anniversary",5,2023,09,04
207,Great location and very pleasant stay!,Very nice hotel at a premium location. Excellent decorations and ambience. Walking distance to all attractions in Dublin. Happening place at night with 4 bars and a lounge exclusively for hotel guests. Very friendly and helpful staff! Enjoyed our 4 days of stay!,5,2023,09,03
207,Bitterly disappointing,"I booked the Shelbourne Hotel via Amex FHR scheme I’ve stayed a few times in the past for work events etc. my husband had never stayed we normally stay at the Westin so I thought I would give this place a go together. We’ve both always said we liked the look and the feel of the hotel. 

Now sadly we won’t ever be back in it as it was deeply bittersweet stay.

On arrival I tried several time to get the attention of the front door team finally a young fella seen me waving told us abruptly to move up. He then went to my husband and asked for the keys I told him twice our luggage is in the boot. So off we went to check in to our room. They asked us as we checked In where our luggage was I explained he left with it expecting that it would be brought in. 

Checkin was less than what I would have expected from Dublin’s premier 5* hotel. Was a little bit of a shambles with Amex you get certain perks early check in etc this couldn’t be accommodated that was fine. However you get a resort experience we were just handed the letter and none of it was explained he disappeared to the back office for around 10-15 mins came back and said he was sorting an upgrade. So we where told to come back later or they would ring us when the room was ready this was around 1pm I was fine with that off we went from checking in to find our luggage as my husband had a glasses case he wanted to put away before we went out into Dublin centre. So we asked where it was no one could find it so we waited over 20 mins after being told it was on its way up it hadn’t arrived my husband went to another receptionist and he said oh your room is ready. 

This is where it got strange we were given a room key and told we could go up so went up to our room and was greeted by two double beds we’d booked a king size. Getting more annoyed I said I want to speak to someone I called and was greeted by a lovely lady who said someone would call me back to room waited 10 minutes and went to reception said to a staff member who then greeted us abruptly asking what the issue was as they had got the booking as a double double heritage room. 

He then asked to see our confirmations which I showed him to his shock he said oh sorry sir you’ve been given someone else’s room . He rushed to find another room and we finally got our king room.

Then we went to ask about the experience credit we had which entitled us to dinner or lunch for two people so we where shown to the Saddle Room i've only ever had breakfast in this room before. The guy took our booking for 7pm. So we went out for the afternoon and came back our luggage had been delivered to the new room. 

We went to have dinner and I was in a pair of designer shorts as i was off to spain the next day and only had packed shorts. I was told at the door that they had my reservation however due to their policy i could not enter in shorts. No one had explained this to us even though i was wearing shorts when i made the booking with the same guy.
So off we went to our room and lucky my husband had another pair of trousers so i borrowed those and went to dinner. He met us again with our new attire and showed us to our table.

We sat down looked at the menu explained to the waiter that we where on the FHR credit and asked what we could get he said he would speak to the manager. Another 10 mins passes we get asked what we want to drink they only handed us one book with contained many options for A La Carte or the Table du Hote menu. They also had wines in it and told us we could have cocktails etc however there where no options in it nor where we offered a larger wine menu like others around us where.

I choose a nice bottle of red and out it came with their sommelier this guy clearly had no training as he poured the wine spilling it on the table and even managed to get it into my husbands water glass.

Off he went came back and offered to change his glass of water with a new one which we had paid for btw. So he replaces the glass and pours from our bottle finishing it. My husbands original glass was untouched so this was wasted. Not being picky but a 5* restaurant should have be better standards. The young French guy Rene serving us was excellent but you could clearly see towards the end of the dinner he was rushed off his feet. We ordered desserts and coffees with him out came the desserts but no coffees.In fairness to Rene he noticed this and 10 or so minutes later our coffee and tea came. We had asked for Milk and some sweetener to this then never arrive we had to ask someone else to get us it by this stage things where going cold.

I brushed it all off as i heard staff telling guest this was their first week etc I just horrified at the standard of service if i am honest.

This got worse when my husband went for breakfast he had to ask 3 times in total for tea after 3 times being offered juices and coffee by three people but no tea. To which a manager came over and said he doesn't want juice he just wants tea like he's told us clearly frustrated. 

He was seated before another couple and they got their tea on the first ask and he also ordered eggs Benedict to which he never got until after the people beside him that was seated after he had ordered his food they then ordered and got theirs first the eggs Benedict.

Overall staff training is an issue here the Shelbourne is Dublins premier 5* hotel i've stayed in some of the best hotels around the world and this comes no where near 5* service or experience. 

I never leave harsh reviews but I just thought booking something special for us to enjoy before i went off to work in Spain was just marred and for the cost of the room not to even have tea bags in the room if you wanted tea this also was lacking.

I was never asked when i left at 4am to catch my flight how my stay was when my husband was leaving it was another mess waiting on the car which he called 30 mins before leaving like we where told.

I get it is hard to get staff in this climate but this is no ordinary hotel this should be better.

I am afraid i would not recommend or stay again.",1,2023,08,21
207,Gets better every time I stay!,"I have been to the Shelbourne on several occasions but this time it was special because it was the first time I was bringing my mum. She had always wanted to go to stay in the Shelbourne so I wanted to make sure it was the best of the best. The reservations team is a pleasure to deal with and made this very easy for me. Ashley is incredible at what she does but also is as accommodating as any Hotelier can be. The reception team were the same as always and check in was quick and efficient. This time I decided to use the Leisure facilities and the only bad thing was that I never used it with my previous stays. Beautiful swimming pool. Great split between Cardio and weights in separate areas.

Never a complaint when staying in this hotel and I am looking forward to my next stay with you.",5,2023,08,19
207,Gym rats will love the weight room,Lovely hotel . Very nice and patient concierge with clueless American runner . He showed me a few great routes to run. Our room was spacious and accommodating for the three of us traveling.  The room was quiet - much needed after an overnight .  My husband and son loved the weight room as it had good selection of dumbbells and a squat rack ( rare for a hotel gym).  The breakfast had a large selection which was nice .   Very American friendly in a great part of town .,5,2023,08,16
207,Thoroughly recommend - Grand Dame hotel which doesn't show her age,"Grand dame hotel that delivers - well positioned, well appointed but pricey as you would expect.

Stayed twice for business recently on a decent corporate rate - room is clearly geared towards American tourists, but actually well appointed with high end features in room. Walk in shower, marble bathrooms, luxury bedlinen and beds and average sized rooms at entry level. Service is generally very good, although can be queue to check in at times.

Leisure facilities are great - indoor pool, sauna and steam room; large gym area on multiple levels including a squat rack and free weights, one of the better gym setups have seen in a hotel for some time.

Bars are institutions, typical bar grub but convenient; horseshoe bar not open every day but is a famous spot for a tipple. Often full of American tourists :-)

Thoroughly recommend ",5,2023,08,14
207,An Experience To Remember!,"Upon the advice of travel advisor Rick Steves I booked Afternoon Tea at The Lord Major’s Lounge as part of my birthday trip of a lifetime. I’d spent 5 months planning the itinerary on our first visit to Ireland and this experience was top of my list. Our flight from Toronto had been delayed until 2:00 am so we had to arrive a bit disheveled directly from the airport. 
What an experience! Our lovely server Lily went ABOVE & BEYOND to insure our experience would be long remembered.",5,2023,08,11

207,"Well maintained Historical Hotel, tremendous service and comfortable rooms","What a tremendous hotel at which to stay on a visit to Dublin. Location allows you to walk just about everywhere; the best breakfast around, with attentive service, and the rooms were so comfortable. The history of this well maintained Hotel and the immediate vicinity was felt and appreciated!",5,2023,07,16
207,Service is definitely a problem ,"We had two significant problems during our stay. The first is that at their restaurant, despite being advised multiple times  that one of our guests had a gluten allergy they were served food with gluten, which caused a severe allergic reaction. But these mistakes happen in a busy kitchen.

 More unforgivable was the taxi situation out of the hotel. We requested a cab to take us to the train station the night before we were set to depart from the front desk.  Our information was taken and we were assured it would be no problem. When we arrived to the Bell desk in the morning and asked for our cabs, we were treated extremely rudely with much eye rolling from the bellhops. They told us it was raining and cars were difficult to come by. They also told us we could not secure  one for a group of our size. I then told them we could break up into multiple cabs, and that was not a problem at all. They were also unable to satisfy this request, and they generally behaved as if asking for a cab at a cab stand at a hotel was a ridiculous request  and were very irritated. After waiting for some time we ultimately had to take all our large bags and walk half an hour to the train in a rainstorm.  We looked like refugees fleeing a war zone and were met with raised eyebrows all across Dublin as we miserably trudged to the train.  

 And this is the best hotel in Dublin?   I’ve stayed at the best hotels all over the world and this was appalling. They should be ashamed.

207,Magnificent property ,"Was concerned after reading so many bad reviews. Our experience could not have been better . The food , service and the hotel its self were magnificent. I stayed here 30 years ago and it’s even better today . Don’t be scared off by the naysayers ",5,2023,07,09
207,A most memorable hotel experience for our family,"We had the privilege to stay at this stunning hotel with our 2 children (11 & 10) our first night in Dublin, traveling from Boston. We splurged via Amex points on a junior suite and it was one of the best decisions on our trip planning. We were delighted to be upgraded to their Princess Grace suite and felt fancier than Kevin McAllister in Home Alone 2! The suite was beyond opulent and we felt like royalty. From the incredible decor picked by Grace Kelly herself to the 1,509 square feet to relax, I wish I could have frozen time. It was so very special for us. 
The hotel itself is gorgeous with multiple, beautiful dining and drink options. We had high tea for lunch, which was incredible and fancy - with options for my pescatarian daughter. I highly recommend the whiskey tea (non-alcoholic). 
For dinner and Irish breakfast, we ate at the Saddle Room, which had plenty of yummy options for us all. The food and drink selection was fabulous and I loved my short rib entree.
The service from the front of the house to every person we spoke to was beyond top notch.  Special shout out to Matteo who made us (and my kids!) feel like we were special guests. The only downside was having it been our first night, no other place in our 13 day travel could measure up to the Shelbourne :) we were spoiled. 
When we return to Dublin, we will 100% return to the Shelbourne.",5,2023,06,29
207,Beautiful Hotel ,"We had a very short but pleasant stay at The Shelbourne. It is a beautiful historic hotel. Our room was cute and comfortable. Hotel staff was professional and courteous. We had dinner late but it was served promptly and was delicious. Breakfast, on the other hand, was somewhat disorganized. Overall, it was a great experience even though our room was a bit overpriced. 
",5,2023,06,21
207,The Place to Stay in DUBLIN! ,"I would LOVE to give the Shelbourne 5 Stars as it SHOULD receive- however I was with a group of 23- we had several rooms, and a few of the participants in the group could not get their room to COOL down, and they were not offered other rooms that might have been cooler or much relief. 
.
The Beds were solid- which is a HUGE plus as many hotels have let their mattresses go downhill-- 
.
The Turn down service is nice- slippers, robes, chocolates, fresh shower caps every day, and bottled water in room included. 
.
The Hotel locks after a certain hour which makes me feel safer- so thank you. 
The breakfast is incredible- fresh coffee, salmon, eggs, fresh fruit, jams, toasts-- I only wish I could have tried a fresh omelette one morning but I was always on a tight schedule.
.
Elevators -2 work well and are roomy for an older property. Did not check out the pool or spa- but those are available. Plenty of space in closet to hang things and a roomy counter in bathroom.  
.
Showers were a bit of a challenge to use- and I am not sure if the accessible rooms have walk in showers- but stepping over the high tub is a risky thing-- 
.
1 Luggage rack per room- which still puzzles me when you know 2 people many times will use the room-- 
.
Staff is VERY HELPFUL-- and I give kudos to them for being able to give our jet-legged group rooms early! THANK YOU! 
.
Highly recommend this for your DUBLIN stay! ",4,2023,06,19
207,Great hotel in Dublin,Just stayed there for 2 nights but we really enjoyed it .Great location right across from the park and 3 steeers over from the Grafton shopping street. Staff was very nice too. Room was nice & beds were comfortable. They left still & sparkling water next to the bed. We enjoyed the bar on the left of entrance at night .,5,2023,06,05
207,"Location, Location. Location","Stayed here for three nights as part of a tour group.  Four star rating is for the location.  Otherwise, I would give three stars as the property has the feel of an average/above average Marriott.  Being directly across St. Stephen's Green park is lovely.  Hotel is located to allow walking distance to explore the finest parts of Dublin with ease.  Service was fine but not noteworthy except for bell staff which was top notch!  Breakfast and dinners were very good.  Room was large.  Bathroom was standard Marriott Renaissance type.  Bathroom cleanliness could be improved.  Would recommend staying here  based on fantastic location.",4,2023,06,03
207,"An unwelcomed visit, and the bar service fell far short of the high prices","Just like other reviewers have said, this place has lost its gloss, and should have lost some of its 5 stars. Five of us popped into the Shelbourne Bar for a drink after dinner in Dublin city centre. The bar was very busy with a student graduation party. Not a problem as they were all well behaved, and were not crowding the bar to prevent others ordering. But that didn't mean you could get an order. There is a seating area on the far side of the lounge - I asked a staff member if we could sit there. He said (as it was a food area) ""we're not serving food any more"". I replied ""that's fine, we just want drinks"" , to which he replied ""but this is for food only"" - you can see how the conversation evolved from there -  my frustration was beginning to build. Anyway, he said we could sit down but they'd be closing the area in a few minutes, so we'd have to leave.....even though the rest of the room was packed. Bizarre! Anyway, we got some seats elsewhere and I went to the bar to get the drinks in.  15 minutes I waited!  The 2 barmen were taken up preparing big rounds of cocktails. The other guy that I had spoken to at the far end of the bar, avoided anyone's efforts to attract his attention for an order, and he eventually scarpered into the back room. Then I saw another barman stacking tonic bottles on a shelf that didn't actually need them. So there he was, happily stacking bottles, while the other 2 were making cocktails, and people were lined up at the bar looking to order. I managed to get his attention, and he took my order - a pint of IPA, 2 G&Ts and a white wine spritzer (he didn't know what the last one was, so I had to tell him the basic ingredients) - he came back with a glass of white wine (no ice) and a bottle of soda. I had to ask him for a glass with ice, so that my sister could assemble her own drink. And then the bill - a staggering €47.85 (see photo). That's €7.80 for a pint of IPA, €17.45 for a white wine spritzer that we had to assemble ourselves, and €11.30 for a G&T.  This place promotes itself as a premium hotel, and sets its prices accordingly. But, to be brutally honest, my experience was that it was like a bar at a racecourse....and that's an insult to racecourse bars. I won't be rushing to go back. Even if the bar was empty, the prices are a complete turn off. ",1,2023,06,02
207,Excellent stay,First time at this historic property.  We booked an amazing one bedroom suite that had a ton of room for entertaining.  Property is ideally located on the park in Dublin.  Service was top notch.  Several great bar options.  We loved it.,5,2023,06,02
207,I’ve stayed here many times in the past. Not sure how it is now still claiming to be a 5 star hotel.,I’m lifetime Titanium Elite at Marriott. Did early check in on app. Why bother? Rooms never available. Front desk here is perfunctory at best. Curt even. No acknowledgement of loyalty to Marriott. Went to breakfast at Saddle Room: had to ask three wait staff before I got a coffee. They stand around nattering and not paying any attention. Am staying 3 nights with family and to do some work. Will see if this gets better. Cannot get worse.,1,2023,05,14
207,The Famous Shelbourne High Tea,The high tea in the Shelbourne is a fabulous affair. It is in huge demand so you must book ahead. It is also pretty expensive but it is an extremely lavish affair served with great panache in superb surroundings by an excellent staff. Everything is carefully curated and if you add champagne into the mix you are really pushing the boat out. This is definitely how the other half lives so if you can do it then do it. I only have one criticism and it’s not with the high tea. As we were early we thought we would sneak in a cheeky Prosecco to get us in the mood. We were directed to the presidents bar which is a small intimate bar that feels like a gentleman’s club. We were told that they had no Proseco in that bar and could only offer champagne which was twice the price so we stumped up for that. When we were about go in for high tea we were asked to wait briefly unbothered downstairs bar. When I looked at the menu what was on it Proseco. This Bar is about  50 feet from the President bar. I was annoyed that my request which could have easily been met wasn’t and this left a bad taste. Apart from that the rest was excellent.,4,2023,05,02
207,A+ All Around,"We only got to spend one night at the Shelbourne, but it was a perfect night. The staff was friendly and professional. We had a beautiful room that overlooked the park across the street. The room was exceptionally well decorated, beautifully lit and very comfortable. The bed was cozy. The hotel was kind enough to give us a welcome gift of fudge and a couple of small bottles of whiskey, which we thoroughly enjoyed after dinner. If I have the pleasure of returning to Dublin, I will not stay anywhere but the Shelbourne.",5,2023,05,01
207,Overrated,"After staying at the Westin and having excellent service my friend and I checked in to the Shelbourne for three nights.  I have stayed at other Shelbourne hotels and was very excited to try another Shelbourne Luxury hotel.  

Upon entering the hotel the lobby is decorated nicely with vases of orchids, a tea room to the right and No 27 Shelbourne Bar to the left.  We approached the check in desk which is located towards the back of the hotel lobby.  There was one clerk working so I checked in first.  We both had booked two rooms with the same King size bedroom.  While I was checking in another woman came to the desk and started the checkin process for my friend.  I asked about an upgraded room, I have Platinum status and  I also had five suite night awards to use but was told the hotel was oversold by one room so nothing was available to upgrade.  I was given my key to room 886 which is located in the oldest part of the hotel facing an office building rooftop.  I'll refer to this part of the hotel as the dungeon as the hallways are very dark and not lite very well.  

My friend who was in the process of checking in also asked about an upgrade and was granted an upgrade to a suite in the front part of the building above the Grand Staircase. The hallways in the front part are grand and well lit.  Her suite 440 was beautiful and faced the park with a large bathroom, separate glass enclosed shower, separate bathtub, large vanity and several closets.  Her room also had crystal drinking glasses and other amenities. I am 5'11"" tall and my room had a step in bathtub/shower combo which made it difficult for me to shower since the shower head was attached to the wall and I don't like climbing into a tub to take a shower. The bathroom mirror was also low and would not swivel up for me to put on my makeup. I asked again about getting a different room that did not have a step in bathtub to shower and was told that was not possible again they said the hotel was oversold.  I asked why my friend was granted an upgrade after I checked in and they really could not explain other than she had two beds and that was the only room with two beds.  That didn't make any sense since we both booked King size beds but they were trying to indicate that she booked two beds which was not true.

Later someone called my room and I was told they would check with the manager to see about another room but nothing happened during my stay and no one communicated back to me about another room. My friend had turndown service and bottled water delivered around 5:00 p.m.   At 8:30 p.m. I called about turndown service and received a call back from a manager saying that someone would be there before 9:00 p.m.  Since I was the last room at the end of hallway on the eighth floor housekeeping came around 9:00 p.m.  That was the only night I received turndown service and water for my room.  After turndown service I noticed that my sheets had black marks on them and were not clean.  I asked housekeeping about changing the sheets and was told they only change them every two days for guests.  I requested that since my sheets were not clean that they change them out which they did promptly.   

There are no ice machines on any floors so in order to get ice you  have to call downstairs and request that someone bring you ice.  I had money on the table and when I came back to my room the money was gone so whoever was in my room decided to lift it.  It was a small amount only 10 euros so I did not report it.  I assume the person who delivered ice to my room thought it was a tip.

 We ate in No 27 and also in The Saddle Room.  No 27 is a gathering place and was very loud with people talking in the afternoon. We each ordered drinks and I ordered a salad and thought it was very good.  The waitstaff in No 27 was pleasant as well.  No 27 did separate checks for us with no problem.

The Saddle Room is more quiet and intimate.  We both ordered separate entrees and asked since we had separate rooms to please make separate checks.   I thought the food was good in both restaurants although my friend was not impressed with the food and did not eat much of her food.  The waitstaff at the Saddle Room did not inquire as to why she had not eaten.  We each had drinks and I requested plain water to hydrate between my drinks.  My friend did not ask for water.  When the bill came we were charged nine euros for water.  One bill was presented at the end of the meal and was not separated.  We asked again for separate bills and was told that was not possible in the Saddle Room.  Several waitstaff came over and was staring at us while we discussed the bill and I also asked why we were charged for water.  We were told it was a mistake yet it was not removed from our bill.  

 When it came time to check out I rolled my luggage down a dimly lit hallway from the farthest corner of the building on floor eight, up a couple of stairs to get to an elevator.  I met a woman on the elevator who said her room was so small that she had to ask the hotel to store in luggage during her stay.  Overall the Shelbourne is a lovely hotel but I was disappointed and  didn't find  most of the staff helpful or friendly with the exception of the doorman and the waitstaff in No 27.  I guess my expectations were much higher from staying at other Shelbourne hotels.  ",3,2023,05,01
207,Amazing,"Was delighted to stay at The Shelbourne Hotel.

It is in a great location right beside shops, bars and restaurants.
We enjoyed a night in the horse shoe bar with great food.

The staff are amazing and could not do enough for us.

Will be back!",5,2023,04,23
207,Top marks for Afternoon tea,"I was lucky to receive a gift of afternoon tea for two from my daughter for my birthday. It was a fantastic treat and such a lovely way to  create a cherished memory..yes, she came with me!
From the moment we set foot in the lobby we were impressed by the warmth and professionalism of all staff members.

Afternoon tea is served in a bright, luxurious but cosy dining room. We were seated in comfortable armchairs and the china table setting was gorgeous. I was so happy to be there with my daughter and the calm surroundings made the experience very relaxing. 
We were lucky to be served by a lovely waitress called Charlotte who made our special occasion more memorable by her attention to detail and her pleasant, friendly nature.

The food served was absolutely delicious and we also enjoyed the variety of tea choices which we sampled purely due to the enthusiastic recommendations from Charlotte. I'm glad we did because it added to the fun.
I was amazed at the generous portions of food we were served as I genuinely expected very small portions. Everything was beautifully presented and as I've said..delicious, especially the smoked salmon sandwiches and we were served extra portions.
Difficult to pick a favourite dessert, they were all so good and the scones were perfect.  The items we didn't manage to eat were beautifully packaged in cake boxes for us to take home.
 
Afternoon tea in the Shelbourne was one of the best gifts I have ever received and I am so grateful to my daughter for her thoughfulness and to all the staff for making my birthday treat such a memorable one.
Fabulous - from beginning to end. Highly recommend and I will return !",5,2023,04,17
207,Luxury in Dublin,We had the most wonderful stay at The Shelbourne. Rooms were lovely and beds were comfortable. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Bellman were very helpful with getting us a taxi and handling our luggage during checkin and checkout. We enjoyed the Saddle Room for breakfast. The buffet was the best we have experienced. The No 27 bar was lively and had wonderful food and specialty cocktail selections. We also enjoyed relaxing with a night cap in the 1824 and Horseshoe bars. Only regret is that we didn’t have a chance to experience high tea. It’s supposed to be the best in Ireland. We look forward to returning again.,5,2023,04,13
207,Loved it,Top to bottom a fantastic visit. Rooms were first class and staff was more than accommodating. Property is gorgeous. Mossy in the lobby is the man. He’ll take care of you. Just an all around good guy.,5,2023,04,07
207,Excellent stay,"Beautiful hotel, the accommodations are lovey! Felt like we stepped into a modern version of a Jane Austen house. Lovely stay, super helpful and courteous staff, excellent location, and the best afternoon tea we have ever had!! Beyond fresh and delicious. ",5,2023,04,02
207,Just as good as the first,"This was our second time staying at The Shelbourne. Our first time was 5 years ago with a tour group, and we were utterly impressed. This time we came back to Dublin on our own and chose The Shelbourne again. Unlike some of the other recent reviews I have seen on TripAdvisor, we found the services to be very good with particular attention to detail by housekeeping. We enjoyed breakfasts and lunch at The Saddle Room where our entrees were always served appropriately warm. We enjoyed happy hour at No. 27 bar, where they served us our food order even though it was earlier than dinner time. We used the fitness center which had a variety of options (pool, cardio, weights) for exercise. Walking distance to shops on Grafton St and to Trinity College made it a convenient location. We would return again. ",5,2023,04,01
207,Wow just wow,"We had afternoon tea and it was a beautiful experience. The building is beautiful, the staff so attentive and the food really amazing. Don't miss this if you are in Dublin a true luxury.  Ask for more and it's no bother, drink every tea on the menu and it's fine. Nothing was too much trouble and the takeaway boxes are beautiful. ",5,2023,03,31
207,Package Tour Mentality,"I spent less than 12 hours in this hotel as I arrived at midnight off the ferry from Holyhead.  Checking in I was astounded to be taken to a room that was actually occupied, something the porter realised when he opened the door and we were met by a yell from the female guest already in the room!  Apologies were proffered as a shaken porter guided me back to reception where I had to wait 15-20 minutes whilst they found me another room.  I was eventually taken to a vacant room with twin beds, despite my reservation is for a King.

I slept soundly and in the morning after a walk around the city, I returned for breakfast and approached the girl outside the dining area for a table.  There was no ""good morning"", simply an abrupt request for my room number, which after checking was met with the words, ""your package doesn't include breakfast so you will need to pay for everything""!  When I commented that fine she then reiterated that I need to pay!  I paid almost EUR 700 for the room and replied perhaps that's an indication I can afford the meal! Breakfast itself was less than relaxing, mostly on account of a table with a young child that was unruly and noisy.  I don't think it is unacceptable for staff to remind the family to control the child and at least prevent it from roaming around and up to other tables.  The staff, however, did nothing and the level of service of breakfast is appalling and I disliked being asked again, ""your package does not include breakfast""!

Departing soon after giving up on breakfast service, my final annoyance was at check-out when I was reminded again that my parking was not part of my ""package"" and I would be charged!  I reminded the staff member that not every guest is a package tour customer and I greatly resent this lack of awareness.  He continued to charge me for overnight parking!

There was also one odd incident as I walked down the grand staircase for my morning walk,   I encountered a staff member who asked if I was enjoying my room.  When I said it was OK he replied making a comment that at the rate I was paying, I should have had a suite and my room normally sells for, ""around Eur250 including breakfast""!  I was fully aware I was paying almost full price because I made a very last-minute decision to stay with the hotel.  However, I didn't need reminding of it and I certainly was unimpressed to be continually treated as a package tour client when paying the full rate for a 12-hour stay.

The Shelbourne is a hotel that once recognised customers, it seems now they simply have a checklist of what package a guest is on.

I was remarkably unimpressed.

207,Loud party nights,"A Premier Inn masquerading as a 5 star hotel. V loud party kept me up until 2am. Hotel more focused on keeping outside punters happy than hotel residents. Awful, avoid at all costs unless you are at the party.",1,2023,03,30
207,Nice hotel,Beautiful old hotel full of history in a fantastic location overlooking St Stephens green. Queen room is very small for the price paid. I would upgrade if budget allows. Very nice breakfast and good quality drinks and service in the bar. We went out for dinner so cant comment on the food.,4,2023,03,24
207,Above and beyond,I just wanted to thank Matteo on reception who went above and beyond to find an incredibly restaurant to eat at late on a Saturday evening. His professionalism and kindness will not be forgotten and we will definitely be coming back to the Shelbourne. ,5,2023,03,23
207,"Do not stay here, stained bedsheets and blankets in 2 different rooms","I do not recommend staying in this hotel in Dublin. Check out The Merrion instead. We ended up leaving to find a different hotel because the 2 rooms they tried to put us in somehow both had stained bedsheets and blankets with what looked like old blood, poop(?), and black marks. Both the rooms were also dusty, you could tell they didn’t even wipe down the headboard, tables, or mirrors. The cleaning staff manager tried to say the black marks might’ve been from when they were putting the sheets on that it rubbed against something. That’s not really a great excuse especially for a 5 star hotel that cost $1700k for 3 nights, the beds should be clean at the very least. Sarah the manager was very nice though and agreed to a full refund.",1,2023,02,27
207,Wonderful,"We had our usual warm welcome by the outstanding door man ( Greg is exceptional)
The hotel has a wonderful entrance hall leading to a quieter and more private  reception, which was nice as it was a busy rugby weekend. We were greeted in a friendly manner and our room was as expected, to a very high standard with beautiful furnishings and spotless. We had lunch and drinks in bar which was pleasant and dinner in the saddle room which was excellent and we felt very good value compared to other nearby restaurants, service and ambience was lovely and calm and food excellent. Breakfast as always is wonderful. 
Many thanks
We will definitely be back.",5,2023,02,15
207,Sensational Shelbourne,"What a fantastic hotel. We only popped in for a coffee, had such a good seat and was so enjoying the experience that we extended the visit to include a glass of wine.

The service is fantastic, location stunning and the experience exceptional. 

Well worth a visit.",5,2023,02,11
207,"""Luxury in the heart of Dublin""","We stayed at the Shelbourne over New Year's Eve 2022.  The location is excellent, right off of St Stephen's Green, easy walking distance to the River Liffey, Museums, shopping areas and great restaurants. Also, very close to public transportation, bus terminals and train station if you decide to take a trip in the country.  The hotel itself is a beautiful old historical building completely renovated and updated with modern amenities. Bouquet of fresh flowers in the lobby, nice restaurants and good selection of bars on premises. Front desk attendants were professional and helpful, and so was the concierge. The room was spacious and very nicely appointed, featuring nice views and a huge marble bathroom with tub and shower, ample counter space. Luxurious towels and robes were also provided along with slippers and turn down service in the evening.  This hotel has it all, five star all around, we highly recommend and will return in the future. Thank you for a memorable stay!",5,2023,02,02
207,Just right,"This hotel was pure elegance from the first step through to the doors. A door man walked to through the beautiful entrance to reception where a lovely man checked me in. I got a beautiful upgrade to a Heritage Premium Guest Room 156. The room had beautiful high ceilings with all the small details just right. The long marble corridor to the bathroom was jawdropping. One of the most enjoyable stays I have had away with my boyfriend. Thank you to Marion on the guest service she delivers every time I ring the Shelbourne. And Brian the Doorman for being such a gentleman.

I will be returning again!",5,2023,01,26
207,Simply the right place to be,"The Hotel is one of the best luxury hotels, we have ever stayed. Everything on point, from the room to the restaurant .As you are leaving, you are already thinking of when to go back. The staffs are always welcoming, from Val Cameron, the reservation Manager to Greg, the concierge, not forgetting the 2 Anas, Vanessa and all the staffs in the Restaurant and Front desk. Thank you so much for your service.",5,2023,01,17
207,Another wonderful experience,"Dear GM,
 
We write to thank you for another amazing year-end/anniversary celebration at the Shelbourne.
 
We got officially married in your hotel in 2018 and have TRIED to celebrate the day with a dinner in the hotel for family and friends each year. COVID interrupted that plan, but this year we were successful in have five nights stay,  with Dinner in the St. Stephen’s suite with our family.
 
Both were absolutely magical, and the experience again was seamless. Kelly from events planning was amazing. She held our hands through the planning process and met us every day in the hotel. She is a real asset, and her professionalism is something you should guard and take great pride in.
 
On the night of the Dinner, Aisling and her team were simply sublime. Perfection to the tee. Please thank & praise them all.
 
Eimear in the Saddle room was a vision to behold with her lovely smile and warm manner, especially at breakfast. The rest of the team there was also great, we are only sorry we do not have all their names.
 
Our suite was amazing and again the housekeeping staff were the best.
 
It is again a proven truth that the Shelbourne is the “Grande Dame” of Ireland.",5,2023,01,15
207,The Shelbourne is a gem - we'll be back!,"We loved our stay at the Shelbourne just before Christmas. It was the perfect launching pad to adventures in Dublin - just a short walk from Grafton Street and many other Dublin attractions like EPIC, St. Stephen's Green, and the River Liffey. Room service was wonderful after a very long travel day, and my 5 year old highly recommends the hot chocolate! Requests were always attended to promptly, and the staff at the Shelbourne were warm and welcoming. I loved the room artwork consisted of watercolours of Bono, Liam Neeson, and Gabriel Byrne. The Shelbourne celebrates Ireland without it being kitschy or stereotypical. If you are looking for a unique hotel in Dublin with all the benefits of being attached to the Marriott brand, look no further than the Shelbourne.",5,2023,01,06
207,Absolutely speechless,"From the moment you set foot, you are greeted like a king who owns this castle of a hotel! My titanium benefits landed me a free breakfast which was the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. I got to use my Suite Night Awards and scored an upgrade to the Heritage 1BDR suite which is absolutely gorgeous and laced with royalty! There is a fully decorated and lit up Christmas tree in the room and the furniture and atmosphere is absolutely stunning. The grounds are so well maintained and this might be the fanciest and best stay I've ever encountered in the Marriott Portfolio! Well done! Shout out to all the staff & housekeepers for being so friendly and kind and eager to help with anything!",5,2023,01,06
207,Very nice but expensive historic hotel,"Beautiful historic hotel in the heart of Dublin. The hotel itself is stunning. The staff are very attentive, and I enjoyed my visit. The one thing that shocked me was given the pride (almost 700 euros for one of the nights I was there ) they didn’t even have a proper coffee maker in the room. Days Inns have coffee makers in the room. It’s a basic amenity that I can only imagine is not in the room so the hotel can over charge with coffee in their restaurants",4,2023,01,01
207,Delightful luxury location,"We have worked in luxury properties in Ritz-Carlton and St Regis. This is a match to those, very elegant and with a good  variety of food choices/venues as well as a wonderful room.

We were greeted well on arrival and got a double room. Nice large, quality linens, super bathroom with strong powered shower. We commented that there was a squeak in the bathroom door and it was fixed immediately. Our housekeeper is amazing. Room 267 for 3 nights. Our housekeeper knew that I drink still water and my husband has sparkling and left the right ones by our bed. She gave us slippers and chocolates at turndown. 

Mulled wine at the reception was a lovely surprise

Saddle room breakfast buffet was superbl. Eggs cooked perfectly. Fruit, croissants, bacon, great sausage, black pudding, mushrooms, tomatoes, etc. Lovely linen tables.

We had dinner in front of a gorgeous fireplace with a warm and fun vibe. My husband had prawns and fries and sourdough. I had fish and chips. Both of us had Christmas puddings.

Location is in the middle of many points of interest. It is across the street from the stop for the on/off bus.

Very friendly staff all over. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,12,27
207,Good location… not much else,"We stayed 3 nights upon arriving in Dublin from Australia. Very busy time of the year, one week before Christmas. Our driver pulled up to the front of the hotel but their was no concierge to greet us and take our bags… so we took them ourselves! 
Reception looked and felt like an airport waiting lounge… absolutely jam packed with people. We waited 5 mins to see the lovely gent behind the front desk… he was the friendliest staff member we encountered for our entire stay. Luckily we received an upgraded room… the room we received was tight, so we can only imagine how small the other rooms are.
Our complimentary dinner in The Saddle Room was average - and that is being generous. When we arrived at the hotel we went and saw the male maître d’ to ask for an earlier sitting as we had been travelling for more than 24 hours… he was obnoxious and plain rude… told us he had over 150 guests coming in for dinner that night and couldn’t possibly help us. When we arrived for our set dinner time the restaurant was practically empty. The food was ok… sadly the fish was overcooked and dry. The service was cold and not at all welcoming. We decided not to dine in The Saddle Room for dinner again for the rest of our stay!
In contrast, the breakfast in The Saddle Room was good…. Not the food but the staff… the breakfast staff were all very friendly and obliging. The evening dinner staff should take note on how to deliver good customer service from the morning crew.
Overall, while the location of this hotel is good, we wouldn’t stay here again… The Merrion looks much nicer. 
PS: we would’ve provided this feedback on checkout but we weren’t asked how we enjoyed our stay!",3,2022,12,21
207,The Highest of Standards in every regard !,"I have been in and out of this Hotel many times over the years, in the bars, restaurants and Ballroom, it is the Grand Dame of Dublin Hotels and is a beautiful Hotel outside and in, excellent food and service. However I had never stayed there. This Christmas I thought I would because my parents were going to be abroad and I have no family of my own. I booked in for the Christmas period on a no refund Christmas package that I was very much looking forward to. A long story short my father died suddenly before Christmas and I needed to be with my mother. I contacted the Hotel to advise them of my situation, understanding the no refund policy I requested a credit to be used sometime in the future only, this is the response I received from reservations: 

“ Dear …………,
 
Firstly, we would to offer our sincere condolences on your profound loss, and thank you so much for letting us know,
 
This email was to inform you that in this special extenuating circumstance we have expedited a full refund to you which will be visible in your account as soon as we can, ideally in the next few days with an obvious allowance for the Christmas holidays,
 
Again, we are deeply sorry for your loss and if we can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us,
 
Warm regards,”

They didn’t have to do this and I didn’t even ask for it, but it was very nice to receive this understanding at such a difficult time. 

Thank you Shelbourne, you are the heart of Christmas in Dublin, always have been and always will be. ",5,2022,12,21
207,By far the worst and most embarrassing hotel,Booked this horrendous hotel  for CEO and others after meetings. After check in went to bar where barman discriminated due to her accent and nationality over drink pronunciation. Quickly barred and later supported by assistant manager to not allow a drink in main bar. Two witnesses thankfully. Legal will be hopefully swift and punitive.

207,Wedding at The Shelbourne ,"I recently celebrated my wedding at The Shelbourne, and it was nothing short of excellent. Every detail was attended to, and no detail was overlooked. Maire helped with the wedding side of things and made us feel in the know at all times. This was a completely international wedding, around 90 in total, and I couldn't have done it without her help in coordinating and planning. From dinner in the Constitution Suite, to holiday tea for 12, and then the ball room for the wedding reception, it went as smoothly as one could hope. Lastly, Mary, the florist I worked with from the hotel, was a joy from the moment I met with her. She understood my vision and perfectly captured everything I was going for! I am so thankful to have worked with Maire and Mary and would recommend them. ",5,2022,12,11
207,Was not impressed with hotel this    Not 5* this trip we both felt.,"We’ve stayed on many occasions.
Definitely €540 a night without breakfast does not warrants 5*
Our queen room was tiny
We were going to order breakfast in our room but room not big enough for this.
Bathroom was so small & old fashioned. Tiny basin, no room for cosmetics. No hanging hand towel at basin! Up high folded behind us.
Bar was jammed, no reserved seats for residents, we wanted to eat in the bar but no where for us to sit.
Location perfect, but definite slide in everything about our stay
Nothing inviting us to go back there",3,2022,12,11
207,Fabulous Hotel ,"I stayed at The Shelbourne for 4 nights including a weekend.  It is a beautiful hotel in a great location.  It is easy to pop out the front door and be in the heart of Dublin which is a very walkable city.   From the hotel you can easily get to shops and restaurants. with a short walk.  The room was clean and well maintained.  It was also quiet.  I ate breakfast twice in the hotel which had a nice breakfast selection and was accommodating to a dietary restriction.  I also used the spa which was beautiful.  Finally, I used the fitness center which was well equipped.  I used the pool several times and was thrilled that they had this option as I am an avid swimmer.  The only downside of my stay here was that the hotel was hosting many events during the holidays and therefore, the lobby was constantly crowded (and loud) and my room was missing a couple of small items.  But, other than that it was a fabulous hotel and I would highly recommend.",4,2022,12,07
207,Worth it for a special treat,"Great locations in the heart of Dublin, easy transfer from airport to hotel via AirCoach. Warmly welcomed, room has traditional furniture in keeping with the beautiful building. Breakfast in the Saddle Room, full buffet & eggs any style to order, served on fine bone china. 

Dinner was excellent pricy but worth it for a treat.
All staff were helpful and professional, I will return",5,2022,12,03
207,Lovely Stay,My daughter and I traveled over from Florida for her 16th birthday.   We had a lovely stay at the Shelbourne.  The staff couldn’t have been nicer.  Shane helped us with our bags and he was very personable and gave us tips for traveling around Dublin. We didn’t have time to try the restaurants in the hotel.  Hopefully next visit.,5,2022,12,02
207,The best in Dublin,"Stunning hotel in a great location just a few mins walk to Grafton Street. 

Loved the Horseshoe Bar - great for drinks after a day out on the town. 

The swimming pool is also a great addition for morning swims.",5,2022,11,25
207,"Great stay, luxury, local staff. Will stay again.","Had three nights here and found it very enjoyable.
Great staff in all areas of the hotel, virtually all were local Irish people so had great interaction with them, funny stories, local knowledge and recommendations etc.
Missing from so many hotels these days.
Rooms was overlooking the park at the front, only down side was road noise.
Very comfortable bed, excellent bathroom supplies, AC worked perfectly and without noise.
Big wardrobes, fridge, iron, coffee machine, water etc, everything you need was supplied.
Breakfast was buffet style but as its an open kitchen you can see everything being made in small batches when needed, so its all fresh and very high quality. 
Service again excellent and wide range of choice. Coffee excellent also.
Had both bar snacks and evening meal here also, can't fault service or quality.
Only down side is the bar is so popular its difficult to get a table, even if your a guest. 
Would stay here again without hesitation.
No airport shuttle which is a shame.",5,2022,11,22
207,Outstanding Service and Impressive Luxury,"From check-in to check-out, my brief stay was exceptional.  I would echo the reviews that say this historic, beautiful hotel has an excellent location, outstanding service. I ate an evening meal at the restaurant and the food and service were also outstanding. Highly recommend and wish my stay was longer.",5,2022,11,19
207,Stunning hotel in a good location,"My wife and I stayed in the Shelbourne and enjoyed our stay but overall I would say I prefer the Westbury if I'm being honest.

The decor of the hotel is stunning.  We received a room upgrade due to booking via American Express platinum travel services.  The room was spacious, clean and no issues with heating controls like other guests have mentioned.
We received a welcome gift to the room which was a bottle of red wine - thanks a bunch for that!
Breakfast was excellent, really good selection and good quality food.
There was a nice atmosphere in the bar area, we had a few drinks and also had lunch there.  I found the staff very good in the bar area and when getting breakfast.

My only minor criticism is that I found some of the staff weren't overly friendly.  Check in felt a bit robotic.  It felt as if the woman checking us in was reading a script.  When we were picking up the car from valet parking the driver was very blunt.  I would've tipped him like I do in any other hotel but he handed me my key card, never said a word and just walked off.  

it seems that if you want a good experience here, you have to be prepared to pay a considerable amount more for a better room.
We paid £400 for the night which was rather expensive but considering the complimentary room upgrade, dining credit, free breakfast and bottle of red wine.  I would stay here again.",5,2022,11,19
207,Disappointing and not the same Hotel,"Stayed in room 161 last Sunday the 6th, and I have to say we found the experience disappointing. This was our third stay, and it doesn’t feel like the Shelborne of old or a 5* to be honest. Bar staff left me standing at bar for nearly 5 minutes even though it was really quiet. Bar food was average and over priced. The room we were in was really noisy from 5am with deliveries. I can’t quiet put my finger on it, it just doesn’t feel like the Shelborne experience anymore. What a shame 

",3,2022,11,17
207,Must stay!,"Not only was this hotel historical and beautiful, the staff was exceptionally welcoming.  Erick was our concierge representative who checked us in early, without prompting provided all Marriott Titanium offerings including breakfast daily, and stamped/mailed out postcards to USA for us!  He was so helpful and truly made our 3 night stay at this hotel memorable and lovely.",5,2022,11,16
207,The place to stay in Dublin,Great stay to see IRL v S. Africa rugby match - the IRL team stayed at the Shelbourne so that was a big bonus - nice to mix with the team during the day and see them leave for the stadium. Unfailingly helpful and welcoming staff in every department. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable - especially the bed. Breakfast was ok but doesn't match the overall Shelbourne experience - we have had better quality and variety at lower cost in other nearby hotels.  Overall : expensive but great for a special treat,5,2022,11,08
207,Fantastic,"Amazing interiors, wonderful and super kind staff. Everything works together. We went only for a lunch at their restaurant and the food  was super delicious. The waiters were more than kind and super professional. We definitely will be back.",5,2022,11,02
207,good as always,"stunning hotel in the centre of Dublin. it is our second stay and we really enjoyed it even more. food was very good, especially breakfast and afternoon tea. 
staff were very friendly and super helpful for tips around the city and more. ",5,2022,10,24
207,"Classy, comfortable, wonderful staff","Superb especially because of the staff.  Two details: I asked a cleaner in the lobby for the east to the elevators. You put down her stuff and walked me to them politely. Allessandro, a young waiter in the breakfast area, could not do enough. 
On providing me with amazing brown sourdough toast (recommended), when I told him how delicious it was, he gave me a detailed description of why that was. 
But all the staff were just impeccable. 

Classy, comfortable and beautiful is how I’d describe this hotel, and of course the most significant hotel in dining through its history. 

Highly recommended.",5,2022,10,22
207,Won't be back anytime soon,"Shocking service. The whole room felt like a haunted house!! Cold area, asked for ketchup only on a burger that was done extra dry and made with that horrible poor meat. Chips are a class lower than mc donalds, The shelbourne used to be a place of energy, class and good warm atmospheres! Such a shame.",1,2022,10,16
207,Second Stay as Good as the First,This was our second stay at the Shelbourne and like the first we were not disappointed.  The staff is excellent and the concierge desk is a standout.  The hotel and guest rooms are well appointed and immaculate. We had drinks and ate at two (No. 27 and The Horseshoe) of the three hotels bars.  The hotel is located near many of Dublin's tourist sights making walking an easy option and there is a beautiful walking park directly across the street. There are many other dining options within a short walk from the hotel.  We would not hesitate to stay at The Shelbourne for a third time.,5,2022,10,15
207,Nice hotel but beware of too warm rooms,"We stayed here for two evenings recently using Marriott points.  I am a Platinum for life with Marriott.  I am supposed to get an upgrade with my status.  First let me say that the staff were extremely kind and helpful.  We arrived early and only had to wait an hour for a room.  Unfortunately they put us on the 8th floor.  The room was hot as hell.  The A/C in the room was not pumping out cool air - it just made it hotter.  The view was over the HVAC units and directly into another building across the alley.  Horrible.  It was so uncomfortable we would wake up sweating from the heat.  The upside was the breakfast which was complementary was terrific.  We switched over to the Westin which, so far, is fine (and cool).",3,2022,10,02
207,Rooms lack the grandeur of the superb public areas,"Stunning public spaces, excellent attentive staff and superb location… Rooms not so great for this caliber hotel. The restaurants, pub and lobby are beautifully appointed and well staffed.  And the location cannot be beat, with a beautiful verdant park across the street,  National museums around the corner, and shopping and hundreds of restaurants within walking distance..
The breakfast was excellent in a luxurious restaurant.. 

Now the not as good as expected- The rooms are very nicely decorated but quite small.  Our room overlooked an inner courtyard shaft. The bathroom is minuscule and no counter space.  We were surprised to have the heating not work in our room and the next day the hotel engineer was banging away at it- but he did fix it. There was almost no Wi-Fi reception most of the time in the room so my husband had to go to lobby or business area to work. 

Not what one would expect from such a superbly rated hotel and one that was highly recommended by a leader in the travel industry.",4,2022,10,02
207,Fantastic Hotel,I took the whole family to Ireland this summer. We started and ended our trip in Dublin. This hotel is wonderful. Big clean rooms and bathrooms. Great location for walking the city. Close to great restaurants and pubs! The staff was very welcoming and polite. The Spa was very nice too. Highly recommend this property.,5,2022,10,02
207,Beautiful Urban Retreat,"We stayed here two nights at the end of our Northwest/Northern Ireland road trip to be near the airport and see a bit of Dublin. We stayed using a combination of Marriott points, Amex points and cash to make it a bit more affordable. The property was a luxurious retreat in a busy city. Some notes on the positives - our room was upgraded on arrival and it was very large; the bathroom was a particular highlight, with a soaking tub, separate shower, and toilet closet- nice robes, slippers, and Elemis toiletries. We could control the temperature of the room, and the shades made things completely dark, so we slept very well; despite the urban location, things were quiet at night. The staff responded to requests - a bucket of ice, more towels, etc. - very very quickly, and we were very thankful they were able to get us a last minute booking for the very fabulous afternoon tea. The service at tea, by the way, deserves a special mention for being so attentive and kind. The breakfast selections at the hot and cold buffet was high quality and enjoyable. We did not use the pool, spa, or bar but we stuck our head in and all of them were very nice. Ideal location in the city right on St. Stephen's Green. Why only 4 stars? At this level of hotel, there were some small imperfections. Our first day at breakfast, we were ignored while other tables got service - we had to flag a server for coffee and they left dirty dishes on our table for a very long time. I had to ask for my welcome letter re: Amex benefits - not a big deal, but I felt like an entitled pest, which was uncomfortable. At check out, they said they would email my folio, but they never did, despite us double checking my email address. The rooms could use a bit of an update, and a smart TV would be nice. Also, this hotel does that annoying thing where there is a fridge in the room, but it is entirely filled up by paid minibar items. This is a policy that lots of luxury hotels have, and they should rethink. I felt too shy to ask them to empty it out, but I am sure if I asked they would have done so. Finally, there are few spaces to just ""hang out"" in the hotel - get some work done, chat with your travel partners - that are not paid restaurants and bars. All in all though, these are small complaints. This is a beautiful, restful historic property and I felt very lucky to be able to spend the night.",4,2022,09,25
207,Sublime service at the Shelbourne,The hotel is beautiful. Rooms are spacious. Great location for walking. Lots to do in the surrounding area. But the service: it is supreme! The front desk staff was lovely and  called us as soon as our room was ready. The bellhops let us go back to retrieve something from our checked bags. The front doors man graciously agreed to a “touristy” pic. Emily at the Mayor’s Lounge was able to  put together enough tables to accommodate 11 of us for dinner on a busy Saturday night. We had a lovely time. Would definitely stay here again sometime.,5,2022,09,25
207,Spa treat(ment),"Really enjoyed the massage, pool, and relaxation area.   All very luxurious and relaxing.  The staff were very attentive and ensured we enjoyed our visit.  Such a lovely way to spend a few hours in luxury.",5,2022,09,22
207,Magnificent First Day,"We just arrived from the US and what an entrance the Shelbourne has. Absolutely stunning decor. 

I had booked tea at 14:30 since I wasn’t sure if we would have delays. While our room wasn’t ready, we asked the manager at The Lord Mayor’s Lounge if we could be seated in advance of our reservation. At first she said they were just finishing their first seating and we would need to wait so they could reset the tables. When I mentioned we were waiting for our room to be ready she said she would change a table for us and let us dine sooner. What an amazing experience. The food was wonderful, the choices of teas and coffees was the largest menu I had experienced and we enjoyed several. The aroma from the Irish Whisky Tea was exquisite and the taste was as well. I later saw they are selling cans of it. Will want to buy some before we leave. 

The amount of food was plentiful and yet they allow you to have more of anything. We took two beautiful boxes of leftover desserts with us without needing any seconds. 

After, we took the elevator to our room which, although not having a very nice view across from business offices, is quite lovely.  The bed is comfortable and the furnishings are so handsome. Everywhere I. The hotel there are beautiful paintings, polished brass, shining wood and glistening chandeliers. It really is quite special. 

We hadn’t made any dinner plans since we weren’t sure how we’d feel after our travels. We were asked if we’d like to tour the Saddle Room Restaurant when we stopped to look at menus. Daniel walked us around and told us about the breakfasts and the menus and seating areas. He was such a nice young man. We looked at the menus and then asked the gentleman up front for any possible availability that evening, an hour from asking. (20:00) He said he could accommodate and so we went for an hour walk around the area and it is so conveniently close to all kinds of restaurants and shops. 

Upon returning we were seated in Paul’s section. He was a wonderful and helpful young man. We had a half dozen oysters and  Kells Lamb. Delicious!  Dessert too!  But along with all of the great service and food, Daniel came back and gave us a few more treats thanking us for being so kind. (We had told him had we known he was a server we would have asked for him.. he sold us on dining there)

Anyway, all this to say, ar 22:41, we have just finished our first day in Dublin and my husband is snoring contentedly beside me.",5,2022,09,21
207,Great Way to Start our Trip,"The Shelbourne was our introduction to Ireland, and it did not disappoint. The staff was very welcoming, from the doorman to the concierge to the reception desk to the food and beverage professionals.

We had a deluxe King room, I believe, and it was charming and comfortable, as was the lovely bathroom.

The hotel's location, across from St. Stephan's Green Park, was perfect. My husband took a long early morning walk and later we all walked to nearby Trinity College and the shopping district. We were also within walking distance to many restaurants. And the ""hop on-hop off"" bus stops right across the street.

We had an over-the-top afternoon tea experience at the hotel (reservations required) that I highly recommend. The service and decor was impeccable. Best of all, whatever you can't finish eating is sent home in a gorgeous ""doggie bag.""

We also loved the 1824 Bar on the second floor. Stunning.

We highly recommend The Shelbourne for all the reasons listed above.",5,2022,09,15
207,A lovely stay and a delightful afternoon tea,"I had the privilege of staying at the Shelbourne recently for two nights with my girlfriend.  The property is lovely - the room, while not huge, was both very comfortable and well furnished, and the property itself is both extremely centrally located (directly across from St Stephen's Green) and has some wonderful amenities - most notably the spa (including a lap pool) and health club.  However, the highlight of our stay was most certainly the afternoon tea at the Lord Mayor's Lounge.  Maria and her team - especially Jiovanna (sp?) were able to accommodate us at the last minute for a pre-birthday treat for my girlfriend, and they could not have made the moment more special - from the champagne, to the beautiful tower of delicious treats (note - come with an appetite), and of course the varied menu of teas.  The service was especially standout - Maria and Jiovanna were both extremely warm and attentive, ensuring that we were well taken care of.  Maria also took the time to tell us about the history of the hotel, the Lord Mayor's Lounge, and afternoon tea at the lounge.  She also took us to see the Constitution Suite in the hotel, where the Irish constitution was signed over 100 years ago!  Overall it made for a delicious and memorable afternoon, and we can't wait to return!",5,2022,09,10
207,Unexpected courtesy and service!,"Exceptional customer service!
We had a one night stay booked here because our flight was scheduled to arrive at 8:30pm, before going to visit family in Gorey for the weekend. Our flight was delayed by almost 2 hours, so it was about 11pm by the time we checked in and we were tired. Trying to charge our phones using a universal adapter wouldn’t work, so we assumed that the outlet was faulty. Colin, the night manager promptly came to assist us, but after trying a number of things for over 30 minutes, it turned out that actually our adapter was faulty and to blame and he then provided us with a working adapter which solved the problem. Regardless, because of our issue and the time it took to resolve it, he offered us an upgraded room and a couple of complimentary drinks to boot. Our stay was delightful, the staff amazing and the food delicious!",5,2022,09,05
207,Afternoon Tea,"Had an amazing experience of visiting Afternoon Tea in Lord Mayor’s Lounge with my family. We were warmly welcomed by Maria Spinenco and shown to our table who throughout the whole experience made sure we were enjoying all. 
Anna took great care of explaining the menu and how the whole experience would be. 
The atmosphere, service and the food was absolutely amazing 10/10. The cups of tea were always filled up to the top and I really enjoyed trying the summer limited edition teas from the menu. As a desserts lover they were unbelievably mouthwatering.
When the whole experience was coming to an end Imelda kindly made sure we were all happy and if we wanted to try another tea before we were leaving. 
Definitely would recommend visiting Lord Mayors Lounge for Afternoon Tea. Best Afternoon Tea to date! Would definitely be coming back very soon.",5,2022,08,24
207,Not impressed,"Stayed for 3 nights first stop after arriving in Ireland.
Great location but we would never stay here again.   

Check in:  the person checking us in was surprisingly very unpleasant almost made us feel bad we were checking into the hotel.  After a long flight was not very welcoming.  

Room: beware rooms have huge sloping floors.   The hallways slope and very low ceilings and floors creak. Very claustrophobic.   We were told half of the rooms are like this in the hotel.

Fitness center - located next door at the spa.   Small and very bad layout.   If more then one person working out can not move around the gym.  Very strong clorine smell from the pool

Dining:Main bar was great!  Staff was very friendly.  Very fun vibe for a pre dinner or late night drink. 

Breakfast :  Get there early as small buffet area gets very crowded.

Late night dinner at the residence lounge was pretty horrible.  Staff not very attentive and got our messed up on all dishes.",1,2022,08,22
207,Service after check out!,"Our luggage was delayed at the airport for days.  Our suitcases were delivered over multiple days after we left The Shelbourne,  The staff contacted us and helped forward our wayward luggage to our new location.  Outstanding!  We were so pleased they were willing to help.",5,2022,08,15
207,Very good but update needed,"The Shelbourne definitely deserves its 5 stars. The staff is very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Plenty of restaurants to get food and drinks. Breakfast in the Saddle room is very good.
We had a Premium Heritage room and I thought it was a little small. They say 30m so they must count the large bathroom. The carpet was badly stained and the walls could use some touching up.   
I understand it’s an old building but our dresser was not level and you can hear guests above you walking around. 
The TV selection is poor in that you cannot stream anything and movie selections are horrible. Also there is no outdoor space to sit and read, you would have to purchase a drink to sit there.
Location is very good if you want city center.",5,2022,08,08
207,One of the best Hotels in Dublin and very central .,"Wonderful traditional hotel , elegant and supremely comfortable . Excellent service always  with a smile !
Super breakfast , even when you are late they find you something to eat ! 
Very good quality fine dinning and great bar ! Car parking service and bell boy help with our luggage again , all with a friendly chat and a ready smile .",5,2022,07,28
207,Lovely Upscale Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,Loved this hotel.  The rooms are beautifully appointed (although small).  The staff was very accommodating and the quality of food in the restaurant and bar was outstanding.  Could not have asked for a better experience for our first trip to Dublin.  This is the place to stay if you are looking for luxury and convenience.,5,2022,07,27
207,Wonderful place and excellent service,"Stayed 3 nights at the heart of Dublin. Enjoyed the park right in  front of the hotel.
Excellent hotel service and amenities. People is so friendly, highly recommended the venue. Historic building with modern amenities.",5,2022,07,24
207,Great Service and a Great Room,"The Shelbourne, Autograph Collection met every expectation we had for a one night stay on our last night in Ireland.  From the moment you arrive, to the moment you leave, you are very well taken care of by a fantastic group of people.

The balcony room we had was very nice and well appointed.  The bed was comfortable and the area where the hotel is located is very nice.  We had a great stay would happily stay here again.",5,2022,07,18
207,Very disappointed,"For $850 Australia Dollars a night I didn’t see the value.  The room was small, the bathroom tiny and old.  My view was a solid brick wall of the next building.  No view at all!  The supplies left in the bathroom were very minimal.",2,2022,07,12
207,What a great stay ,"Stunning as always. Staff are amazing here. I come here for business but also as a treat for myself. Thanks to everyone. From front office, nights, kitchen staff. F&B staff. And also housekeeping staff. Well done 👍. I will dedi be back again.",5,2022,07,06
207,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location, comfortable and pleasant","Very comfortable bed and bathroom amenities. Loved the cookies with tea and extra water in the room. Across the street from a lovely park to stroll through. Also very close to Grafton street, Trinity college, Temple Bar, etc., easy to get around. Great neighborhood pubs around the corner. Breakfasts were great! Staff were very nice.",5,2022,06,28
207,A historical stay,"We have had the pleasure of getting married at The Shelbourne Jan'21  when we could just have 6 at a wedding.. The Shelbourne staff made it a stay to remember during such trying times. Totally covid compliant. We decided to change our wedding plans from being abroad to having our anniversary party 1 year later at The Adam & Deirdre Suite with close family and friends. We had a fantastic time.

The food was as always outstanding. We have stayed in regular suites, The Eamon De Velera Suite and also the Micheal Collins suite. My fave being The Micheal Collins Suite but all are fabulous. 

We had the pleasure of having many a meal at all the dining areas. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner.. All exceptional. 

Thank you for always carrying out the best service. 

Shannon & Niall Whelan",5,2022,06,23
207,Nice comfortable and welcoming hotel,Nice room and hotel is centrally located and minutes from shopping and Grafton. Best hotel breakfast with lots of options. Front desk staff friendly and nice couple of bars to choose from Rates were bit higher and preferred when they were not Marriott/Bonvoy property. But still charming hotel.,4,2022,06,20
207,Coffee in the city,"Visited the city centre last Sunday and had a walk around. Stopped into The Shelbourne for a coffee on the way back to the car. Always a pleasure to call in and visit. They have a lovely interesting little museum there too, it’s free and worth a visit.",5,2022,06,20
207,City Hotel,"We had heard rave reviews from people about the hotel.  Located in the city across the street from the park, near restaurants, and down the block from the shopping area of Grafton Street the location was prime. 

Our room was quite nice with a separate sitting room to relax in. A room key card was needed to access the elevator and that provided another layer of security. 

The shower was very good though it did leak into the bathroom area. We were given macaroons to enjoy and there was a coffee maker. 

At three o’clock each day the fire alarm was tested. Doors in the hallways closed automatically. 

Trying to get into the Saddle Room for lunch or dinner without a reservation was impossible. Luckily there was a bar area to the left of the entrance. 

Overall we found the hotel to be a typical city hotel. People were busy and not overly friendly.",3,2022,06,16
207,The ultimate classic Dublin hotel,"Welcomed by Ethan on front desk - nice and friendly and professional check in. Room was ready early which was a nice surprise. No view from room but that was OK, we planned on making use of the great location more than staying in our room.  Nice pool and gym area. Was helped by another Ethan at the pool! Great job. Love the history of this hotel.. passed the constitution room being set up for an event and the event planners let us sneak a little look. Overall a lovely stay at The Shelbourne.",5,2022,06,16
207,Lost some of the polish...,"Anticipated a lot, the Shelbourne, Dublin. Great welcome,  valet took the car and fast checkin process. 

Wanted a pre dinner drink in the famous residents bar but we were shown to a small external area with electric heaters and fake grass. Decided to leave. Crazy.,. Room was a good size, nicely decorated. Only issue was bathroom was v v old, the shower head was wall fixed and hit my chest, not a rain style head. Couldnt be moved, quite frustrating for a 5 star hotel. 

When we returned from dinner we decided we'd head for a night cap - we were told the bar was full! No night cap for us, shame when you're a resident!

Breakfast was great, lovely setting, the Saddle Room.  Staff were amazing, a real treat. Valet team very efficient on departure which is great.",3,2022,06,16
207,Delicious lunch,"Had a lovely lunch as a treat in the saddle room. Food was amazing, staff were so nice and the value for the 2/3 courses was great.  Unless you're a connoisseur of Ballygowan I'd ask for tap water. We weren't expecting €16 for a few glasses of still. I guess that was the luxury part of our meal. Apart from that everything was superb.",4,2022,06,15
207,Excellent location and superior service ,Excellent experience staying at this hotel. The building is in central Dublin at the historic core and next to St Stephen's Green. Local tram and bus transportation at the door or nearby. The staff is fantastic.  Special thanks to Patrick at the front desk and Alan the concierge who answered all our questions and ensured our stay was enjoyable ,5,2022,06,12
207,EXCELLENT,"Visited once again , had dinner and drinks in Bar 27. Served by Cian who was really lovely and very knowledgeable about the wine selection. Food was very good with excellent service    .Great atmosphere in a stylish environment .
We will be back.",5,2022,06,06
207,Disappointed,"We recently stayed The Shelbourne and I will start with the positives.  We checked in 3 hours early and a room was ready for us.  The rooms were cleaned well and in a timely manner.  Unfortunately there were a couple of issues with our stay.  Firstly the mini bar is fully stocked and there is no room to add your own items (I needed to store some oat milk) so I called guest services which promptly removed the items as requested. The following day, the mini bar had been restocked leaving my milk behind the chargeable items, so again I had to call guest services to have them removed.  After two nights stay, I awoke and went to put my make-up on to head out for the day but it was nowhere to be found in the room despite checking  the whole room 3 times over.  Apart from us, the only other time the room was accessed was for cleaning and turn down service the day before.  My make-up was still in the ziplock bag from the airport and left on the side in the hotel room. I only ever take 2 items out with me as my bag is very small.  I called guest services twice who said they had checked with the staff, who hadn’t seen it.  The issue here is, the staff must clean/turn down dozens of rooms a day, or if my bag had been thrown away by mistake, the cleaner would assume they are throwing away rubbish so of course would say they hadn’t seen my makeup. The result was that nothing was done and I had to order it all again online to the tune of 120GBP.  Luckily I had removed my asthma pumps from the ziplock",2,2022,06,06
207,Top Class Stay,"From the time we arrived everything was excellent. Our room wasn’t ready but we were quickly provided an alternative one by Patrick, who was most helpful. The room was beautiful. The beds are heaven. Breakfast was outstanding and the Saddle Room is stunning. Cannot wait to return.",5,2022,06,05
207,Stunning,Had some of the best stay in years. Hotel is well located and well maintained. Rooms are nice especially for the bathrooms. Hotel is overall amazing. We loved the lovely smell and the very professional staff.,5,2022,06,05
207,Alex was brillant,"Had birthday drinks in the no.27 bar and was looked after by Alex, an absolutely fantastic evening and will definitely be back because of our fantastic service from Alex, a true professional and made our evening very special",5,2022,06,03
207,"Disappointing, with lack lustre service","For €958 per night this hotel wasn’t even close to being up to scratch…
At this nightly rate I would expect service standard to be impeccable, but it was sorely lacking and very basic. As an example we had an issue with the tv (from what I understand the tv system is in desperate need of an upgrade yet the hotel is holding back on spending money on this) and instead of the hotel management trying to find a solution, I was told that there was nothing they could do. Only when I complained did they spend time trying to sort it…finally sending up an Apple TV system 3 hours later. I would expect at this price point, the management would be two steps ahead, but instead it felt like I had to drag them to the solution.",3,2022,06,03
207,"Uff, not a Marriott 5* Standard","I am Marriott Titanium and a Marriott / SPG member for 10+ years and have stayed in the finest Marriott properties. So I know what great and luxury service is. This place is just obnoxious, and nothing to it when compared to international luxury standards. 

E.g ordered drinks with service staff, was asked to pay immediately or leave a card behind.
They don’t trust guests to pay for their drinks later, but I should just trust them with my credit card? Desperate!

JP, when you walk around your hotel, take a minute to greet guests please, that’s what I expect of a GM.",1,2022,05,26
207,Anniversary Visit,"I visited the No. 27 bar with my husband for our anniversary this year. Staff were beyond lovely and even brought us a lovely plate with treats on it to help us celebrate. The staff were so attentive and checked in on us regularly to make sure we were okay - I was recommended a Shelbourne Bramble which has become my favourite cocktail! 

I would highly recommend the bar for both food and drinks. My husband and I will most certainly be back and would like to pass on our thanks to the staff for looking after us so well.",5,2022,05,24
207,Celebration ruined,"Very obnoxious place, so disappointed with our visit. Pretentious and staff trained in an unpleasant manner. We will not be returning. We had chosen to toast an upcoming wedding with some champagne there, spent a crazy amount on two bottles only to be treated with disrespect.",1,2022,05,22
207,Beautiful bar,"Stopped by for a few cocktails before our dinner. Stunning ! Bar tenders are very talented. Menu is with lot of choices and well executed. We had a great time. 

Thank you and we will be back to experience it again",5,2022,05,22
207,Best of the Best,"We had such an excellent reception, from the minute you step at the door. Everyone was fabulous, starting with Val Cameron, thank you so much. Greg, you are amazing. The breakfast team are absolutely wonderful, They are the most friendly I have seen in a hotel, Ana, Vanessa, Antoine, Paul, just to mention, but a few. 
Overall, we had an amazing experience. Thank you",5,2022,05,04
207,Almost perfect,"The public areas of the Shelbourne Hotel really have the wow factor, everything is so stunning. The location is perfect for anywhere in Dublin city. Really the best thing in the hotel are the staff, without exception everyone we met was just fantastic, really on the ball ensuring everyone was well looked after. 
Breakfast was amazing, one of the nicest I have ever had. 
The only negative was the actual bedroom which was awful. Tiny bedroom, tiny bathroom, shabby furniture and a horrendous smell in the room that seemed to be coming from a drain. We only stayed 1 night so didn’t make an issue of it but it was pretty bad. This room type is flagged on their website as a ‘small room’ so choose a different room type if at all possible.",4,2022,05,02
207,Best in Dublin!,We were part of a large group that began wedding festivities in Dublin before leaving for the countryside. The staff at The Shelbourne are top notch...Irish hospitality at its best!! The beds were extremely comfortable. The common areas are stunning. The breakfast was delicious. No request was too difficult.  We had a wonderful welcome dinner in the St.Stephen suite with outstanding service and food. There is no better place to stay. It was so convenient to walk to Grafton or St. Stephens green or the national gallery.,5,2022,04,24
207,First class Irish hospitality and service,"What a fabulous hotel The Shelbourne is and now rates as one of my all time favourites.

From the minute you are greeted at the door you know you are in for a treat.

The pros

Every single member of staff we met was warm, welcoming, friendly and super helpful.

The rooms are super comfy, spacious and clean.

You have to sample the afternoon tea! I've had a few over the years but this was the best by a country mile and our server was amazing, very attentive and friendly.

Really close to the city centre.

We ate both breakfast and dinner in the hotel, the food is out of this world, tasty, hot and always well presented.

The cons

None, not one!

Thank you to everyone at The Shelbourne, you made our break special! We'll be back.",5,2022,04,19
207,Fantastic afternoon tea,What a lovely experience afternoon tea at the shelbourne is ! Fabulous food and service was impeccable- highly recommended. Imelda is a joy and the ambience in the room is wonderful - nothing is too much trouble - perfect for a special occasion. Treat yourself !,5,2022,04,15
207,Excellent experience at Saddles Restaurant in The Shelbourne,"My wife and I experienced an excellent lunch. 

All staff we spoke to were welcoming and attentive.
The ambience was grand, as expected of a renowned hotel. 
The 3 course lunch was superb. 
We will return when in Dublin.",5,2022,04,06
207,Mothers Day Visit,"Me and my mother stayed for mothers day, I accidentally booked a King room but the helpful Adam on the front desk despite my mistake found a twin room for us and even gave us a complimentary upgrade to a room with a fantastic view overlooking Stephens green, He was welcoming and friendly and truly made us feel at home, making mothers day extra special for my mother,

The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the room was immaculately clean,

The breakfast was delicious the next morning with the friendliest staff,

I can't wait to stay again in the near future, Thank you very much to the Shelbourne team!",5,2022,03,29
207,Fantastic service,"I was in on Sunday just passed and was having a good day out, but it was made even better by the service we received from Luke and Bradley on the bar. Lads were excellent, knowledgeable, and professional. Kept everyone at the bar well stocked and they were more than helpful to give some insight and suggestions for great drinks. Lads are a credit to the staff.",5,2022,03,08
207,Underwhelming  stay and a catalogue of things they could do better.,"I really had high hopes for this hotel as it came highly recommended, but sadly very underwhelmed.There were a number of things which didn’t make my experience a great one. 
Before I start, the biggest disappointment among other things was the food; especially the indoor dining. The selection was very poor (soup / salad / sandwich or burger!) There was no diversity offered in the in room dining service. 

Restaurant were quite ‘samey’ and often times had dress codes which isn’t something convenient when you are travelling with work. They didn’t make ordering in room dining easy at all for the customer as they had their menus in the TV.  For someone who isn’t technologically savvy, this would have found it terribly frustrating and daunting. I get that this might have a more environmentally friendly way of offering room dining but the experience was cumbersome, selection was poor and I didn’t even bother after many failed attempts. 

Other things that frustrated me: 

1. The room they put me in was TINY, it smelt very musty, decor very dated (I get they want to go with a heritage feel but it was more like an retirement home feel)

2. The sink area in the bathroom was so small you couldn’t properly brush your teeth or wash your face without having water getting everywhere. There was literally no countertop room.

3. The kettle was not emptied properly and had water left from the previous guest

4. Lightbulbs were flickering 

5. I asked to be moved to a different room as i was staying int he hotel for 5 nights so to their credit, they put me into different room which thankfully was much bigger but it was a twin room with two beds - there was just one of me. When I asked  for a double bed they said I can either go back to the tiny room with a big bed or stay in the big room with small two beds, or pay extra €50 per night to get a double bed in a bigger room - not a great experiences

6.  Staff were not very attentive - for example I asked for a coffee mug because the cups they offered in the room were so fine the coffee bags didn’t fit. They said they need 45 mins to go and find a coffee cup to send up to my room - and it never arrived. 

All these experiences combined I found it quite an underwhelming stay. This is such a shame as I really wanted to like this experience at the Shelbourne, but I think I might try a different hotel.  next time.",2,2022,03,04
207,Lovely,"Utterly brilliant hotel, compliments run out when staying here.
Food excellent.
Variety of drinks amazing.
Staff, very friendly and attentive.
Been home three days and already thinking of dates for the next trip.
Expensive yes, well worth the bill, definitely🤓",5,2022,02,20
207,Amazing stay,"I stayed at the hotel on 12t Feb, from the moment we pulled the car in the staff could not do enough for us. The hotel is so lovely and everyone was very helpful. 

My only issues were I feel like the breakfast room would be better located to the front of the hotel where is is bright and the room did nothing have a great view.

But I would highly recommend The Shelbourne. 

I will definitely return.",5,2022,02,17
207,Perfect city hotel,"Great hotel for service, as a lone female traveller I felt welcome and safe. Patrick on reception was always so helpful and the rooms and hotel in general were beautiful. Central  and perfect for exploring Dublin",5,2022,02,12
207,Fantastic Hotel ,"Stayed in the Shelbourne last weekend. We had a lovely stay. The room was Extremely clean, quiet and luxurious with everything you could ask for. 
I planned to ask my partner to marry me in the Lord Mayors lounge of the hotel. The staff were so helpful with all the planning. They literally couldn’t do enough for us. The best part of the hotel is definitely the staff. 
The food in the hotel is exceptional. My partner is a coeliac and they were able to cater for everything including a delicious afternoon tea and gluten free breakfast. 
Small touches like the curtains being drawn, bed remade and chocolates on our pillows on returning in the evening was lovely. Topped up on bottled water also. 
Over all, this was the most special weekend away we ever had. Thanks a million to all the staff for everything. It wasn’t easy being the six nations weekend and being so busy but you made it an amazing weekend for us. 
Thanks a million. ",5,2022,02,09
207,Top choice for Dublin city center.,"The Shelbourne is a perfect choice for Dublin. The property is well-situated in the heart of the city. The accommodations are appropriate for a high end hotel. The staff is well-trained. The dining options are excellent. 

This was my first trip to Dublin. I looked at the various top rated hotels and went with the Shelbourne. I am glad I did. I had a chance to see most of the others during my stay. There are other good hotels but I think this is the top based on accommodations and location. 

The building is historic and beautiful. A historic building, of course, has a few trade-offs. The gym and spa are wedged into the basement. However, they are well equipped. The pool is small but nice. There is a spotless sauna and steam room. 

Dining offers great options. The on-site restaurants are outstanding. They also seem to attract a who’s-who crowd. The afternoon tea is worth the price. 

If you need to give someone a special day: a spa appointment, afternoon tea, and a nice dinner will do the trick. 

The housekeeping service is well done. Towel, sheets, etc., are of high quality. 

Valet parking was prompt and polite. 

Museums and other attractions are within walking distance. There is a large urban park across the street.

The hotel is in Marriott’s Autograph collection. This is definitely at the high end of those properties.",5,2022,01,29
207,Simply the best,"Arguably the best hotel in Dublin. Superb from start to end. From doormen, concierge, reception, housekeeping and spa team. Excellent restaurant and epic breakfast. Pool good. 
Iconic building with massive history. Would have loved to see an exhibit or something on the history. 
Would we go back- in a heartbeat.",5,2022,01,23
207,This is a fine hotel !,"We had a layover of 20 hours between a flight from Barcelona and a flight to Chicago on Aer Lingus. Staying at an airport hotel was never considered as we hadn't been in the city of Dublin together before.

I checked TripAdvisor to see the hotel offerings while she checked her Marriott Membership on the off-chance they'd have a hotel there. I found the Shelbourne at the same time she was booking it. Great minds think alike. Classic hotels are our Jam.  Modern, hip and trendy are instant turnoffs. It had great ratings and a long history of excellence.

We rolled up in a taxi and were greeted on the sidewalk by Bell Men and our luggage taken inside to reception. Smiling faces there and we soon had our room keys. At no time during our brief stay did we have an issue that the staff had to deal with. All were professional and friendly but had no need to go ""above and beyond"". It was a well-oiled machine.

We like a quiet room so being at the back of the hotel with an uninspiring view was not an issue. The room was spacious, very clean and well appointed. Elegant furnishings that spoke of 5 Stars.

The bathroom was large with enclosed shower and separate tub. Fluffy white towels. No reason to complain whatsoever.  First class.

The room was for sleeping in, the bathroom for bathing so most of our time was spent out of the room enjoying the location, right on beautiful St Stephen's Green.

Our timing wasn't right for having Afternoon Tea in the elegant Lord Mayor's Lounge, alas. A beautiful room harking to days gone by. Very stylish.

We had a very fine bar-food dinner in Number 27, a beautiful bar on the ground floor. Great food and service (seperate review). There are a few restaurants and pubs within a 2 minute walk from the front door also. Buses stop just outside the hotel and are frequent. 

After a great feed, some perfect  pints of Guinness and an Irish coffee it was time for the heads to hit the pillows in a very comfortable bed. In the quiet we soon fell blissfully asleep.

In the morning, prior to checkout we ate breakfast (not complimentary) in the Saddle Room restaurant. Basic food, not noteworthy for the price alas. A small assortment of a la carte dishes to choose from and a tiny hot buffet. Room for improvement and a chance to further dazzle there.

 We had less than a day to enjoy this fine hotel. A week would be nice.
We'll return to Dublin for a longer stay and we'll book into the Shelboune again!",5,2022,01,19
207,Wonderful stay !,"Our 5th stay in this hotel but our first with our 9 yr old son. From the parking valet, reception housekeeping, lounge and restaurant we compliment the lovely friendly efficient and professional staff! We would like to give special mention to Derek our breakfast host. He took time to give us great guidance and treated our son with respect and kindness. We try our best to instil these attributes in him and are so appreciative of the attention he gave him.I understand the head chef offered our son (9yr old)a job but he doesn’t feel quite ready as yet! 😂… although he rated the food 10/10 especially the salmon/lemon recommended by Derek! The hotel is spotless and just a wonderful experience.
Thank you all.",5,2022,01,12
207,Warm - Friendly - 5 Star - Superb Christmas Break in The Old Dame of Dublin,"From the moment we entered the lobby of The Shelbourne Hotel on Christmas Eve it was obvious that this would be a special experience. The Christmas Decorations and the magnificent regal vibe coupled with an amazing welcome from every member of staff signaled a very enjoyable stay. The Room was impressive with everything one would expect in a 5 star but the little personal touches made every guest feel special. We dined each night in the hotel and no fault could be found, excellent food, excellent service and in these covid times it was good to see how the hotel made all feel safe.  This type of experience only happens when Management and The Team combine to ensure superb service at every level and that is what happened - Well Done to All. We will be back.",5,2021,12,27
207,2 night break,I had 2 nights in this hotel  this week .Loved it . Room was amazing . pool and gym brilliant and easy and restaurant was superb  I think I was in the pool 5 times over 2 days . Location the best in Dublin - 5 stars all round .,5,2021,12,19
207,Beautiful,"We were served by the lovely Angelica for Tea. 
Food and Teas were fabulous. 
Such a nice and relaxing vibe. The piano music was lovely. 
Was surprised with a birthday plate. 
Over all our visit for my birthday was a 10/10 will definitely be back in the new year.",5,2021,12,12
207,Amazing stay for my friend's 30th,"Booked online easily with amazing price.  Went for my friend 30th and staff wished her a happy birthday both at check in and check out (so nice).

A week before travel got an email from Shelbourne asking if anything was needed and our arrival time which was a nice touch.  Arrived on time and had valet parking which was professionally done.

Check in was lovely.  Had to book breakfast due to social distancing which was fine.  Staff at check in friendly and informative.  Room was lovely with good toiletries provided and definitely up to five start standard.

Had drinks each night in the bars with really good bar staff.  Tasty cocktails as well.  prices were good for Dublin.  Breakfast each morning had a larger selection than expected with both a buffet and a menu.

Location is so handy for so many things.  Had an amazing stay.  They also left a treat in the room for my friends birthday and a card which was a cute touch.

Would love to go back again soon.",5,2021,12,06
207,Amazing visit to Shelbourne Hotel,What a warm friendly atmosphere from the time we entered the hotel.  Check in perfect.  We had a fantastic room.  We had dinner in No 27 bar and food was amazing.  It was such a relaxing setting with absolutely best of service.  We had drinks in 1824 bar again a beautiful bar.  My son came to visit us and had a drink here with us.  Such a special time to spend with family.  Used swimming pool which is easy to access.  Breakfast next morning was wow and chatted to Derek who spent time with each customer.  I received this visit as a birthday gift but I will definitely be making it a yearly visit from now on.  Thanks to everyone for making it such a lovely visit.,5,2021,12,06
207,Fabulous ,"Since watching the TV programme about the Shelbourne years ago I have always wanted to find the opportunity to stay. It was just as great as I hoped. Super clean, friendly staff, amazing cocktails and a great breakfast. 
I was a tiny bit surprised to see people wearing nikes and hiking boots in the residents bar as I was expecting a dress code but I suppose times have changed. ",5,2021,12,01
207,Such a thrill to stay at this historic and beautiful inn,"When planning our trip to Ireland, we knew we had to stay at The Shelbourne. While our expectations were high, nothing prepared us for the excellent care that we received. An early morning arrival from the US had us hoping to check our rental with valet and then begin touring the sites. The hotel checked us in early, we got breakfast delivered to the room, and we got freshened up in our very accommodating space. The location was ideal, with the park just across the street, and the valet team was prompt and friendly time and again as we took advantage of all that Dublin had to offer. The welcome and departure team at the desk took prestigious care in offering up suggestions to us, and efficiently handling our business at the hotel. We look forward to many repeat visits to The Shelbourne.",5,2021,11,23
207,Go for cocktails,"I rated 4 out of 5 for the Terrace and to be honest the food was 2/5 but everything else was 5/5. Great setting, service, cocktails etc. Pity the food was not up to standard. Avoid the beef dish!!!! Maybe just go for cocktails and atmosphere and you won’t be disappointed",4,2021,11,08
207,"Perfect stay, one minor niggle","This is one of the big three high end hotels in Dublin - The Westbury, Westin and Shelbourne. The standards of service for all are extremely high end. 

We stayed at this one for a week in late October, aside from a 5am fire alarm and a lacklustre way of dealing with it at checkout it was a perfect stay, the staff were friendly and professional throughout.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it",5,2021,11,02
207,The place to stay in Central Dublin,"Lovely classic hotel in the heart of Dublin.
Arrival easy with attentive door staff & pleasant receptionist, who conveyed info about Hotel. They were helpful throughout stay.
Room well designed, comfortable & excellent cleanliness. Mini bar fridge not working so room service waiter said to just call them for anything needed.
Concierge knowledgable but need to send text confirms vs. letter sent to the room
Breakfast service very good. Not used to having to reserve a seat in bar but hopefully that is unnecessary after COVID.",5,2021,11,01
207,Dinner,Such a bad experience.  Have stayed a number of times pre covid and loved the experience. However we went for dinner 22nd October. On arrival at Bar we were left waiting for at least 5 minutes while girl checked availability.  The bar was almost empty!! The loud background 90s music was like being at a disco. Horrific. There were small tables with tablecloths for guests to sit and have a drink.  So much for eco saving. The cloths were changed after each table was vacated and obviously washed. The Shelbourne has lost its old world charm which we love.  Dinner in the Saddle Room was just average. At least the background music was subtle and relaxing. We wont be returning.  There is a 5star hotel across the road which has retained its high standards and luxury. Will go there instead.,1,2021,10,23
207,REALLY LOVELY,"Had dinner last week in Saddle room and drinks in the 27 bar beforehand.
Cian our server in the bar was excellent as were all the staff in the restaurant.
Lovely atmosphere in both bar and restaurant.
higly recommend.",5,2021,10,19
207,Want to be pampered?,"Absolutely the best hotel in Dublin. Across the street from St. Stephens Green and a short walk to Grafton Street. Staff is great, service impeccable, lodging unbelievably comfortable, food delicious. The hotel is an historical property with modern touch. High tea twice daily, bar food that is delicious, great restaurant, wonderful breakfast buffet or ala carte",5,2021,10,18
207,Disappointing,"I booked this because I felt this hotel really was the ultimate treat for my Mother’s birthday. 
I’ve never written a review here before but I am disappointed. 

When we arrived and checked in, I was surprised to see they took a refundable €50 deposit from my bank account rather than just hold my card details.

Arrived to the room and there were no biscuits to go with a coffee. Had to ring reception as we were not provided any information about the hotel on check in. 

The pool and changing rooms were way below standard. 

1827 bar is gorgeous and shoutout to Bradley and Darragh who provided excellent service. Aside from the pool, the hotel is unbelievably clean. 

We did have a lovely time and it’s a perfect location but it doesn’t have the 5 star quality I was expecting.",3,2021,10,11
207,25th Wedding Anniversary,"Spent 4 nights at the Shelbourne as part of our Euro tour and 25th wedding anniversary.  This by any measure is a world class hotel.  The level of customer service and amenities is amazing.  Front desk, porters, fitness center staff and dining staff all were top notch!!!!  I wouldn't expect an ultra modern room but is was very comfortable (and larger than I expected) and appropriate for the image of what they are trying to maintain.  Truly a remarkable experience and a great start to our trip.  Location is also perfect to city attractions.Outstanding job Shelbourne to staff (Patrick, Danny and Adam)!!!",5,2021,10,09
207,For an aristocratic hotel the client is randomly… King!,"What better surprise to your life partner than to celebrate the 41st wedding anniversary at the Shelbourne in Dublin together with your best friends? The procedure is simple: you book a room providing all personal details, documents and card. Then you ask for two tables for eight guests: separated but one next to the other, observing the regular distance (COVID obliges!) “No, Sir, we cannot guarantee two tables one next to the other!” “Scuse me, why?!” “Because…” Two calls and an e-mail couldn’t solve this extremely difficult challenge for the management. I gave up! 
We arrive in Dublin but, for some reason, my wife arrives at the hotel some 90 minutes before me: she has the passports but the card is with me… The fact that the hotel is in possession of my card coordinates and it is fully entitled to debit it unilaterally is ignored. She doesn’t get access in the room: she sits on a coach and she is not even asked if she needs some water… A coffee or a tea seems to have been inconceivable!
Ok! Finally I arrive. I get the key and we go up, not before watching the luggage waiting patiently in a lobby corner. “We’ll send it in your room in a couple of minutes.”
Thirty minutes later I come down and take my luggage from where I saw it before…
“May I help you, Sir?” asks me a porter from the height of his parade uniform. “ No, you can’t!”
Before leaving for the restaurant which could arrange the two tables as required, we go to the bar to get a drink. We are lucky enough to find the opposite face of the staff: two young girls served us so professionally  that I couldn’t not to tell them my earlier experience. “Would you like to speak to a manager?” “Why not?” The manager arrives and show the full flexibility required by such a position in a reputable institution. He is Greek and his name is Spiros. He apologized and sent us a plate with few candies and a touching greeting in chocolate written! Later in the room, we found a bottle of champagne and a nice written message!
Maybe I’ll come back for the 42nd wedding anniversary Spiros, if you’ll still be there!",5,2021,10,07
207,"Beautiful public areas, dated rooms","The Shelbourne is a grande dame of a hotel — historic, ornate, a little tired. 

I loved the public areas, which were well-maintained and beautiful. My room, on the other hand, was dated and worn. The bed was rock hard and uncomfortable; the furniture was too old to be nice and too new to be classic, the carpet was well-loved. I did like the bathroom — perhaps it had been more recently renovated. It was spacious, classic, and in mostly good condition (the flush system on the toilet only partially worked). 

We had breakfast in the Saddle Room a couple times — it was really good but quite expensive. 

The location of the hotel made it easy to walk most everywhere in Dublin. 

The staff were really helpful and friendly — excellent service all around. 

All in all, a nice experience but one I wouldn’t pay for again.",4,2021,10,06
207,Perfect!,"A beautiful Georgian hotel with impeccable service and luxury rooms! Located in the centre with an abundance of bars and restaurants along with the beautiful park to stroll through in the morning. Rooms even the basic have a touch of luxury, tastefully decorated with Elemis toiletries. Business week here made it more relaxing! Definitely the one to book again and again!",5,2021,10,05
207,Birthday Treat,"What can I say we had the best couple of nights away in the Shelbourne. We were so well looked after, it was my wife's birthday and she was so well treated. The food was amazing and the service from the staff was excellent. A special mention to Roberto from the front desk, Veronika and Layndea ( hope I got the spelling right ) in the No. 27 Bar and all the breakfast staff were excellent. Thanks again for everything. See ye all soon.",5,2021,09,30
207,"Beautiful hotel, great food and great staff but not happy with additional charges post reservation","My wife and I stayed in the Shelbourne hotel last Friday night as an anniversary treat. The hotel is charming and beautiful, the room was comfortable, the meal in the Saddle Room was delicious and all of the staff were courteous and helpful. However we were disappointed with being told of additional charges when checking in. Our hotel reservation was booked and paid for on the hotel’s own website about 4 weeks in advance. In the reservation request section I requested a room at the front of the hotel. It wasn’t until we were checking in 4 weeks later that we were told that our request would cost us an additional 120 euros. Also the reservation did not present an option to add on breakfast, so we assumed breakfast was included. At check in we were told that if we wanted breakfast we would have to pay an additional 64 euros. I felt that this approach was unprofessional for a 5 star hotel and was more the business approach of a budget airline. I made my views known to the manager and although I received a courteous reply , it didn’t adequately address the issues raised.",4,2021,09,29
207,Spectacular hotel!,"We stayed twice on our way into Dublin and out. The staff is wonderful at the hotel and made great suggestions on pubs to visit, Irish whisky to sample and more.

We had a great suite the first night—roomy with a great closet and separate sitting area. We loved our surprise macarons—delicious!  The bath had great water pressure and loads of hot water!!

The location is perfect. We loved 1824 —the resident bar and No 27 The Shelbourne bar. Great drinks and great food. Our breakfast was so good with a great selection and terrific soda bread.

Would definitely stay there anytime we are in Dublin. St Stephen’s Green is across the street, Trinity College and Grafton street are a short walk away.",5,2021,09,28
207,Best in Dublin???,"Full marks to all at the Shelbourne.  Excellent meal (steaks all round were perfect) , good wine (again, the Valpolicella Ripasso here beats the more lauded Amarone. Good atmosphere; good service & able to finish off with a few pints of Guinness. By no means cheap c. €600 for three people ( but there were whiskey’s with the coffee - but an enjoyable evening out",5,2021,09,07
207,Lovely weekend away!,"My husband surprised me with a 2 night stay in The Shelbourne at the end of August. I was very excited as it has been on my travel list for quite a while! Check in was seemless and everywhere was spotlessly clean and fresh with good Covid guidelines in place. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable. We were disappointed that the Horseshoe Bar was closed during our stay and we felt the menu for dinner was quite limited with only a couple of options to choose from. Breakfast was hugely overpriced considering the high price of the room in the first place. Also the television in our room didn't work and were disappointed that the bar closed so early, 10pm for the 1824 bar. A lovely hotel experience overall.",4,2021,09,06
207,Great to be back at The Shelbourne!,After 20 months - terrific to be back in Dublin and wonderful to be back at The Shelbourne.  Front of House manager Jacqueline is always welcoming and wanting your stay to be the best.  Luke at the Residents Bar was very attentive and quick with a good beverage.  Responsible COVID protocols. Need to make sure to have a booking at restaurants in the hotel or in the city.  Can't wait to be back before the end of the year to make up for lost time!  ,5,2021,09,06
207,Absolutely appalling,The Shelbourne has long been our favorite hotel in Dublin.  We booked in for our 25th Wedding Anniversary and checked out the same night after being publicly humiliated by their staff.  Never again and I advise steering well clear of what is now clearly a poorly managed hotel.,1,2021,08,28
207,Another Flawless Overnighter.,"We were three generations of mums/daughters/granddaughter who stayed for one amazing night the first week of August. 
We had the most amazing stay made even better by a beautiful upgrade from Patrick on arrival. Patrick you were fantastic. 
The staff were wonderful and so helpful with the baby and all the cribs/strollers etc that are associated with travelling with an 11 month child. 
We had a superb  stay. The staff go above and beyond. Had breakfast, lunch in the bar and room service. Highly recommend all of these. 
Can’t wait to return ASAP.",5,2021,08,26
207,Wonderful Wedding,"We stayed here last weekend for our daughter’s wedding. We had a fabulous time . Everything was done to perfection. Beautiful hotel, lovely food and attentive, friendly staff. Wonderful venue for our daughters wedding. Valet parking was very helpful.",5,2021,08,26
207,Amazing at Christmas time,"We stayed here at Christmas, and the staff, hotel, food, and drinks were all incredible. Even though it was a weird Christmas with the restrictions, the atmosphere was so lovely and festive. There was an error made with my meal on Christmas day, and the staff went above and beyond to resolve it. All my family loved their meals here, and wouldn't hesitate to book again for Christmas or another time of year.",5,2021,08,17
207,Lovely overnight stay in the capital,"We fancied a break away for the August Bank Holiday weekend and spent the Sunday in The Shelbourne. We arrived a little earlier than expected so dropped our bags and had a coffee at the hotel before popping out for a wander. We were contacted when our room was free and it was a really nice room, with such a comfortable bed! I use a sleep tracker on my Apple Watch and it tells me I had a 93% rating (the highest I've ever had) which a testament to the comfort. I love Elemis products so I was delighted to see them supplied. 

We had drinks in the No.27 bar -- served by the delightful Steven -- and chilled for a little before dinner. The tables are adequately spaced it felt very well ventilated, so we enjoyed our pre-dinner wine no end.  Dinner was a sumptuous affair. I had the terrine and my husband had the oysters, followed by the beef in bourguignon sauce and dover sole. Exquisite! We had a wonderful, informative waiter named Cyle who could not do enough for us. 

Breakfast was served at the table (though there was an option to go to the buffet) and it was of a very high standard. 

Highly recommend the Shelbourne -- you won't go wrong!",5,2021,08,17
207,Lovely hotel but disappointing dining experience,"We stayed here for 2 nights midweek for our first trip out of our county since restrictions lifted. The reception staff and room were lovely. Breakfast and the breakfast staff were superb. Our only complaint was our dinner on the first night in the No.27 Bar and Restaurant. The food was not what we expected as we ordered two fish dishes, thinking they were mains and going to be hot, however one was actually served cold which we weren’t expecting. We also ordered cocktails which we had to send back as they tasted awful. The young man serving us was a bit awkward and borderline rude at times, we have his name if wanted by management. The dining experience definitely dampened our overall experience at the Shelbourne, however due to its location and the rest of staff’s excellent service, we would be happy to return to stay and try the other restaurant for dinner.",4,2021,08,15
207,Wonderful Stay,"My wife and I spend 8 wonderful days at The Shelbourne Hotel in July. The staff could not have been more accommodating. From the doormen, to the bell staff, front desk, restaurant, housekeeping and the late night runner who deliver us ice each night. Each met our needs, each day. 

The property itself is ""classic"". There are not many hotels with a storied Dublin history like the Shelbourne. In fairness I can't say enough meaningful complements about the hotel and the committed staff that make it work seamlessly.

Thanks for having us.",5,2021,08,12
207,City break,Always love The Shelbourne.. but -this time felt a little different.. I know a lot has changed in these COVID times.. Hotel was cold and lacked the usual buzzing atmosphere.. we had food in the bar it was nice.. not a lot on offer for coeliacs .. room was just fine nothing amazing for the € paid.. and breakfast was the most lack lustre affair I ever had in a hotel..  table service is fine .. but it really wasn’t worth the effort unless you want a big traditional fry up.. over all the hotel is lovely.. great location.. this is not the hotel’s fault.. Dublin has changed and felt very un safe at times..,4,2021,08,11
207,Just superb,"Just superb in all areas food service atmosphere, made our wedding anniversary very special. We felt very safe and the hotel are managing Covid very well. We will definitely return when the occasion is right. Special mention for Inga who was warm and very professional.",5,2021,07,24
207,Sun night in the city,"We had a wonderful stay in the shelbourne last week. Valet, checkin and check out were seamless, staff very attentive. We were lucky to score s heritage room, next door to the Princess Grace suite. Room was beautiful overlooking the green. Bed super comfy. Lovely extras such as Nespresso machine, lots of water and delicious chocs for turndown service. Small bottle of hand sanitiser and wipes were handy for when out and about. Luckily we had Booked our time slot for breakfast late morning ( lots of fab cocktails in the hotel bar the previous night) and had lovely choice of buffet and cooked to order items. Delicious. Can’t wait to come back.",5,2021,07,13
207,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"We had an excellent stay from start to finish at the Shelbourne Hotel .  The staff we very welcoming and friendly. The room and food were of a very high standard.
Lucius,  the Manager is one of the most genuine, kind and accommodating people I have ever met! 
He ensured,  personally that we were very well taken care of and because of his professional and caring attitude I would highly recommend the Shelbourne to any potential guest.",5,2021,07,09
207,"Disappointing, lost it's shine!","Having read the recent reviews below, I am sad to agree that in-fact the Shelbourne seems to have lost it's spark. While the location and hotel are beautiful, from the moment we checked in there were constant mistakes. Having worked in and stayed in many hotels, we fully understand that we are all human and we all make a mistake but there were just too many mistakes for the money we paid.
Weeks before the booking I booked all food and pool times as required for Covid-19. At the time of booking I asked do I need to book any drinks and I was told no, so we were disappointed on check-in to learn that we should have booked the terrace for drinks. While the staff were kind (special shout-out to Derek who was lovely), they did not make that extra 5 star effort. The dinner food in the Saddle room was fantastic and each dish was so different and tasted amazing, but it’s a pity that the lack in good service created an overall disappointing dining experience. The dinner menu priced at €59 for a three course dinner didn’t include any tea or coffee. We would have even paid for the tea and coffee but we were encouraged to leave straight after the dessert. At first I thought due to Covid that the staff did not want to come over to our table to make conversation or to ensure that we didn't have to lift a finger but we had about 4/5 different servers for every meal so not exactly covid friendly anyway. They forgot bread for dinner, condiments for lunch, cutlery, had the wrong items on the bill, our wine was never topped up and no staff member tried to make conversation, all the things that make a 5 star experience. The breakfast was also very disappointing, wilted sausages, burnt pancakes, and bite sized croissants. They forgot our toast, then the butter, then cutlery and when we noticed there was no milk for our tea or coffee we just didn't bother to call the staff over again. There is no excuse for a bad lunch or breakfast in a 5 star hotel, especially when current food standards around the Dublin are at an all-time high. While it might seem that we are being picky, when you pay a few hundred euro for a stay in a 5 star you expect 5 star treatment. We have stayed in a lot of places where you are made feel totally at ease and at the start we made allowances for the fact most people are just returning to work after Covid-19, however after speaking to other residents, they too we're disappointed in the service and the constant mistakes. The staff were by no means rude, but their attention to detail was poor. It was not 5 star standard. We have no issue paying the money for top quality and even though the room was lovely (thank you Patrick for the upgrade) we did not leave looking forward to a return visit. We have stayed in other 5 star hotels during the pandemic (when we were allowed) and we left feeling like the staff couldn't have done enough and that we didn't have to lift a finger, unfortunately we couldn't say the same for what has been one of our most expensive stays. We would not recommend the Shelbourne and we felt we have received a higher level of service in many lower star hotels around Ireland and abroad.",3,2021,06,13
207,Service errors and crazy dinner menu/price spoiled our stay.,"The good: 
Friendly staff, nice terrace bar, spotlessly clean and seemed very Covid-safe. Nice suite. Late check out confirmed with minimum of fuss. 

The bad: 

Our bags were taken in from the car on a trolley and brought to reception. They said they would deliver them to our room but they never did. After almost an hour we went down to reception and just carried  them up ourselves (nearby staff just watched us do this, without either checking that we actually owned the bags or asking if they could help).  

I have titanium status with Marriott by the way, so one might expect a special effort. But no. 

We made a reservation to use the pool. We were told that the changing rooms were closed due  to Covid so to come down in our swimwear and robes. So two hours before our pool appointment time I called reception to get robes for our two kids. Nothing happened. I called again with an hour to go and asked why they had not arrived. I got an apology and another promise to send them up …but they never arrived.  I asked again at the pool and a third time they were promised but never arrived. 

A repairman arrived to fix our tv. It was not working properly but we didn’t report it as it wasn’t important. The repair man couldn’t fix the tv and it turned out after about half an hour  that he had been given the wrong room number. He should not have been in our room at all. (In a Covid environment having a repair man in our room with us for half an hour, unnecessarily, is not good).

But by far the biggest problem was the dinner menu. It was sixty euros for three courses. No amuse bouche, not even tea or coffee. And for that price there were only two (non vegetarian) main course choices, breast of chicken or plaice. For an additional THIRTY EUROS (!!!!) you could have steak or fish. So total cost of ninety euros for a plain vanilla three course no-frills steak or fish dinner that for Covid reasons had to be over in well under two hours.

None of the above were showstoppers on their own. And I got an apology for the non delivery of the robes when we checked out.  But combined the sloppy service and crazy dinner price spoiled our stay.",3,2021,06,12
207,Covid Wedding,We would just like to say a huge thank you to all the staff inparticular Lucius the manager who made our stay one to remember. Our wedding was not one we had imagined due to covid restrictions but The Shelbourne went above and beyond for us and we are ever so grateful. Looking forward to returning when all the restrictions lift. Thank you very much. Mr & Mrs.Whelan.,5,2021,01,27
207,An Oasis in a Storm,"Had a sudden trip back to Ireland due to the passing of my Dad. I scrambled at the last minute with Air transportation Hotel arrangements and Covid Tests.
I am so glad that I chose to stay with the amazing caring team at The Shelbourne!
They made me feel at home, comfortable and safe. They handled every aspect of my stay with style and charm. I felt for them as the city was in lockdown and may of the rules I am sure where new to them. They never showed anything but calmness and confidence. As someone who has traveled extensively and have been fortunate to have stayed at many upscale hotels, I can say with surety that  the team at The Shelbourne will make you feel that you are their only customer. The location is the best in the city. Grafton Street and Stephens green are footsteps away. The building is stunning yes, however stay for the smiles you will be welcomed with!",5,2021,01,15
207,The Shelbourne @ Christmas,"I had the absolute pleasure of staying at The Shelbourne at Christmas, checking in on Christmas Eve for 2 nights. The excellent 5* service started from entering the hotel with a lovely greeting from the doorman and the friendly and superbly helpful Reception staff who made the check in feel so personal. I had a Deluxe King which was perfect and was left a host of edible treats for my arrival ... delicious. 
Despite the further Covid restrictions that were enforced that day the hotel maintained a lovely atmosphere whilst ensuring the safety of all its guests. We ate in the bar on Christmas Eve and the Saddle Room on Christmas evening and the food and service was amazing. Breakfast both days was gorgeous and a very relaxed affair giving us time to enjoy the lovely coffee after eating. I cannot recommend this hotel, and it’s fantastic staff highly enough and look forward to returning very soon. ",5,2021,01,04
207,Christmas in the Shelbourne ,I stayed in the Shelbourne for Christmas and what a lovely experience. The staff were friendly and helpful and the service was excellent. The room was fabulous and the hotel was very festive. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and felt very safe in the current climate.,5,2021,01,04
207,A Christmas to remember,"We had such a fantastic Christmas at the Shelbourne hotel. Checking in on Christmas eve we got a wonderfully warm friendly welcome from the head doorman who arranged for our bags to be taken in and our car parked. Upon arrival in our room there were  were some lovely treats waiting for  us and that night there were even cookies , carrots and Milk ready in our room for us to put out for Santa. We ate in the restuarant on both evenings and the food was out of this world .All of the staff were amazing, so friendly, helpful absolutely nothing was a bother and they just made us feel so special. We were staying with our small daughter and the staff were just so nice to her giving her colours and pictures and even bread to bring over to feed the ducks in St.Stephens green.Roberto the front door man was so kind and even helped us take our christmas day pictures.We are so delighted we got to experience Christmas at the Shelbourne Hotel it was certainly one to remember. We can't wait to visit again one day soon hopefully.",5,2020,12,28
207,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,Myself and a friend visited the Shelbourne for the Festive Afternoon Tea. It has been sometime since I was in the Shelbourne and there has been a great amount of change. However I must congratulate the staff who have worked hard to make the feeling of visiting such a wonderful Dublin landmark the same even in times of Covid-19. The wonderful Róisín served us and was very helpful in assisting us in recommending different teas to try. At the end of the serving there was some of the treats leftover and Róisín was good enough to get us a box to take away these treats. The only issue I had and it wasn't anything major was when leaving the hotel the signage wasn't very clear and I think if the staff mentioned where to exit when you were either being seated or leaving. I do hope to return to this truly 5 star experience when times return to normal.,5,2020,12,21
207,Beautiful hotel,"My partner and I stayed here in September for our anniversary. We were upgraded to Heritage Suite which was one of the nicest suites we have ever stayed in.
We both felt very safe staying there and everywhere was so clean. There was a bottle of hand sanitiser in our room and everyone wore masks in public areas. 
John the Front of House Manager  was very friendly and really made sure we had a great stay. Our meal was gorgeous and the cocktails were 10/10! Thank you very much and we will definitely be back.",5,2020,12,14
207,Disappointing,"We were really looking forward to our trip to the Shelbourne - however from the first minute we arrived it was disappointing.

We have stayed in a couple of hotels since the Covid pandemic and they were very safe, excellent precautions but still great customer service - not the Shelbourne. Not one person asked had we stayed before - not one person said even in this awful time you will still have an enjoyable time. We were given clear instructions on what we couldn't do (orders really) but nothing about what we could do.

The hotel itself was nice-  the room was just about average. Even though the hotel was empty we were given the most basic room - having stayed in the Lough Erne, the Galgorm and Powerscourt you are always given an upgrade if possible when its a special occasion. Generally the service was professional but unfriendly - in direct contrast to what you would expect from an Irish hotel - the manager should go to Ashford Castle and see how they treat their guests. 

Certainly won't be back here - Powerscourt is still my favourite Dublin hotel by far.",2,2020,12,04
207,Always wanted to stay there and my dream came true,The hotel is exactly as I expected. The service was very friendly and the amenities were nice. The swimming pool is very nice and very intimate. I would definitely recommend staying there. We got to enjoy the breakfast which was very tasty apart from the wait as the place was very busy,5,2020,11,25
207,Hospitality is born here,"Shelbourne is Dublin's no1 hotel and that's not questionable at all. Extraordinary world-class 5* service. Luxury as it's best. Location fabolous - only The Marlin and Westburry can provide the same location wise. Bus and tram stops in front of the hotel, Grafton and Dawson street less then minute away. Hotel has one of the best terraces you'll find in the city - it's cosy, romantic and very stylish. For the best rate i recommend to book directly, for pleasant stay - as usual at any place, ask for higher floor and for room with view. Afternoon tea highly recommended. 10 out of 10. ",5,2020,11,10
207,Beautiful and Comforting Stay in Unprecedented Times,"My partner and I had planned a weeklong trip to Galway, our only vacation planned since the COVID restrictions began in Dublin back in March. We were excited to travel and reclaim some semblance of normalcy in our lives. But restrictions were raised and made our trip out of the county impossible. Deciding to be impulsive and treat ourselves, we realized a dream of ours instead: a week at the Shelbourne.

We expected the beautiful hotel room, the incredible food, the elegant interior. What we didn’t expect was the celebrity treatment we received from every single member of the hotel staff we interacted with. On one of our first days we got lost on the way to the spa and asked someone cleaning a room to point us in the right direction. Instead, she led us there herself. And when we happened to see an interesting meeting room as we passed, the assistant bar manager Andrew Taylor took us on a late-night after-dinner tour of the Shelbourne himself to find it (based only our vague recollection of “a red room with lots of paintings”).

We had planned on one spa day, but enjoyed our massages and relaxation time (champagne in hand) so much that we added on another. Definitely do not miss out.

Every measure felt taken to ensure a safe and worry-free stay, from the temperature checks on the way in, frequent hand sanitizing stations, face masks and face shields abound, and time-limited dining. We felt so isolated from the outside world that, at one last coffee in the Lord Mayor Lounge before checking out, we admitted to one another we had forgotten entirely about the gravity of the pandemic. Though I’m sure these unprecedented times led to some truly unique experiences (like playing boardgames in the Lord Mayor Lounge, having the entire No. 27 bar to ourselves, enjoying a long conversation and delicious cocktails courtesy of Luke Boland in the 1824 bar, enjoying Afternoon Tea alone in what would have been a sold-out room), I am sure that when we return we will receive the same level of professional and welcoming service, no matter the number of guests staying with the hotel.

We had planned to dine at an outdoor seating area at a local Italian restaurant, but when the night came we were enjoying a Guinness and boardgames in the lounge. My partner asked if it would be possible to order in, seeing as we’d tried just about everything on the menu, and the response came that the chef would be happy to make us something off-menu, and so we enjoyed a penne with Irish chorizo and finished our game, content not to leave the hotel at all. We didn’t know it, but this was our first interaction with the general manager, JP Kavanagh.

On our last night, we had cocktails at the 1824 bar. I was beyond impressed with Luke, our bartender. Being something of a cocktail hobbyist, I tried out some more obscure drink orders, and he was familiar with every request and happy to recommend drinks. We were privileged to be checked in on by JP himself, who recommended the Chateaubriand steak for our dinner at the Saddle Room and then sent in the sommelier, Nisea Doddy, to personally recommend an accompanying bottle of red wine and decant it so it would be ready for us in time for dinner. It was, without a doubt, the most personalized hotel dining experience I have ever had.

I am confident we will be back and, with the current restrictions due to continue, probably sooner rather than later!",5,2020,10,06
207,"Amazing visit, great option during lockdown","Been to every type of 5 star hotel around the world, but I have to say this is right up there at the top. Well worth going right now given there isn’t to much open right now. 
Right from parking the car at the front door, greeted by great door staff who took the car off to park it. Advised to give them 15 mins advance if we need the car for anything which was really good to know. 
Restaurant was great, really attentive staff who looked after you for the whole meal, food was fantastic, I should have went for the lobster option though. 
Room was v nice and the bar/lounge was nice for few drinks after. 
Great to have option of Grafton at/Stephens green on your door step, won’t get better location in Dublin. Will more than likely make it a yearly visit. Breakfast also fantastic, got booth which was really good. 
",5,2020,10,04
207,Enjoyable Stay,"The staff at reception were very helpful and eager to assist me in any way they could- special thanks to Patrick. I arrived early and was upgraded to a wonderful room with a bath. No request was too much for the team who made me feel like a real VIP. I had breakfast both mornings and it was divine, Inga is a real asset to the Saddle Room. I will definitely be back!",5,2020,09,25
207,Junior Suite,"The Shelbourne never disappoints! This was my 10th stay in the last 3 years and I am always so warmly welcomed back. Great stay as per usual. Staff have adapted the Covid procedures very well and are still delivering the most amazing and attentive service as per usual. Treat yourself to a Junior Suite, you won't be disappointed.",5,2020,09,25
207,Family dinner,"The main purpose of my visit was holding a family dinner to mark my late husband's first anniversary, and to this end we had booked the private room off the Saddle Room.  Unfortunately, due to Covid regulations, we had to reduce the number to 6 (we should have been 8) but we all have to keep the rules these days!  Suffice to say that it was a lovely evening with excellent service and superb food.

As I was staying overnight, I had checked in earlier and was pleased to find I'd been upgraded to a king room in the heritage wing overlooking Kildare Street.  Again Covid precautions were observed - no magazines or guest handbook, the minibar was sealed and the toiletries provided were the bare minimum, but it was very comfortable and quiet.

Despite the big dinner the previous night, I treated myself to the full Irish breakfast (included in the room rate) and very nice it was too.  

The Shelbourne is providing excellent service whilst complying with the current restrictions.  Every member of staff was unfailingly polite and helpful and went out of their way to provide a very pleasant visit.",4,2020,09,22
207,Great Food but drab,"The shelbourne is up to scratch as usual and doesn’t fail to impress...

However when I visited last, the bar seemed very dull and quiet with the tables spaced out. The food was beautiful with the cheese and ham toasties glorious as ever",3,2020,09,18
207,Amazing stay,"First time staying at The Shelbourne and it was a wonderful experience.  From the moment I booked online the staff were in contact to make sure that car parking, breakfast etc was organised to make things easy.  Front desk on check-in was one of the most professional and friendly I have ever encountered (Patrick).  The whole hotel was spotless and everyone acknowledged you in passing.  Very professionally trained and friendly staff.  
Breakfast was table service and again was high standard, only negative was the consent sound of the head chief barking orders.  The resident bar lacked atmosphere due to strict social distancing.  
Highly recommend for a weekend break.",5,2020,09,15
207,Another Great Stay,"Without doubt, one of my favourite hotels in the world. From the moment you step on the door, you are welcomed with such warmth. 
Rooms are really nice. Had a junior suite and it was so luxurious. Staff as per normal were so friendly and the food was top class. 
Stay here every year and it only gets better ",5,2020,09,09
207,Amazing dining experience ,"Went for dinner in the Saddle Room at The Shelbourne Hotel last night. Amazing experience. The food was delicious, fresh, rich, tasty, well presented. Chef Garry Hughes has done an incredible job there over the years. Consistently at the highest standards. Service from Dagmara and Nisea was top class. Great food, great wine, great service. Highly recommend this restaurant which is at the top of my fine dining list in Dublin ",5,2020,09,05
207,Shockingly disappointing...,"Stayed here with my husband for a special occasion. The bedroom was of three star standard at best. Small window overlooking another building.
The 27 bar closed after breakfast, we asked where we could sit to read newspapers and were told to go to our room. There was one armchair in the room so my husband had to sit on the bed to read.
Breakfast was chaotic, mixed up orders and long delays. Was of very mediocre standard when it finally arrived. 
I cannot believe the standard has dropped so much. It was such a treat to visit the Shelbourne, no longer so unfortunately.",2,2020,09,03
207,Amazing service. Wonderful stay. Will be back!,"I just wanted to say that I experienced a wonderful stay, for 1 night, last Sunday.

From the moment by wife, baby and I arrived we felt spoilt and we were sad to leave for our journey to London on Monday.

Your front of house staff including Mireia were exceptional.

Paul, the Concierge was AMAZING when I realised I had booked the wrong ferry.
He made a new booking and got us on our merry way.

Ali in the Saddle Room Restaurant was so kind, nice and pleasant both over our lunch on Sunday and our breakfast on Monday.

And Greg, the chap at the front door was amazing when assisting with valet and car matters.

You have a 5* team and please pass this message on to all concerned.

We look forward to our next visit.",5,2020,09,02
207,Lovely place to eat,"Food was delicious, staff was as equally lovely and helpful. Everyone was happy with their meals and drinks. I would highly recommend going and giving this place a visit. 
Their white wine pinot griot was the best i ever had!",4,2020,09,02
207,Amazing and safest staycation yet out of all hotels,"I have stayed twice since the Shelbourne reopened. Staycationing is a pleasure when you can walk from the hotel entrance to the local shopping on Grafton street or Stephens Green and many nearby restaurants. We had dinner in The Saddle Room this time and I regret not going sooner the meal was the best I’ve had in a long time, highly recommend the Sole.  The staff are all outstanding from Front of House to the Saddle Room to Concierge, housekeeping and the safety standards in place and perfect, some hotels like Mount Juliet  could learn from them as I was not impressed when we stayed there. Overall if staying in Dublin this is the best hotel and I can’t wait to return. Credit to the team especially Lucius.",5,2020,09,01
207,Terrific experience,"Just returned from an overnight stay in the Shelbourne. Everything about our stay was perfect. We had a light and delicious lunch in bar No.27 and dinner in the Saddle Room which was superb. The staff in the hotel are excellent, every member of staff with whom we had contact could not have been more professional or have done anymore to make our stay more relaxing and memorable. The ambiance in the hotel is luxurious, calm and welcoming.",5,2020,08,31
207,The Perfect Stay,What a great experience. Myself and my wife stayed here for 1 night in August and we we blown away by the staff the cleanliness of the hotel and the buzz about the place. I don't much else to say but it was amazing and a big thank you to the staff!,5,2020,08,25
207,“Due to Covid”...the Shelbourne offers a pretty dreadful guest experience ,"A one night stay at the Shelbourne was a last minute addition to a short family staycation, the previous 3 nights of which were spent at the beautiful Dromoland Castle in County Clare. We were looking forward to a mixture of continued relaxation in 5 star luxury at the Shelbourne, mixed with a bit of Dublin's cosmopolitan buzz after our quiet country retreat in Clare. I thought the Shelbourne would be a perfect choice. How wrong I was! The phrase 'due to Covid...' or 'due to Government guidelines...' was soon ringing in my ears, as this was uttered almost constantly by the staff to justify the rather extreme Covid  measures implemented at the hotel (they couldn't even provide some biscuits in the room to go with tea or coffee...why?...'Due to Covid...'). We ate at the Saddle Restaurant, where they insisted masks be worn as we walked to and from our table and we were allotted exactly 105 minutes to order, eat our meal, drink our wine and then get out. They insisted we order all courses at once to reduce the number of times they'd come to the table. All that was missing was a stop watch at the table to countdown the time we had remaining. I felt stressed within 5 mins of sitting at the table. The food was good though, such a shame I felt rushed and unable to savour it along with the bottle of wine we ordered. Hour long slots had to be booked in advance to drink at the residents bar and you then get a 10 minute warning to let you know your hour is almost up, so you could drink up and leave - none of this is necessary or conducive to a relaxing stay! Of course I get the fact that these are not normal times and hotels need to take steps to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. However what we experienced at the Shelbourne was extremely obtrusive guest management measures from staff who, in some instances were almost rude. Overall it was a complete contrast to the super relaxed and friendly vibe at Dromoland where we were well looked after and made to feel welcome. Presumably the management of both hotels are having to implement the same 'government guidelines' and protect guests and staff from Covid risks, yet the guest experience we had at both hotels could not be more different. I share the view of another recent reviewer of the Shelbourne in that we also felt like we were an inconvenience to the hotel and not at all valued guests. ",1,2020,08,23
207,Staycation,"This year it was to be a staycation due to covid so we have moved around a few different hotels this week.  

We left the Shelbourne until last with expectations of a final “treat”.  They are certainly all over the hygiene aspects of covid but unfortunately by the end of our stay we felt more like more an inconvenience to them than a welcome guest.   

The evening meal in the saddle room was wonderful, but unfortunately, the overall experience was very disappointing when compared to other hotels we had stayed in earlier in the week, under the very same covid challenges. ",2,2020,08,19
207,Best hotel trip this year,"Myself and my husband booked a night in the Shelbourne for a mini babymoon. From start to finish the experience was wonderful. Despite the challenges the hotel industry is facing, this hotel made every effort to make our stay as relaxed as possible. The hotel seem to have a well run system for social distancing and cleaning. I cannot fault the hotel or staff on their delivery of a safe environment. There was no compromising of service or atmosphere with the restrictions.
The room was immaculate and thoroughly cleaned. It’s obvious the hotel regularly maintain the decor in rooms, it was fresh and welcoming as well as spotless.
The bed was very comfortable and despite the weather being very humid the room stayed lovely and cool with the air con.
What was a big plus for me was the peace and quiet in the hotel, despite there being a lot of guests you could barely hear any outside noise when you were in your room.
We had breakfast the next morning which was superb. The quality of the food was clear and everything seemed to be cooked from fresh with a great variety on the menu.
I must commend the staff throughout the hotel, everyone we encountered was pleasant and helpful even though they are working in difficult circumstances having to constantly wear masks and visors, along with the extra cleaning duties
Since we couldn’t holiday abroad this year we decided to take some trips around Ireland and out of 4 different places we stayed, this was the absolute highlight. Other hotels could learn a couple of things from the Shelbourne about how to manage a hotel during a global pandemic!",5,2020,08,15
207,Excellent Post Covid Night Away,"My wife and I booked in for a stay just after the hotels reopened and I have to say we were really impressed from the outset. The  reservations team were really professional Roisin guided us all the way through the process booking in, Booking dinner and breakfast and are car in with the valet. Really professional. 

When we arrived we were very impressed with the level of sanitation and procedures that the hotel had in place however this did not take away from our experience. The staff were professional and we soon forgot about covid.

Dinner was amazing as it always in the restaurant - The cocktail in the bar were great.

The car was was parked and kept safe overnight.

An excellent experience. Cant wait to go back",5,2020,08,13
207,First Class,"Famous old hotel which never disappoints. Central location, history, style and the most professional and welcoming staff anywhere. Great value and another great stay. Unfortunately, we only took breakfast this time and have to say that was slightly underwhelming when compared to everything else on offer. Still, our favourite Dublin Hotel and will definitely be back.",5,2020,08,09
207,Thank you,"This was to be our last family outing for a while due to  illness.
My husband and I had always wanted a night away in  the shelbourne Joined by our son  this time  so not romantic.
What makes this hotel is the staff.  From the doorman to reception to concierge, housekeeping.
Health and safety faultless ...
Check in took longer but a lot to explain and advise.
I found the breakfast a little bit underwhelming for the price but tasty all the same.
We had the Maureen o’hara which was lovely with fabulous views and great linen.
Final comment. I could have spent hours looking at all the art work that lines the corridors simply brilliant and the floral arrangement that welcomes you was spectacular.
We thank you.",5,2020,08,06
207,Stunning Service.,"Booked an overnight stay for business reasons. We have never stayed here before but its reputation precedes. Everything was taken care of from start to finish, the most  seamless check-in ever. This hotel is definitely 5-star quality and the service you receive here is a testament to that fact. Beautiful decor all around, spacious room with classy soft furnishings. Evening turn-down service. 
Dinner was in the Saddle Room - due to Covid restrictions some health and safety measures were put in place to ensure social distancing would be observed. Were only allowed to stay for 1h 45m but again service was impeccable. and the food was delicious. Wonderful selection of wines that I like, made me really happy.  Breakfast the next morning was a la carte, I am unsure if there was ever a buffet option in pre-Covid times ... I do love a morning buffet spread. The pancakes were a bit of a let down so I wont be ordering those in future. Make fluffier pancakes please!! Highly recommended place to visit all things considered.",5,2020,07,31
207,Expensive but for what? ,"Booked the Shelbourne for a luxurious night away. Unfortunately I was let down. Room was standard, nothing above 4 star. 
Wanted to relax and have a drink, but couldn’t unless we were going to eat, even though we were residents, so we had to return to our room and order a drink to our room which cost an extra €6. 
So all in all we could enjoy no amenities in the hotel. Not worth the money. Breakfast very average. Croissants were not freshly baked. ",3,2020,07,20
207,A wonderful hotel with old style luxury with a few things they could work on..,"We stayed here for our 10 year anniversary a few days ago, we  had got engaged in the hotel so it meant alot to us to return. They went out of their way to make it special for us leaving a card and sweets in the room and a little treat plate in the restaurant after our dinner and wishing us a happy anniversary on arrival at check in. We were for the most part thrilled with our night. The hotel has clearly made huge efforts with the covid situation and we felt very safe with all of their precautions in place. Masks, gel and wipes left in the room. 

We were happy with our dinner.  Really lovely quality. The desserts were really beautiful. The only thing I would mention is that they charge for you to swap out your side, so I wanted mash instead of their boiled potatoes, when the sides are comparable, I think charging is a little mean, particularly with a restaurant at this price point (3 courses 59 euro). We were also a little disappointed with breakfast, the staff all of their masks are having a hard enough time so I didnt want to mention in on the morning, but it just wasnt the standard I would expect for this hotel. My husband had the full Irish, the sausages were a little small and wilted looking. Everything tasted fine, it just was more a 4 star level breakfast. I had eggs benedict, the muffin was not great at all, not fluffy as you would expect. Not enough sauce. The pastries were again not to the standard I would expect, some overcooked. I had a hot chocolate and it was cadburys drinking chocolate, which is a little behind the times. The juices were I believe fruice juices, made from concentrate. I assumed the OJ would be real OJ in a hotel of this calibre. Considering the prices of their breakfast menu, 25 euro for the full Irish I believe, I think this needs work.

The room was really lovely, a heritage room. Incredibly beautiful bathroom. We also used the pool which was nice, very clean. The hotel communal areas are kept to an enormously high standard. The staff are extremely polite and friendly without being overly informal, and go out of their way to help you with anything you need.

This is one of Dublin's treasures, It would just be nice to see them create perfection by fixing a few of the smaller issues (saying that I am conscious we were with them a few weeks after opening after covid and with buffet breakfasts now no longer allowed, perhaps they are adjusting to the new setup)",4,2020,07,20
207,Afternoon Tea,Have visited many times for afternoon tea and as always it was an excellent experience. It was different due to Covid 19 precautions but it was still lovely with outstanding service and food.  Highly recommend.,5,2020,07,16
207,Weekend stay,Visited here recently with my partner. I was worried that Covid restrictions would interfere with our experience but that was not the case. Staff at the hotel were faultless. Very attentive to our needs during our short stay. The location could not be better. Rooms are spotless and very well presented. Nightly rate is expensive but worth it for the location and the service. ,5,2020,07,15
207,Superb Stay!,"Absolutely fantastic stay in The Shelbourne, so relaxing. They have all the necessary safety measures in place but done in a very classy way. I had a lovely relaxing facial in the spa. The staff are amazing. The food was absolutely gorgeous. Would highly recommend a stay here, can't wait to go back.",5,2020,07,15
207,Leah at 27,Absolutely incredible service special mention to Leah who was so great and made our experience so special. The shelbourne is lucky to have this lady and the food was delicious and cant wait to go back.,5,2020,07,05
207,Amazing ,"Staff are just amazing, accommodating, friendly and amazing. From the time of booking until you depart. We felt like royalty. Room is magical. Drink menu superb especially the mojitos. Bread and butter pudding-yummy. So central to everything. In walking distance to everything shops, parking, park, bars etc. Will definitely be booking again. Thanks to all the staff ",5,2020,07,05
207,Splurge for this Hotel,"The Shelbourne is historical and classic.  It’s regal and timely.  Even if you are not a guest at the hotel, stop by for a cocktail at 1824 Library Bar or book a high tea afternoon 
in the main restaurant- the hotel is an experience.  

If you are lucky enough to stay at the hotel, you will not be disappointed. My room was spacious and bathroom large and modern.  ",5,2020,04,18
207,Favorite in Dublin,"I've stayed in at least half-dozen nice hotels downtown DUB but this is my new favorite. Location is great, service is superb (had one breakfast where the waitress never came around to check back at all) but next morning waitress was fine and overall service is impeccable. Rooms are spotless and comfy and personal favorite the bedding is excellent (THEY STILL HAVE SHEETS!!!). Decorations at Xmas are stunning. One word of caution, they have gone to the auto-mini-fridge: you pull it-you own it! Warning is small (unreadable with my old eyes unless cheaters are on) sign ON THE INSIDE of the door. Staff is great tho...they will clear it from your account if you make a mistake. 
Afternoon tea is a must! Stunning presentation and every single thing was delicious.
  As you might expect; it's not cheap, but off-season not horrific either. Def my #1 hotel in Dublin",5,2020,04,17
207,A Birthday visit ,Have stayed here a number of times but probably my last. Had to move rooms as it had a noisy air conditioning unit so can’t complain at the helpfulness of the staff. Where I did have a problem was there was no priority for guests when using the bars or restaurants. Yes it was busy but it was a free for all in the main bar and what used to be the private bar for guests was now open to all. ,4,2020,04,09
207,Worth waiting for,"We’ve waited a long time to stay here, considered Dublin’s finest hotel by many.  It was worth the wait.  Truly the Grand Dame if St Stephen’s Green, there’s wonderful history in the building but the renovations undertaken several years ago have made it a true 5 star property.  Our room was in the oldest part of the hotel, complete with a slightly sloping floor, but was comfortably furnished with period pieces.  The bath was large & quite spectacular.  The staff were all top notch & we felt well cared for throughout our stay.  Wish it could have been longer.",5,2020,03,23
207,Lovely Experience - Impressive measures fro Covid 19,I visited the Hotel on Friday Night and the Place looked superb and The actions the Hotel Management have taken to mitigate against the Virus outbreak are very impressive and very reassuring. I felt very comfortable having a drink and the obvious but simple actions to minimize contact between the visitor and staff and indeed other visitors made for a relaxing experience. Well done to all - The Staff at the Bars and Management  - Top Notch,5,2020,03,14
207,Shelbourne Hotel Rocks,"Fantastic hotel. Great location near Grafton Street and Temple Bar. Has a great bar and restaurant. Rooms are medium. They always stay up with the remodels. Cafe en Seine, Keough’s Pub and McDaids are great pubs.  
Great Bell Staff.",5,2020,03,07
207,such a pleasure to stay here,"This is by far the most I have enjoyed a hotel stay recently. The ambiance is totally captivating and so relaxing. My wife and I went to Dublin in mid-January for our 2 night annual post-Christmas break and hardly ventured out of the hotel! We sat in the foyer on the armcharis by the fire, watching the world go by, ate in the No.27 bar both nights and one afternoon - what a place to people watch, such a buzz and the service and food are impeccable. We enjoyed the spa - a jacuzzi would have been nice too - perhaps something for the future.  Little touches lke the desserts in our room on the first night and the chocolates on the second added to the experience as did our complimentary room upgrade to one overlooking St Stephen's Green. Will most definitely return -. 5 stars, excellent. Absolutely loved the whole experience!",5,2020,03,05
207,Very nice BUT it's not The Merrion,"Decided to try this hotel for my January visit to Dublin, instead of my usual, The Merrion.  There is always a big aviation meeting in Dublin at the time of year I need to be there and I thought this place might not be as busy as The Merrion. Yikes, was I wrong - crawling with delegates, on arrival they were literally filling up and blocking the sidewalk and entry.  However, not the fault of this property.  Staff very nice, hotel was renovated a few years ago, my room was pleasant.  Just missing that little something that could make it special.",4,2020,03,03
207,Wonderful Brunch Experience,"We had a continental sit down family breakfast at the Shelbourne Private Dinning Room
The booking experience was easy and included a viewing.
The set up was impeccable. Everything we needed was already placed on the table.
The service on the day was sufficient, professional and efficient. The staff really did go out of their way to take photos for us - including allowing us to take photos in the Constitution Room. Was such a wonderful touch to the experience. 
The food quality was wonderful.
The tea and coffee selection was great.
There truly was nothing to fault. 
Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel.",5,2020,02,29
207,Friday night dinner and drinks ,"Lovely night in bar Loved the 1824 champagne ceremony 
Craig who served us was polite , professional and really a gem such a great asset and a super friendly knowledgeable waiter
Bar food lovely 5 star all round ",5,2020,02,28
207,Lovely and traditional but lets itself down!,"Overall the hotel itself is very nice. Traditional, clean, and our room was spacious enough. What's missing at the Shelbourne is the attention to detail and the service. Two examples, the first from the housekeeping. They clean the room well enough, but they don't tidy up your hairdryer, and curling iron cables, etc. In other hotels, for example, The Dorchester, The Savoy, they do these small things so it's very evident when you go back to your room that they've spent time doing this and it's a nice touch. Mine were a heap on the desk exactly as I had left them. This didn't bother me as much as the doormen. At the other hotels I mentioned previously, the doormen are in a class of their own. They make you feel special, they make you feel welcome and like you've come home at the end of the day. They go out of their way to take your bag or open the door for you. I asked if possible to have an umbrella for me to get into the cab as it was raining and we were off to dinner and he responded: ""it's only a few meters"". I was quite surprised, to be honest. It's a shame because The Selbourne is regarded as the best hotel in Dublin and these small things let it down. No personal touch at all.
Also, there is very limited lobby seating. Literally two or three seats and that's it. So if your waiting for someone or just want to sit and watch the world go by you can't.

The spa set up is not good. When you go to a spa from the minute you walk in the experience should be calming and relaxing. The fact that the initial reception of the spa is on the ground floor, street entrance and the changing rooms down in main gyms pool area, then back up to reception in a bathrobe freezing by the street entrance until I was taken upstairs, to then be led into yes a lovely area finally. The entire process should be upstairs. This was very bizarre and I don't understand why it's done this way.",4,2020,02,28
207,Night out in Dublin,"This place takes you back in time to a traditional top class hotel , it was amazing to see the customer service, nothing was too much trouble. I could've sat and watched the life of the hotel go about it's business, there's not many places like this left in this world. Location is perfect and the room was lovely.",5,2020,02,23
207,Great attention to detail except when it mattered,"We stayed a few nights for my partner's birthday , she always wanted to stay in The Shelbourne. The hotel itself beautiful, the staff went the extra mile to make us as comfortable as can be. However I had called twice to arrange a birthday cake over dinner and they assured me they this would sorted but unfortunately it wasn't . I did find this quiet disappointing . That being said the food was divine and the rest of the stay was great.",5,2020,02,22
207,Excellent service,"We stayed at the Shelbourne early February 2020 for a weekend break.  The hotel is elegant and refined and you absolutely get what you pay for.  The service was attentive. The waitress at breakfast recognised us from the day before even though we were in a different part of the breakfast restaurant, which was a nice touch.  The breakfast was fantastic and definitely one of the best breakfasts we have had in a hotel.   We had the afternoon tea (which I would suggest you book in advance).  Far too much food but you can take the cakes back to your room in a lovely box.  The room was comfortable (although probably not the biggest room we’ve had) but there was everything you needed.  The bathroom was lovely and warm (a must!). 

A great location too.  10 minute walk to the main shopping street and easy taxis to other attractions.",5,2020,02,22
207,Great Hotel,I stayed here in January while in Dublin finishing some business.  The staff is outstanding and treats everyone like a king and queen.  The rooms were great with everything you need (except for some USB outlets).  the bed was so comfortable and soft.  the shower was outstanding and just what I needed to feel relaxed.  Great place to stay in a great location in the center of dublin.,5,2020,02,05
207,"Fine, Good amount of places to eat and drink",Stayed here one night.  Hallways are windy and tight.  Rooms are clean and fine.  Will do.  Enjoyed the bar that looked like a library.  Dinner at the restaurant right below that was delicious.  We were happy with all the dining and drinking options within the hotel.  It will do.,4,2020,02,05
207,Lovely for a drink,"The front bar is great for a drink and people watching. The interiors are stunning and service is 5 stars. Paper straws for the drinks - its great to see the hotel considering the environment. Door man is a credit to the hotel, very welcoming",5,2020,02,05
207,2 Stays in November,We had a one night stay and a 2 night stay following a trip to Western Ireland.Both were very pleasant. The location is perfect to explore the compact City Center. St Stephens Green is across the street.,5,2020,02,01
207,Afternoon Christmas tea ,"I treated my grandmother and godmother to afternoon tea at the Shelbourne on the 27th of December. It really was a special experience from start to finish. It meant a lot to me to be able to have make this memory with my family members. 
The food was so fresh and there was plenty of it, we even had left overs which they kindly let us take home in the prettiest box. 
The staff were constantly topping up our teas and checking to see if everything was okay. Our waitress was particularly nice as she asked to take photos of us all and really made an effort to capture a great picture.
We will now make this a tradition for as long as my grandmother can make it to the Shelbourne. We can’t wait to be back! 
Thank you x",5,2020,02,01
207,A Grand Hotel in a Perfect Location,"Stayed here for one night while on a 27-hour layover from London to Washington, DC.  Booked using points and got a nice upgrade as a Marriott Platinum member to include free breakfast.  

The hotel is incredible and the rooms are well appointed.  Huge bathrooms with separate tub and shower, and heated towel racks.  The bed was incredibly comfortable.  If they have it available, ask for a room facing the Green.  

The staff is amazing.  There was a fire alarm that went off at 7AM the morning we checked out. It happens, but there were signs created within an hour apologizing for the inconvenience, which I thought was a nice touch.  This hotel is expensive, but the room and service level showed that you get what you pay for.  

Also don't sleep on breakfast.  The scrambled eggs were the best I've ever had at a hotel buffet.  They were creamy and light and perfect with the sausage.  Also the salmon and capers was terrific as well.",5,2020,01,29
207,Lives up to its 5 stars in every way!!,Stayed at the Shelbourne this weekend for an anniversary treat. From start to finish it was amazing. Having worked in a 5 star hotel myself it ticked every box for me and will be a weekend that will be hard to forget. We got upgraded to the Michael Collins suite with  views of St Stephens Green it was complete comfort start to finish. Everything about this hotel is perfect. We had a beautiful dinner in the saddle room and the following morning had breakfast in our suite overlooking Stephens Green. Thank you for making our stay so rememberable it is definitely a tick from my bucket list.,5,2020,01,27
207,Special Night,"Well what a fabulous hotel,from the moment you arrive till you leave your it so special,Juilete on arrival Micheal and Darragh the barmen in the Horseshoe Bar all so friendly and helpful, as for the food absolutely in a world of its own Garry Hughes Executive Chef has a super team and everything is finished to perfection.I had the Plaice my favourite fish and it was melt in the mouth and just gorgeous,my husband had the Hereford Burger he said it was the best he ever had and the truffle fries were just perfect. Breakfast was just a nice beautiful presented and lovely tasty and fresh.
When arrived we had be upgraded to a Suite and it was superb, staying in the Shelbourne had always been a wish since a child well Im so glad I got to do it,and especially in a Suite with everything you could as for beautiful comfortable bed and pillows,a bath you never want to get out of and perfect views over the Green.The say the best things in life come to those who wait, well Im so glad I got mine.Really really enjoyed every moment. This is a prime example of old meets new with class, opulence and excellence.It really is more than 5 stars its perfect, something we will never ever forget.",5,2020,01,26
207,Excellent in every way!,"We were fortunate to spend 5 days at this marvelous hotel over the Christmas holiday. I cannot say enough good things about the Shelbourne. The staff here goes out of their way to provide the best in customer service. The rooms are small but comfortable and divine. We had a luxurious marble bathroom along with robe and slippers. Superior room service and turn down service adds to the pampering that awaits you here. There is a choice of lobby bars that are popular and fun places for a happy hour cocktail or after dinner drink. The indoor heated pool is a nice treat on a cold day, plus high tea to chill your bones after a day out on the town.  There is a salon for hair or nails treatment, plus massage rooms for a body treatment. The onsite restaurant serves a very extensive buffet breakfast including omelets cooked to order. The location of this hotel is ideal as you can walk easily (just a few short blocks) to the popular Grafton Street with its many stores and restaurants. The tour buses stop at the park directly across the street from the Shelbourne lobby. Honestly, this hotel is perfect in every way. The room rates are pricey but in this case you get what you pay for !!!",5,2020,01,23
207,"5 Star, First class stay!","Myself and my daughter stayed at the Shelbourne in a heritage room on Saturday night. The staff were amazing especially the lovely Jessica who welcomed us so warmly and showed us to our beautiful room. We were celebrating a big birthday and Jessica seen to every detail, nothing was too much trouble. The friendliness of the staff and the attention to detail made our stay a memorable one. We are already planning our next stay.",5,2020,01,19
207,Festive weekend in Dublin,"The Shelbourne lives up to its reputation as an iconic 5* hotel in the city centre, very convenient to shops, bars & restaurants. The Christmas decorations throughout the hotel were stunning !

We received a surprise delivery of brownies and a card in our room. Both our rooms (we were upgraded on request on our second night) had a quality marble bathroom, a restful colour scheme with luxurious linens and soft furnishings. The bed was very comfortable and both rooms were quiet. Housekeeping was excellent offering a turn-down service.

Our platinum status was acknowledged at check-in allowing us to be upgraded on our second night to a Heritage room. We had complimentary breakfast in the Saddle room - the food was excellent, very well presented with constant replenishment of items.

The concierge arranged bus tickets for us that could be added to our room bill. Yasmine was very helpful on check-in. We were fortunate to be offered a brief tour of the Constitution room by Monika - it was laid out for lunch and the table had some beautiful floral arrangements. All the hotel staff were extremely polite and helpful at all times given it was a very busy time of the year for them.

The 1824 bar was very cosy and intimate offering a fabulous range of cocktails & whiskies. You could only enter the bar if there was enough seating available so patience is required at busy times !

The hotel’s Saddle room restaurant surpassed our expectation : our round table for two near the open kitchen was great for people and food watching ! The season game menu with accompanying wines was superb and very well presented. Pavel, the sommelier was very helpful. A very thoughtful note was the offer of a black napkin for my wife’s dark velvet dress ! On our last day, we had a champagne afternoon tea in the Lord Mayor's Lounge and this too was an exceptional experience.

Thank-you to all the staff - we would love to return.",5,2020,01,19
207,Tourist Attraction,"My wife and I stayed here for one night in January and found the stay disappointing. Our bed in a deluxe king room was two single beds pushed together, with the hard ridge between both mattresses running down the centre of the bed. The bed itself (two single beds rammed together) was hard and uncomfortable, certainly not luxurious or something that would encourage you to stay in bed on a cold January morning. 
The view from our window was directly opposite an old office block, we watched one poor guy work there all saturday. The room was above the swimming pool roof. The noise from the ventilation  system to the pool ran for the whole night a constant hum, that sounded like we were on a ship. We had used the spa facilities and would agree that expectations would be more for a 5 star than just a small pool with a tiny steam room and sauna, again grand but not 5 star. We both had treatments, the treatments themselves were over priced but fine, however the room where I had my massage was more akin to a dentist surgery than a relaxing massage room.
The whole ground floor including all the bars is open to the public and full of people ""dressed up for the shelbourne"", the 1824 bar adds something nice but it is small, does or doesnt take reservations depending on who you are and again is open to anyone. Being a resident in the hotel seems to give you no benefits in term of bar or dining options. So why not just stay somewhere nearby and drop in for a drink. 
There is way more luxious and better value options available in Ireland for domestic tourism.",3,2020,01,19
207,Champagne Afternoon Tea,"My daughter and I had champagne afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors Lounge.
Staff are excellent and very professional. Food was top class and plenty of choice
Beautiful surroundings in the lounge.
 It was €140 for two people but well worth the money for the experience.

207,So proud of a wonderful hotel in my own city,"Unusual to stay in your own city in a landmark hotel!  Brought my friend for a birthday treat to the Shelbourne!  From beginning to end it was an outstanding experience!

The staff were professional, engaging and wonderful.  The room was superb - everything from bed linen, bathroom and facilities were first class.  Dinner in the Saddle Room did not disappoint and was served in style with top ingredients.  Breakfast was outstanding.

Well done Shelbourne you do Dublin proud.  You deliver 5 Star through an excellent team.  Loved it and highly recommend it to visitors and Dubliners alike!

Well done all!",5,2020,01,15
207,Poor experience,"The staff made a mess of my booking, the service in the 1824 bar was poor and when I complained the management did not deal with the complaint as one would expect. Unfortunately, our experience was not what we had hoped for.",1,2020,01,13
207,The Best in Dublin,We try to stay at The Shelbourne once a year- it’s that perfect destination hotel in a wonderful city. The mix of old and new work very well together as we enter the grand entrance way. The Lord Mayors Lounge has been tastefully redecorated without any loss of classical history. The newly renovated lobby is cheerful and welcoming. The staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The rooms are comfortable and the bedding is divine. We love the fact there’s an indoor pool and a convenient spa. There’s always time for a very pleasant service. I especially like the wash and blow dry! We always hate to leave and this time was no exception. Can’t wait to return.,5,2020,01,12
207,Definately 5 star,"Just back from 1 night stay as part of my bucket list.Must say I really enjoyed my stay.Our room 270 was tastefully decorated,very comfortable and oh so clean,the grouting in the bathroom passed my test,Well done to housekeeping.Had evening meal which was most enjoyable and good value for money.Turn down service a nice touch,The gem for the hotel is their staff,they were all so professional and very friendly,a special word of praise to Patrick McManus at check in who made us feel very welcome.All in all a great break and I feel I will return.",5,2020,01,11

I would highly recommend a visit ❤",5,2020,01,10
207,Outstanding service with true Irish character,"I stayed at The Shelbourne Dublin for 2 nights just before Christmas. This hotel is an icon of the city and a favourite of the local community over the holiday season due to its unrivalled location and incredible buzz and atmosphere. Everything was exceptional from beginning to end - from the beautifully luxurious and very peaceful accommodation overlooking the Green to the energy of the bars and restaurants. It also has a magnificent spa, fitness facilities and a pool - perfect for lap swimming. I really felt that I was experiencing authentic Dublin at it's absolute best during my stay here but what was most remarkable was the standard of service and the friendliness of the staff. Everyone I encountered during my stay had a warm smile and word (or two) for me and made me feel truly welcome and valued. Brilliant hospitality and a brilliant Irish luxury hotel.  ",5,2020,01,08
207,Stunning 5 Star Dublin  Hotel,"We've just  stayed in The Shelbourne for a couple of nights.... and it was stunning...

The attention to detail from John Lynch, Front of House Manager and his team was exemplary...... a standard to be set by all 5* hotels....take a bow !

Thanks also to LeAnnie Wilson, Guest relations ..... for their hospitality....

We had a lovely lunch in No. 27.......Soup of the day was Mushroom.... so tasty....... Kilmore Quay Seafood Chowder is a must taste too .....

The Fish'n' Chips is mouthwatering......

.....Ah, but the Daily Wrap special (+soup) is just stunning...

We'll be back
We'll be back......",5,2020,01,07
207,Simply The Best,"What can I say? The Shelbourne has a long standing reputation for being one of the finest hotels in Dublin. As a former resident of Dublin I'm quite familiar with its many bars and impressive lobby but having finally stayed there recently I can confirm that it's impressive reputation is thoroughly deserved. Everything about my stay was excellent; impeccable valet service, wonderful front desk staff, luxurious room (managing to combine period elegance with modern comfort effortlessly), all the little extras one expects from a luxury hotel, great restaurants, great bars and an impressive gym, pool and spa. I was pleasantly surprised at the value and efficiency of the valet parking in this prime location on Stephen's Green. The Shelbourne will be my new go to on trips to Baile Atha Cliath; I've stayed at most of the other 4 star plus hotels and they simply don't compare.",5,2020,01,06
207,"Beautiful hotel, great location ","We stayed in the Shelbourne for the second part of our anniversary break in Dublin. We stayed two nights. On check in we were upgraded to a Heritage King Room, which was lovely and very kind. The hotel smells divine, the scent in the lobby is fabulous and the Christmas decorations were so beautiful also.

The only small complaint I would have would be that housekeeping wasn’t the best. There were no milks in our rooms both days and we had to call down for some, also we had to call to have our room made up after the first day and when they did it was only average, the bed looked very casually dressed, like I would have done myself before leaving the room anyway. The room was very clean however I felt that the making up of the rooms during our stay was the only let down. We stayed on the 6th floor. 

Apart from all that, fabulous hotel, beautiful art work throughout and excellent service in every bar and restaurant downstairs. 
We will definitely return. ",5,2020,01,06
207,Dublin’s Best Hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights over Christmas and the New Year and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great service, with helpful , attentive staff. We had a couple of small
issues with left behind coats and check
in but these were resolved efficiently with staff making extra endeavours to help. The Shelbourne is deeply comfortable with first class service. Staff are professional but also warm and friendly. Breakfast is very good with lots of choice and quality produce. The rooms are well appointed and beds extremely comfortable. We really enjoyed the bars and atmosphere. We love the fact that the hotel is buzzy and always bustling with people enjoying themselves. We really appreciate the warm hospitality at the Shelbourne and will return - it’s our “go to” Dublin Hotel for enjoyment & relaxation and perfectly located to fully enjoy all that Dublin has to offer. A home
from home in beautiful, congenial
surroundings with a big warm Irish welcome.",5,2020,01,05
207,Enjoyed every minute ,Just home from a lovely night away with my mam for her birthday. Jessica checked us in & out and what a lovely helpful girl. On check in we asked about breakfast & it was added to our room complimentary for my Mams birthday. Such a nice thought and meant the world to us. They have 3 bars but each small enough so can be hard enough to get a seat. Service was spot on & all staff so friendly & helpful. The atmosphere was really good throughout the hotel with the Christmas buzz still in full force. Would definitely return... ,5,2020,01,05
207,Christmas present ,"5* Hotel and that’s a fact. 
We had a terrific time staying here with superb friendly staff. Attention to detail and the place oozed expense. Gorgeous smell throughout with a great atmosphere.
We had been upgraded to a balcony room which was wonderful. 
Dinner in the Saddle Room was simply divine. I had the ribeye with a ten euro charge and oh boy was it worth it. Best steak I’ve had in years. 
Nothing was too much trouble for any staff member. 
Will happily return. ",5,2020,01,04
207,Weekend trip,"We had a wonderful time and loved the excellent staff who made our trip very special in The Shelbourne Bar! Thank you for your superb hospitality, we didn’t want to leave!! The Guinness and oysters were delicious!",5,2020,01,04
207,A truly disappointing experience,"This was our third time saying at The Shelbourne Hotel as a family at Christmas. Unfortunately we did not have a pleasant stay this time at all. There were a variety of issues and I think it’s important that you know about them.

We were not allowed access to the new 1824 Bar upstairs or access to the Terrace at any point during our stay on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The doors were closed and we were informed that all tables in the bar were booked. We asked if we could make a booking and we were told no, as there were too many bookings.

The breakfast was very badly organised. We asked for a table in the main restaurant but were seated at the far end of the main bar at tables that were not big enough for four people. We asked if we could change tables and were told no. We asked if we could go on a waiting list for a table in the main restaurant but were told no because there was a long waiting list.

There was an intermittent smell of cigarette smoke through the air vent system in our rooms. This happened at various stages throughout our stay.

For our Christmas meal, we experienced the worst treatment of all. Our service was extremely bad. Firstly, we had to wait about 45 minutes to order. Everything that followed was extremely rushed and unwelcoming. During our dessert, our bill was presented to the table, even though we didn’t ask for it. We were asked to leave the table and our coffee and mince pies would be brought into the lounge.  But these never arrived.
 
The entire experience was extremely unwelcoming and we will not be returning to The Shelbourne or recommending it to any one else. The organisation in general was really bad and a lot of the staff were very unhelpful. It was a truly disappointing experience.",1,2020,01,03
207,An over expensive hotel,"Paid a lot of money for 3 nights to see in the New Year 2020. Hotel was too busy with wedding parties and the lounges and bars in the hotel was so full that one could not enjoy the visit. Housekeeping services was below par. On the first day we asked for room to be clean early so that we could rest in the afternoon. Cleaner turned up at 4.30 pm disturbing our rest and did not leave any shower gel for the day! On second day, late cleaning again and did not leave tea or milk. On complaining to the housekeeping manager, she apologised and offered to send up a bottle of wine. The wine did not turn up, which added insult to injury at all. It would be better if she had not offered anything at all, but I assume this to be par for the course.  We also dined in the Saddle Room which was supposed to be a reknowned restaurant. Food was mediocre and waiter service was slow and below par. Dirty dishes left on adjacent tables after diners had long gone, whilst head waiter was busy ironing table cloths! Our first course arrived before our drinks and had to remind them to serve the drinks as well as having to ask for some bread rolls to accompany my soup. On the flip side, the service during breakfast was very good and the staff were very efficient, it's a shame that the dining waiters weren't as professional. On checkout, receptionists did not even ask if we enjoyed our stay or had any feedback. Very disappointed that our very expensive stay in this supposed best hotel in Dublin was so underwhelming.",1,2020,01,03
207,Leading Hotel,We stayed for 3 nights and cannot recommend this hotel enough. It is in a class of its own - a mixture of stepping back in time because of its history - and having modern classic decor. The staff are extremely welconing andcwell trained. Every element of the hotel oozes elegance. Food is delicious whether in the bar or the restaurant. Will be back no doubt about that.,5,2020,01,01
207,Absolutely Lovely in Every Way.,"Booked a suite here upon arrival to Dublin. Was hoping to check in early as our flight landed at 6am. No such luck but the location is amazing and there was plenty to do to pass the time until we could get into our room. The rooms were well appointed the decor was gorgeous.  We loved the service, the restaurants were plenty but our favourite was the small and intimate bar on the second floor. We have found our hotel of choice every time we are in Ireland. Looking forward to returning.",5,2019,12,30
207,Horseshoe Bar is a find ,Great bar in the back of the lobby. Good selection of whisky and well informed bartenders.  Lovely  quiet atmosphere and a welcome break from the raucous alternatives near temple bar.  This is for “ adults “ ,5,2019,12,30
207,Highly recommed,This hotel provides the level of service commensurate with the price. The valet service is excellent the Door Man with TopHat is a professional and the rest of the staff top notch. Walking distance to everything worth seeing in Dublin.  I will stay here again. ,5,2019,12,26
207,Mortified. Awful experience.,"My partner and I went for lunch on Christmas Day, entering through the side door into the ground floor bar, the Saddle Room. We told a staff member we would like to sit for coffee and food, she suggested sitting at the front windows or the bar at the top of the stairs which was cosy. Having been to the Shelburne before we decided to go upstairs to 1874 bar, only to be told that they were only serving residents. We were assured that if we returned downstairs to bar 27 we would be served. Slightly embarrassed we returned downstairs, walked through the bar again and were given seats by a staff member, we took off our coats and our order for coffee was taken by another member of staff. Then abruptly we were asked did we know anyone staying the the hotel, we did not at that time but had been on a few occasions before, and not wanting to go into details, and being a bit surprised, I replied that we did not. We were then told by the young man that he could not serve us. Without further adoo we were left to pack up and leave. Absolutely mortified we again had to trudge through the bar full of onlookers to the exit. I have never been so embarrassed and will not be recommending the Shelburne in the future to save friends and colleagues the same mortifying tretament.",1,2019,12,25
207,Christmas visit,"Not cheap but some of the best service in the world: perfect combination of professional and friendly. The hotel is beautiful, room very comfortable, and bars great fun. It’s very busy around Christmas but the atmosphere and location is well worth it. ",5,2019,12,23
207,Festive afternoon tea 7th december,"Decided to book festive afternoon tea in the shelbourne to celebrate my pregnancy. Have always wanted to try festive afternoon tea as I’m a bit obsessed with afternoon tea! Having tried numerous afternoon teas in hotels such as adare manor, powerscourt and Harvey’s point, the shelbourne definately stood out miles ahead. Service was excellent, it was evident it was quite a busy afternoon but the service was brilliant, didn’t have to ask for anything to be topped up. As a pregnant woman I loved the unlimited top ups of sandwiches! Also all the different varieties of teas available-I must have tried about 6 different ones all beautiful! Loved the Lord Mayors lounge and the beautiful Christmas pianist music playing in the background. Staff service was exceptional despite being so busy... I wish I could remember their names as everyone was so friendly and nice. I particularly loved the menu with the history of afternoon tea written inside(so much I bought a menu home with me!) also loved at the end we got gorgeous tea boxes with any left over cakes left over to take home(never get offered this service in previous afternoon teas). Just loved the atmosphere of the place the Christmas lights and hustle. Food was fabulous the attention to detail on the deserts was so beautiful! Recommending festive afternoon tea to all my friends and family.Another lovely touch from the staff was that they bought out a desert with congratulations on it-completely unexpected. Will 100 percent be booking afternoon tea again here, it is worth every penny and is such a beautiful atmosphere! Thanks to the shelbourne for making our celebration so special. Will be booking tea again soon!

207,When You Want the Best,"My wife and I recently celebrated her special birthday in Dublin with a 6 night stay the Shelbourne and our stay was really memorable.  The location, on St. Steven's Square, is perfect. 

Our room was wonderful.  It was spacious and very well appointed.  The bed was very comfortable.

Just before Christmas, the hotel was very crowed both with guests and merrymakers.  We visited each of the bars and our favorite was the small, quiet 1824 bar on the second floor.  We enjoyed a couple of dinners in the hotel and the the food  and service were top notch.  The breakfast buffet has everything you will want.

The staff, to a person, was warm, gracious and welcoming.  A number of people went out of their way to make my wife's birthday very special.

If you are going to Dublin, the team at the Shelbourne will truly offer you 100,000 welcomes!",5,2019,12,23
207,Simply dreadful ,"For the last 14 years we have made a point of visiting the Shelbourne for a two night stay before moving on down the country for Christmas with the family. It’s fair to say we have thoroughly enjoyed our stays that  is up until this visit. 
What have you done to the reception area? ... it’s absolutely dreadful, cold, uninspiring and uninviting. The whole character of the hotel reception has  been removed in favour of a shoddy lighted suspended ceiling and the traditional display has been obliterated in favour of 4 ghastly chairs. Such a shame... As if this is not bad enough... service at the main bar is non existent... insufficient staff numbers and the manager running around like a headless chicken trying to cover for the distinct lack of staff....to add insult to injury despite arriving at the hotel at 11am, after a very early rise to catch a flight... the best they could do was finally deliver a room at 15.00hrs the absolute last minute. Indignant was the only way to describe the receptionist’s reaction when I suggested that as a long standing Marriott member an earlier entrance would have been preferred..
And then the piece de resistance spurious charges making their way onto  the final account. Simply not acceptable... we are entitled to better...
Very disappointing indeed....",1,2019,12,22
207,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel, well located in the heart of Dublin city centre, in front of St. Stephen's Green, Very helpful and friendly staff, Excellent rooms with very comfortable beds, and has good number of resturants and bars inside it.",5,2019,12,20
207,Prestige in Dublin,"My Wife and I stayed here 5 nights in early October just after the hurricane passed through. From what I gathered that was a rarity. What followed was perfect weather!

It was our first time in Dublin. After exploring for several days and marinating on our trip the last two months I must proclaim that the Shelbourne’s location is premiere. I couldn’t imagine a better positioning. Fronting the hotel is St Stephens Green (a lovely park). Just around the corner is Merrion Square and several important or historical buildings. Also not far is Grafton Street as well as Trinity College. Essentially you can hit all the famous spots with ease.

Upon arrival we were treated like gold. We were helped from our vehicle, bags taken by porters, escorted through main level where we checked in and were given a history lesson and further made to feel important and valued. We were led to our room by staff where porters delivered the bags timely and ran through all the details of the room and services available to us.

Our room was well appointed and kept with the theme of the common areas - Victorian, but tasteful... definitely not garish. The sheets were of fairly high quality and the mattress the same. We slept very well. The vanity in the bathroom was large, high quality and well lit. Some things to know about the room: US electrical outlet options, shower/tub are one and same, a touch small.

Over the 5 days we took many a respit at the hotel and thus found ourselves imbibing and indulging often. I must tell you, the Shelbourne delivers. We loved the fish and chips at the No 27 Bar and Lounge. Cocktails were a delight at the 1824 Bar and we had daily breakfast in the Saddle Room. Unfortunately we never tried the other options. We did take in room service one night, twice! Silver platter and white glove delivery.

The main door and foyer are manned, beautiful and come with ever changing floral arrangements, a fireplace and a few chairs for sitting. I highly recommend the Shelbourne to anyone who is visiting Dublin, especially those seeking comfort and character.",5,2019,12,18
207,Can't fault,"Returned to stay at the Shelbourne for our annual festive trip to Dublin, and really couldn't fault any aspect of our stay this time. All the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful, our room was beautiful, as was the decor in the entire hotel. Beds extremely comfortable - I had a really great night's sleep when we stayed. Location is fantastic - very central for exploring Dublin.",5,2019,12,13
207,Impressive drinks ,"Over the weekend,I was in Dublin City and I was about to go for lunch but beforehand I went to the shelbourne for a few drinks and I have to say it was very good I had a pint and a large glass of water 
Very impressive ",5,2019,12,10
207,Leaving Incredibly Impressed!,"World Class 5 star luxury hotel that reflects a bygone era with incredible Irish hospitality. A fabulous experience from check-in to check-out. The Shelbourne looks and feels like the heart of Dublin.

Pro’s 
	- Old school luxury, lovingly maintained
	- Polished Irish service
	- Location. At the core of the city.
	- Surprisingly a member of Marriott Bonvoy and therefore eligible for perks and points!

Con’s 
	- A dated spa and health-club
	- Can be a maze to navigate the hotel
	

Check-in:
We arrived at 10.30 by Uber and our bags were  whisked away as we entered the hotel and were greeted by a lovely scent in the lobby and gorgeous green and gold Christmas decorations - beautiful! The standard was set with the incredible Nieve at the front desk. She was warm and welcoming - she thanked us for staying at the hotel, booking through AMEX and being a gold member of Bonvoy. She explained a lot of details about the hotel and informed us we’d received an (amazing) upgrade to a Signature Suite. Although our room wasn’t ready she informed us it would be soon - and indeed she called us 30mins later and escorted us to the room telling stories of the hotel which I loved! 

Service:
Well, I don’t have a bad word to say about the service at this hotel. The staff here clearly love their jobs and are proud to work here. They are attentive but very warm and easy to talk to. Just as an example I had been out doing some Christmas shopping and when I came back I asked a gent in the lobby my options for lunch. He explained my options, then walked me to the bar restaurant, introduced me to the staff member that would look after me and offered to have my bags sent to the room. 

Room:
Given we were upgraded from a mid-tier room to a signature suite - I have no right to complain. The suite was spacious with a living room, separate bedroom and bathroom with tub and shower. One consistent theme throughout the hotel is the use of green hues which feels perfect for the Emerald Isle. The room was no exception.

We stayed in room 644 - Earl of Shelbourne. It was on the roof of the heritage (Original) side of the hotel with views of the park. However the windows were small given we were in the roof. The room was classic in décor but nicely renovated and well maintained with lots of lighting options. Given we were in the original building as you walked around the room the floor would creak and the crystal glasses would shake but that was all part of the charm for me!

The beds were very comfortable as were the robes and slippers provided. The downside of the bathroom was the small (and narrow) tub as well as the fact there was only one sink.

Amenities:
The public areas of the hotel were absolutely gorgeous. Even the hallways were clearly lovingly decorated and the scent travelled through-out the hotel. We were lucky with our room but we did see some wings of the hotel did not seem as nice and the hotel was a nightmare to navigate with multiple staircases and elevators - a symptom of expansion over the years. However the grand staircase was a real treat!

The decorations for Christmas were beautiful!

The one disappointment during our stay was the spa/healthclub experience. My friend and I had booked the Gentlemen’s Experience - a 60 minute treatment followed by a cocktail in the relaxation room. We arrived at the spa via a very old and rickety elevator - we arrived earlier to use the health club but as we saw it we realized it was not in keeping with the rest of the well-appointed hotel and felt dated. We skipped the pool/steam. 

The spa also felt past it’s prime but the relaxation room was comfortable and the Christmas decorations nice. I must say our treatments were excellent and well worth it as was the cocktail and refreshment plate we were served after the treatment.  

Food & Beverage:
There are multiple food and beverage options at the hotel which I believe is partly due to the fact not only residents come here, it’s a place for locals to visit. I’ll talk through the establishments we tried:

We had coffees in the Lord Mayor lounge. It’s an ornate, classical style room at the front of the hotel and had the feel of Claridges in London - it was gorgeous! This is also where afternoon tea is served which I’m sure must be lovely.

I had lunch at No.27 - a more casual dining option but nonetheless the service was exceptional! I had a glass of Laurent Perrier (my favorite champagne) followed by Fish and Chips which were good, but not great.

One of the benefits of booking through AMEX Fine Hotels & Resorts was a complimentary lunch or dinner at the hotel. We used this at the Saddle Room and had an exceptional 3 course festive dinner (cost should be 75euro x person) 
",5,2019,12,08
207,Loved every minute!,"We stayed here recently as part of a work group and all I can say is that our stay was worth every cent!
The hotel itself is gorgeous but it’s the quiet opulence and all the behind-the-scenes work going on constantly by the staff that make your stay truly special. The rooms and indeed the hotel caters for everything. And the bed!!! Wow! It felt like I was in a cloud - honestly the best night’s sleep I’ve ever had.
And the breakfast is definitely work a mention - nothing was too much trouble and they were able to cater for all our dietary requirements without issue. Plenty of choice and everything we had tasted delicious. I’ll definitely return!",5,2019,12,08
207,No room at afternoon tea. ,"At a loose end in Dublin city centre at 5.45pm and decided to treat myself to afternoon tea. They couldn't accommodate me due to not having a ""stand"". Worst excuse ever for turning away a paying customer. The afternoon tea area was scarcely populated so I wonder are the cakestands for busy days stored off site? Not the standard of customer service I expect or normally receive from Bonvoy establishments. ",1,2019,12,06
207,A wonderful hotel in a historical building.,"The historical building (195 years old) was pretty impressive and our room on the top floor was large and comfortable. It has many restaurants and bars to enjoy. The service was wonderful, especially the persons at the entrance. The location was great as we walked to all the places that we wanted to visit, such as the castle, Trinity College,  city hall, the river, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, etc. There were also a lot of great restaurants within walking distance. We highly recommend this hotel for those visiting Dublin.",5,2019,11,30
207,Very Nice Stay; Great Dublin Location,"We enjoyed a recent stay at the The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin, Ireland. We stayed for 6 nights and the hotel's location made it easy to be a tourist in this incredible city. Located close to many of the cities sites as well as Grafton street shopping was helpful. Of course in November, expect some rain. Our six days did see one beautiful rainbow and a little sun but most of the weather was dreary, soppy wet. 

We arrived from our red eye from JFK to the hotel around 8 AM, Check in was handled by Julie who was very friendly and hospitable, she used my name and thanked us for being Marriott Bonvoy Platinum level members. Even though we were very early for arrival time she was able to find a room for us to check in. She asked for ID and a credit card and did well to carry on conversation. She told us about breakfast and the times available. She inquired if we would like a newspaper delivered to our door,.

The bellmen who escorted us to our room was Arjet and he also was very friendly and hospitable. He did a great job of introducing us to our guest room showing us the features of the room and pointing out emergency procedures. Arjet let us know of a special Christmas ceremony happening that night in the hotel. We were very happy that he did, it was one of our many highlights of our journey to Dublin. 

Our guest room was spotless clean and housekeeping did a good job during our stay. There is an umbrella available for use as well as two coffee options. One being a Nespresso machine. The towels sit on a heated rack in the spacious bathroom. The water pressure great but be careful on the hot water, it can get very hot. I do prefer a stand up shower vs a tub shower but this worked fine and with the included rubber mat wasn't slipper. The bed very comfortable and the linens crisp. The pillows plump.

We did have an issue with Concierge Paul, we had him book a tour and he said he would have a confirmation sent on up. Well, we never got the confirmation and had to follow up the next day after to finally get it. Not a big deal but it was a little disconcerting for a hotel with such excellent service elsewhere.

The health club facility is great. Lots of aerobic and weight equipment. It does take a little bit to find the location. The staff there were also very friendly.

Breakfast in the Saddle Room was very good. The buffet has many options including omelets cooked to order. The hosts at the door were always very friendly. There are numerous bars in the hotel for guests, they are pretty much always busy.  They do serve a formal English Tea daily but we found the price to be a bit pricey. 

We checked out early Tuesday morning (5:45 AM) and the person at the Front Desk was very friendly and helpful. The bellmen also, he did well to show me where to get a cup of coffee and insured we knew where we were going to meet the Airlink bus to the Airport.  (a short block and half away). Sorry, I didn't get their name, they were very helpful early in the AM.

All in all an incredible stay and we highly recommend The Shelbourne in Dublin.",5,2019,11,28
207,My favorite hotel in Dublin,"Spent a week at this grand hotel with my mom and cousin. The staff were kind and accommodating. Our rooms were fantastic. We had a wonderful high tea with knowledgeable staff who taught us Americans about teas. Even with a protest blocking the street in front of the hotel, the staff were always looking out for us. This is an amazing hotel, one of the world’s best.",5,2019,11,28
207,Wonderful Wedding Celebration!!,"We celebrated our wonderful wedding at the Shelbourne and from the first contact all the way through to checking out and beyond our experience was excellent. The event team were exceptional, especially Cathy. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and professional,  and the evening team that looked after our beautiful meal in the Constitution room were amazing.  A very special thanks to Cathy and Patrick from the events team, Billy for showing us around the hotel,  Samuele from the evening team,  Lauren and Eva in the salon, Mary for the flowers. They all made our experience 5 star in every way.  
The accommodation is beautiful,  we look forward to our next visit.

Anne Marie & Nico",5,2019,11,26
207,Warm and welcoming (most of the time),"I highly recommend this hotel for location, unique identity and recognition of Marriott Bonvoy Status. I stay here once every quarter for business reviews nearby. The food is excellent, 3 bars to choose from with the outdoor terrace a particular gem if the weather is good. The door staff are smiling no matter the time or temperature and they do not grimace at parking my old polo!
Quality of staff is generally excellent, welcoming and unstuffy, with a focus on the guest experience that is very welcome after a long day of travel. Brendan is especially amiable if you have the choice of check in desks!
However I have knocked off 2 stars based on poor experiences with 2 staff members, Iain on the front desk who is cold, dismissive and irritated by any request. I have noted his interaction with other colleagues before but only recently have I been on the receiving end of his silent and unfriendly style. He turned on his heel and left me with a more junior member to address my issue. How he is front of house is beyond me. 
The other staff member to avoid would be Denis, the concierge who is truly an old school snob and not inclined to give me, a casually dressed business tripper, much interest. I would direct you to call the telephone service and deal with a helpful team virtually rather than subject yourself if you need dinner reservations or help.
All in all I will continue to return to the hotel but feel sorry for folks whose trips are spoiled by a couple of staff members who let down the hotel.

207,"Location, service, history all recommend","This is one of the premier hotels in Dublin.  It is an old and historic building, and so it has had to be retrofit into a modern hotel.  The rooms are European-style compact, but filled with most amenities except for ample drawer space.  The tub is old style, and to use the shower you'll have to climb over the edge, but the shower is a very good one. The staff is marvelous, starting with the doormen who welcome you back each time you come in, and that is despite the fact that they are also greeting visitors to the public spaces in the front of the hotel.  By the way, both bars as well as the restaurant where we had breakfast were great. Over the weekend these were busy and exciting. Just out of the door and across the street, is St. Stevens Green, and I recommend spending an hour walking through the green following the posted tour.  You will learn some of the fundamentals of the Easter Rising, that defines the consciousness of the city and Ireland itself. It is also a short walk to most of the other sights to be seen in the city, and the pubs and stores you will want to visit. I would stay there again when we return to Dublin.",5,2019,11,23
207,FABULOUS!!!,"We stayed here recently for our 14th wedding anniversary, Wow what a place!!! We stayed in a beautiful suite which was so luxurious!! Staff were so professional and welcoming in particular Lucius who was so helpful he even gave us a mini tour of the hotel including the constitution room and a history lesson!!.   We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel....food was exceptional they even had a card and some treats in our hotel room to acknowledge our wedding anniversary. We found the staff very friendly including Daniel (sorry cant remember other guys names who dealt with us i have a son called Daniel) who served us dinner and made us feel very relaxed for a top class dining experience.. after dinner we also called into a couple of local bars on the recommendation of the staff at the Shelbourne.. we had a great night and great experience all around.. Thanks guys!!

Highly recommend this hotel as a must stay in such a beautiful city!!",5,2019,11,19
207,Another great stay ,This was the third time we stayed in the Shelbourne. Once again couldn’t fault it. Service is really second to none. Room was spotless and very comfortable. Breakfast is delicious and we also enjoyed a few drinks in both bars. Didn’t have dinner there as so many restaurants to try in the city. Great location for shopping / theatre / restaurants/ bars etc. ,5,2019,11,18
207,Night in Dublin.,"Growing up in Dublin I always wanted to stay in the Shelbourne Hotel it seemed like the the height of glamour and sophistication.
I no longer live in Dublin and took the opportunity to stay here when visiting Dublin.
Excellently situated for visiting the City.
It was nice. Nice room, comfortable bed, spotlessly clean but no view.
A maze of corridors to negotiate to find the room, easy to get lost.
To be honest it didn't live up to my expectations, I have stayed in nicer, fancier hotels in big cities all over the world at a fraction of the cost.

I  think it trades a lot on its name and past grandeur.

However if you can secure a weekend  price deal take it as everyone should be able to say they  have stayed in the ""Shelbourne"" at least once.

207,Fab service,"I work near the Shelbourne. Having injured my back recently, I found it difficult sitting in my office chair for long periods. Having some documents to review, and not wishing to walk far, I popped into the Shelbourne main bar to sit in a more comfortable chair to work during my break time.
€5.50 for a cup of coffee is probably one of the most expensive in Dublin! The accompanying toast was fine, but the butter was rock hard. The coffee wasn't great, and my chair was too soft. An older couple who sat at the adjacent table also passed comment when they sank, rather than sat, into their chairs!
Although the refreshments and furnishings could have been better, what made visit a positive experience was the wonderful customer service. 
A friendly waitress from Argentina served me. When I paid my bill to the waiter, Derek, he was just lovely.It was evident he loves his job in the Shelbourne. He treated me as a valued customer, even though I only had coffee and toast! Derek also delivered a wonderful service to the elderly couple beside me. 
The staff service alone would be enough reason to return! 😀",4,2019,11,17
207,"Lovely hotel, great location","Hotel is very nice and conveniently located.  But I guess to me it is just an average upscale hotel. My husband is a Lifetime Titanium Marriott member and there is really no benefit to staying at this hotel with this status.  There is no concierge lounge but they do give you a full breakfast which was very nice except for the McDonald's-like hash browns (this shocked me). My husband was not offered an upgrade but that didn't surprise me as this hotel is constantly booked so they don't really care about honoring you with special treatments. I was further disappointed when they did not make up our room one day and we were offered nothing for the inconvenience! At Marriott hotels you can choose to not have your room serviced and get points in exchange. That one thing definitely affected my opinion of this hotel. Our view was of office buildings and the bed was rather hard. We wanted to open the window and get the nice cool air in the room to sleep but with the all night lights of the office buildings we either had to put up with the light coming into our room or not get that much affect from having the window open. The everyday staff were really nice especially during breakfast. For the money, next time we go back to Dublin, we will AirBnb it, no real desire to stay here again.",3,2019,11,15
207,Honeymoon weekend visit,"Had a great time here, room overlooking the green was amazing - bathroom was huge with separate shower.
Friday/Saturday night in all the bars was a real buzz, enjoyed starting the evenings sat at the horseshoe bar. Heaving with locals not just guests and that really adds to the atmosphere I think.
Highlight though was coming back to the 1824 bar for cocktails later on, great atmosphere and love the murals either side of bar - nice touch handing out the sheet to explain who all the people are up there when you see confused faces ha.
Special mention to cocktail master Nicholas - a true gent and a pro. Cheers for introducing me to Glendalough gin - its a winner.
Had a perfect stay and will use Shelbourne as a base for any future Dublin visits - class act.",5,2019,11,14
207,Just WOW,"I stayed in the Shelbourne 3 years ago when I was visiting Ireland and came back this time just for dinner and drinks. I was always fond of the Shelbourne and I would love it no matter what but... My God what a change! This is not the same hotel as it was before, this is now the hotel that was always meant to be - just glorious. Well done to GM. I was especially impressed with the Saddle room this time, not the same restaurant as it was, it is really glamorous now, has this old feel and it is wonderfully Irish. I will definitely be back.",5,2019,11,14
207,Amazing!!,"What a fabulous hotel. Full of character staff were amazing! The GM runs a fabulous hotel, the staff are friendly and welcoming, the suites are luxurious. Came for some R & R and was not disappointed. Thank you - We will be back!",5,2019,11,13
207,Best stay ever!,"What an amazing stay we have had at the Shelbourne! Rooms are fantastic!  Staff so professional and helpful!  In particular, Paul at the concierge desk helped us with a failed tour to rebook and get our money back. So thankful for his personalized attention!  Highly recommend this as a place to stay in Dublin!",5,2019,11,12
207,The best hotel in Dublin!,"We received a strong recommendation for the Shelbourne from friends (and other we met in Ireland), and still the Shelbourne exceeded our expectations.  The location is great for walking to all of the major attractions that we had planned.  From the moment we arrived the staff was helpful and friendly.  The doorman, Richard, was great with his recommendations in addition to the concierge desk.   Breakfasts and dinners were extraordinary!",5,2019,11,11
207,Google Visit/ Pleasure Trip,"This hotel is simply the best I’ve ever stayed at.  The touches of high-end elegance, the food and beverage offerings, and decor throughout the hotel are spectacular.   The staff were well trained and very accommodating throughout the entirety of our stay. 

The location was right in the heart of downtown and easy walking to parks shopping and other restaurants.... and the Guinness factory wasn’t too far away either. ",5,2019,11,10
207,Afternoon Tea,We had a wonderful afternoon tea experience at the Shelbourne. The staff were very attentive and helpful and the portions very generous. A really enjoyable experience. Unfortunately that was somewhat soured when we went into the Horseshoe bar for a drink afterwards and were served by one of the rudest barmen I have ever experienced. An appalling manner which made us regret going in there at all and took a real shine off the day. Really disappointing and not what you would expect from a hotel of that calibre.,3,2019,11,09
207,"Beautiful hotel, friendly and helpful staff, amazing location","My wife and I stayed in the Shelbourne for one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We have 2 young kids so this was a big treat to have a day and night to ourselves! From the moment we arrived in the Shelbourne, we were made to feel likely royalty. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite with complimentary champagne and we spent the most wonderful 24 hours in the care of the kindest and most attentive staff imaginable. A huge thank you to Lucius Farrell and his staff who made us feel so special.",5,2019,11,07
207,Nice cocktails,"Hotel has nice bar with amazing cocktails. We enjoyed the ambience of the hotel, great location and restaurant serves tasty food. Specifically, we went to enjoy our evening and have several excellent cocktails.",5,2019,11,05
207,Very nice,"The Shelbourne Dublin is a beautiful hotel with a great location in the center and across from a park. The rooms are comfortable. Service at check in was efficient. The building is historic, but completely modernized. There are three bars/lounges. All of them were standing room only at 5pm on a Friday. We wanted to enjoy a relaxing drink, but this place is too popular! The entire lobby was packed also. ",4,2019,11,04
207,Soiree at the Shelbourne,"We had the most special evening in the Constitution Room last Friday night, celebrating my Husbands birthday
Our thanks to all the fantastic staff at the Shelbourne Hotel who looked after us from start to finish 
A special thanks to Ileana, Samuele & the private dining staff who served us on the night . They made everything so memorable for us. We love the Shelbourne Hotel & it's warm inviting interior & people. Well done to JP for Managing a wonderful team of people who exude warmth from the moment you enter the front door
Keep up the fantastic efforts

207,Just wow,"I dont even know where to begin! So i may as well start with saying that that was the BEST meal i have ever eaten in my entire life on this planet! I laughed after the first mouthful as it was so ridiculously delicious i simply didnt know what else to do! 

We had the chateau briand to share, after we had chosen from the array of steak knives  presented in a wooden box, the steak was then carved table side! We wanted a slightly different sauce for our steak that was not on the menu (port&red wine jus) this was no problem at all! The staff both at the horseshoe bar and the saddle room were incredible! The whole experience from entering the door to leaving was second to none! 

Apologies for the essay but it really was the best! Id like to thank everyone at the shelbourne for making my gf's bday meal so incredibly special",5,2019,11,02
207,Amazing!!!,"Beautiful hotel right across from St. Stephens green. Amazing suite with separate living room,  bedroom,  study and bathroom.  Huge! Marble bathroom showers and floors. China tea cups and crystal leaded wine, and champagne glasses in the room with coffee and tea service.  Turn down service was very nice with slippers put out by the bed and water with glasses on the night stand. The breakfast was delicious and great service. There's a few bars and restaurants and high tea is offered. Very classy hotel.  Loved it and didn't want to leave",5,2019,10,31
207,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of dublin,"We stayed here for two nights at the end of our ireland trip and throughout enjoyed it! We had one of the older rooms which are good maintained and charming. People had been always very friendly and especially in the bar the young staff had a great knowledge. We asked where the oysters are from and how they produce the delicious bread and they could tell as everything about it. Nice touch!
The breakfast was perfect with great a la carte dishes and an attentive service. Overall it´s a recommendation for sure!",5,2019,10,31
207,"Superb Stay at the Shelbourne, never fails to impress","Fantastic hotel from the moment you arrive until the time you leave.  Service is excellent,  Room overlooking St. Stephen's Green was spacious with beautiful interior decor.  The staff were so pleasant and efficient, always ready to make your stay as pleasant as possible.  Could not fault this hotel.  Top Class.",5,2019,10,31
207,Charged me twice!,"Lovely hotel but they charged me $1250 two times upon checkout and then told me they didn't know how to charge it back because it was my DEBIT card. Meaning they took real money from me. Asked to speak to a manager and was denied. Was assured the problem would be resolved and had a plane to catch. It's been a week, I've spoken to 3 different supervisors, still haven't had this resolved. How can a 5 star hotel treat its guests this way?",1,2019,10,29
207,Beauty and History,"This hotel is stunning in every way. From its very efficient staff to its beautiful interiors, everything about The Shelbourne is first rate! Comfortable rooms, delicious food, several gathering spots for festivities large or small, and a very convenient location make this a must-stay place in Dublin. Ask to see the Constitution Room, where the Republic of Ireland’s Constitution was created.",5,2019,10,27
207,Overall incredibly disappointing ,"Having paying just under €500 just for a room for the night, myself and my travel partner were very disappointed to find 2 small double beds in our room instead of the requested one queen size. The room was quite small and incomparable to other luxury hotels such as the westbury which is far superior and better value. Breakfast wasn’t included and was €30 Extra each which I think is ridiculous having paid so much for the room. We found the reception staff incredibly helpful however the night doorman and one of the barmen was incredibly rude to members of our party. Unfortunately we were really disappointed about the stay overall as we had really high expectations and our bill in total came to close to €1000 which we definitely didn’t think was worth it. Would definitely return to staying in the westbury in the future :( ",1,2019,10,24
207,Best of the Best ,This is honestly one of the best properties I have ever visited! The room was incredible and overlooking the beautiful St Stephens Green. The location is second to none but what really makes this property so amazing is the highly skilled and courteous staff who honestly can’t do enough for you. ,5,2019,10,23
207,Great Stay,"Service is very prompt, any issues were fixed very quickly. VIP treatment all the way. I was offered an upgrade but didnt take it, our room was very nice and quiet on a high floor. Front desk and back office all so helpful and nice, location is perfect.",5,2019,10,23
207,Great views ,"My wife and I stayed here for 1 night on our Irish getaway. It was one of the best hotels we have stayed it. My wife said that if she was going to buy a hotel robe it would be this one, and they had bath salts to soak in after a long day exploring. Our room overlooked the park entrance and it was beautiful. We absolutely will stay here again. It was easy to walk to everything we needed/wanted to see. ",5,2019,10,18
207,Very nice!,"The staff is first class, down to the last one. Service oriented 100%. The room was quite small and the bathroom vanity was very low and also tiny. The decor for the entire hotel is gorgeous and elegant, including the guest rooms. We had trouble with the hot water in the shower so took 2 very cold showers until my husband figured out that if he left the hot water running in the sink, it would also make it to the shower. Then showers were fine but I do, of course, hate wasting water. All in all a very nice place to stay smack in the middle of lots of shops and restaurants. ",4,2019,10,18
207,Fabulous hotel!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Shelbourne! Everything was top notch. The service is excellent, lobby and bars are just gorgeous, our room was very nice and spacious and quiet! The main restaurant for breakfast and dinner, the Saddle room was our favorite restaurant in Dublin. Breakfast was cooked to order and the Chateaubriand at dinner was outstanding!
I loved the quaintness of the 1827 bar and felt like I was having a cocktail in someone's very nice library at their estate home. 
It is in an excellent location and I highly recommend it as an old world fancy hotel with all the modern amenities. Again, the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home. I hope to return and stay again.",5,2019,10,17
207,Beautiful hotel with fantastic staff.,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for 4 nights. The staff were all great! Friendly without being stuffy. My room was large and beautiful, and the common areas were magnificent. I will definitely stay again at the Shelbourne when I return to Dublin.",5,2019,10,15
207,Five Star Service!!,"It was not difficult to understand why this hotel is rated Five Stars. Our stay was, by far, the most enjoyable of the three we stayed at during our recent trip to Ireland/England. While our original room (an upgrade) was entirely acceptable in most respects, the HVAC system was not functioning properly, so, we were further upgraded to a suite designed more for royalty than a couple of retirees from the U.S. Thanks to Jason, the transition to the new accommodation was prompt and without effort on our part. Patrick was also helpful in every way. Beyond that, service in the restaurant and lounge was impeccable and all food was wonderfully prepared and delicious. No matter who you talked to on their staff, they were always helpful, friendly and most accommodating.The location is excellent and the role of the hotel in Irish history is well known and most interesting. Upon our return to California, we discovered the hotel has their own series on Netflix! If you want a preview of the kind of excellence they strive for, check it out.",5,2019,10,13
207,I would give it 10 stars if I could.,"The Shelburne is an enchanting, elegant hotel. It's magnificent entry invites you to a supreme level of comfort. The rooms are spacious and the beds are divine. 
We arrived in the middle of the night to a young gentleman putting on his jacket...I appreciated the respect very much. Jason at the .ain't desk was outstanding.  He had polish, charm and humor, and so much knowledge.  I know that people expect the Shelburne to be as magnificent as it is physically, but the feeling you get it s comfort a d exceptional. 
We also enjoyed our meals. The Shelburne made our trip for us.",5,2019,10,12
207,Fantastic Stay,"The Afternoon Tea on the Lord Mayors Lounge can not be missed.  Great experience for my wife and I. We are vegetarians and they had a special vegan tea menu.

We had a 17 night stay in September 2019 and the room and service were super.  

Location is great.  

Helpful for an older couple for getting around.",5,2019,10,10
207,Simply splendid Shelbourne!,"We stayed at The Shelbourne at the beginning and end of our 2 week stay in Ireland, and our stays were the perfect bookends to our family vacation! We usually stay at another 5 star hotel in Dublin, but this trip we decided to try The Shelbourne, and I’m so happy that we did! Amazing accommodations and perfect location = happiness in Dublin!",5,2019,10,09
207,Great spot ,As you would except a great spot!  Great service. Clean and comfortable rooms. Bar staff and environment is amazing. It was busy on Monday and Tuesday night. Bloody Mary and Gun and Tonics are amazing! ,5,2019,10,05
207,"The Best in Dublin, Location and Beauty is a standout!","Loved this last Hotel on our recent Tauck Tour in Ireland.  The location can't be beat across from Trinity College. The staff is wonderful,  The breakfast was lovely too.  You will see all kinds of dress in the Hotel lobby from very stylish to casual.",5,2019,10,03
207,Fur Coat No Knickers,"We stayed here back in February.  I have nothing good to say about this hotel. A lot of the problems that we encountered had to do with the quality of the staff.  

Despite booking a Deluxe King Room, we were given a room with a very small double bed that would not comfortable fit two adults. After raising the issue with the front desk, we were moved and that room was fine - nothing special, but fine all the same.

Prior to going out for the evening, we met a friend in No. 27. This busy bar was understaffed and as a result tables were overflowing with dirty dishes and empty glasses. The waitress that whose attention we were finally able to get was disgruntled. The decor and general layout of the room is unwelcoming.  

Breakfast the next morning was shockingly bad - again problems with service, which was slow with serving tea and coffee and clearing plates. 

The spa is underwhelming - in fact to call it a spa is really misleading.  Essentially, it's a swimming pool, gym, a swedish sauna, and a wet sauna. The treatment that I had was just OK.

There was a lot of confusion upon check out and I did not feel comfortable that everything was taken care of properly.  My suspicions were correct when we got our credit card bill and we had been charged twice for the room. In the end, it got sorted, but I definitely was not impressed.

Why this is considered a Dublin institution is beyond me. There are much better places to stay in the city.",1,2019,10,01
207,A Superb Night at the Shelbourne,"In town for the week before St. Patrick's day, and the last night of our stay we got priced out of the Westin, only to find that the Shelbourne (!!) had a room within our company's travel budget, so we packed up our bags and slummed them up to the Shelbourne, where we were treated like royalty for our one night at the hotel.

An army of attendants greeted us between the sidewalk and the front desk, and after checking in, we had a slight detour due to some renovations to find the elevator which took us up to our floor. My room was small, but immaculate and handsomely appointed. I *loved* the framed drawing of Liam Neeson which hung above the luggage rack, and I slept very soundly indeed knowing that a man of his stature and ""particular set of skills"" was watching over me.

My sleep that night was perfect, and after washing up went down to the breakfast room to eat at the excellent breakfast buffet. Service was five-star, with attendants whisking away unused china and cutlery and replenishing used items with clean ones. The food itself was superb, a veritable feast of hot and cold items, the pastries being particularly good. I downed several cups of tea with my food, and would have loved to linger over a local paper, but we had a flight to catch later that morning, so off we went.

My stay at the Shelbourne was exceptional in every way, and I can't imagine a better hospitality experience in Dublin. I'll come back in a heartbeat if my company will pay for it. :)",5,2019,09,30
207,First rate experience,"The service exceeded my already high expectations at this hotel. Every single member of the staff was professional and helpful from the minute we arrived. As a Marriott Titanium member, I received a nice room upgrade. We loved being walking distance from many attractions and near a number of good restaurants.",5,2019,09,28
207,Amazing...Love This Hotel,"We stayed at the Shelbourne about seven years ago, and things have changed - amazing 2.0!  Didn’t think it could get better, but it has.  From the time we arrived with world class bellman, a thing of the past, to checkin - all first class.

Our room was clean, classy, and appropriate for our stay in Dublin.  This is a fantastic location btw...  room service, and turn down service was all up to expectations.  Room service in the morning was fast, courteous, and classy.  We love the Room 27 Bar, and the Horsheshoe Bar for after excursion drinks.

If you are lucky enough to visit when the florist is changing the flowers out in the main lobby, it’s a spectacular event - amazing artisans.

We travel all over the world, and the Shelbourne is first class!  My only gripe is I had to leave!",5,2019,09,28
207,Incredible,My friend and I stayed at the Shelbourne hotel.  We had an amazing time.  The staff could not help enough from the start.  Located just a few minutes from Grafton street and Trinity collage.  Afternoon tea is a must but make sure to book.,5,2019,09,28
207,HOTEL FULL OF HISTORY IN CENTER OF DUBLIN,"* Excellent location facing St.Stephen's Green Park
* Reading the history of the hotel is recommended
* Stayed in room 584, a deluxe room looking at the offices at the back of the hotel
* Hotel seems to be always fully booked and you should be prepared to find your room ready for check-in after 15:00
* Room has a good size and comfortable bed
* Bathroom is also good size. Bathtub is narrow.
* Breakfast is served in the lobby floor. The waiters are very friendly and show great hospitality to each guest but sometimes you find waiting in a line to enter the breakfast area.",4,2019,09,26
207,Grand old hotel is in great condition,Enjoyable stay at the finest hotel in Ireland.  Bar and restaurant are excellent.  Rooms have been refurbished.  Pool and gym are good.  Ireland rugby team stays there so can’t be bad!  You are in the heart of the city.  Most sights are only a short walk away. The weather is unpredictable but the welcome more than makes up for it.,4,2019,09,26
207,Luxury All The Way,We stayed for a long weekend and as always the Shelbourne was spectacular. We were in a junior suite looking out onto the green. The room was perfectly decorated and very comfortable. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure everything is top notch. The restaurants are all delicious and again the staff was fantastic. ,5,2019,09,25
207,Top Shelf Hotel,"Everything about this hotel is 5 stars.  From start to finish, this hotel delivers on all fronts.  It has great grandness, luxury, location, service, bars and a super restuarant.  Excellent for business or pleasure.",5,2019,09,24
207,Beautiful old grand  hotel,We enjoyed our stay at the Shelbourne in Dublin.  We laughed at the slanting floors in our nicely appointed room....Which just added to the charm of this great property.  Quiet and comfortable.  We had drinks in one of the beautifully appointed bars.,5,2019,09,23
207,Location is Awesome..Staff is Professional and the Hotel is First Class,"Every aspect of the Shelbourne is top notch...the rooms, the food, the service....even the location. The building itself is a landmark. Old world elegance seldom seen today and as a member of the Marriott family it comes with those perks as well",5,2019,09,23
207,Great hotel!,"Hotel was attentive and wonderful. We did have an issue with the bathtub draining very slowly so when you showered it would puddle at your feet. Other than that, everything was great. Most of all, it was so close to so many things!",4,2019,09,20
207,Great beginning and end to our Irish adventure ,"We flew in and out of Dublin, staying our first two and last two nights at the Shelbourne.  The public spaces are elegant, check in and bell service were fantastic both times and our rooms were comfortable, clean and lovely.  I especially want to call out the staff in the 27 and Horseshoe bars.  Their service was engaging and their drinks were well made.  Plus it was fun to watch them work their craft on the signature cocktails.  We hope to return to this beautiful city and property again.",5,2019,09,20
207,Lovely hotel with incredibly attentive staff!,"The room and common areas of the hotel were very nice. They were both clean and well maintained. The staff was superb! My interactions wit the front desk, bartenders in the Horseshoe Bar , the wait staff in The Saddle Room and even the bellhop were all very accommodating and polite. It all made for a very enjoyable stay.",5,2019,09,19
207,Beautiful hotel,"Loved everything about this hotel from the history, architecture, service, floral arrangements, restaurants and bars. Location couldn’t be more central and perfect. Our king suite was very comfortable - although the a/c was either freezing or off (no in between). Unsure what we were overlooking as we were on the 2nd highest floor - appeared to be a courtyard but could see the other part of building. 

If you want a proper drink - see Nicholas at the Horseshoe Bar. Loved my Penicilin (premium single malt scotch, laphroaig, honey & ginger syrup and lemon). I then asked him to surprise me with my next drink and made me the best Rob Roy I've ever had. Not to be missed. So happy this bar was in my hotel.

Breakfast had a nice variety of foods. No. 27 Bar always seemed to have a lively crowd. 

Cons: Denis the concierge was useless. When we arrived, I realized my jacket had not been returned on the airplane when the flight attendant checked for me and I asked if he might be able to assist. He wasn’t very confident and said he’d “text his friend who works for the airline.” We also asked about booking tee times at a golf course and was never done. I ended up contacting the airline myself once I realized he wasn’t going to be helpful in the least and had it shipped to our next destination. 

Unfortunately, I can’t remember the room number (maybe 7th floor) but our room had a foul smell when we would return later in the day. Almost like sewage or something died in the vents/walls. The maids must have noticed, as well because our window was always open when we came back. 

Despite the cons, it’s a lovely hotel and would absolutely come back to stay, particularly if you have status with Marriott.",4,2019,09,18
207,Pure Luxury,Spent the night in this amazing hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.  The hotel is gorgeous and staff cannot do enough.  It was a pleasure from start to finish.  Made all the more special as we were upgraded to a suite and were given a lovely card and some chocolate treats to mark the occasion.  Breakfast was also delicious.  Hotel is also in a great location over looking St. Stephens Green.  Cant wait to stay again,5,2019,09,18
207,Quick drink,Walking around the Iveagh park nearby we called in for a drink.  Very good service and tidy venue.  We left here and went to Temple bar the round of drink was actually cheaper here.  Nice experience would go back for a stay,4,2019,09,17
207,"Classy, historic hotel - highly recommended","The Shelbourne is a wonderful hotel.  We were greeted warmly at the door and bags were whisked away through a  side door.  By the time we arrived at reception (in an odd location at the back of the main floor) the bags were there.  Check in was effortless and our room was gorgeous (bad view of office building but had no effect on our stay).  The beds had great quality mattresses and linens which we appreciated.  We made the most of the swimming pool and steam room which are quite lovely. I enjoyed a pleasant G&T in the bar one night but we ate elsewhere (so many choices in that area).  We had afternoon tea at the Merrion Hotel which was VERY nice but rather wished we had had it at the Shelbourne as the setting is very special indeed. We will do that next time as assuredly, we will stay at the Shelbourne again.",5,2019,09,17
207,Love this hotel but disappointed that it was not up to standard,"The Good, we really enjoy the vibe in this hotel and would always end an evening in the No. 27 Bar & Lounge even if we are staying in other 5 star hotels in Dublin. It is a great location for shopping and staff who are local help to make it a proper Dublin experience. We don't normally have dinner in the hotel as we like to try the numerous restaurants in the city, but have always enjoyed breakfast when we have stayed over.
The Bad, we stayed on Saturday 31st August and were disappointed with the bedroom for too many reasons. First we were not notified the room was ready due to the receptionist entering our email incorrectly and my 2 email ask if the room was ready after 5.00pm received no reply meaning we did not get our room until 6.00pm even thou we had dropped our bag and car at 1.00pm. On entering our beautiful bedroom we discovered dirt on the floor behind the toilet door, long black hairs on the bed, no tea or milk available only coffee pods and the windows so dirt on the outside that the view of the park was somewhat difficult. on requesting tea and milk we were surprised when someone eventually arrived with four milk pods on a saucer and a handful of tea packet, yes a handful and not a biscuit either. We reported the bathroom dirt and this was cleaned later when we were out for the evening. On using the shower in the morning we discovered that more water leaked out of the head connection than was sprayed from the shower head and attempts to tighten the connection failed. When we went for breakfast at 9.30am we were seated in the bar that we were in the night before due the everywhere else being full and had the unpleasant experience of sitting in front of an old convector radiator with a noisy fan which was trying to heat the large room. This reinforced the feeling, which start with not getting the bedroom on time, that the hotel standard had slipped badly. I must also point out that I completed the hotel follow up survey from JP Kavanagh
General Manager, titled ""tell us about your stay"" and detailed by experiences above. I received no response which is the reason for writing this review. And if you are wondering the room was over €600 for the night.",3,2019,09,16
207,Good vibrations ,"Walked into this newly renovated hotel to have a quick coffee and was drawn to the lovely piano music in the front lounge. Very friendly staff guided me to the other bar for coffees only - piano room was doing the set afternoon teas.

Again very friendly staff greeted me and I got a nice orange juice (with bits, yum) and delicious filter coffee with pouring cream.

Lovely vibe these days - the fuddy duddy atmosphere of years ago is totally gone; staff now are welcoming, helpful and friendly.

Nice place for a coffee on Saint Stephen’s Green ",5,2019,09,13
207,A classic - don't miss it,"The Shelbourne is a classic in every way - service, high tea, solid food, great location. Our room wa on the small side and faced an alley, but otherwise everything was fine. It is the place to stay in Dublin - in the center of the historic district with a big park right across the street. You can walk to everything you want - museums, parks, Grafton Street, restaurants.",5,2019,09,13
207,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","The Shelbourne is a beautiful hotel. We stayed here for 5 nights earlier in the month. The staff was always kind and welcoming and the concierge was very helpful with suggestions for pubs/restaurants that were outside of the tourist-y areas. The doormen were happy to chat and assist with grabbing cabs and helping with luggage. The rooms were surprisingly spacious compared to other overseas hotels I've stayed in. Beds were comfortable but the pillows could have been better. We didn't use the pool/fitness center/spa while we were there but they all looked nice. We had high tea in the Lord Mayor Lounge which was delicious. We also ate twice at No 27 Bar and everyone enjoyed their food.

The hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to Trinity College, Guinness, the Temple Bar area, and cross the river into the North Side. St. Stephen's Green is right across the street. The one time we took a cab was to Kilmainham Gaol (the prison) which was a bit far, even for us walkers. 

Overall, great stay, and would definitely recommend.",5,2019,09,13
207,Gourgeous Hotel with so much history!,"This is an amazing hotel!  The rooms are beautiful and the service is above and beyond!  The restaurant and bar were superb!  A special thank you to the concierge, who spent time giving us the stories and history of the Shelbourne!!",5,2019,09,07
207,Quick visit to Dublin,We stayed here for 2 nights visiting new relatives we had just met.  We were at this hotel in 1982 and it's been totally redone and is quite fabulous.  We had a lovely king room and the weather cooperated for the most part.  Staff was fabulous!,5,2019,09,06
207,Simply terrific,"This hotel defines excellence. Lovely rooms, great location, fabulous staff. Non-stop top notch service.Also, they have restaurants and bars to match every appetite and mood. Very busy when the nearby offices close for the day, but that adds to the liveliness. Expect  the best in friendly Irish services.",5,2019,09,05
207,Dinner,"Beautiful hotel. Not that expensive-€19 for Fish & Chips with minted peas & homemade tartar sauce. Delicious, presentation was exquisite, great sevice. Very classy but not snobby. Loved the whole experience!",5,2019,09,04
207,Fine Dublin hotel and location,"This was the last hotel on our recent Ireland vacation and it was a very nice place and terrific central location.  A lot of history behind this hotel/building that I won't go into, but current day hotel offers a wide selection of hotel eateries and bars that may well be the best feature about the property.  The rooms were very good although there was goofy uneven sections of the flooring within our room...not sure why and not a problem, but you couldn't help but notice it.  Staff was very professional and welcoming. Located right across from St. Stephens Green park and offers convenience to walking to many popular areas in Dublin including the national museums.  Would be glad to stay here on any future visits to the city.",4,2019,09,01
207,Great location ,"The Shelbourne is centrally located in the heart of Dublin.   Perfect location to the pubs, churches , Trinity library and shopping /dining.  As in most large cities, rooms area smaller then out in the country. The picture is of an upgraded room - which is nicely appointed and had plenty of room.  Breakfast was massive and expansive with all one could imagine . Looking forward to a return trip

 ",4,2019,09,01
207,Afternoon Tea,"We spent a wonderful 2 hours enjoying 'afternoon tea for two' at The Shelbourne Hotel. due to the fact that we do not drink tea we had a coffee, which was absolutely delicious!! as well as champagne - Rose, and I am still paying for it, to this day :)); 28.00 euros per glass!!. service was of a high standard, great music and surroundings, the cakes were delicious, the sandwiches little bland.",4,2019,08,29
207,"Location, Location, Location (and everything else)","We just spent  six nights at the Shelbourne and had an excellent experience.  The hotel's location on St. Stephen's green cannot be beat and everything about the hotel was excellent -- the staff, the accommodations, the concierge desk and the facilities were all top notch. The hotel was spotless.  The restaurants and bars were beautiful and the food was excellent.  We would highly recommend this property and we will definitely return.",5,2019,08,27
207,Amazing,"I have stayed here numerous times and i have to say i just love this hotel. The service in every department, the smiles and guest care is above and beyond going that extra mile to create that special feeling that you get when you stay here.",5,2019,08,26
207,Solidly Mediocre,"The Good
-  Great location on the green and close to main Dublin attraction such that they are
-  Nice public areas, well decorated restaurant bar etc.
- Good concierge and reception staff

The Bad
- Considerable service issues.   Two separate items lost (subsequently retrieved but required us to search through baggage room!)
-  air condition worked sporadically 
-  coffee machine didn’t work and only some of the wall plugs did
-  rooms mediocre at best and even with recent renovation are getting tired rapidly

The Ugly
-  Hallways smell like a cheap pub...  cigarette smoke with a whiff of stale booze and no air conditioning
-  significant cleanliness issues...  please see picture of pubic hair in tub
-  spa facilities are very dated and poorly maintained

Overall
Needs lots of work and a comprehensive re whack at the renovation to reach an international level 5 star product.",3,2019,08,26
207,Delightful Afternoon Tea,"Wonderful experience at The Shelbourne Hotel enjoying their fabulous afternoon tea. The selection of sandwiches, pastries and teas are to die for, not to mention the Champagne. 5 star service all the way from Thomás and Jamie. Highly recommend this experience as a way to sit back, relax, disconnect, enjoy conversation and watch the world go by. Thank you again so much for the attention to every single detail and unbelievable service. ",5,2019,08,23
207,Perfect start to our tour if Ireland—-prior to joining a tour group!,"We spent 2 days (1 night) at the Shelbourne and wish it had been more.  Starting with arriving from our overnight flight from Boston to find that there was a room ready for us...ah the luxury of that alone was enough to earn them 5 stars!  The bellman who greeted us at our cab was exceedingly helpful and brimming with hospitality.

In fact every member of the staff seemed to be endlessly polite, of good cheer, helpful and intent upon making our stay as perfect as possible.

After a morning and afternoon of sightseeing, we settled in for a restorative nap.  The mattress on our bed was perfection.  We arose refreshed and ready to enjoy our dinner at a highly recommended restaurant nearby,the Delahunt.  Quite marvelous as well ( see review elsewhere).

Returning to the hotel, we were met with the wonderful tue Disney service of old---bed prepared, two chocolates on each side table, bottled water and fresh glasses on each side table and slippers as well!  When was the last time all that greater you after dinner?

Breakfast was a treat in the hotel restaurant The Saddle Room was delicious, the continental and full Irish breakfast offerings were plentiful, however, there was also a lovely ale carte menu as well.",5,2019,08,23
207,Lovely evening,"Stayed for an overnight before flying out the next morning. Lovely hotel - an institution. I had always heard about it, so it was amazing to have the opportunity to stay there. Great drinks in the Horseshoe Bar, too!",5,2019,08,22
207,Not quite what I expected ,"Renovations were ongoing so I got a discounted rate without breakfast. I booked for the experience as it’s a Dublin constitution and probably the only time I could afford it even though it was still pricey. The staff were very helpful and I felt they gave it the 5 star treatment. The room was quite small but comfortable. The bathroom had Elemis products which I liked. We also had a turndown service. The pool was small but quiet so we had it to ourselves. Parking is valet and €35 per day. You can’t beat the location as it is opposite the park, close to grafton street for shopping and Dawson st for food and drinks. Maybe the renovations took from my experience as some areas were closed and you could only enter the bar by exiting the hotel.",3,2019,08,20
207,Great Hotel,"Our first trip to Ireland and this hotel is the best in the city center. Lots of history and beauty too. We didn’t know but it was a favorite of Grace Kelly as well. 
We loved the 1824 bar when Luke made rhe best Jameson Old Fashion. 
We also visited the horseshoe bar where Nicholas served us well. 
Our last night we dined in the saddle room and it was gourmet quality. 
It’s a pricy place but the attention to service and detail are evident. 
We will return. Life is short, treat yourself.",5,2019,08,19
207,Absolutely love this hotel - history in its walls!,"My favorite hotel in Dublin, probably the poshest also, but worth the money as rooms, staff, breakfast, afternoon tea and bar is so nice! Located on the St. Stephens green park in city centre just buy Main Street Grafton Street:) 3 nights of luxury and comfortable beds. I recommend it!",5,2019,08,18
207,central location and beautiful,"We only stayed one night on our way home but we loved our large suit. The hotel is large with a few restaurants and bars, i think locals eat there so they were busy. From valet to front desk and room service everyone was accommodating. The room was modern and clean. The hotel is a 5* and worth that rating, i also didn't think it was very expensive so thats a win.",5,2019,08,18
207,Can't beat it!,The Shelbourne is my favorite hotel in Dublin.  Rooms are very luxurious and beds are super comfortable.  Poor service in the bar was my only grip.  Can’t fault the rooms and convenience of valet parking.  Great breakfast too. Fantastic spa and hair salon onsite. Expensive stay but worth it in my opinion.,5,2019,08,18
207,Amazing stay,So went to the Saddle room to celebrate our anniversary food ambiance attention to detail and the staff amazing especially the staff were outstanding very tuned in to their customers stayed here last december with our grandchildren lovely room breakfast was delicious unfortunately the same room wasn't available for this December so we have to go to the Westbury but will definitely try to stay in the shelbourne next year,5,2019,08,17
207,Absolutely Fantastic,"We recently stayed in The Shelbourne and it was just absolutely fantastic. The staff were amazing, so friendly, polite and professional. The room was spotlessly clean. The food was gorgeous. I had a facial in the spa which was one of the nicest facials I've ever had. Really looking forward to returning to The Shelbourne.",5,2019,08,17
207,Dublin's Elite Hotel,"The Shelbourne sits across St. Stevens Green with easy walking distance to most of the best sites to see in Dublin, Ireland. I could honestly say that I have never seen a across the board STAFF that is excellent as the SHELBOURNE.  Everyone we dealt with was an ultimate professional.  The Shelbourne is a historic hotel built in1824.  As we were sitting in our beautiful room we could not help but to think of about how many famous and historical individuals that have stayed in that room.  The room had everything you would want in an hotel room.  The breakfast buffet we had the next morning, had to be the best buffet we had ever seen.  The variety of items was fantastic and the quality of food was beyond excellent.  If you are planning on staying in Dublin this is the only hotel you should consider. Pam and Michael",5,2019,08,16
207,Would Give 10 Stars if I could,"I travel frequently  and am difficult to please.  Our flight from DC arrived in Dublin very early and while our room was not available the hotel arranged a room to “rest” until our suite was ready.  There was a lovely card, a very nice bottle of wine and chocolates.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  The saddle room was where we had breakfast daily and it was simple, very fresh and delicious.  The only comment I might make is that the menu didn’t change but it was extensive enough to satisfy.  The lobby is a hub bub of activity and the staff seemed genuinely warm regardless of how busy they were.

I absolutely loved the hotel!

207,Our favourite base in Dublin.,"We always endeavour to overnight at The Shelbourne when we fancy a weekend in Dublin (usually my birthday!) and we’ve booked to stay again in November 2019.
The location is superb for shopping, eating out, a stroll through the Green or a visit to Trinity College, the National Gallery, etc. The hotel is beautiful in all its public areas and even if we are only down from Bangor for a day’s shopping, I always pop in for a half pint of the best Guinness on the planet. Have eaten in the Saddle Room for both dinner (book well in advance) and breakfast and the food is always excellent. We’ve also enjoyed an Afternoon Tea in the lounge and the experience is comparable to any of the great hotels in London. Really pleased with the opening of the spa and salon facilities, which underscore the grand reputation of this lovely, historic hotel. Last but definitely not least, from valet parking all way through to checking out, the Shelbourne staff are always highly professional but with warm, friendly Irish charm. Highly recommended if you can treat yourself when visiting Dublin. Can’t wait until November 23rd!",5,2019,08,14
207,Historic hotel in the heart of Dublin,The Shelbourne is steeped in history. The older rooms have been in service for over 200 years. It’s a great location close to shopping and across an amazing park. The bars are busy and the food is good. There is a residents lounge for hotel guests with children who wish to dine at a later hour off the lobby.,5,2019,08,14
207,Amazing!!,"We spent our final weekend of a long holiday here for some luxury and comfort before returning home.  This iconic hotel lived up to everything I had read or heard. We were upgraded to a suite which was beautiful and so comfortable.  From the bedding (amazingly comfortable) to the bath products and well appointed bathroom, this was a fabulous experience.  The staff is top notch and SO attentive. And everywhere you look in the hotel, it is absolutely beautiful. 

We ate breakfast (included for us) in the Saddle Room each day.  The food was delicious and offered a nice variety from buffet to cooked to order items. One evening we had drinks and a light dinner in the No 27 bar- both were delicious. My only disappointment was that I couldn’t avail myself of the spa services as they were booked - definitely arrange ahead if you are interested. 

We have travelled internationally quite extensively and this is one of our favorite hotels. We felt pampered and valued as guests. We will definitely be back!",5,2019,08,11
207,Beautiful hotel,We stayed at this Hotel for one night after arriving from America. It’s right across the street from St Stephen Green and you can walk almost everywhere in Dublin from here. The staff was friendly and they let us check in early to rest some before exploring the city. ,5,2019,08,09
207,"Perfect, great location, impressed all visitors","Really great location for hosting our global meeting.   From arrival and valet parking to bar service and departure; all top class. 
Great breakfast, service everywhere was amazing.   Concierge was so helpful. 
Rooms were small, but very comfortable.  
",5,2019,08,06
207,Absolutely Fantastic Experience,"We rounded our 10 day Ireland trip off at the Shelbourne to experience a little luxury after being in the countryside for a week, and boy was it nice. As a Marriott Ambassador member i was given an upgrade to a named suite that had to be 900 sq ft. The crystal stemware, nespresso machine, and sitting room were truly stunning and would have been great if we wanted to host a party - we did drink some fantastic whiskey in the room even if we didn't host a party!

The bathroom was great with a lovely shower, huge bathtub, and two nicely appointed sinks. The bed also was more than comfortable in a well designed bedroom with both charm and modern amenities such as outlets where you need them. Every night we had lovely turn down service with slippers, chocolates, and lush bathrobes.

The hotel has some cool bar spaces from light and airy to dark and classic. While we didn't eat dinner or have tea we did go to breakfast which was unfortunately sub-par. Breakfast was free as an ambassador guest, but I would not suggest paying for it. 

The service was beyond spectacular with someone handing us an umbrella if we needed it before we left, people helping us get taxis, or deliver extra water to the room. And I loved having both sparkling and still water for both of us in the room, what a nice touch!

I look forward to coming back to the Shelbourne, but I do think they could build out their breakfast offering a little more. One of my eggs in the benedict was overcooked too which really just seems like such a shame :(",5,2019,08,06
207,Quintessential charm and classic elegance ,"We stayed at the Shelburne on business travel. From the minute you walk in the door you are transcended into world elegance. The gilded moldings are lovey. Fresh fliers adorned everywhere and were changed often. The service of the front desk, concierge. and restaurant was first class and responsive. The art of the cocktail is back in swing with wonderful mixologists. Stephen was fantastic and attentive!
The food was divine with multiple venues to dine inclusive of afternoon tea service. The location is in the center of everything with easy access. The rooms are spacious by European standards. We can’t wait to come back. ",5,2019,07,29
207,Five-star experience!,"We stayed here for 5 nights in July 2019.  The Shelbourne is a lovely hotel in an excellent location.  We were in a room on the fifth floor which had a view of the neighboring building, but since we were out exploring the city, the view didn't matter to us.  The room was spacious and bed was very comfortable.  Bathroom was nice with bathrobes and nice thick towels.  Elemis shampoo and bath products were in the bathroom.  

Bottled water was provided in the room (still and sparkling water) and they were replenished during turn-down service in the evening. The mini-bar was one of those that was activated if you moved anything so we were careful not to touch anything.  A kettle was provided for a cup of tea or coffee in the room. 

As Marriott Bonvoy elite members, we chose breakfast in The Saddle Room each morning as our benefit and it was delicious!  Hot breakfast items to include Irish breakfast, fresh pastries, variety of fruit, cold breakfast items (meats, cheeses, salmon), juices.  We had Afternoon Tea in the Lord Mayor's Lounge during our stay and the food and service was impeccable. 

The hotel is located across from St Stephen's Green. It's an easy walk to many of the museums and points of interest in Dublin (Trinity College, the EPIC museum, Grafton Street to name a few).  

All around outstanding accommodations and service!  I will definitely stay here on future visits to Dublin.",5,2019,07,27
207,Top class,"Beautiful hotel, staff are exceptional, location is as good as it gets, if you want a negative the breakfast doesn’t warrant the €30++ price tag but does any breakfast........
Would recommend and would return",4,2019,07,27
207,"Historic Hotel, Great Location","The Shelbourne is a destination in itself. The Irish Constitution was drafted here, British snipers fired into St. Stephen's Green from her rooftop, and so much more. It is very conveniently located to most of the goings on in Dublin, we walked practically everywhere. The Number 27 Bar is elegant but inviting, really good food and professional, courteous staff. We will stay here whenever we're in Dublin!   ",5,2019,07,24
207,LOVE THIS HOTEL!!!,"This is my new standard of quality! From check in to departure, it was first rate service in a stunning setting. The lobby is gorgeous, the front desk staff is welcoming and efficient. The room was quiet as requested, comfortable and the bathroom included a large tub and Elemis products. The bed was a dream and turn down service just added that extra to an already perfect experience. 

The service in the restaurant was superb as was the food for breakfast and dinner. The staff at the Spa were friendly and helpful. 

This is worth every penny and the entire hotel's attention to detail should be the gold standard for all 5 Star hotels!",5,2019,07,24
207,Disappointing stay,"The location can’t be beat but the hotel may be past its prime. Service is good but very formal considering how friendly Ireland is. The bigger issue was the room and recognition of elite Marriott Bonvoy members. Our room had a broken toilet, broken soap dish in the shower and basically faced the wall of a neighboring building. This was the best room available for a Bonvoy Platinum Ambassador member, with no recognition of status at check-in (I had to remind them) nor in the room on arrival. For a hotel with the claimed the stature and service of the Shelbourne, this was a disappointing couple of days stay. We’ll look to elsewhere on our next visit to Dublin.",1,2019,07,22
207,Luxury in central Dublin,"The architecture and internal design makes the stay worth while alone . Everything is seamless , and onsite amenities are world class . The restaurant and bars make leaving the hotel a chore , although the location means you can walk to everything you would want to see in Dublin . Special mention to the concierge team who spent our 3 days there looking from for our lost luggage from Etihad - over and beyond !",5,2019,07,21
207,Beautiful Hotel - Disappointing Bar,"On a recent visit to Dublin we were advised by friends to stop by The Shellbourne for at least a drink - even if we weren’t staying at the hotel.
After a long day of sightseeing, we did stop in. The main floor bar was full - it was a busy fun Saturday evening in Dublin.
It’s a gorgeous hotel - would have loved to have stayed.
We were advised to go upstairs to the lovely Terrace Bar.  Lovely wine & specialty drinks available.
Service was fairly prompt - lovely drinks were presented. 
The problem began when we also asked for water. Our server brought very pricey bottled water and - without asking - proceeded to serve two bottles of water at 8€ each.
Ok - we let that go.
Then one of our party picked up his water glass to drink & it literally broke in his hands - the bottom half of the glass broke - spilling the entire contents all over him & his clothes.
Our server seemed stunned - there was a couple moments of chaos as we mopped up water & our friend who was soaked.
There was actually not much of an apology & no movement to smooth over the unfortunate event.
There should have been some effort of genuine apology & probably an adjustment of our over 100€ tab for 6 drinks.  At the moment we were there.  Our friend was not amused to walk back to our apartment holding his jacket in front of him.
Later - after several email exchanges, management did offer to comp one bottle water and one drink.
Which has not happened yet.
Maybe a little late - think we’ll be passing on drinks at The Shellbourne on our next visit.
And they may want to reconsider their choice of glassware.

207,A very impressive Dublin hotel,"Do an Internet search for the best hotel in Dublin, and your search results will most certainly contain The Shelbourne Hotel. This hotel offers the full glitz experience at a really affordable price, and the staff especially are wonderful and attentive.
My room was a little smaller than expected but the decor was perfect. There were no signs of wear and tear and all the fixtures and fittings worked as expected. The hotel is located in an area where there are plenty of bars and eating establishments, so after dining locally I was impressed on my return to find that my bed had been turned down and slippers set out!
All in all, a lovely well maintained hotel that I would definitely stay at again.",5,2019,07,14
207,Afternoon tea,"Being a steak & spuds guy, I could never see the logic in Afternoon tea. That's until my wife booked it for us for my daughter's birthday last year in Dromoland Castle. And as everything is wonderful there anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed it. So on a recent trip to Dublin for a Monday morning meeting where we stayed over the previous night, I booked Afternoon tea at the Shelbourne as a treat for my wife. She really enjoyed it as it was truly fab & I have to say l am totally sold. Everything was magnificent & the staff are so informed & engaged. I can only recommend it highly except to add that a Guinness & select whiskey afterwards in Horseshoe bar isn't a bad idea either with a G&T for the lady! The barman really knows his stuff.",5,2019,07,13
207,Great staff great location ,"Perfect location to walk all over the city! Close to Trinity College, St Patrick’s Cathedral, Book of Kells and shopping. Amazing staff, and rooms. We arrived early morning due to our flights. They offered bag storage and a place to freshen up so we could continue our day. Only downside was the heavily fragrances entry. Otherwise a wonderful hotel! ",4,2019,07,04
207,"Highly Recommended - Great location, great property.","A great Dublin property that maintains trandtions and elegance.  Not a modern property, but still updated so the guest feels all the modern luxuries during their stay.  Excellent food in in the restaurant, and great meeting areas for conversations and visits.  Highly recommended.",5,2019,07,03
207,Excellent in Every Aspect,"We loved our short stay here!  Just wished we were staying longer.  All of the staff was very helpful and friendly.  And there were plenty of them at all times, too. Really made us felt welcomed!  The decor and fresh floral arrangements were exquisite!  Loved the beauty of the new Connemara marble in the reception area. Bed was very comfortable. And this hotel is very conveniently located to many sites in central Dublin.",5,2019,07,03
207,3-Night Stay 👍😍 ,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights before boarding Oceania Nautica Cruise Ship.

The Hotel was picked by the cruise line and was part of our Dublin Highlights Pre-Excursion Package.

I do have to say Oceania always goes all out and picks the best hotels right in the middle of all the shopping/theater districts. 

The Shelbourne is an absolutely awesome hotel with impeccable service.  The staff are very attentive and really nice. 

If we return to Dublin again to stay for a week I would definitely come back here to stay.

207,dinner and drinks,we met with friends for dinner. a la carte had a good offering we were given good advice from our waiter with chowder to start and had the lamb special. service was great and wine list is very good. we had the chablis fourchamps.following dinner we settled on sharing some cheese and headed off to the bar for champagne.  great night,4,2019,07,02
207,Venerable hotel in need of some polish,"We stayed at the Shelbourne 7-11 June.

We booked two rooms, one for us, and one for our college-aged daughters. We are also Marriott Bonvoy Titanium Elite, but unlike the previous reviewer, were not offered an upgrade on either room. The hotel was apparently full. Unfortunately, the room we were assigned had maintenance issues, including a heater that blew cold air, and a towel bar that was not working and, in fact, leaked water onto the shelf below. Maintenance staff was apologetic and tried unsuccessfully to resolve these issues. Housekeeping forgot hand towels one day, and my husband’s shoes that were left out for polish were not returned. We had to seek them out before our dinner that evening. We were eventually moved to a room on a higher floor with a balcony, which was lovely. Our daughters’ room had a view of the kegs in the alley. 

Staff (Ashley, front desk)was absolutely friendly and tried to help. The concierges (especially Jack) were very helpful and gave great tips on restaurants and tours. The Terrace and Library are great spots for a drink. Amenities like towels and sheets are as you would expect. We were not able to get spa appointments on our arrival day, so we went to the pool. It was a nice city hotel pool.

All in all, a mostly nice stay. But a little maintenance and review of standards is in order for a hotel at this level. This was an expensive stay, and I’d hoped for more value than I felt we received.",3,2019,07,02
207,Lovely service and spa!,"We checked in a bit late after a long day of touring, but were pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded to the Michael Collins Suite.  As a Bonvoy Platinum we were immediately thanked for our loyalty and was told we could have a welcome gift of $10 or !,000 points. I was very impressed by how nicely restored the hotel and suite was. It had an old 20th century feel with 21st century technology. We had a wonderful stay and massage in the spa. We will be back.",5,2019,07,01
207,What's not to love!,"Stayed here for three nights in June 2019.  Arrived early in the morning and eventhough check in is not until 3:00pm, our rooms were ready within a half hour.  Everything about the hotel is beautiful.  The staff is professional, friendly, and helpful.",5,2019,06,30
207,Delightful,"Lovely hotel.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Comfortable room.  Great restaurants.  A special thank you to all the concierges but especially Denis who went above and beyond to assist us.  Also, thank you to Tomas and lovely Khulan whose friendly service was a treat.",5,2019,06,30
207,Very worthy of a 5 star rating!! Excellent hotel!,"From the moment you arrive at the Shelbourne you are treated special and as if you are coming to visit old friends.   Greg at the porter/valet service is outstanding!  He was so helpful, kind and made us feel welcome and well taken care of.  From calling for us a taxi to giving us tips on Dublin and Ireland.  Julie at the front desk reception for check in and check out was just the sweetest and truly an excellent guest reception hostess.  Sara Diaz from reservations was truly amazing at setting up a wonderful dinner for us and helping to celebrate a birthday celebration.   The rooms here are lovely, spacious and well equipped with everything you need from mini bar, water, and lovely French soaps and toiletry items.  The beds are very comfortable as well.  The hotel staff in the bar, lounge and restaurant are also quite lovely and kind.   The bar is very classy and they made some specialty cocktails that we enjoyed as well.   When you walk into this hotel you feel like you don't want to leave.  After travelling all over Ireland, we found this hotel to be the best in all of Ireland.   Truly made our stay in Dublin memorable!",5,2019,06,29
207,Beautiful Old Hotel - Some Maintenance Problems,"Just returned from our trip and, having stayed at some really great hotels during our time in Ireland, this one disappointed us a little bit.  Let me start by saying that it is a beautiful hotel and we had two Heritage Premium rooms through our Marriott Gold membership that overall were well appointed, comfortable, and large.  We had drinks in the Horseshoe Bar, which was very intimate and the drinks were delicious.  Our final night, the whole family had dinner at the Saddle Room and we all loved it.  Service was excellent all around in the bar, restaurant, and front desk areas.

The issue that gives me pause and is the reason for the 4 star rating, rather than 5 stars, is that our room had several maintenance issues.  Several fixtures either fell off when we used them (the shower handle) or were about to fall off (the toilet paper ring) - we called right away and a maintenance person showed up and fixed them.  But the real zinger was that we had a huge picture window in our bathroom overlooking other buildings and not a single shade or curtain on it!  It appeared that there had been one, but it had fallen down.  We called the front desk about it and also told the maintenance guy about it (he said it was a housekeeping issue and he would tell them) but during our 2 night stay, it was never fixed.  My husband actually shoved a few towels into the window jams to avoid putting on a ""show"" for all the people in the building opposite us and on the street below but comically, the housekeepers kept taking the towels down when they cleaned, somehow not noticing the reason why we had put them up!

We stayed very busy during our time in Dublin, so after speaking to two different people about the exposed picture window in the bathroom, we just didn't feel like dealing with it anymore and kept doing our towel-drape method, which honestly gave our 5 star room a fleabag motel sort of motif.  

If it hadn't been for this, it would have been a perfect stay.  Hopefully the hotel will put more emphasis on checking the rooms for maintenance issues before turning them over to the guests.",4,2019,06,27
207,"A venerable institution, if you can't stay at least pop by and see","We were blown away by the architecture, the ambiance and the amazing staff...too bad we could not get a room (full house you know) the Number 27 Bar and Lounge is a lovely place to just sit back, have a beverage and take it all in",4,2019,06,26
207,Gorgeous City Centre Hotel,"We recently had Afternoon Tea in the Shelbourne Restaurant and it was absolutely sublime. The 3 tier layers consisted of fresh cut sandwiches, scones and loads of  miniature yummy treats.

The hotel has a really lovely atmosphere and it's decor is very eye catching and beautiful.

Staff were very friendly and happy to help out or be of assistance should you require it. 

We were particularly impressed with the main Guest Toilets.

The Shelbourne Hotel is spotlessly clean and i'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere really special.

Will be back!!",5,2019,06,26
207,Ireland trip 2019,"I could not say enough wonderful things about this beautiful hotel. From the time I arrived on a Saturday morning until I left 2 days later I was made to feel like a Queen. Even before arriving, the staff made me feel so welcomed and valued. The bar staff was amazing and I enjoyed my very first drink of Jameson's (plus a few more), ordered room service on my final morning and my meal arrived promptly and with great service. I truly wish I could have stayed longer in this amazing establishment, but I was meeting up with friends and our travels took us all over Ireland. I will definately be returning in the future",5,2019,06,26
207,Simply Bliss,"This is a first class establishment 
Did not stay .......but spent the day in the bar and restaurant 

Service was outstanding , bar staff knew their craft very well , don’t have to ask for a top up or fresh drink , it’s done 
Food was extremely tasty and plentiful 
The room and its charm created a wonderful ambience 
Even later in day when all tables and bar was full , the buzz in the room was magic
Would highly recommend ",5,2019,06,25
207,The Saddle Room,"We have just come from lunch in the Saddle Room, my family and I and we had a superb meal. The children's menu was wonderfully illustrated and made for fun reading, the Cod and Chips were excellent, we all had salmon and then the fish of the day, everything was faultless. We will definitely return.
We finished our experience by having a final drink in the newly opened to the public atrium bar, so pretty an atmosphere, a real gem. 

The Shelbourne is expensive, however the staff are wonderful as us tge service and food.
A must for a special occasion.",5,2019,06,24
207,We toured the hotel but did not stay,I would love to stay in this beatiful property if I could afford it. The concierge took us for a tour of the room where the declaration of Independence and or Constitution was signed and was very warm and professional.,5,2019,06,22
207,Beautiful and clean hotel,Hotel is beautiful and clean. Front desk staff is very nice. We felt the restaurant and bar staff think jeans are not appropriate attire to eat there. We went down the street to another restaurant that did not care that we were wearing jeans.,4,2019,06,21
207,Ms,"Can’t say enough on how wonderful my experience was.  The facility is spotless.  The service was impeccable.  Breakfast was amazing. The Horseshoe Bar perfect. 
All staff were professional but not snooty.  Greg was the most gracious and engaging doorman ever.  He loved the to travel and was a fan of The Boston Bruins.  I’d definitely return",5,2019,06,19
207,"Perfect location, most helpful concierge","A quick overnight stay and such a pleasant visit! Ideal location for exploring Dublin with limited time, be sure to pop into the lovely park right across the street, Trinity College and the Book of Kells just a few minutes away. Left or right, plenty of pubs with Guinness and fantastic live music. But save time for a drink at the Hotel and admire the beautiful details of this special place. Huge thank you to Paul, our concierge, who helped resolve a dinner reservation crisis-you are the best!

207,very good hotel - but not feels like a grand dame,"this historic hotel is Dublin's grand dame but some aspects are elegant and some are as an ordinary 5 stars city hotel, inc orgnised groups at the lobby.
the simple rooms are just simple rooms.
we had afternoon tea and it is recommended. the lounge is elegant and food better than
afternoon tea at some top London hotels.  location very convenient.
the price is too high for the experience.",4,2019,06,17
207,A Truly Unique Experience,"A truly unique experience at a magnificent hotel. True Irish history, with the Irish constitution written there. Marriott has done a magnificent job in restoring the hotel. True elegance. Your stay will be memorable. Service of the old school. Stay there.",5,2019,06,14
207,Outstanding luxury property,"We stayed here for a week.  While typical-sized to European standards (smallish for Americans), the room was well-appointed, clean, and delightful.

The breakfast was simply outstanding.  They have an incredible buffet, with exceptional service, and a true joy.

The concierge was very helpful with advice.  This is definitely a place we return on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2019,06,09
207,Wonderful,"My wife and I and ourtwo childre spent a wonderful weekend here, I really had to write this review as tehy truly deserve it. The rooms were five star and the food and room service was wonderful, but the bar was the most amazing of all
High recommend",5,2019,06,09
207,Irish Hospitality in a convenient corner of Dublin,"This hotel is a majestic grand hotel that has been thoughtfully updated. The rooms are quite comfortable, although on the small side. The breakfast buffet was extraordinary in it's abundance, both hot and cold foods. We also ate a very special meal in the formal restaurant. Service was impeccable and unassuming. The food was fresh and a served with a unique twist on Irish fare.  
The hotel is very close to the archaeological museum and not too far from the Book of Kells. Lots of good shopping in between. ",5,2019,06,07
207,"We had an AMAZING wedding here, but the accomodation side leaves a bit to be desired","We booked a small wedding here and it was flawless. I would recommend anyone do the same. The attention to detail meant that myself and my wife had virtually zero stress in the run-in. The food....it was incredible. We had about 24 people attending and ate in the constitution room. People are still raving about how amazing it was and how brilliant the service team were. In fact, the service made it. The team who looked after us and our guests were the most welcoming, polite and professional staff I've ever come across. Cathy and all of the team involved in the wedding side of things were incredible and I literally couldn't pick a flaw with anything.
We also decided that, as we were having a small wedding, we'd provide accommodation for all of our guests. There was nothing awful about the accommodation, but it just wasn't to a very high standard. We were constantly dealing with very small issues. None of them were big problems on their own. But it was just one small thing after another. Some small examples:
- Rooms not ready when our guests arrived at the correct time for check-in.
- Being sat down at breakfast and being left alone. Several of our guests complained about the lack of toast or eggs in the buffet. Apparently the waiting staff were meant to bring these, but they never did. The same thing happened to us both mornings at breakfast as well and we decided to skip it the third morning.
- There were a few small issues with the room, but we couldn't get through to anyone at reception or at customer care  on the phone to ask for help.
- I saw a member of the kitchen staff sneezing into their hands at breakfast
- We had paid for our guests' rooms. But on checkout, one of our guests was told their room wasn't paid for and that they would have to pre-authorise their card for the amount until they could sort it out. Not sure why the front desk didn't just call us in our room if there was confusion. We only found out when our guest told us. That was pretty embarrassing for us (and for our guest having to bring it to our attention). We had to go and sort it but it took quite a while to straighten out.
- When my wife and I were checking out, they tried to charge us for our pre-paid room, so I know how our other guest felt!
- When checking out, we were given what was left of our wedding cake. Luckily I unwrapped it on the way out and found it was the cake from the other wedding that was on that weekend.
I could go on and on, but we spent a few hours over the weekend dealing with constant small issues like these. I'd like to think we're not fussy, but this wasn't a hotel where things happen seamlessly.
On the flip side, the staff are very nice. We had amazing housekeeping staff and the guys who brought the luggage were super friendly. Staff in the terrace bar and in the residents' bar were amazing. 
In summary, I'd recommend anyone to have their wedding here in a  heartbeat. Don't even think twice. Just do it. But your guests might be better off staying somewhere else close by. 
I'd give the wedding side of things 5/5 and the accommodation side 2-3/5.",4,2019,06,06
207,Beautiful interior,Set in ideal location to visit the capital. In walking distance of many tourist attractions. Not worth the money for food as portions are too small. One thing that saves this hotel is staff are friendly . ,1,2019,06,06
207,Dublin's Grand Dame is in need of a facelift! (and a lot of training at the front desk),"Although the hotel has gone through a recent 40 million euro refurbishment of some of it's rooms and public spaces, many of the rooms are well worn and outdated. 
Upon checkin, and despite being a ""Lifetime Titanium Elite"" and a current ""Ambassador Elite"", there was absolutely no recognition of this loyalty. We were shown to our room and were immediately dispppointed. Having booked a ""Premium Room (Heritage room, concierge level) with a view"", there was nothing ""premium"" about it and the view of the air conditioning equipment on the roof next door was not a 'view' worth mentioning. After contacting the front desk, and asking about any possible upgrade based on status, the front desk clerk noted that he 'hadn't even noticed the status, please wait a moment and let me check with manager in charge of room assignments'. After coming back the best that they could do was move us to a better room for one night and we would have to vacate by noon the next day and then roll the dice on whatever room that they might have available at that time for our second night of our two night stay. We took them up on the offer and enjoyed one of their refurbished rooms (more in line with what we had been led to expect), and checked out the next day by noon the next day and moved to another property for our second night. Inconvenient, but the rate that they charge for the room were shown initially is excessive and unnecessary in a city like Dublin with plenty of upscale options. Additionally, there seemed to be confusion with the reservation, as it was booked with a ""concierge level"" benefit, however there is NO concierge level or lounge at the hotel. In lieu of that, the compensation is a 'gift' of 8 euros towards food and beverage, which won't get you a beer in the lobby bar. And when asked about the benefit of breakfast, I got two conflicting stories from front desk staff -- one was assuring me that, yes, it includes full Irish breakfast, and another then at checkout said it included only the buffet (not the al a carte items) when explaining the additional charge for breakfast. Also, at checkout, after being asked about the stay, I mentioned how dissatisfied I was, especially as one of Marriott's most loyal customers, only to have the front desk clerk 'attempt' to tell me that there was no record of our Marriott status or number on the account and would only acquiesce after showing her the reservation on my Marriott Bonvoy app (indicating both confirmation number and loyalty number). It seems that they are trained to say anything to make a guest happy/go away.  Obviously, there is a lot of training necessary at the front desk, as well as a much needed refurbishment of all of the remaining rooms.",2,2019,06,04
207,Service and facility as expected. ,"We recently stayed for five nights. The location is ideal. Easy walk to Trinity college, shops and the little Dublin museum. A reasonable stroll to temple bar as well. Many good restaurants nearby. 

The hotel itself is a grand old dame. Rooms are well appointed as you’d expect for this class of hotel. Not the largest rooms but more storage than first appears. And extremely quite. They don’t build walls like that anymore. Ventilation system was also quite and easily controlled- no compressor starting up at night to wake you. 

Service staff was always hospitable, professional and accommodating without any pretension. You feel like you matter without any airs. 

The breakfast buffet was outstanding array - they should be for the price, but after their breakfast you can skip lunch. As a Titanium Marriott member, my wife and I were comped breakfast daily. 

High tea is a pricey affair but everyone there seemed to be enjoying this as a special event. ALL women every time I went by. It seems a ladies bonding time. 

The 23 bar and restaurant serves late and was a busy and welcome spot for a light dinner or cocktail. 

Health club with lap pool, steam sauna and workout space good for those who like this. No jacuzzi, the only regret for my sore muscles. 

I never complain about pricing if I know costs in advance and they deliver. Shelby didn’t  disappoint. ",5,2019,05,31
207,"Overpriced, anonymous, forgettable.","Paid $500 for a cramped, oddly laid out room.  Yes, it had been recently renovated, but the heating didn't work and the space was so oddly laid out (hardly room to move around the bed; armchair and tv shoved up awkwardly against the wall at the foot of the bed) that it felt unwelcoming.  Minibar had horrible selections -- pringles potato chips and the like.  For a five star hotel, I'd expect some choices that were a bit less motel-6 like.   Clanking of glasses in the outdoor restaurant located several floors down outside bedroom window kept me awake late into the night.  In the morning, grabbed a (free) coffee from the ""hospitality stand"" in the hotel restaurant, which was shoved up against the waiters' serving table and littered with old sugar packets and debris.  This is a 3 star hotel masquerading as a five star hotel.  I'd advise the managers to visit the Merrion around the corner to find out what a true luxury hotel looks like.  On the plus side, both the staff at check in and check out, as well as the doorman, were helpful and friendly.",3,2019,05,25
207,Buzzing Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, staff were very professional and everything from food to fittings and furniture is top notch. Constantly busy in the lobby and bars, not always the most relaxing atmosphere but it suited me as I was traveling alone on business and enjoyed chatting with locals",5,2019,05,23
207,Absolutely Wonderful Experience,"We booked our hotel (a Marriott Renaissance, now their Autograph Collection) months in advance. We had a driver pick us up at the port from our cruise to take us toThe Shelbourne.  Best decision EVER.  The port of Dublin is a working port.  Not set up for cruising.  A line of literally thousands to get a cab after disembarking was daunting.  Our driver, Miles, was part of LfL Chauffer Services.  I can’t say enough good things about him.  He worked his way through the crowd, found us and shouldered all our “excess” baggage with him to the vehicle. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted and quickly directed inside as they moved our luggage in.  The hotel had just finished its refurbishment. Beautiful.  Our first impression was Irish crystal chandeliers and fresh flowers. Our room was ready early. Check in was quick and we were in our room, in 10-15 minutes. Our bags quickly followed. Breakfast buffet was included for us with our Marriott status.  Lots of good choices there.  One of the special parts of our too short stay was Afternoon Tea.  Our server, Tomas, explained the teas and made suggestions. He was a wealth of information about the tea, recommending which tea with which items (we tried 3 teas, EACH) and told us to take our time. It was lovely. He would check on us and our teas and chat.  He was a wealth of information on the change from Renaissance to Autograph Collection. Although still listed on some websites as a Renaissance the recent change to Autograph was a great decision by Marriott. There is apparently much more flexibility to be what they are. A historic Irish hotel with lots of history and classic beauty. The detail was able to be enhanced (think intricate plaster work, some gold leaf on ceilings, columns) attention was to the art, food history and their great service.  At meals the dishes and cutlery (much was original) were beautiful. Tomas pointed out the tea pots on the table being used to serve tea. Original.  We were thrilled with our experience.  We found a “fine hotel” that delivered.  A well maintained hotel with a cheerful and very helpful staff.  It’s on our list to return.  Soon.",5,2019,05,23
207,Dreamy!,"The Shelbourne is EVERYTHING a 5 star hotel should be: wonderfully stylish rooms with divine beds - delicious food - beautiful throughout with art and floral arrangements- wonderful concierges (Keith, Denis, Alan) and an entire staff that welcomes you on every level. We hope to return!",5,2019,05,22
207,Fantastic,"We stayed at the Shelbourne on a recent trip to Dublin and vowed that we will never stay anywhere else in Dublin again. It was wonderful. The service is outstanding, the property is gorgeous, the rooms are beautiful and have every amenity that one could need. We also had an outstanding dinner at the hotel. We loved it. Can't wait to visit again!",5,2019,05,20
207,Fabulous,"I couldn’t say enough positive things about the shelbourne hotel! We got married last September and stayed here one of the nights. They couldn’t have made us feel more special. 
A classy hotel, that’s professionally run!",5,2019,05,18
207,Birthday drinks served with style and a smile. ,I visited today with my daughter and had a lovely experience all because of a staff member. Thanks to Eva - who  is fairly new to the hotel I believe- our drinks were served with a smile. You can’t do a lot better than birthday drinks in a lovely hotel served by a great staff member. Thanks. ,5,2019,05,17
207,Wonderful in every way,"We regrettably had to depart after three days. From the moment you enter the hotel, you feel a warmth from staff at every turn. 

This hotel is expertly managed and the staff truly care about the needs of guests. The door staff were attentive, friendly and helpful with the car, directions and recommendations. Check-in was seamless. Bar No. 27 has a wonderful atmosphere and service.The resident’s room was fantastic for breakfast and dinner. There is a bar on the second floor for residents that is absolutely beautiful. The bartenders were extremely knowledgeable. As a result, we rarely left the hotel to eat or drink.  The outdoor patio is adorned with teak furniture, heaters and patio umbrellas and is a tranquil retreat. The Horseshoe bar is fantastic. The restaurant for fine dining is terrific.  Rooms are absolutely beautiful and are impeccably clean and impeccably cleaned.  The corridors are beautiful and are adorned with wall scones and pictures from scenes across Ireland. The fresh flowers in the lobby and on the tables in every outlet and public area are fantastic. I had occasion to speak to the three staff members who replaced the flowers today and they took great pride in their work. 

     We are very grateful to have stayed at your hotel. It was a sublime experience. I really hope the staff and management are recognized for their efforts.",5,2019,05,16
207,Beautiful hotel,"What a gorgeous hotel.  Gorgeous chandeliers and beautiful decoration.  Sat in the bar which is open to non residents and had a very expensive glass of wine! Apparently Princess Grace and President John Kennedy stayed there, we could only afford a glass of wine!!!  Well worth it though, the ambience and luxury of the place has to be experienced.",5,2019,05,13
207,"Fine, but a bit underwhelming","My wife and I stayed there last July on points for several nights and were a bit underwhelmed. A few scattered remarks:

Deluxe room I booked was fine though nothing especially impressive. Requested a ""Suite Night Upgrade"" as part of my Marriott platinum status, but no upgrade from what I'd booked. Then again, it was the height of the tourist season.

Friends were put in a smaller room than ours and were assured by reception that it was not the smallest category. Hard to see how that was the case.

Nice breakfast buffet and great staff to provide service and manage the many diners who flowed in and out of that restaurant.

Great, central location, including being right across the street from fun, beautiful St. Stephens Green, the city center's vibrant park.

Reception staff ok and professional, but compared to most Irish not particularly charming or friendly. 

Same goes for concierge staff, who were fine but clearly had just some standard, pre-packaged advice they gave all visitors. One negative exception to this was got no help from them in booking a Guinness Factory tour or even understanding the several tour options. 

Doormen quite helpful. 

Lobby areas smallish and not very charming. 

Place swarming with tourists (including us), but I supposed that's simply Dublin in July.

To get back to where I started: The hotel is fine in and of itself. But for a very expensive property that's supposedly one of the historically finest in Dublin, it wasn't particularly impressive. If you have Marriott points to burn, it could be worth it. But for a revenue stay, I'd think not. And if we ever get back to Dublin and Ireland, both of which we loved despite it being peak tourist season, I suspect we'll stay elsewhere. ",3,2019,05,13
207,West Britain's finest historic hotel,"I have stayed here recenty twice and has an old tradititonal room the first time  which had commanding views of Stephen's Green. The secnd tme I stayed in the newer annex, which was cheaper but not so special. I like this hotel very much. It is full of  Irish history; the new constitution for the Free State was crafted up on the second floor. The whole thing has an ""Ascendency"" feel to it and it remains a bastion of the Anglo-Irish, The small horseshoe bar is particularly special inasmuch it s rightly claimed that more government decisions are taken there thn i the Dail. The staff is superbly warm and welcoming. My only negative pbservation is  that the reception gets very crowded at times and that staff is stretched.",4,2019,05,12
207,Old world luxury,"I just love hotels like this, very old world elegance and no detail is forgotten. 
We had a fairly standard room and it was stunning! Beautiful decor and very comfortable bed.
The bathroom was very glamorous black and white marble, with plenty of storage space for toiletries.
Every aspect of our stay was impressive, from drinks in the Horseshoe bar and main bar, to the most exquisite dinner in The Saddle Room.
The location is fantastic, short walk to Grafton Street and in the heart of everything. 
Don't hesitate, stay here!",5,2019,05,11
207,Best way to start visit to Ireland ,"Shelbourne has totally lived up to its reputation. We arrived very early on 1st day. Room wasn’t ready which we expected. Only 6am. However checking person gave us breakfast. We are platinum with Marriott but this was unique. 

Our room was ready at 1. First room offered had some construction noise. The manager immediately moved us to beautiful 8th floor room. We were given a nice bottle of wine for hour inconvenience. 

The concierge was terrific. Recommended good local pub. Gave us reservations for key tours. Detailed instruction. 

Guest Relations worked restaurant even before we arrived. All in all perfect. By location unbelievable. ",5,2019,05,10
207,Luxury Hotel in Dublin,"Location is walking distance to the shopping area. waking distance to all the attractions.

There is a park opposite the hotel.
Food is great in the restaurant and drinks are free in the lounge.

Spa is also amazing",5,2019,05,10
207,🇮🇪 Still the best hotel in Dublin 🇮🇪,"Dublin has some very nice hotels. But it would be hard to say any hotel in the city is better than The Shelbourne . The place exudes history, class, and elegance. Combine that with its recent renovations and St. Stephen’s Green location and you have the best address in the city. 

We recently stayed two nights at the end of a 10 day trip to the east coast of Ireland. We were given a room with early check in but there was a problem. Two levels below the open window was a construction crew drilling and working on the roof next door. Even though the hotel was sold out, we were changed to a larger, better room. Very happy with the hotel’s response...

Over two days we explored the neighborhood pubs (O’Donoghue’s, Kehoes, Long Hall), visited the National Gallery, took the DART to Skerries, and walked the city.  At night we hung out in the Shelbourne’s lively No. 27 Bar & Lounge and the more quiet Horseshoe Bar. Just a great time at this beautiful hotel... 🇮🇪 ",5,2019,05,10
207,Elegant and excellent,"What a wonderful hotel.  Fabulous breakfast buffet;  great staff;  comfortable room.  Right on the airport bus route. Great location in Dublin.  Everything you might want in an hotel.  Quite expensive, but I was on a tour.   I was sorry I had to leave",5,2019,05,09
207,Elegance in the city,"We only stayed here for 1 night which wasn't long enough! All staff were extremely friendly and really go out of their way to help you. Wish I could remember peoples names so I can thank them for making our stay so cmfortable. Hotel its self is beautiful and the food is delicious (especially the banana pancakes for breakfast!). Also not forgetting the pool, no better way to end a stay then a nice relaxing swim before check out. Really deserves it's 5 stars, look forward to returning.",5,2019,05,09
207,The Shelbourne Dublin Experience,"The Shelbourne Dublin was an absolutely over the top experience.  From the time we arrived, we were greeted by John the Bellman outside, then receptionist as we entered the lobby (who seemed to be there all of the time)...her name unfortunately I can't remember, and then the people at check in.  They were all so very professional, helpful and courteous.  That night, we met Nisea the sommelier, Clive our waiter, Holly and Nick our bartenders upstairs in the pub, and several others. They were exceptional, as well. My girlfriend even had a fantastic spa experience. 

Can't say enough about this place.  The rooms were beautiful, clean and fresh.  All the little extra touches made for a great stay, right down to the chocolates on the beds each night.  

I would recommend this hotel to all.  You MUST stay here!!!",5,2019,05,08
207,Weekend city break,"The hotel is on the airport / city centre bus route and is ideal.  The buses run 10 - 15 min intervals and have free WIFI.
A variety of open top tourist bus tours stop just outside the hotel and you can be a quiet tourist or rioting Viking.
The hotel is situated within easy walking distance of Grafton Street, and Trinity College. 
The staff and kind and attentive, the beds are comfy.",5,2019,05,07
207,Area for residents only to drink alcohol.  Eating food not allowed.,We stayed in Shelbourne for a romantic overnight break. Went to get a snack at 8pm but small eating area full. Then went to residents only areas which had about 5 guests in them. About 60 or more free seats for residents.  Asked for a sandwich and told we could only drink from the bar. Food would not be served to us. This is a disgraceful standard and behaviour for any hotel. Very disappointing.  Finally returned to our room and ordered a sandwich from it. Such a disappointing experience.,2,2019,05,07
207,Great Hotel in Dublin - if you like to stay classy,"We stayed in the Shelbourne for the last three nights of our Ireland holiday and really enjoyed it. Our to little ones were happy to back in proper hotel after a week in various airbnbs. 

The hotel is located close to the pedestrian area, temple bar and trinity college. You can walk there in approx minutes.

I really like the luxurious interior of our room (prbably due to the kind upgrade at check-in) we had two large beds and the bedroom was bigger than my first flat at the time when I was a student :o)

There is also pool area which has specific opeing hours for kids. Ours really enjoyed playing around in the pool after a long day walking around in Dublin. 

IF you intend to take a tour with the viking busses, they start/stop on the other side of theroad at the hotel. If would come back to Dublin, I would stay again at the Sherlbourne!",5,2019,05,07
207,Afternoon tea - 5 star in every way ,"Just spent a fantastic afternoon at the Shelbourne, it really is 5 star in every way. The afternoon tea is an experience from start to finish, from the exquisite setting, background piano music, 5 star service and food. Our waiter Tomas was fantastic! Definitely the best afternoon tea in Dublin. Cannot recommend it enough.  ",5,2019,05,06
207,Highly recommended,"We stayed here for 3 nights. Upon arrival we were told that we were upgraded to a room with a balcony but we found out the balcony was simply in front of and very close to an office building ( the proximity of the other building made it obvious that we couldn’t even open the curtains ).
We immediately asked to move to another room but our request was rejected. 
The next morning we were fortunate to meet Iain, the front desk manager, who was very attentive to us and moved us to a different room. 
We were given a room in the old part of the hotel , facing the park- an amazing room! This is when our wonderful stay at the hotel started. 
Other than this misfortunate beginning, there are only very good things to say about this hotel:
-It is very well and centrally located, within walking distance of many attractions and in front of the beautiful park.
-Excellent and friendly concierge service. 
- Great breakfast buffet
Highly recommended !",5,2019,05,05
207,"Exceptional. Fabulous Location. Great Service, Great Rooms.","Spent a couple of nights here on a recent business trip. I had seen the Shelbourne previously, but had not stayed here. So glad I chose to stay here this time. The hotel is exceptional. The location on St. Stephens Green could not be better. All of the staff I met were so welcoming and friendly and professional. Loved the bar - great cocktails and wine selections, and also enjoyed my meals at the Stable Room. The food was excellent. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and in excellent condition. Comfortable bed, and good sized bathroom. I would prefer a walk-in shower over the older style tub/shower, but that is a small detail.",5,2019,04,30
207,Smokers,"The Shelbourne is a nice hotel in a good location. Just a word of warning for smokers, which is not an illegal activity in Ireland, yet. There is not a smoking area where you can sit and have a smoke. 
If you wish to partake in a cigar or cigarette you have to stand outside the front entrance next to the footpath, not even a bench to sit on. My wife has trouble walking and yes I know she should not smoke but chooses to do so and found this a hardship.",4,2019,04,30
207,Fantastic.  Highly Recommend,"This was a luxury stop for the last two nights of our trip and it did not disappoint.  As a Marriott Platinum member we received a wonderful upgrade with a balcony that overlooked the inside Courtyard.  What a treat...we were able to leave the doors to the balcony open at night and there was no street noise and lovely cool air.  The hotel room had a fan in the room as well, which was greatly appreciated as I sometimes find hotel AC units a bit stuffy (we did not need in April but nice touch for warmer weather ).  There was also one US outlet .  Amenities were wonderful.  Used the pool, steam and sauna which were also a treat.   We had breakfast included - outstanding! Full buffet as well as custom cooked options.  The staff were wonderfully accommodating.",5,2019,04,29
207,5 Star Treatment All The Way,Have not one bad word to say about this hotel. The staff are an absolute credit to this hotel. From the warm welcome we received from the concierge on arrival and the helpful reception staff who arranged an appointment for me to have my hair done in the shelbourne salon. Lauren looked after me in the salon and she was so warm and welcoming and lovely to chat to while having my hair done. We really did experience 5 star treatment from the moment we arrived to when we left on Saturday morning. Staff go above and beyond to attend to your every need and ensured we had a truly enjoyable staff. I look forward to returning in the future.,5,2019,04,28
207,Birthday cocktail 😥😥,My friend and I were here last week . I got a voucher for my 60th birthday.  €25.00 .So I took my friend for a cocktail.  I asked for the Cavan it was on the menu but they said they couldn't do it. So I had the Shelbourne Bramble.  My friend had the Wexford. My cocktail was more like an ice pop with raspberry juice it was just a big ball of ice. I was so disappointed I would not recommend it. 😥,4,2019,04,28
207,My mind was blown by this fabulous hotel and it's wonderful members of staff.,"I travelled to Dublin with my mom to try on my wedding dress. We were delighted to book into the Shelbourne Hotel for the night. Unfortunately as my mom got her bag out of the taxi, the defective boot door struck my moms head. Eamon Kelly (first aid at the hotel) is my mom's hero. He came to her assistance sat her down, cleaned her wound and kept us calm. He went above and beyond for us. He didn't realise we were staying in the hotel until he had finished treating her. Eamon was so kind. In fact every staff member we met enquired about how mom was feeling etc. We were blown away.

The hotel is spectacular. We will definitely be back. 

Eamon we cannot thank you enough. You made our weekend....my wedding dress was a close second! ❤❤❤",5,2019,04,27
207,Incredible Hotel,"Cannot say enough good things about this fine hotel.  Convenient location directly across from beautiful St Stephens Green.  Each and every staff member is pleasant and eager to help.  Special mention of Greg (doorman) and Patrycia/Sarah at Reception.  If you want to be treated like you truly matter, stay here.",5,2019,04,22
207,Great hotel in the heart of the city !,"It’s a big beautiful property right in front of St. Stephens Green and quite close to the heart of the city. 

The hotel has undergone renovations recently and the rooms are well furnished. Some of the basic rooms are on the smaller side though. 

The standout feature of the hotel was their fitness centre along with a heated pool, steam and sauna. Definitely worth the stay !",5,2019,04,21
207,It's a 5 Star for a Reason,Top notch from the minute we arrived.    I was so impressed by the level of service.  I did book through Amex and had some extra perks like room upgrade and early check in/late check out which made it even better.   The bed was so comfortable with really great thread count sheets.   Room was spacious.  Furnishings were outstanding.   TV was small but didn't care because we didn't want to watch TV.   Location is great in heart of Dublin.    5 Stars all the way,5,2019,04,19
207,"Beautiful hotel, convenient location","We stayed a few days here.  The service was very good. The room itself was so so. We stayed in the lower level and faced the back of the hotel,  no view at all.  The breakfast was good with lots of selections.  The location is very convenient and close to the hop on hop off bus stop, shopping area.",4,2019,04,16
207,Renovations did not hinder us,"You cannot pick a more perfect place to stay if you have only one day to explore Dublin. You can never go wrong staying across the street from the main park (St. Stephens Green) in most cities as there is so much activity and people-watching there. We were able to walk up Grafton Street 1 block away, Trinity University and to O’Connell St. across the bridge. We could also walk to Temple Bar as well as Merrion Square, the most beloved square in Dublin. The highlight for me was to be able to walk 2 blocks to the National Concert Hall to see the Dublin Philharmonic and my wife was thrilled with Gino’s Gelato for delicious ice cream so close by! AND, to top it off, we easily took the AIRLINK EXPRESS to and from the airport even with tons of luggage, which stops 1/2 block away. The renovation going on actually made it more fun to navigate to our room and we discovered a more convenient entrance.",5,2019,04,16
207,Best in Dublin,"We spent the last night of our trip at the Shelbourne, and Im glad we did. We booked on points and were upgraded to a fantastic suite (the Elizabeth Bowen Suite). 
Modern amenities with historic charm. 
We arrived earlier than expected and our room wasnt ready yet so we headed to the bar for lunch and some drinks.  Had the Oysters Shelbourne and Fish and Chips, both were delicious. 
Within easy walking distance to many of the main tourist attractions. Definitely a busy part of the city but once you're inside you feel insulated from it all. The door men make the arrival on the busy street much safer and less stressful. 
Sauna, Steam room,  and pool were completely adequate but not on par with many  5-star hotels . Absolutley fine, as that was not the main draw for us. The location and history of the property more than make up for it.  
Watched the The Shelbourne on Amazon Prime prior to our visit and it really enhanced the experience! 
Ordered a bottle of champagne and they ended up sending us a second  bottle plus a birthday plate complimentary.",5,2019,04,14
207,Weekend away for the theatre,"We stayed at the Shelbourne when we came to Dublin to see War Horse. We’ve always loved it and always have a drink in the bar when we visit Dublin. 
We decided to treat ourselves since it was our first overnight trip since having our baby.
The check in was smooth and the service excellent.
Our room wasn’t quite ready when we arrived so we went to the bar and had a drink. It was a very short wait until the room was available and the receptionist came to find us. 
When we arrived in our room we had been upgraded and have fizz waiting for us.
My husband used the relatively new spa facilities and he said they were lovely.
We came back after the theatre and our room had been turned down and slippers etc had been left by the bed.
Overall it was everything we hoped for.",5,2019,04,14
207,Amazing,"I absolutely loved this hotel.

I checked in at the tail end of their renovation (it was officially complete on my second day).  The new lobby was bright and posh.

Staff is outstanding across the board.  From front desk staff, doorman, concierge, cleaning team, it was great.

You could easily get lost in the hotel because it is a historic location and the layout is non-traditional.  I loved it though, even when I was frustrated about not being able to get down some stairs at one point.

My room was quiet (I was at the end of a hallway).  It also probably helped that I had my air running the entire time and it drowned out a lot of noise.

I enjoyed eating in the hotel bar and the Saddle Room, but near by is some great options as well.  

Location is fantastic.  I walked everywhere, except when I had to go to the main train station.  It is also very close to a lot of the day tours that meet at the Molly Malone statue before they head out of town.  And the tours drop off close to the hotel too (10 minute walk).

They offer an afternoon tea that is a must try, and the small bar on the second floor is a must see.  Grab a drink and sit outside if weather permits!

Robes, slippers, and a wonderful bathroom are pluses to the sleeping room.  I had tons of counter space in the bathroom and was thankful for the large closet.

The room also has 1 US compatible outlet!

I would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,04,13
207,Best Hotel in Dublin,"This hotel may not be the least expensive but it sure is a wonderful place to stay .
Service is first class and location is very central to all the highlights of Dublin.
You can easily walk anywhere you need .",5,2019,04,13
207,"Beautiful hotel,  prime location just a pity about the service ",Busy hotel with a lovely decor but service is poor. Buzz in hotel is what draws you in but have to say you will probably leave with the impression that hotel doesn’t live up to its star rating. Five star hotel with three star service. Didn’t leave a good impression on either occasion to be honest which is disappointing. Would not be rushing back. ,3,2019,04,11
207,Marble and crystal perfection in Top Hats,"From the first doorman, to check-in, bags arriving in the palace-like room....this hotel was spectacular!  The crystal glasses in the room, nightly turn down with mats, slippers and chocolates and even setting up the bathroom mats especially for night-time...not a detail was missed!  Champagne and oysters in the hotel restaurant and many other treats make this the perfect Dublin respite!",5,2019,04,10
207,"Mother & daughter 'l love me "" day","Well where to begin. A lovely Christmas present from my son which brought myself and my wonderful daughter to have afternoon tea at the wonderful Shelbourne Hotel. Greeted by the lovely warm and friendly Eimear. Our most tantalising array of sandwiches, scones(still warm) and gorgeous desserts were placed in front of us on a pristine white tablecloth. The sun was shining on our backs and our cups were never empty. Honestly if you just want or need a special time out, somewhere and with someone extra special ,the Shelbourne Hotel is the place.",5,2019,04,09
207,Great place to stay,The Shelbourne is a great central location for Dublin city center. The rooms are really nice and the staff are friendly and helpful. The bars have a great buzz and the food is tasty also. I love the Shelbourne for the bars and the location and would definitely stay again.,4,2019,04,08
207,Afternoon tea,"Yesterday was the first day the Shelbourne held afternoon tea after a 3 month break, you would never had guessed... the service and quality was next to none. The beautiful surroundings, the staff and exceptional food made it the most relaxing and fun afternoon we’ve had in ages. I would especially like to thank Khulan who was are hostess for the afternoon for the very charming and in-dept service she gave us. If you want to treat someone to a very special afternoon out look no further! I’ll be back for sure.",5,2019,04,07
207,Excellent service,Beautiful hotel. We picked this for our first day hoping we could get an early checkin based on my husband's status and we did.  The service in this hotel was terrific. We don't  always stay at fancy hotels and the slipper service with turndown was the cherry on the top. Good breakfast in the huge restaurant downstairs. Location is great across from Stephen's Green.,4,2019,04,05
207,First time in Ireland,We arrived in Dublin for a two week driving tour of Southern Ireland.  The trip could not have started at a better location.  The Shelbourne is a beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff.  It is centrally located across from St Stephen’s Green.  I can’t say enough for the quality of service.  We started here and will end our stay in Ireland with the last two nights at the Shelbourne.  We have a lot to experience but we are already looking forward to being back.,5,2019,04,04
207,The Saddle Room,"We went for the Table d'Hote special which included a bottle of wine for €99.00. We had excellent service and the wine was very much to our liking. The food was also excellent - we had the fish of the day, which was sea bass. The only thing was the portion was very small. We ordered 2 sides and we noticed that the table near us also ordered 2 sides!",5,2019,04,02
207,Fantastic ,"A group of us stayed here recently, from the moment we arrived until we left the hotel  management and staff made us feel very welcome.
The hotel lives up to it reputation, perfect location for doing & seeing everything.
Our rooms were wonderful very roomy, granted no view but that's a small price to pay.
One quip & i agree with other reviews if your breakfast isn't included in your stay its not worth the €30 / head, everything over cooked barr the scrambled eggs.",4,2019,03,30
207,Superb!,"My husband and I recently stayed at The Shelbourne Dublin and couldn't be more pleased with our experience.  

We were part of a group from the U.S. and from the time that we stepped out of our vehicle until our check-out, everyone and everything was incredible!  The room was spacious and clean.  The staff was amazing!  Everyone we encountered greeted us with sincerity.  The food we had was over the top!  

The location is perfect.  It is within walking distance to so many things...museums, galleries, parks, Grafton St., pubs, shopping, Temple Bar area, etc....the list goes on.   

We really enjoyed the ambience of the hotel and would stay here again should we be lucky enough to return to Dublin!",5,2019,03,29
207,Good,"I honestly had a lot of expectations for the Shelbourne due to its renowned reputation. I loved the whole ambiance and atmosphere. I am also amazed by how clean the hotel and rooms were which I would say is thanks to the magnificent Housekeeping team. 
The point I decided to deduct is due to FO, because their service was not as expected. I was told they were going to do preauthorisation on my card. Since I am familiar to this and a lot of hotels do this in the US, I simply declined. The guy behind the desk was shocked and told me that it is impossible not to do a preauthorisation. How come since this is my own card. There was no need for this since I prepaid everything and breakfast as well. 
Then I had to wait too much for check-in since the whole process is slow.",4,2019,03,28
207,"Tres chic,fantastic staff,great location,but some negatives","To start off, I will definitely stay again. The staff were welcoming and seemingly sincerely friendly,. the primary bar was jammed from 4 pm onwards with’ beautiful people.’.For  guidance, there is another bar only for guests, and the bartender knows her whiskey. The breakfast was included and was bountiful.we ate once for dinner which was fine but pricey. Having said that,the other area restaurants were no bargain but the food left no complaints.
On the downside, we couldn’t find our room on the 3 rd floor for 15 minutes due to poor signage and the maze like formation at the hotel. The actual flooring on the 3 rd floor was not level which was bizarre but quirky.. 
Finally, we had checked in early. I was told my room was ready. I found it after wandering around on the 3rd floor, but upon entry I found that the room was still occupied. Staff were v apologetic and provided a free meal.
Overall, this is a hotel I would recommend notwithstanding.....",4,2019,03,26
207,Incredible!,"I had the most amazing stay and that was down to every fine detail. I was there for my 30th and the staff and hotel went the extra mile with complimentary wine, cakes and a handwritten birthday card. The breakfast was amazing and the service and kindness of all staff from checkin to cleaners to room service was exceptional. Thank you for making my night in the Shelbourne one to remember.",5,2019,03,24
207,Disappointed visit to the Shelbourne,"First, while our experience was during renovation, our experience still was not what we expected, based on the Shelbourne’s reputation. We were less than impressed by The Shelbourne which struck us as very “snooty”, and not five-star as advertised. 

Our overall arrival was a terrible experience. The check in process was slow, unaccommodating, not personalized and rushed, much like cattle being herded. In fact, staff could not even show us to our room correctly- miss directed twice. I asked the reception if they had a electrical plug adapter since I was not able to find one locally and was told they do not have for guests. I actually asked the following evening and was told they would find me one, which they eventually did. Finally, we asked for our bags to be delivered to our room, and when we returned later that afternoon, they still had not been delivered. On our second night, the room was cleaned and no towels were left, again we called to have towels delivered. 

That evening, we had a reservation and needed a taxi. We walked through the lobby, and again no greetings by the NUMEROUS associates standing around. I asked the associate for a Taxi and was immediately  told you didn’t request one earlier? Well, no we didn’t since we didn’t think we needed to scheduled a taxi ride. I personally flagged one down and went on our way. 

Let’s talk about our time each day in the 1824 Bar & Terrace. The associate Marianne, was the only good experience of this space, “guest” only area. Shelbourne staff would parade other guests through this space, entertaining them privately in the corner (very loud by the way), without a single hello to us. It was very distributive to our visit and made us feel like we were not even a welcomed guest. We also stayed at the Ashford Castle before arriving at the Shelbourne and regardless of the room you purchased, everyone knew our name immediately and always was welcoming, accommodating with a personalized approach- NOT the Shelbourne. 

Upon arrival we went to dine in Bar 27. Overall, again poor customer service, associates did not greet us and were fairly unpleasant, or probably close to rude. 

Overall, we were dissatisfied by the entire experience and in fact, would not return.  Service was widely inconsistent and staff not friendly at all. Does not live up to the hype for sure. The Shelbourne is just like any other Renaissance property and not a special experience as marketed by management.
",2,2019,03,24
207,Nice but Uncomfortable Bed,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and enjoyed our stay for the most part. However, the bed was very hard  - it was not comfortable. 

The staff are awesome, from the doormen to the concierge, and from the front desk to the housekeeping staff.  The room, aside from the bed, was well appointed and very quiet. 

Breakfast was very nice with a large variety to choose from and the wait staff were very attentive. And the bar area is wonderful, also with great staff. 

The hotel cannot be better located.  If you use the hop on hop off bus, the stop is half a block away. However, the hotel is walking distance to many historical locations. When in Dublin again we will look into booking the hotel.",4,2019,03,23
207,Above and Beyond ,"I stayed at The Shelboune with my sister for six days to enjoy Ireland at St. Patrick’s Day time. When we found out the hotel would be undergoing some renovations during our stay, we questioned whether we should keep our reservation or look elsewhere. I’m glad we decided to stick with our original plan. As a Marriott Titanium member, the staff worked hard to find a bigger room to give us an upgrade. This was very lovely and appreciated since we were staying so long. We were also treated to complimentary breakfast in the Saddle Room. We enjoyed the breakfast on two days that we weren’t doing day tours and absolutely loved it. We also enjoyed the spa. My sister and I had massages and loved the relaxation room afterward. The hotel is gorgeous and while we had to walk a bit farther to reach the elevator, we really were not impacted by the renovations whatsoever. The staff was absolutely wonderful, accommodating and welcoming. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay! ",5,2019,03,23
207,My Mums birthday,"The staff was amazing. Aoife was so attentive to minute details. Paul gave us an amazing tour and Kaluan was precious. The hotel is stellar and our park view room was fit for a Queen. Our Mum.
Thank you for making her 86th year so memorable.
Lynne. 
From Florida",5,2019,03,19
207,Disappointing spa experience,"We stayed here recently for my birthday. My husband booked us in for massages and he booked me in for treatments in the salon. We found the spa experience very rushed and it was very obvious the staff were under a lot of pressure. It was like get them in and get them out and it was very disappointing. I got the same feeling in the salon, I'm sure they're very busy but I don't think it's fair on the client when they are there for a relaxing treat and their treatments are being rushed. My husband also informed the hotel that our stay was for a special birthday and I thought they would have made some little effort to have something in our room. In other hotels we've stayed in for special occasions they would have a complimentary desert with 'happy birthday' or a bottle of wine in our room on arrival. It's the little things that really make a difference. I don't want to be completely negative because we really did enjoy our stay, the hotel is beautiful and the food and drink selection was fantastic. Lastly on arrival we checked in with Ashley who wasn't overly friendly and didn't smile much. All the other staff were pleasant and helpful.",3,2019,03,19
207,"great location, ambience","friendly staff, excellent service despite the hotel going through a major renovation which was not transparent when we booked the stay.  this is high-end hotel when not under construction, and the lounge, breakfast service and more didn't disappoint.  We had to walk outside to access the SPA, which was highly inconvenient during  the renovations",5,2019,03,19
207,Fabulous.,Stayed here to celebrate a 50th birthday. We had a great time. Staff were super friendly and the whole ambiance was great. Enjoyed a lovely spa treatment as well as great dinner and breakfast. Would highly recommend.,5,2019,03,18
207,Gorgeous,"I just love love love a swanky, high end hotel and the Shelbourne did not disappoint.

Everything was perfect, from the flowers in the lobby, to the carpeting in the halls.

The staff was fantastic. Courteous, professional and helpful.

With all the fantastic hotels in the area, I don't know that the Shelbourne would be my first choice, but it was absolutely a great stay for our last night in Dublin.",4,2019,03,14
207,Fantastic experience,"Although the hotel is currently going through renovations, the staff went out of their way to ensure we were not disrupted. Staying in the Shelbourne was a bucket list experience, and it didn't disappoint. Excellent staff and attention to detail. A special thank you to the lady (apologies for forgetting your name) who opened up the Constitution Room to show me around.",5,2019,03,12
207,So disappointed,"We were very disappointed with our stay at the Shelbourne.
Although the hotel was under-going renovations, this was not part of the reason we were disappointed. 
We arrived at check-in time to be told our room wasn't ready - which is fine. We spent some time in the near-by bars to pass the time until the staff rang to let us know when the room was ready. However we never received this promised phone call. 
We arrived to the room which overlooked some fans, had a broken bathroom door handle and wasn't what i would deem 5star quality/presentation. 

Room amenities were poor - customer service was poor - the pool facilities, poor. 

Apparently we had a room upgrade away from 'the works' - which was appreciated. However for a 5* special occasion break - this fell very short of expectations. 

Truly gutted as I looked forward to the break for quite sometime.
Appreciated the senior managers concerned email after I filled out their survey - However I won't be returning to take up his offer to ensure the next visit would be better.",2,2019,03,11
207,Incredible staff,"stayed here recently during refurbishments and had a lovey relaxing stay.
Fantastic location, within walking distance to practically everywhere. 
The staff here are the most helpful, friendly and accommodating, nothing is too much 
trouble for them. The room was beautifully presented and very comfortable. Breakfast 
was good, with many options to choose from. Will definitely stay again on my 
next trip to Ireland.",5,2019,03,10
207,"First Time, Not The Last!!!","My wife purchased me a stay in a king suite. However,due to my interest in JFK, we were upgraded to the suite that the president visited. The staff were excellent, the room was spotless ( can’t remember a cleaner hotel that we have visited worldwide).  The breakfast was great and the omelette I got was a very high standard. Overall this was an excellent first time experience and as a Marriott rewards member we felt this property surpassed the service we have come to expect worldwide.",4,2019,03,10
207,Yet another wonderful stay.,"My friend and I have been coming to The Shelbourne for six years. Each year tops the one before. The atmosphere in Bar 27 is hip and elegant. The cocktails are delicious - Alex, Rose and Steven looked after us and were fantastic! The food in the Saddle Room is to die for (I recommend the Turbot). The service is second to none - Sandra was nothing short of a delight. Iain in Front of House is a credit to your hotel. He is a joy alongside being friendly, professional and efficient. Everything was simply wonderful. Thank you again for another weekend filled with happy memories.",5,2019,03,10
207,Beautiful hotel made our trip just perfect!,We stayed at The Shelbourne in February as part of a birthday trip for my husband. I simply cannot fault this hotel - the attention to detail is second to NONE! Staff were unfailing kind and everything from the comfortable beds to the beautiful food made this a trip to remember. We'll be back!,5,2019,03,07
207,Disappointing and stuffy.,"There’s no doubt about it the current renovations are taking their toll. Our room was dated, Old fashioned and the bathroom had a bad smell. I found the staff ok, no one stood out, no one super helpful. I found the staff hit or miss. The hotels public areas are beautiful, the residents lounge really cosy and warm with a fire. Due to renovations we had to walk up stairs to get to reception, not ideal for elderly although we did see staff members helping. After countless trips to Dublin this one didn’t stand out.",3,2019,03,07
207,Disappointing,"Having stayed here for 8 years in a row during the Christmas season we booked for my birthday again. Over the last 2 years we have noticed a decline in the level of service and professionalism of staff. The majority of staff were extremely polite and went out of their way to be polite but 2 staff in particular were extremely rude, one in the bar and one in the restaraunt. The waitress in the restaraunt tried to tell us we couldn’t afford to eat there when we asked if my husband could have something different as a starter!!! We were so disgusted that we asked for our coats and walked out. The manager came to speak to us and said she would accommodate my husbands dietary requirements and offered us a free drink which we were still charged for at the end of our meal. Haven’t been back since and unfortunately will no be returning.",3,2019,03,06
207,Outstanding luxurious room and unbeatable location ,"This hotel is extremely comfortable and the staff is very friendly and helpful. It is deluxe on every level. We went during their renovation of the lobby so getting around was a bit confusing but there are good signs to direct guests. The hotel is a very close walk to Trinity College Dublin and the national museum of Ireland-Archaeology, as well as many restaurants and pubs. ",5,2019,03,06
207,Fantasic break,"We stayed here for a long weekend and it was utterly fantastic. They are undergoing a remodel at the moment, but the entrance is only about ten steps further away from the usual one, so not a huge hardship! We were checked in promptly, our room was on the 3rd floor and it was quiet and peaceful throughout our stay. We were in a deluxe room and it was worth paying the extra, the room was spacious and the bed very comfy. The bathroom was also very nice and had elemis toiletries and thick fluffy towels. The bath is the perfect size for a bubble bath!
We did have breakfast on both mornings although it wasn't included in our package, at the end of our stay the cost came to €90!! which i felt was a bit much for pancakes, tea and toast for both days, but that was more down to us being to lazy to find somewhere else as the hotel are very up front about their pricing. The breakfast itself was tasty but not quite that tasty!!
The hotel is very centrally located and you can walk to all the attractions you want to. We used the AirLink bus from the airport, number 757 stops at St Stephens Green and the cost is €14 per person for a return.
We didn't do much touristy stuff as we were there to relax but i do recommend a visit to Trinity College Library and a walk in the park opposite the hotel. 
The concierge was very helpful in recommending a nice restaurant that was very much to our liking, called Sole.
 
Overall this was a fab hotel whose staff obviously work very hard to keep up an exceptional level of service.",5,2019,03,06
207,Iconic Hotel in the best location in Dublin,This hotel is the place to be. Beautiful facade that faces a busy street right in the middle of Dublin.  Walking distance to many of the landmarks. Rooms were decent size. Museum downstairs in the lobby features all the famous people who have stayed here. We didn't get a chance to see the lobby where they serve afternoon tea as it was being remodeled. Breakfast buffet was just ok.,5,2019,03,04
207,Drinks with family,"Lovely atmosphere & great service. We enjoyed our favorite predinner tipple, a Gin & tonic. The staff were friendly & welcoming. The artwork was stunning& a great talking point for locals & tourists. Would highly recommend this place.",5,2019,03,03
207,Disappointing in Dublin,"We are visiting Ireland for the week, and have weekends in Dublin.  As a Platinum Marriot Member, I try to stay within the brand, thus we choose the Shelbourne Hotel.  Realizing the hotel is under renovations I prepared myself for some challenmges, which were not all that bad.  What was unepected was the variability of service and friendliness from the staff.  Some were lovely and outgoing, others not so much.  Frontline staff are so important to the overall experience, I am wondering if a doorman will ever actually offer a greeting and open a door.  I am American so hope springs eternal.  My other complaint may sound petty to many, but for those of us who are loyal to a hotel brand this may be of interest.  The elite status benefits that we have all worked so hard for may not be worth much here.  As I left Philadelphia late last evening, I checked the hotel again to see what my chances for an upgrade would be.  There appeard to be plenty of rooms available at 2230 Philly time, which is 4am Dublin time.  We arrived at the hotel around 10am, checked in, and went to breakfast and a walk while our rooms was prepared.  Standing in line and waiting for my room, I heard many couples receiving upgrades.  Thus I was very surprised  to only be offered an upgrade when I asked and was given a tiny room with a direct view of construction.  That did not set a great tone for our first stay with this hotel.",3,2019,03,02
207,Excellent 5* hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed here for a two night city break, and loved it! The hotel is currently having renovation works done in some areas, so you don't use the main entrance, but it didn't affect our stay in the slightest. Our room was definitely of a 5* standard, but then so were all the parts of the hotel that we saw. All staff were polite and professional.
The hotel is situated opposite St Stephen's Green, which is a beautiful park to walk through. You are also only a few minutes walk from plenty of shops, including Grafton Street, and lots of bars!
We were struck by how clean and well maintained Dublin was.",5,2019,03,01
207,Amazing Xmas ,Spent Xmas in the Shelbourne with my wife and 11 month old baby and it was magical. From the moment of arrival to the sadness of checking out everything was amazing. We has Xmas dinner in the beautiful dining room and it was delicious. An amazing experience. My best Xmas yet and to send it with my young family made it even more special ,5,2019,02,25
207,Terrible and noisy,Currently in my room and cannot sleep due to the noise from a function currently going on in the hotel. Have rang reception twice  already first I was told music would be turned down which never happened. Second time I requested earplugs as I could not sleep with the noise. Earplugs finally arrived!! Not what you would expect from what should be a quality hotel very disappointed.,1,2019,02,23
207,Very underwhelming,"Stayed here this weekend for the first time, expecting it be be amazing. Was totally disappointed by the room, and that was after requesting another. The staff were lovely but the hotel itself is definitely over-rated.",2,2019,02,23
207,Great location,"This hotel is in such a great location in middle of dublin with easy access to all facilities ,we just stayed for a cheeky little weekend but had a good stay ,very helpful and friendly staff who told us places to visit.",4,2019,02,23
207,"Great service, but disappointing room.","This hotel has a great location situated in the heart of the city. The service from staff is some of the best I have experienced in a hotel and the leisure facilities are very good. However I found the bed very hard and uncomfortable to sleep in. I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in Dublin and after this stay, the Shelbourne would not be my first choice for a hotel as the comfort of the room did not live up to my expectations.",4,2019,02,22
207,"Have Always Loved This Hotel, But Current Refurb Works Do Not Improve Experience","In Short:  Lord Mayor's Lounge still shut, layout now *really* confusing and mazey, main hall and staircase shut.
Also, on this occasion, my room was over-heated, aircon useless and promises of a portable air con unit unfulfilled.

Not the hotel I've known and loved for years.

Back to the Conrad, Merrion or Marker next time.",3,2019,02,21
207,Lovely hotel,"Firstly the Shelbourne Dublin is a stunning hotel in the heart of Dublin 
The room was adequate with fresh clean facilities . The only negative being the €739 3 night stay offered on booking.com didn’t even include breakfast. I’ve noted this is becoming a regular accurancel on the site and advise people to look around 

Gone are the days of bed and breakfast for hotel guests maybe hotels are becoming more like low cost airlines ? Breakfast in the Shelbourne is €32 pp I decided to visit other local restaurants within 200 yds of the hotel each morning to sample the delights of Irish hospitality at €11 including freshly brewed coffee 
Great shame in short....... a fabulous  “ bed only “ for 3 nights but sadly not the best value or experience as breakfast was a very expensive upsell option €64 per couple per day €186 for 3 breakfasts whilst the hotel was going through refurbishments 
Double check with any booking . Com rate 
Dublin is a fantastic city to visit but Ryan Air and now the hotels charging for every option! check the deal do some homework shop around ,  ask to be treated as a guest and not a cash point 😜",3,2019,02,20
207,Nice enough but not special.,"I wonder if perhaps the Shelbourne suffers from high expectations associated with its history within an Irish context. Anyway, for whatever reason I found it disappointing, it just didn't meet my expectations and wasn't anything special at all. Its a nice enough hotel but if it were a person you would say it was pretentious and shallow, it thinks its a great posh hotel but actually is nothing special. We live only 20 miles away and stayed there on a city night out to see a show in the Gaiety (always a winner there, no pretensions but a great history and as good today as ever), had dinner in the Shelbourne first (you have to go around the corner to get into the restaurant), the food was good but the service was poor and overpriced for the level of service and its not there wasn't enough staff there. Needs a shake up.",3,2019,02,19
207,Overrated and tired,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for 5 nights in October on a work trip. I was very excited to stay in such a historic and storied hotel. However, I was disappointed in the quality of my room (772) for a 5 star hotel. The carpet was fraying, the paint was peeling, the walls were dirty and the furniture was chipped. I took pictures documenting this.  I was here for work, so I didn't ask to switch rooms, but I really wish I had, since it wasn't pleasant for my 5 day stay.
 In addition, the checkin line was very long and chaotic (there seemed to be like 50 wedding parties checking in all at once on Saturday afternoon Oct. 6). And the lovely lounge/bar on the mezzanine level was closed several evenings when I wanted to sit there.  Several items were out of stock at the horseshoe lounge, including the hibiscus gin drink. In addition, there was no hot water in the shower on Wed night Oct. 10, when I wanted to take a shower. Topping it off, at checkout I was mistakenly charged for parking, when I didn't even have a car. (The charge was eventually removed.)
 On the plus side, the pool, steam room and sauna were nice, though I wish there were towel hooks on the side of the pool near the stairs, since there was no place to hang a robe or towel. The towels, robe and slippers were soft and comfortable. The bed was comfortable, though the room was very hot at night
Overall, I was pretty disappointed in my stay. I mentioned all these issues to Lulu at the front desk upon checkout, and  I hope they are resolved for future guests. This was not the level of room or service I expected for a 5 star hotel. Although I wasn't paying for the hotel myself-it was on my employer--I am sad to say I wouldn't recommend the Shelbourne.
(I gave this feedback to Marriott in real time after my stay, but hadn't had a chance to post this on Tripadvisor til now.)

In summary:

There were several issues with my stay:
* Checkin line was long and chaotic
* Shower was out of order on night of Wed. Oct.10
* room was VERY hot several evenings
* the mezzanine lounge was closed early 2 nights on hours they were supposed to be open
* Check out I was mistakenly charged for parking when I did not have a car
* as mentioned earlier, room 772 carpet was fraying, paint was peeling, furniture chipped, wall stained
* several items were out of stock at the horseshoe lounge, including the hibiscus gin drink",2,2019,02,18
207,Outstanding hotel and staff,"Although the hotel is going through some renovation and you cannot go through the main entrance, the staff are friendly and always have a smile to help you. My room is amazing, great bed, a good working desk and large bathroom. I can’t wait to come back when the renovations are complete. Thank you for making a jet lagged traveler feel at home.",5,2019,02,16
207,Disappointing Disappointing Disappointing,"I have been wanting to stay at this hotel for a long time, however it was very disappointing.  The hotel is under construction and we booked this about 9 months in advance, however were not advised of the construction until about a week before, which was too late to try and change hotels at an extremely busy time (rugby 6 nations).  Our room was very nice - comfortable bed, lovely linen.  It is situated in a good location for getting around Dublin.  

The doorman was too busy on his phone to get me a taxi.  The bar is great but it is too busy they should limit the access, as residents in the hotel we could not get into the bar at first.  The barman worked their socks off and didn't stop but because they were so busy they were actually grumpy and you had to wait a long time for a drink if you could actually get to the bar.

The breakfast room had no atmosphere was just like a big conference room with a buffet in the middle, the service was very poor and took 10-15 minutes to get tea, often having to chase it 2-3 times. 

So overall having wanted to stay at this hotel for so long was very disappointed and accept that they had construction work but we should have been advised of this.  There is no reduction in the room rate because of the construction and the impact this has clearly had on their service.

People were constantly lost, roaming the corridors trying to find their rooms due to lots of diversions due to the construction work.  We bumped into people several times going round in circles trying to find their room.",3,2019,02,16
207,Beautiful Hotel but under construction,Unfortunately the entire front entrance area of the hotel has been closed off.  You enter through a side door and have to take stairs to get to a room where check in occurs.  This really takes away from the ambiance of the hotel and is a nuisance.  You find yourself going down corridors and up and down stairs.  I imagine the hotel with its entrance would be spectacular if it was open.  Right now for the price paid you really don't get the same value. Also be careful with a room on the top floor.  The AC didn't work which  other reviewers have noted so it was uncomfortably hot in the room even for January.  The hotel did agree to move us to another room which was much nicer and cooler.  Breakfast was quite good but again was in a makeshift large room.  Once the reno's are done I would return but not right now.,4,2019,02,14
207,5*****,"A group of four of us stayed here the 19th of January, although it was not my first visit it never disappoints us. We checked in earlier than planned but was advised by Miriamma that the room would be ready shortly, she was kind enough to call me on my mobile as soon as the room was ready. We were shown to the room by a lovely man by the name of Billy and our bags were brought up by Danny. Although there were renovations taking place at the time this did not impact on our stay. The managers and staff go above and beyond to ensure a relaxing and enjoyable stay.This place has always been a treat for us so we will be back. 5 star property and 5 star treatment.",5,2019,02,14
207,Sophisticated and Special,I enjoyed lunch in this beautiful hotel with work colleagues.  3 courses came to €30 each.  It was a special treat with sophisticated surroundings.  The service was excellent. Although the hotel is currently being rennovated it is still a beautiful place for a meal or drink.  I'd highly recommend this venue to locals and tourists alike.,5,2019,02,13
207,Renovations took from experience,"We were really looking forward to our short stay in the Hotel recently. I had booked it a few months ago for a special occasion. However I received an email just a few days before the stay, to inform me of renovations ongoing in the Hotel during the stay. ( the renovations had been going on since beginning of January). While the staff were very helpful, and guided patrons through the diversions etc. I have to admit, it did take from the experience, and I must say, had I known earlier about the disruption I would have re considered by visit.
That said, the room, service and staff were top class as expected, though I was not impressed with having to book the breakfast separately and quite an expensive price...

I hope to revisit this Hotel again in better circumstances, and would advise would be  visitors to make sure renovations are completed first.",4,2019,02,13
207,Excellent lunch,"With my sister and wife a quick stop for lunch. Good food, excellent service and value for money in the bar area. Varied menu, food was good, and surprisingly inexpensive by Dublin prices for what you got. Not the first time I’ve been, the steak sandwich comes with chips and salad, fish and chips decent portion but not overpowering. Plenty of staff offering a very efficient service.",5,2019,02,13
207,Fab Hotel,"Great night recently in The Shelbourne. Loved the chilled atmosphere and comfortable seating in the residents bar. Only issue was with the refurbishment, which we didn't know about until a couple of days before arriving, meant you entered through a side door and up a back stairs which meant lugging our bags up multiple flights of stairs as there was no lift, to a makeshift very unimpressive check in area. More could be done with this make shift area as it gives a very poor impression, a few vases of nice flowers or something in the room would make it less basic and thrown together looking. Suite was great though and bed so comfortable! Another issue with the refurb, if you want to go to the bar you need to go down all the back flights of stairs again, out onto the street and walk to the Kildare street side and back the same way after. Breakfast room was also disappointing and makeshift. ",4,2019,02,12
207,"Great gym, pool and spa","I stayed here weekly for 4 months and don't have any bad things to say about this property. Certainly a 5 star hotel though the corridors can feel older. As other travellers note, the property is under construction until April 2019. This provides temporary minor inconveniences but I expect the property to be top notch after the construction.

The main thing to note is that the gym, pool, steam room, and sauna are their best amenity.  Highly recommend visiting these facilities during your stay.",5,2019,02,12
207,Lots of stairs and corridors,"I was informed, after booking and paying, that the hotel was undergoing refurbishment. That was fine, the rate reflected this. What was initially disappointing was the number of stairs, to get to the first floor temporary reception and then to my 2nd floor room via the lift.  I had to go up/down 6 stairs and walk through many long corridors.  A result I expect of many older houses being added together to form a hotel.  A bit too much for my knees. The second disappointment was the size of the room. It was quite small and cramped with no view, again presumably reflected in the discounted room rate.  The bed was very comfortable and the pillows perfect.
A visit to the public bar required leaving the hotel to go out on to the street and enter via another entrance, there was no direct way through the hotel, a victim of the refurbishment I gather and not permanent.
I had intended to use the swimming pool but realised that I had brought a costume that was too small.  There were shops nearby to purchase a new one but I really couldn't face all those stairs and corridors another time, in order to go and shop.
I slept well until the early hours when my wife and I were awoken by someone, nosily, trying to gain access to our room.  My wife was understandably quite scared.  I opened the door and was confronted with people who had tried to gain access to the wrong room.  When they saw me they were quite abusive.  I rang reception who immediately said they would get security.  There were no further disturbances but the restful sleep I was having to that point didn't return.
These are the negative points; the positives are its excellent location, its cleanliness, the friendliness and professionalism of its staff and the superb breakfast (additional charge)
Unfortunately, in future I think that I will stay in a different hotel in Dublin the negatives outweighed the positives",3,2019,02,11
207,The perfect Hotel,"I didn't think it could live up to the picture i had in my head but it did and more! The staff make this place. Miriama was the lady who checked us in and she's a credit to the hotel. But every member of staff we encountered were lovely and helpful.They made you feel at home there. Our room 540 was stunning, really big and brilliant views over Stephen's Green. There is a reason this is one of the most iconic hotels in Dublin. It's simply amazing. Loved the beds too such a comfy nights sleep. Bathroom was huge with Elmis products and a full size bath and separate shower. Huge fluffy towels and bathrobes provided. I didn't want to leave.",5,2019,02,11
207,"Shelbourne, Take Me Back! ","We ended our twelve day Irish adventure with just two nights at the Shelbourne while we explored the city of Dublin. I really wished we had spent a third night. Honestly, I want to come back and spend a week. 

This hotel was absolutely stunning. The rooms were gorgeous and I felt like we were staying in a palace as we walked up and down the stairs and even down the hall to our rooms. 

My aunt and uncle live in Dublin and they were more than happy to meet us for drinks near the bar downstairs. Excellent service. Absolutely top notch. You will feel very special. 

I highly recommend the Shelbourne for travel with or without kids. I would visit here again with anyone who wants to go with me! ",5,2019,02,10
207,Overnight stay,"We spent an overnight stay at the Shelbourne hotel in Dublin and very much enjoyed the experience. Quick and friendly check in. The room was excellent and very comfortable, view not so I think we had back of house office view.

We had a meal in the restaurant that evening and the food and services was excellent. The restaurant doubles as the breakfast room in the morning and that would be the main criticism the kitchen servery is very tight and cramped when a lot of people are in the servery area,a bit disappointing for this  hotel.

Good service and atmosphere in the bar that evening.

The hotel is in an excellent location and allows you to enjoy Dublin on foot with all main attractions very close and walkable.

Enjoy",4,2019,02,09
207,Fantastic Place ,Love this classic hotel. Rooms are well appointed.  Very nice fitness room. The included breakfast was fabulous. No. 27 bar attached is a great place to unwind after work. Great whiskey selection. They are undergoing some renovation so at times it’s tricky to get around. Highly recommended ,5,2019,02,08

207,England vs Ireland 2019,"Wonderful well appointed hotel, with spacious rooms and A1 bed linen.
Very lively bar particularly on a rugby international weekend. Hotel undergoing some cosmetic changes but nothing detrimental to our weekend there.

Bar food was excellent and a week needed now to recover from Guinness overload.

The hotel is very well positioned for shopping and Dublin’s sights",5,2019,02,03
207,Business Trip,"What can I say........ WOW I have never ever stayed in something that is out of this world until now.

Everything about my stay was top class and I was very well looked after. Customer Service through to the porters are very well educated and certainly look after guests how you would expect to be looked after.

The room was imense even more so as I got a free upgrade.

I would most definately stay here again.",5,2019,01,30
207,Wonderful staff,"Stayed here on an overnight to Dublin using (all!) of our Marriott points.  Lovely room.   I love this hotel and the fact it has history and elegance so I was excited about our stay.  There is continuing work on the reception and foyer so we used a side entrance and were guided to reception.  Staff were very attentive and the room lovely.  My favourite place is the tiny residents bar.  Cosy, fire lit and book-lined it was a lovely place for a pre-dinner drink and catchup with my husband. Due to the renovations, ‘paying’ guests were being offered free car-parking.  When we mentioned it the receptionist was kind enough to ask her manager if it applied to us.  Unfortunately we did not get the free parking, but we did get free breakfast!!! (At €29 per person that was a super bonus!).  Tiny negative comment was just that the carpets in the breakfast area needed to be hoovered.  I expect 5 star to mean spotless.",4,2019,01,30
207,We loved it!,"OH and I spent two nights there this weekend, Saturday and Sunday and had a truly fabulous stay. I know there are ""issues"" at the moment with the refurb going on, but that is very clearly highlighted on the hotel website so no one can really say they weren't expecting a bit of disruption or inconvenience. I'd rather call it a voyage of discovery, ok so you can use a different lift every time you come down from your room and it might be a bit frustrating to find yourself where you didn't expect to be but, in such a beautiful building who cares? The bar is sensational, cosy log fire, book lined walls and the most delightful cocktails, I had the nicest Cosmopolitan ever on Sunday evening. The room, 394 had no view as such  but it had everything else, and it was spotless, comfortable and warm at all times. Bathroom likewise. No complaints whatever, we haven't stayed there before so can't judge what the ""true"" Shelbourne experience might be, but I'd certainly want to go back once the refurbishment is complete and sample what must be a 7 star stay!!",5,2019,01,29
207,Beautiful Food,"Had a meal here recently a group of five in the saddle room it was beautiful.
We booked for lunch time & as we arrived early we had a drink first in the bar. The  bar had a really nice relaxed atmosphere & was really bright. The waiters were all really friendly & very efficient.
After drinks we went into the saddle room for our meal. The setting was really nice in the room was very much relaxeg in here. The food was 10/10 again the service was very good. Was such a nice treat of a Sunday & will be returning soon and will be recommending it to others. ",5,2019,01,27
207,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE !!! ,We stayed here for 2 nights over Christmas for a break !! The room was perfect check in quiet poor no effect made by reception to explain restaurant times etc !! We have stayed in the hotel before and I don’t think we will be rushing back !! We arrived in the horse shoe bar on several occasions during out stay and found it impossible to get served 10-12 customers in there the bar staff to busy talking in there little room out the back !   Dirty glasses left on the tables for ages !  At 1 point a manger walked in to the bar looked around at all the dirty tables and left  again no effort to clean up or get it sorted !! Not 5 star standard sorry !!! I would strongly consider asking the bar staff to lift there heads and acknowledge the customers in front of them rather than looking at there shoes !!! ,1,2019,01,25

207,Construction - Complaint,"Att: Mr Arne Sorenson 

As a Platinum Marriott Rewards member I booked using my points and there is a small warning on the site informing guests "" Access to entrance closed for renovation works"" When we arived late from the airport and we were not expecting to experience so much hassle.  The doors were all locked up and we had to call - This hotel is 50% closed and they are doing major construction, we walked the block to find the hotel entrance .
 
We only stayed 1 night and all facilities were not available due to the construction. We took the stairs to our small room and we were not afforded an upgrade.  The hotel lounge was closed so we walked to a closeby horel for a breakfast buffet. 
To access the Gym I needed to walk down the street and its not worth the trip. I have reached out to Mr Sorenson at Marriott as this hotel should no longer be listed on the Marriott Programme at a cat 7! 

Before posting tis recview i reached out direct but no responce yet",1,2019,01,21

207,Overnight stay with dinner for Dads 60th birthday,"Fri 4th January, a family of 9 of us stayed at The Shelbourne hotel. Mam and Dad were upgraded to a suite on arrival worth 1,500euro which we were absolutely thrilled with. it was decorated beautifully for Christmas with a Christmas tree in the room and we could all celebrate and enjoy our drinks in pre our evening meal. Wine, chocolates and a personalised card came to the room for Dad. He also had a personalised dinner menu . Food was exceptional in restaurant. Beautiful quaint atmosphere and breakfast was completely complementary the following morning. The room where the constitution was signed was open next day which was a treat for my Dad and husband due to their love for history and they had an opportunity to sit in Michael Collins' chair. THank u to all staff for a very memorable trip.",5,2019,01,14
207,Extremely disappointing,"Before unpacking I decided to have a cup of tea only to discover I had a choice of coffee or herbal tea. I rang housekeeping who delivered some breakfast tea. Next to the bathroom preparing for my night out, lacking toiletries, no razor/shaving cream, no toothbrush/toothpaste, no comb. I went to reception to collect some. (I was advised combs aren't provided the other items were). After my night out attending a concert in the nearby National Concert Hall I returned to my room which was very cold & I could not turn up the heat, the bathroom extractor fan would not turn off & hummed a night, to make matters worse a fan outside underneath my bedroom window also hummed all night long. I checked out on 20 Dec 2018, I was advised that the guest relations executive was busy but would contact me... to date I have not been contacted. It was my worst ever hotel experience.",1,2019,01,12
207,High Tea,"While visiting Dublin, high tea was highly recommended.  Sitting at a window with a view, we were served a variety of sandwiches and pastries - much more than we were able to consume.  From Coronation Chicken to Napoleons, there was something for everyone.",5,2019,01,12
207,Beautiful hotel and great location,Stayed here for 1 night after 2 weeks in Ireland/N Ireland before flying out the next morning. Airport is 20 min away. Loved the location. Easy to find.

We had drinks in the bar which were fantastic. Service great. ,5,2019,01,12
207,Returned visit,"Excellent place. Staff very accommodating, polite and friendly.I stayed at the Shelbourne 10 year's ago with my neice for her 21st birthday. We wasn't stopping at the hotel this time but wanted to revisit. The staff let us look around reminiscing. We had a lovely bottle of Fizz, Oysters and outstanding desserts. Wonderful place if you haven't already been it's a must. We will return",5,2019,01,09
207,By far the best hotel I have ever stayed in,"Clean, perfect location, friendly staff, comfortable, great facilities and a great breakfast. This should be the standard of any hotel. You pay a lot, but you get this money back. I wish every hotel was like this.",5,2019,01,09
207,An excellent hotel overall with some limitations and it's spa is really a plus.,"The Shelbourne is definitely top notch, but obviously not cheap.  It provides what one would expect from a large, well-managed hotel: Clean,  nice linen and clean, bathrooms. Ours had a large comfortable tub which is a wonderful thing when you've just landed from the U.S.  Having the spa available, even if your room isn't available when your overnight flight arrives from the U.S., is an amazing plus. Though it wasn't mentioned by desk staff, knowing it existed and could be made accessible was very beneficial.  Be sure to check to ensure that it will be made available to you if you arrive before check-in time.

We had a deluxe room both at the beginning and end of our stay.  It faced an modern office building across the way that made it feel like you could be anywhere in the world rather than specifically in Ireland, let alone Dublin.  So you close the curtains rather than feeling like you're in a special place.  During the day (recuperating from the flight over) the alley between the hotel and the office building was rather noisy. On the plus side, it was quiet at night as I'm sure those facing the park (there's a highly trafficked street between the hotel and the park) wouldn't be, but to say the view lacked ""charm"" would be an understatement.

The hotel is currently (Jan, 2018) undergoing renovation of the main entry floor.  This is due to last three months, but often these things go much longer, so if this matters to you, I'd check on how they are progressing.  The hotel has multiple dining/bar spots so one doesn't need, strictly speaking, the ground floor lounge, but it does slightly impact the sense of being in a luxurious spot.

Excellent location, especially if you want to be near the National Library and Trinity College.  Like most big cities, being near to the center of town also means being near to overcrowded streets and ""global"" mega-operations like Starbucks and Hard Rock Cafe -- again making it hard to feel a real ""Dublin"" experience, but wonderful literary museums are within reasonable walking distance and there you can get more of a sense of what a literary world Dublin once was.  Nearby pubs were too overcrowded to be useful, unless, of course, you like overcrowded pubs. Excellent restaurants, however, are abundant within easy reach of the hotel.",4,2019,01,08
207,Pre Christmas treat,From the valet parking and the helpful porter to the beautiful room and ultra clean bathroom-it's the place to feel pampered in and was a special treat. Busy bars and hard to get a seat/table but worth waiting for.,5,2019,01,07
207,Fabulous ,"This is a truly great 5 star. While renovations are going on the five star experience was still very evident at all stages. It will be great to see how the renovations go.

207,Leisurely lunch,"My husband and I had a delicious lunch in the Saddle Room in the Shelbourne on Friday 4th January. The food was gorgeous and great value. The staff were efficient and very pleasant, particularly Dagamar who was our waitress. We will definitely be back",5,2019,01,05
207,New Years in the Hotel,"Myself and my partner have stayed in the hotel before, in fact we have started a tradition of celebrating New Year by staying in this hotel.

Checked in just about 3pm to be told our room wasn’t ready, no problem we left our bags and went shopping. On return i was told that our room booking which was made weeks before a Deluxe King wasn’t available!!! But we could have two double beds instead as this is in the same price bracket 🙄.

We paid for a Deluxe King because we don’t want to sleep in a double bed, who would want to go away and sleep in a smaller bed then your own at home. Anyway we went to take a look at the room and it was awful. Two double beds and a connecting door into the next door, the room was so small.

I called ask spoke to Patrick who had someone come up and moved us to a Deluxe King room which was suddenly available.

The rest of the stay in the hotel was great, but sadly if you start by upsetting your guests it’s hard to fix and that’s why I have reduced the score of this hotel.

Why they couldn’t have just given us the room we paid for. ",2,2019,01,04
207,Great location off Grafton! ,"I could see why this particular hotel is so loved and fondly spoken of in the Irish circles. We stayed in a 2-room suite (king size bed, walk in closet and separate living room). What a surprise to find a Christmas tree in our room too, nice touch! 

The reason for the 4 stars is upon arrival, we had to wait 25-min in the lobby to check in. The lobby is very crowded and small and there should not be this type of inconvenience in a 5-Star hotel where one is paying $1,450/nite. And while our stateroom room was tasteful and elegant, it was also a tad bit small (for the price paid). Lovely staff, food and drinks reasonably priced with ample rooms all around to sit and read a paper. We did not do Afternoon Tea, but I heard it's the thing to do!

I am glad we had the experience of staying in such a historical hotel, but would not rave home about it.",4,2019,01,02
207,Deceitful,"It’s one thing to offer poor service.  It’s quite another to be outright deceitful, which is our experience thus far at The Shelbourne.  Booked a room for four nights starting January 2 directly on the hotel’s website.  At the time of booking the website had a message indicating the lobby would be closed for renovation starting January 6.  No problem, that’s the day we’re leaving.  Also received a confirmation email a few days in advance of the reservation with a similar message indicating lobby renovation beginning January 6.

Upon arrival on January 2, lo and behold the lobby is under construction.  We had to haul our heavy luggage through a side entrance up several flights of stairs to reach a makeshift reception area in a hallway.  Being surprised to see the construction based on what had been communicated to us we inquired to make sure all of the restaurants and bars were still open, as that is one of the reasons we booked here.  We were assured by the employee at reception they were all open.  Upon further review, however, we have learned Lord Mayor’s Lounge is in fact closed.

We had many options on where to book in Dublin, and had we been aware of this situation we likely would have booked elsewhere.  Instead we made a decision based on false information we were provided by the hotel and are now dealing with the consequences.  Hopefully anybody heading here over the next couple days expecting not to encounter lobby renovations and restaurant closings sees this review and can make informed decisions appropriately.",1,2019,01,02
207,Christmas stay ,"My husband and I stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights, checking in Christmas Eve and out on Stephens Day. It was the perfect way to spend our first married Christmas together. 
We were lucky enough to receive a room upgrade and also received a bottle of Prosecco in our room. 
The hotel itself is simply stunning. Old school luxury. Not to mention the food and the staff who give 110%! We’re currently trying to figure out how we can get back for Christmas every year!! 
Thank you guys! ",5,2019,01,02
207,I stayed in the Shelbourne for 2 nights over Christmas,The hotel was way overpriced. If this is a 5 star hotel the Adare Manor and Ashford Castle must be 8 star hotels. The air conditioner in the room didn't work.  There was no USB outlets in the room.  The bed was too hard and sloped out from the middle. The service was terrible for a 5 star hotel. The food was ok in the Saddle restaurant but not fine dining. I would not recommend staying in this hotel,2,2019,01,01
207,Such a disappointment,"My wife and I stayed on 29th Dec to celebrate our wedding anniversary. €290 for the rm, when I booked I mentioned the occasion and the girl said she’d do all possible to upgrade but would make a gesture of some description. No gesture, no upgrade, room was basic and looking into a multi-story carpark, woken by the bottle banks being emptied on a frequent basis from 9am to 11am. The heat in the room was terrible and air con no use at all. I raised it at check out and was offered a complimentary upgrade, which I won’t use as I won’t be back! ",1,2018,12,30
207,Afternoon Tea,"At 59 euro a head the afternoon tea is a criminal waste of money for what is being offered--very small portions of less than overwhelming food. Yes, the ambience of the hotel is lovely but in no way justifys the cost!",1,2018,12,30
207,What a disappointment.,"We booked a night here on the basis of many recommendations, only to be left very disappointed at accommodations and the overall state of the hotel. The hotel aspires to a 5-star experience, but service was among the areas lacking.

First, the good: As Renaissance points members, we were able to use points to offset the cost of the stay, although that only put the stay in the category of reasonable value for money. Tidy and upscale period inspired decor was a nice touch. Food for in-room dining was very well-done. The Horseshoe Bar is quite a cozy and relaxing place for a drink.

Now the bad, and unfortunately there are several. First, our room was stuffy even finding that a window was left open for air. It felt well above 25C so we attempted to use the climate control in the room which did not work after several hours. The hotel's answer was to change rooms (inconvenient by that time) or send up a fan. Lots of noise, but absolutely no air movement. Maintenance person appeared over an hour later with the small oscillating fan. Showed an overall lack of maintenance. The shower was nice, but the hand attachment (which looks more like a microphone, perhaps it was since it didn't spray water) flat out didn't work. Upon check-on, the staff was to have made reservations for us for dinner at a prescribed time, and again after several hours nothing was done. By that time, there was nothing available and nothing open due to the holiday near the hotel.

Overall, the rating is a 2 due to the many non-working areas that were detrimental to the stay (uncomfortable night's sleep with the fan). Suggestions are that maintenance on the building infrastructure (see pictures) is sorely lacking and the property doesn't stack up to Renaissance standards. I had high hopes for a stay here, but now would not recommend to other travelers until major improvements are made.",2,2018,12,27
207,Very impressive hotel and staff,"Bottom Line: This is a beautiful hotel with nicely-maintained and decorated rooms. Conveniently located, with the airport bus service picking up and dropping off just across the street. Staff were friendly.

I had a 2-night stay over a weekend while working in Europe the weeks before and after, and was very pleasantly surprised at how nice The Shelbourne is. My other option would have been the Westin, but the Westin was just slightly more expensive and my work requires me to take the more reasonably-priced option. 

I am looking forward to returning to the Shelbourne on my next visit.",5,2018,12,26
207,Doing Dublin Proper,"With a fantastic location in walking distance (or short taxi) to many of the typical spots like Dublin Castle, Trinity College, Guinness, and Brazen Head, as well as, walking to shops, pubs and restaurants...you cannot beat a stay at the Shelbourne. Besides it offering formal dinning at the Saddle Room restaurant, food and drink at the famous No. 27 Bar and drinks at the Horseshoe Bar all inside the hotel, our family really enjoyed our stay. The gym and indoor pool were nice, the rooms comfortable, and the staff very good, so we recommend the Shelbourne to anyone, but especially those who appreciate local history. ",5,2018,12,26
207,Shelbourne  just ok ,"My daughter booked for a night on 23 rd December for 3 people , three months ago she booked a junior suite . Arrived at 2 40 pm after queuing at reception for 10 mins told room not ready till after 3 pm , off we go and arrived back at 4 15 pm another queue  , different receptionist , and time wasted got the key to junior suite arrived at room ,beautiful room only to discover only one bed . Out the door back to reception queue up once again eventually getting to a third different receptionists , unfortunately my daughter couldn’t find the confirmation booking on her phone and  the receptionist suggested she had booked a junior suite with one bed. , she was in no position to argue , receptionist no 2  had said to her is the room for 3 people , still he sent us to the room with one bed . I was observing the demeanor of all the  receptionists from close proximity  , and they appeared to me they were robotic and I have seen more personality in a cardboard cutout . Eventually we were dispatched to a ‘premium room ‘ up in the attic , the bathroom was very big nearly as big at the bedroom , between both there was one tiny window in the bedroom looking out on to st Stephens Green , bright and airy certainly would  not be the description  here , ‘dungeon like ‘ more to point even if it was on the 6 th floor . My daughter was very upset over the whole experience having invested 700 euro for the night she was looking forward to. The criteria is would We return again , definitely not ! ",3,2018,12,25
207,The shortest-coolest stay in a hotel,"Thanks to this beautiful oasis in the land of greenness, I was able to run in the dark, close to all the beautiful landmarks, and this happened right after one of the best meals I had had in a long time. Right under your nose, in the hotel. ",5,2018,12,24
207,Nice Tea and Scones,Enjoyable experience.   Great atmosphere.  Expensive but it is the Shelbourne.  I tend to call here at Christmas every year and the family all look forward to it.  I would certainly recommend it for atmosphere alone.,5,2018,12,24
207,Spectacular,"The most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in. Both the history and amenities are amazing. Went out of their way to welcome us. Was our honeymoon...they put a heart of red rose petals on the bed. Front staff welcoming, talk to Richard at the door for local hints, ask Adrian in the residents bar to teach you about whiskey.  Stayed 9 nights, have not only NO complaints, but highly recommend as the best place in Dublin to stay and base your visit from.  There can be no finer establishment in Ireland.",5,2018,12,22
207,"Classy, comfortable hotel","Spent 5 nights here and really enjoyed the property.  Our room was extremely comfortable, the bathroom had everything we needed.  The bed, pillows, sheets, and duvet we snowy white and so comfortable. The location is wonderful right across the street from St. Stephens green.  Close to Trinity College, Grafton Street, etc.  Everything was very convenient.  Had an excellent dinner one night in their fine dining room, The Saddle Room; wonderful drinks in the Houeshoe Lounge, and very nice lunch in the No. 27 Bar & Lounge.  The hotel is so beautiful and gracious.  The doorman is so kind and helpful. As expected, the service is impeccable.  Would love to stay there again.",5,2018,12,22
207,Wonderful experience!!!,"Rooms - immaculately maintained. We had an amazing room overlooking the park. Spacious, comfortable bed, massive bathroom, plenty of storage space.

Location - great central location near numerous restaurants and is walking distance to great shopping areas. This part of Dublin did not seem quite as crowded and hectic as the Temple Bar area. Is quiter after hours. 

Dining - outstanding breakfast buffet with too many options to list. Smaller bar/restaurant with great, quick options such as salads, burgers, and fish and chips, very well done. We also loved the horseshoe bar - was a great place to cap off the night with a cocktail. Did not try afternoon tea but it seemed quite popular.

Amenities - excellent , decent sized fitness center (for a hotel), though it was a little difficult to locate.

Service - everyone was friendly and attentive. Concierge gave us some great restaurant recommendations. Doorman arranged for transportation when we needed it. Desk clerk proactively noticed a billing error and corrected it without my having to say anything. Room was serviced twice a day and was spotless.",5,2018,12,22
207,Missed the mark this time,"This is obviously a well regarded hotel and they do many things right but missed the mark for us. The overarching impression was that it's a city landmark that seems to care as much or more about hosting events and visitors to its bars and restaurants as it does about guests staying at the hotel. There were all kinds of office parties, receptions, etc taking place throughout the hotel. And all of those bars and restaurants were packed with people in suits, presumably after work crowd. All of that's fine, but if you're looking for a hotel that is focused on you as the guest staying the night, this just isn't the place. 

-Our check in was handled by a trainee who had a lot of difficulty and took a lot of time, and no one came to help her until the end. If you're going to have trainees on at busy times, they need to be supervised.
-That was after we found reception, which is buried behind a crowd of bars and restaurants that were mobbed by people not staying at the hotel. Not very welcoming for actual guests. In general, we found the staff to be fairly cool.
-We paid for a city view of the green, but on the 6th floor, the windows are tiny, high, and clouded, and at night are flooded with spotlights so bright that the hotel has installed special pads to keep the light out of the room. Basically the window (and view) are worthless. If you book a green view, make sure you're not on the 6th floor when you check in.
-I don't know why, but the room wasn't ready for guests to use. The water sputtered like it does when it's recently been turned back on. The wifi was bad till an engineer came to fix it (thanks for that). That plus the view made us feel like we'd been put in a back corner of the hotel, even though it fronted directly on the green.
-Gym and pool and sauna are terrific. But if you don't want to go outside, you have to go down an extremely winding and badly marked path through multiple floors and elevators to get there. (After we found it, we led some other lost guests in robes and slippers.)

On the plus side, the Christmas decorations were beautiful and the room was comfortable.

Next time we'll stay somewhere equally central and equally comfortable, but with a focus on welcoming folks who are spending the night with them and not on being the Plaza Hotel of Dublin.",3,2018,12,21
207,Pure class!,"We are here for our second visit. We were at the Shelbourne last December with our family for Christmas, and the experience was so personal and lovely that we are here again. And a bed of roses is what we return to after dinner in the Lord Mayor's room. Pure class.",5,2018,12,20
207,Bar review,This is one of the best 5 star hotels in Dublin. The service is second to none. Visit at Christmas especially to get the full experience but be aware that the bar will constantly be full at this time. You’ll be lucky to get a spot but if you do you won’t be disappointed. A very special hotel.,5,2018,12,19
207,"Location, location","Fantastic hotel full of history, the location is great, the service is outstanding, attention to detail, you really feel like a valued guest.we stayed in a suite with our very own Xmas tree. The saddle bar is really quaint and serve lovely cocktails.",5,2018,12,18
207,Special Place In The Heart of Dublin,Treated to a stay here early December. Beautiful hotel. Cannot fault a thing. Our room was a heritage park view so overlooking Stephens Green. Excellent location. We had breakfast and dinner each day and the service was fantastic especially in the saddle room. Only downside is they have changed their pink champagne and pink prosecco range since our last visit and they are definitely not as nice.,5,2018,12,18
207,Travel in luxury,"Shelbourne is truly a magnificent experience. From time of arrival to departure the days were smooth, without incident, accommodating and convenient. Reasonably central, it is a short walk to the downtown district. Even closer are several pubs that are both amusing and enjoyable. There is nothing like the character of an Irish Pub. The hotel had many amenities, service was impeccable and they were very helpful in suggesting place to go and things to do. The hotel has a great deal of history and several lounges and restaurants available on site. There is no doubt we will be back, outstanding.",5,2018,12,17
207,Festive Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea is great way to catch up with people and I like to try it in different places. The Shelbourne this December was probably one of the best experiences I have had. I was there with another adult and two children. The desserts were amazing - works of art! The atmosphere was great, the staff attentive and the surroundings are beautiful. There are sitting times which means people aren't constantly coming in and out and the time is generous - we didn't feel rushed. Overall an experience that I'm hoping to repeat again and again.",5,2018,12,17
207,Lovely old-world hotel in the heart of  Dublin city,"Have stayed in the Shelbourne a couple of times, and it is one of the nicest hotels in Dublin. The service is exceptional - all the staff really can't do enough for you; from the door staff, valets, receptionists, bar maids etc. At Christmas time, the whole hotel is decorated fabulously and it really adds to the festive atmosphere. Since we last stayed, they've opened a residents only bar upstairs which is great, as the main bars get extremely busy with non-residents and it can be hard to find standing room not mind a table in the evenings!

Our room was exceptionally spacious, with luxurious robes, slippers and toiletries provided. The turn-down service is an added nice touch.

Reason I didn't give 5 stars is for a couple of reasons, which I've listed below:

- When we stayed, there was a problem with the air-con / heating in the hotel, and our room was stifling hot. We reported this to reception who advised it was a hotel-wide issue, and they had engineers onsite to try and fix it. They offered us an in-room cooler which we accepted, but when we returned to our room after that brought this, we found it was a huge noisy contraption which required the window to be open, so we asked they remove it after a while, as it was too disturbing to keep in the room for more than a couple of hours when you're there.
- We requested an ice bucket and one point (as this isn't provided in-room as standard), and it took nearly an hour for it to arrive.
- We stayed for 2 nights and used most of the toiletries on the first night; these weren't replaced on the 2nd morning when housekeeping made up the room.
- We had some drinks in the residents-only bar, and on both nights, the time between ordering drinks and them arriving was a bit long (up to 20 minutes at one point)
- One of the lifts was broken for a couple of hours on our 2nd day, and this resulted in some long wait times when only 1 was available to all guests.

I've called these out, as this is a 5-star establishment, but despite these minor issues, I would definitely return to this hotel. It is slightly on the pricier side, but worth it as a treat!",4,2018,12,17
207,Amazing,"After many years of being in the Shelbourne for functions, I stayed there on Friday. I now love this hotel even more. There is something very special about it. The staff are friendly but not overbearing. The rooms are lovely. The breakfast is fabulous.",5,2018,12,16
207,Lovely stay,"My friend & I had a wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel, from the minute we entered the front door we were treated like royalty. The room was divine, dinner superb & staff were amazing especially Eleana on Reception who was so pleasant & considerate making our check in & out seamless.",5,2018,12,15
207,"Absolutely love this place, it gives you a big hug when you enter and it's a tonic!","This must be our sixth or seventh visit to the Shelbourne.

The hotel, its bars and its staff never fail to impress us.  We always worry that one day we will be disappointed or even bored of staying here but we need not have been concerned.

Check-in was lovely with staff being so nice and helpful.  Our standard room was as expected - warm, clean and with a very comfy bed and plenty of space.

The No27 bar can be quiet or bustly but it's such a great place to have some food and drink, chat, people watch or just chill.  The new 1824(?) residents' bar is a new addition since we last came and is a lovely peaceful oasis away from the busy hotel.

We also had the grand tower fish platter for tea in the No27 bar and it was delicious with loads of seafood including Oysters, prawns, mussels, crab and lobster - splendid!

We can't wait to come back and be 'cuddled' and looked after by this lovely place.",5,2018,12,11
207,Light lunch at the Shelbourne,"Dint stay at the Shelbourne on this occasion just dropped in for very enjoyable light lunch today with my wife. As we perched on our high bar stools & perused the menu we had a great vantage point to scan the Christmas shoppers , office lunchers & legal eagles. We ordered a large glasse
 of  Pinot Grigio for M  & Albariño for me. Now on to menu choices Celeriac Soup  for M  & Avocado on Flat Bread topped with Smoked Salmon for me,exquisite :. My Albariño was perfect with the smoked salmon not sure about the Pinot Grigio  with Celeriac Soup. It’s notoriously hard to match any wine with soup — the experts recomendation would be a dry fino Sherry. Our light lunch & wines cost 46 euros  for two — great value for s great venue & lunch time experience. ",5,2018,12,10
207,Party night out,"superb Hotel located beside Grafton Street and St Stephens green, expensive but worth it if you want location and to spoil your friends or family, the whole place busses with excitement and people enjoying themselves. Breakfast in the saddle room is fab, lovely décor and friendly staff with gorgeous food and plenty choices.",4,2018,12,10
207,A great hotel,"Really cannot beat this hotel. Location, design, service, all top class. Room service was excellent, really looked after. Very busy with functions and a great buzz around it. Highly recommend. We could cover all the main sights easily on foot, minutes from the shops at Grafton Street. Great piece of history embedded here also as we found out when we visited the GPO and bear the story of the famous 1916 rising. St Stephens green opposite. If you want class, service and location, I cannot imagine any being better in Dublin.",5,2018,12,09
207,Traditional Old European Hotel,"Very Classy and Traditional Old Hotel. Definitely a 5 star hotel. Customer service was outstanding from the minute we arrived at the front door. Bartender was very friendly. 

Bedroom and Bathroom were both very modern.

Breakfast was very good, with both a nice Buffet and menu order options.

Location was very good. Right across the street from Steven's Green. It was a short walk to many pubs and restaurants. I short walk in the other direction to shopping.
It was a longer walk be from here we also walked to The Temple  Bar, The Cathedrals Dublin Castle and to the Guinness Factory.",5,2018,12,03
207,Hard to find any faults,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for a weekend in Dublin and it was a wonderful hotel. The lobby is beautiful, the staff are all very friendly and the rooms are magnificent. Having stayed at a lot of different marriott and Renaissance properties I would say this hotel has to be right at the top of their offerings. There was a turn down service included and along with the amenities make this the place to stay.

If I had to have a quibble I would say that as a 6 '2 man showering in the over bath rain show is a bit troublesome as the shower head isnt high enough but this really is a small small thing in relation to how wonderful this hotel is. We will stay here when we come back to Dublin.",5,2018,12,03
207,Absolutely wonderful!,Just returned today from a bucket list 2 day trip to this fantastic hotel. Had been before but had never stayed. Will probably be my last visit due to health reasons but wonderful memories already. From our wonderful upgraded room with wine and chocolates on arrival everything and everyone was wonderful. It is clear that all staff are trained to say yes to every- reasonable- request and nothing seems too much trouble. The Saddle room for breakfast is beautiful as was the food- the best breakfast ever. People watching in the 27 bar is a treat as was the 1824 residents bar. Touches like the turn down service were an added bonus. Many thanks to everyone who made this a special trip but especially to Katie in reservations for all her help and Billy in Guest relations for meeting us and arranging the added extras.,5,2018,11,29
207,Great Location in Downtown Dublin,"The Shelbourne – Dublin

The Shelbourne is blessed with the best location in Dublin as it is walking distance to most major attractions, shopping and tons of dinning options.  The Hotel is a very grande building which has kept a lot of the tradition intact.  Our room was very large with great closet space, bedding and toiletries.  The bathroom was large and very nicely appointed with all the amenities needed.  The bed could not be more comfortable.  We took advantage of the Saddle room for breakfasts were they hosted a full buffet and a la carte menu.  Service in the lobby, restaurants and with the butlers was fabulous.  The Irish are genuinely kind and caring and we felt that hospitality at every turn at the Shelbourne.  
Great hotel with great service and location.",4,2018,11,28
207,Great Dublin Option,"We booked this hotel for our way into Ireland.  We knew that we would be arriving early and requested early check in.  The hotel was very accommodating.  We were able to go into one room at 7 am and the other at 10 am.  This was huge after being up overnight.

One room was on any alley which was kind of noisy and looked over into an office building.  It was good sized but a bit of a bummer.  It was the room that was available at 7 am, so when the day is done, no complaints from us.  Our son stayed in the room and none of these bothered him.  

The other room looked into the courtyard and was very quiet and serene.  A wonderful location.

For some reason, our AC was not working and our room was very hot.  We waited way to long to report it, yet facilities was Johnny on the spot and set us up with a portable AC unit which got the job done just fine.  

All of the staff was very polite and customer focused.  We had a superb breakfast and the bartenders in the bar were great.

This is a must go back to spot for us for both the service and the ambiance.  The historic charm is beautiful.  Every room and every nook and cranny is unique and special.  Certainly not a cookie cutter property.",5,2018,11,27
207,Amazing Stay at Shelbourne!,The Shelbourne is awesome! It was in the perfect location for everywhere in Dublin. Everything in the hotel was perfect and to our liking. We loved every moment of our stay here. Definitely the nicest hotel in the city.,5,2018,11,27
207,1st anniversary ,"We got married in The Shelbourne last year. We booked this year & mentioned our special day. We got upgraded & champagne, chocolates to our room. Very nice touch. Dined in restaurant, food class as was service. Few drinks in bar after. Service & atmosphere were second to none. Great hotel to visit. Recommend it . Thank you",5,2018,11,26
207,Fantastic couple of nights.,This is a great hotel and in a perfect location. Rooms are superb as you would expect as are the facilities but what really stood out to me was the staff.  They could not do enough for you and they were genuinely friendly.  Sadly I was too busy to enjoy the spa and gym but what I could see looked fantastic.  Must go back soon.,5,2018,11,24
207,Holiday away,The hotel location is perfect and everything about the hotel is perfect. The service is outstanding the room is top notch and of course the afternoon tea is a must. You should definitely stay here if you like to be pampered.,5,2018,11,22
207,A Tourist Attraction in Itself ,"It’s terribly expensive so not for everyone but if you are looking for a treat in Dublin then have one night here. It’s more than a hotel it is a historic site in its own right. 

It’s very traditional and old school and feels like a stately home, but much more like one the Queen would live in rather than Harry and Meghan. 

I found the Concierge service extremely disappointing (arrogant and rude). I can’t remember the last time I queued for over 10 minutes (completely ignored, no eye contact, no we’ll just be a few minutes etc) and then when he finally deigned to speak to me was unhelpful, bordering on unpleasant). 

The above treatment was out of character with the rest of my experience in the hotel and the staff were lovely, easy to deal with etc. 

If money is an issue go to the bar for a few drinks, it’s very attractive and interesting and has a great outlook on to the street. ",5,2018,11,20
207,Reliving old times,"Believe it or not, it was fifty years since I’d last stayed in the Shelbourne, at the end of my time at UCD. Needless to say, there have been a few changes - all for the better!
Great food, comfortable room, and great service throughout the hotel.
Hopefully it won’t be another fifty years before I return.",4,2018,11,14
207,Our favorite in Dublin,"We have stayed at the Shelbourne a few times now and have always had a great experience.  The staff is super friendly and accommodating and the location is great.  Across from St. Stephens Green, it’s a lovely part of the city, yet not too busy.

You have plenty of options for meals and a great bar, The Horseshoe Bar.  There is a wonderful full service spa onsite as well as a full fitness center.  

There is plenty to do in the area and you are only a couple minute walk to Dawson Street and Grafton Street.",5,2018,11,12
207,Gorgeous hotel and and an institution in Dublin,"For a great experience and a chance to experience a part of Dublin history, you can do worse than stay at The Shelbourne.  Part of the history of Dublin, the Shelbourne is situated centrally in Dublin next to Stephens Green, just off Grafton Street, Trinity College etc.  Rooms and public areas are beautifully presented, with staff professional and attentive. Not the cheapest experience but well worth it.

For visitors to Dublin and looking for an alternative to an expensive taxi, the airport bus 757 stops very near the hotel @ EUR12.00 return, or representing better value is the purchase of a Leap Visitor Card - EUR9.00 for 24 hours or EUR 19 for 72 hours, covering unlimited travel on the LUAS, DART, local buses including 747 and 757 services between the airport and Dublin",5,2018,11,12
207,Wonderful Hotel!,"We had a great stay at the Shelbourne. Room was lovely. Service outstanding. Breakfast options were delicious. Location couldn't be better, on St Stephen's Green. 5 minute walk from the Little Museum. On the DoDublin bus route. 757 bus from Dublin Airport drops you off almost at the door. Walking distance to Grafton Street shopping and Temple Bar.",5,2018,11,11
207,Dublin and the Shelbourne,"Excellent hotel oozing history and style. Stayed here for a week at the beginning of November 2018 with family and had 2 rooms. My room was upgraded which was good of the hotel. Rooms are very comfortable, however a bit on the small size but that is only my opinion and not a critisism as the rooms are very well appointed and extremely comfortable.
Breakfasts are expensive at €29 if you do not have them included in the room rate but are exceptional in quality and choice.
I would stay again. ",5,2018,11,11
207,Absolutely amazing stay,"I always like renaissance chain of Marriott’s. But this property completely blew my mind off. 

The location, the guest rooms, the service and the history of the property are all exceeding my expectations. 

The convenient location makes it easy to explore Dublin on foot. The service makes our stay a memorable one. The staff cared for details and made absolutely sure all of our needs are met in a timely manner. 

They only regret I had was that we couldn’t spend more time at the hotel to enjoy it more due to our tight schedule. 

I’ll definitely come back next time we are in Dublin.

207,Top Hotel In Dublin,I have stayed here a good few times and love the Bars and Restaurants so much that I do visit quite a bit....I stayed here back in Jan'18 and had a beautiful room overlooking St Stephen's Green. Rooms are big and plush. I always recommend this hotel to friends visiting Dublin.,5,2018,11,08
207,AMAZING ,"We stayed here in March for a weekend break and oh my goodness it's easy to see why this is a hotel ranked amongst the top hotels in the world.  Apologies for my delay in posting such a delightful experience...
The opulence of the decor is splendid. The front desk experience was beyond amazing so friendly and professional .
Jackie the front of house manager added to the supreme welcome we received and escorted us to our room. Such friendly professional and personal welcome to this fantastic hotel.
We stayed in the Michael Collins suite which is splendid in its size and grandure and such exquisite decor. The front facing windows overlooking St Stephens green. The Michael Collins suite is seeped in history with decor  books and chair blankets all linked to the man himself. 
The suite is simply amazing in every detail. The bathroom is beautifully detailed and stocked with luxury toiletries.  There is a fantastic private sitting room.  I could go on and on about the high end finishes the opulence of the room and it's amenities...but I'll just shorten my comments to say it was a hotel suite experience that will last with me for a lifetime for all the right reasons it was simply heavenly.
The breakfast experience at the Shelbourne was beyond words ...it bears little or no comparison to any other hotel breakfast experiences. A selection of foods so vast and luxurious I was like a child on Christmas morning. My stand out breakfast moment was velveteen porridge with irish whisky and cream ..service was beyond amazing. Our table server was so friendly  professional and charming full of irish hospitality and welcome ( Saoirse  I think her name was ). I wanted the experience to last until lunchtime such was my delight.
You can't help but feel like royalty in this hotel, the staff are quite simply amazing. The hotel is quite simply amazing amazing amazing. Everyone needs to have a Shelbourne experience at least once in their lives.  ",5,2018,11,07
207,Better than 25 years ago!,We stayed at the Shelbourne again after 25 years.  It has only improved with time.  The room was larger (maybe we had a lower category last time) and the bathroom much better.  Dinner was excellent in their main restaurant though now it is modern rather than the classic dining room of the past.  The large bar is very pleasant but definitely check out the Horseshoe bar for a cozy historic spot for a Guinness.  The hotel location is great - walkable to most sites one would visit.  Service was friendly throughout.,5,2018,11,06
207,Magnificent hotel,"This was my first time at the hotel. It was top notch. True luxury.  There are three unique bars.  The food, drinks and service were all terrific.  The hotel has a great location across from historic St Stephens green and close to lots of shopping and restaurants on and around Dawson Street.",5,2018,11,06
207,Best hotel in Dublin,"As always fantastic service 
Quick check in lady who checked us in was very polite 
She asked if we needed any help with restaurant reservations 
Fantastic atmosphere as you walk in you would defiantly want to go into the bar before you even check in 
Location perfect 
Lovely room big bathroom 
Lovely bed linen",4,2018,11,06
207,Luxurious and Centrally Located,"My wife and I came here to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. This was the 1st time staying at the hotel and the experience was wonderful. From the moment we entered the Staff were friendly, polite and courteous. The room was clean, very relaxing and the bathroom stocked with elemis toiletries. We enjoyed some drinks in both the horseshoe bar and No. 27 and my wife would recommended the Dingle gin. The staff on hearing we were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary organised a lovely plate of Petit Fours, which my wife absolutely loved.",5,2018,11,04
207,Largely disappointing and dated ,"As a marriott member I booked directly which was not the easiest experience and didn't include breakfast. So upon check in I asked about adding breakfast and told there are no special deals for staying for breakfast and would be an extra €29 per person for cooked breakfast each day. The service is non-existent in this hotel and check in is cold and get you on your way as quickly. I would imagine this would differ if your staying in premium room or a known big spender but for average guest they seem very uncaring. We stayed in a deluxe king room and room isn't very spacious especially the bathroom and air con extremely erratic! The extra for breakfast in my opinion  on top of paying premium to stay here in a room is not justifiable and we chose to eat elsewhere having a beautiful cooked breakfast in Avoca at a fraction of cost! The only thing going for this hotel is location as bar is overpriced and the 2 days we stayed they had functions and you felt you where more of an inconvenience than anything else. Another main reason for choosing here was for the pool and it's a rather confusing experience trying to locate this initially. The pool area is nice but I feel it is in dire need of refurb, there are a lot of broken missing tiles in pool and lot of tiles are grotty. I would be surprised if I stayed here again as it falls far short on every level in comparison to other 5 star hotels in Dublin and is living off past glories and reputation. Look no further than the Marker if you truly want an unforgettable 5 star s luxury stay in Dublin and avoid The Shelbourne if you have any expectations or standards! ",1,2018,11,03
207,Beautiful & comfortable!,My husband and I stayed here for just a couple of nights in late October. This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Although we had no great view (looked out into offices) our room was pretty and comfortable. We had a delicious breakfast in the hotel restaurant that was included in our hotel status. There is also a lovely bar/restaurant area. Highly recommend!,5,2018,11,03
207,Beautiful hotel in perfect location.   ,"This hotel is in perfect location across from St. stephen’s green and close to Grafton Street.  Hotel itself is decorated beautifully, right from Victorian Era.  We got upgraded and I still thought our room was a bit small.  Decorated nicely, but small.  Bathroom was large and modern.  Tried to get a drink at both main floor bars before and after dinner and they were absolutely packed at both times.  Wish I had the opportunity to try them.  They looked cool.  ",4,2018,11,03
207,Outstanding Perfect,"The Shelbourne Hotel is the MOST amazing hotel that I have stayed at and as a Marriott Lifetime Platinum elite member I can certainly comment on SERVICE Oriented and Consumer Focused staff compared to my other hotel experiences .
My sister and I came to the UK a few weeks ago and used my points to stay  at this  stunning hotel.The minute we entered the Shelbourne staff  were so happy to see  us and greet us  with such smiles . The front desk staff apologized that our room was not ready. We weren't upset at all and so  happy to wonder around the  downtown area for a few hours [ we arrived in Dublin much earlier than expected] When we returned too soon the staff felt horrid so we were upgraded to a gorgeous suite for our inconvenience . I can't tell you enough how proud the staff are of this hotel and THANK YOU BILLY and the other Front desk  manager [I'm sorry I cant remember your name] plus all the staff for your assistance, history lessons,wonderful sense of humour and making us feel like Royalty. 
My everyday job involves Public Relations and people skills and I only hope that I treat people with such warmth ,professionalism  and kindness as you did with us . It made our trip and will certainly be  returning in 2019. 
Bravo to you all - Marriott  and Shelbourne management ,please understand how lucky you are to have such loyal and outstanding people in this organization.",5,2018,10,31
207,Not happy with room!,"We were assigned a room facing a large building and I immediately heard a loud buzzing or humming noise coming from the outdoors.  I assumed it was possibly construction work but wasn't sure.  I think it may have been the heating and cooling units but not sure.  I asked for a room change and was reassigned and could still hear this noise.  I spoke with a manager and he had no idea about this noise.  I asked him if he wanted to come to the room to hear it and he declined.  I am sure the staff is aware of the rooms in close proximity to this humming.  Also the room was really warm.  The AC didn't seem to work and the room never cooled down.  Yes, this hotel has a grand entry and formal tea etc but the comfort of the room is the important part for me.  I was not satisfied with the room conditions.",2,2018,10,31
207,Superb Stay in Dublin!,"Definitely a show-stopper of a hotel with great history, but the staff make it even better.  Our family has stayed with Marriott hotels many times over the years, and this may be my favorite.  The breakfast is fantastic (although not much choice for vegans), the room was small but luxurious, and it helped to have an umbrella to use when out and about.  The location is excellent; we walked everywhere with ease from the hotel.",5,2018,10,31
207,A gem in the citt,"Such a great yo stay in this historic hotel in the city centre overlooking Stephen's Green. Such charm and style, this hotel have everything to impress its guests. The Saddleroom is impressive, the food is exquisite and the staff are friendly, professional and exactly what is expected of a 5* property. The rooms may be small but the luxury makes up for it. Fabulous products in the bathrooms, über- comfortable, location near Grafton Street and the best of Irish hospitality make this my favourite hotel in Dublin city centre.",5,2018,10,31
207,Great afternoon tea experience ,This famous hotel is always busy but full of history. The Irish constitution was signed here. There are several sittings for afternoon tea. Service is impeccable and the choice of tea blends is excellent. Not cheap but nonetheless worth it for a great experience ,5,2018,10,30
207,Yep. You will be happy with this choice. ,"Dublin is a large city, i.e. more expensive then other areas of Ireland, so, if you are thinking of saving a couple of bucks on lodging and want a great location in this city, you’re probably not going to be happy with a “cheaper place”

You will be happy with this property.  But, Be prepared. It is busy. This is very popular because it’s on of the best in Dublin. 
Service. 5 stars. From the greeting of the valet to the front desk girl (Miriama/excellent) you will know you made the right choice. 

",5,2018,10,29
207,Great way to start a trip! ,We only stayed at The Shelbourne one night but we really enjoyed it. It is a great location walking distance to many items you want to see when visiting Dublin. They didn’t have our room ready yet but quickly stored our luggage. The whiskey bar is comfortable with a good selection.  The murals on the upstairs walls are interesting. The hotel room was spacious and comfortable. We selected a room with a balcony .... definitely not worth the extra cost. A great base for visiting Dublin. ,5,2018,10,28
207,Good but didn’t exceed my expectations,"having watched the programme I was really looking forward to afternoon tea in the Shelbourne. It was a very enjoyable experience, nice room, service great but you were aware of being on the clock as it lasts 2 hours. There were a lot of cakes, all very nice. There were 4 sandwiches each for adults. Very delicious, there weren’t enough but we were soon brought more which was great. Having looked around the room people just tend to eat the deserts. The sandwiches for me were the star. We brought my two children also and they had the time of their life, amazing attention to detail for the kids. An experience they will remember forever. Overall very pleased but having had afternoon in the Merrion hotel, it was a more relaxed and better experience. We sat on sofas by a fire and you just felt like you were at home. I think the Shelbournes one is a little too commercial. Photos are adults for two tea and the second the kids received one each",4,2018,10,28
207,Meets Every Expectation,"This is a historic property, wonderful in every respect. Situated in the heart of Dublin, everything is accessible and much is walkable. It is handsome. From arrival, through check in, you are handled efficiently, properly and warmly. Our accommodations were spacious, sumptuous and elegant. I've rarely done so well. Purposely, we opted against a street facing room and we experienced perfect quiet. Breakfasts were perfect. 

Usually I write a longer review.  Here, it is simply, correctly, excellent. Choose this one.",5,2018,10,28
207,Afternoon tea at the shelbourne,"""Dublin can be heaven with coffee at eleven and a stoll down stephens green"" as the song goes. Afternoon  tea at the shelbourne hotel is truly heaven on a brisk October afternoon. The whole experience was wonderful from the very attentive care from Klunda and Gregory to the delightful food. If you are looking for a gift idea for visiting guests or native Dubs you will be thanked many times over for an afternoon tea experience voucher at the shelbourne. I cannot rate it high enough. Fantastic and we are looking forward to a return visit.",5,2018,10,28
207,Fabulous!,"Albeit a bit expensive (all nice Dublin hotels seem to be but this should change with new ones coming online in the future), the Shelbourne Dublin was fabulous!  It is in a great location just two blocks from Grafton street, 10 minute walk to Trinity College, 25 minute walk to Christ Church, Dublin Castle, Guinness, etc. (we like walking).  The food was superb, service excellent.  Well done Shelbourne Dublin!",5,2018,10,27
207,Great place,Stayed at Shelbourne for a business trip in August. I am usually into ultra modern properties. But this time around and even knowing I had this tiny tiny room - I slept as a baby.  No kidding. Crazy but true. Next time when in town  I will ask for same room. Lol.,5,2018,10,27
207,Phenomenal Tradition,"Fabulous 5 star hotel in the heart of Dublin. Nice sized rooms with luxury feel.  Great bar and restaurant, the Tea room was bustling with activity.  Convenient to great shopping close to Trinity college. ",5,2018,10,26
207,luxury hotel lives up to reputation,"This hotel is really a perfect location, at a decent price considering that it is a luxury hotel with every luxury amenity you want or imagine.  The people are extremely helpful and nice.  I would stay here again for sure!!",5,2018,10,25
207,Stunning Hitel,Beautiful hotel.  Got a room upgrade to a huge suite likely because Marriott Platinum.  Paid in points originally.  Bar is awesome. Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Valet parking was easy and necessary.  Close walk to Dublin sites.,5,2018,10,24
207,"Dublin on a ""Sunny Summers Morning""","Stayed at the Shelbourne over the weekend. The really enjoyable experience starts with the decor inside the building, their is an air of opulence as you step inside.
The Heritage room we were allocated was standard size with a great bathroom & Elemis products. Only 1 dressing gown supplied which I thought unusual.  A loud buzzing noise from the A/C unit in my room was quite annoying at night. Enjoyed a great meal at dinner in the saddle restaurant. Breakfast was very good but not the best in Ireland. Im a tour guide and get to travel all of our beautiful hotels around the Country.
Enjoyed Dublin & the Shelbourne.",4,2018,10,23
207,Nice but useless staff ,"The first room we got was tiny but then we were moved to a larger room but with smaller beds ...
The hotel is excellent located but the staff is ridiculous and completely useless. And it’s quite expensive.
The food is excellent.",3,2018,10,22
207,Excellent hotel with superior quality service,"We stayed here for two nights. During that time we enjoyed shopping on the nearby Grafton Street. We also enjoyed relaxing in the nearby St Stephens Green park. We found the leisure suite to be highly relaxing and thoroughly enjoyed our Pre booked pampering sessions. The food was of excellent quality and delicious. The staff we found to be helpful, friendly and polite. The building in which this hotel is situated is beautiful and very close to tourist attractions. Our visit was one which we thoroughly enjoyed and we would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,10,20
207,Proper five star property in the heart of the city,"I spent quite a few nights at the Shelbourne whilst on business for almost two years. SPG status went a long way with various suites upgrades, complimentary breakfast and complimentary welcome drinks. Probably my favourite hotel in Dublin!

Property is really outstanding and most of the (refurbished) rooms are really nice. All suites overlooking St Stephens Green on the 6th and 7th floors are absolutely gorgeous and a treat after a busy day. Breakfast is probably the best in town, dinner menu is also great with various options from local sourced farmers. Both bars (theres an irish pub like bar as well as a high end cocktail bar) are equally fun, depending on what mood your are on. 

Spa facilities are also fantastic. It’s hard to find a nice indoor pool in Dublin and this one is excellent. Gym is bigger than your average hotel gym, with access to a steam room and a sauna. 

Shout out to Fatima from guest relations and the concierge Denis for always making my stays special. You two are missed !",5,2018,10,20
207,Perfect hotel stay!,"Used points to stay our last night I. Ireland here. Perfect location right next to bus stops and an amazing park. Close to many activities/ walking distance. The hotel itself is gorgeous, the room was large with a great bathroom and the bed was extremely comfortable. We weren’t able to try the restaurant for breakfast but did have one nightcap after a long day. The No. 27 bar was great and the staff was very friendly. Would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,10,19
207,Simply breathtaking,First time staying at this hotel and I can tell you now it won't be the last. From the second you walk through the doors you are taken back in time (in an amazing way) the hotel is simply stunning. I normally go for ultra modern hotels and didn't book here myself but I am converted. Staff were delightful. Food first class. Ireland at its best,5,2018,10,19
207,Just tea and scones for the experience,"Snazzy hotel right across from the green, complete with a top hatted doorman. Went into bar, rather than fancier restaurant for tea and scones. Service was great and chairs were super comfy. The decor says it all. Get dressed in your Sunday finest, if you dare.",4,2018,10,19
207,"Historic, Beautiful, Quality Hotel.","The Shelbourne, across from St Stephens Green in Dublin, is a really nice place to use as a base to see Dublin.  We stayed here for a few days (9/26-9/29/18) prior to a tour of Ireland with CIE.  It was renovated in 2007, and looks great.  We arrived early on 9/26, and stayed in an second floor lounge, with had a library, with an outside patio until our room was ready.  

My wife told me to say the room was gorgeous, and it was. Good size, all marble bathroom.

The hotel was occupied by British troops during the Easter Uprising in 1916, so it is a landmark historic hotel.  Turns out Hitlers elder half brother worked here in the early 1900s also. The Irish constitution was drafted in room 112 of the hotel in 1922. There is a mini museum where you check in also.  

The front of the hotel is really impressive, with big outside globe lights marking the entrance.  When we walked in, the lobby had a gigantic floral display.  Looking around, you then see the intricate gold leaf painting on the walls and columns.  

There are a number of really good restaurants within the hotel, and we tried almost all of them, several times. The bar is impressive.  It's location is only a few blocks from the top of Grafton Street (right turn from the hotel, and a great restaurant called Peploe's between them), and a bunch of great pubs going to the left (Foleys for one). I walked down to the Liffey River from here, about a 20 minute walk, passing the government office and the Natural History museum. If you want to get a cab, the doorman is obliging, and fares are very reasonable.  I had a conversation with one, who provided some insight into my wife's maiden Irish name.  Very engaging fellow.

The hotel is a Renaissance Marriott, so we used points, until our tour started. Its a great place to use to start your tour of Ireland.  I would stay here again, no question!",5,2018,10,18
207,Excellent Stay & Fantastic Location,"We stayed at this hotel 06Oct2018 for 3 nights.  Hotel is location is superb for walking the city!  Room was immaculately clean, well thought out in terms of all amenities, pool area was good as was the fitness facilities.  Staff were truly caring and helpful each and every day.  The restaurants and lounge area was great!  The history alone makes for a great stay.  I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin.  You cannot go wrong by staying here!",5,2018,10,16
207,Trip to Dublin,"We stayed at the Shelbourne while we were in Dublin October 5 and 6, 2018 with our family.  The hotel, bars and restaurants were great.  Location was perfect.  Service was terrific and the staff very kind and helpful.",5,2018,10,15
207,"A beautiful, classic hotel","We just completed a 5 night stay here and couldn’t have been more pleased. Excellent location in a stunning neighborhood; a friendly staff that bends over backwards to make guests feel at home and offers great advice for sightseeing and restaurants; and beautiful public rooms. We stayed in a king room that was extremely well appointed, 
had a very comfortable bed, and was immaculate.7The Saddle Room had excellent breakfasts and we also had two wonderful dinners there—servers for breakfast and dinner were top-notch. A true five-star hotel all around and definitely one of the Crown Jewels in the Marriott portfolio.

207,History Retained ,"I’ve stayed in this wonderful hotel on many occasions and it never fails to be anything other than amazing, No 27 Bar hustle and bustle mixture of tourist locals enjoy a superb atmosphere great menu and bar food , saddle room for that little more privacy and subtle touches excellent food , staff are amazingly helpful and interact in a professional manner with everyone always willing to go that little extra , Hotel itself is steeped in Irish history and situated right in the heart of Dublin’s vibrant Centre of Bars and Fantastic Restaurants & shopping district If you wanted to try something different, Highly Recommended",5,2018,10,14
207,Champagne on the house ! ,They really looked after us tonight - just lovely staff and great venue. Circular bar with class situated right near the Grafton. Bought a bottle of their own Rose wine and they also gave us lovely glasses of bubbly free and nibbles :) such friendly staff ,5,2018,10,13
207,Lousy experience,"Had high hopes but ended up with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent years. Started with weird customer friend-less welcome by the receptionist. 
I had booked a de luxe room that actually turned out to be a  sauna. Apparently the air con was broken in all rooms! Not what you expect of a 5 star. No room change offered /possible, just a fan that really made no difference. No apology. No offer of anything in compensation, not even a comp fruit bowl or something by way of apology. Terrible from allegedly one of the best hotels in Dublin. Meal in bar was nice although food slow to arrive but when it did both starters and mains basically came at the same time, so ended up having both with no break. Again not what you expect in a place like this. Left after a terrible, hot uncomfortable night, leaving an uncaring, expensive complacent hotel behind. Not coming back, plenty of competition thankfully.",1,2018,10,13
207,10 STARS,"This hotel is beautiful. From the Flowers in the entry way to the rooms. Turn down service every night. Stocked refrigerator (and they came by to see if you needed anything restocked during the night). The staff was amazing, friendly and attentive. ",5,2018,10,11
207,Wonderful hotel in Dublin,"Our group of four couples found The Shelbourne Dublin a perfect beginning to our trip to Ireland and Scotland.  The location could not be better, we walked to many of the sights we wanted to see.  The bars, restaurants and buffet breakfast were amazing.  The staff was very nice, we enjoyed talking with them and the concierge service helped us to find a wonderful restaurant just down the block.",5,2018,10,10
207,Whiskey Tasting with Daire,"My daughter and I attended a whiskey tasting in the Horseshoe Bar with Daire, who is an expert on Irish Whiskies.  More than an expert, Daire was fun and informative, making the history of Irish whiskey (""water of life"") making come alive.  And the whiskies were pretty darn good, too.  Definitely recommend this!",5,2018,10,02
207,Great hotel in a wonderful city!,"Very nice, classic and classy hotel in a superb location. Very nice and comfortable rooms and great and friendly staff. Good restaurant and nice bar with lots of guests. A very nice gym and pool area. The hotel is located in a great part of Dublin within walking distance to everything. Great hotel, great city - and if in Dublin I would definitely stay here again. Certainly recommend it to anyone, leisure or business - a great place to stay!",5,2018,10,02
207,Nice as always ,"Great hotel in a great location 

Always elegant, yet practical

However, this time my room “leaked” fairly significantly.   The hotel made it right - moving me and helping me.   Guess this stuff happens.

I’d stay here again - every time.

207,Fablous,"Attended the Lauren Perrier five course tasting menu dinner and have to say from start to finish everything was fablous.
The champange reception first was served with nibbles of cheese balls divine
Dinner and champange in saddle room amazing excellent presentation and tastes on every course
Only regret didnt get to stay in hotel
Maybe next time",5,2018,10,02

207,Old World Feel in the Heart of Dublin,We had a great couple of nights at The Shelbourne. It has an old world feel with all the modern conveniences. It is in the heart of Dublin overlooking St. Stephens Green. Our room was beautiful and quiet. The main bar is great for a drink and people watching. We’ll definitely be back.,5,2018,09,30
207,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service","Loved this hotel, it's absolutely stunning inside and out.  Rooms and decor are consistent throughout.  Rooms are immaculate.  Restaurant is modern and upscale. At breakfast  the service was incredibly friendly.  The horsehoe bar is intimate and and upscale and offers great Irish service.  Health club facilities are fantastic.  Location is right in the heart of Dublin. This is the 5-star hotel you should book into on your next trip to Dublin.",5,2018,09,24
207,Very special Hotel,"We had a family event here in September. We dined in a private room and the attention we received was second to none. This is not normally the kind of location I would visit but its how the other half live! Superb food, excellent service and interesting surroundings. A real treat if you have a special occasion. Very highly recommended.",5,2018,09,24
207,We had made 2 small requests - they failed.,"Two months before my stay I called and emailed the concierge. I was keen to plan our short 1 night visit to Dublin city. I had asked for a Dinner reservation at the Ivy Grill and my wife requested some information about a Catholic church close to the hotel.

We arrived early and as the room was not ready so we completed the registration forms and went to tour the city. As we did not receive the call to say that our room was ready we returned tired at 16:00 - still not ready and it took some time to get our keys. 

On the way out to dinner as I had not received a confirmation of my reservation - the guy at the desk had no record of my request and explained that they prefer not to call the restaurant as it can be difficult to get an answer. He advised that we should walk the block ourselves.  Fail #1 = No Reservation

Next Day we took a short walk to the local church for the 10am mass. Fail #2 = Mass had started at 9.30.

In short its expensive and not worth the stress",2,2018,09,24
207,Fablous,"Hotel and room was excellent, Shelbourne is in great location, fantastic hotel experience, loved the staff and they were extremely helpful and courteous.

207,Best Location in Dublin,"This is a beautiful 5 star property in the middle of Dublin and within walking distance to everything.  The service is excellent, the bar is upscale, fun and engaging with a great vibe.  The rooms are nicely appointed with beautiful bathrooms.  The restaurants looked great but we did not visit.  If you are trying to decide on a Dublin hotel, don't hesitate and book the Shelbourne (especially if you are a Marriott member).",5,2018,09,21
207,Excellent hotel,"Excellent location, superb service.  Enjoyed high tea here as well which was fantastic.   Close to most things in Dublin, lovely location across from St Stephen’s Green.   Rooms were excellent size and good bathroom facilities. Evening turn down was a lovely touch.

207,We loved this perfect hotel,"What a fantastic experience.  Everything was sheer perfection.  Excellent location, a 10-15 minute walk to all the best sights in Dublin.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  The Horseshoe bar was a favorite.  We will definitely be back.",5,2018,09,19
207,First class hotel,The shelbourne hotel is in the heart of the city and easily assessable to most attractions. The hotel itself is updated and modern and the staff were helpful as well. I would recommend this hotel because of its location and overall care given to the hotel.,5,2018,09,19
207,Stayed twice,"We stayed at the Shelbourne twice on our Ireland trip - 3 days at the beginning and the last night.   We really enjoyed our time here.  The hotel is a beautiful property with a few bars and restaurants on the first floor.   The check in area is in a smaller room as you walk in through the lobby.  The check in  process was methodical in our first stay but very quick on our second.  We got similar rooms both stays - small cozy comfortable rooms with one queen bed and not a tremendous amount of room to negotiate.  The rooms have safes, coffee makers, 2 bottles of water, disposible slippers, bathrooms with shower stalls and toiletries.  There were no USB ports, however.  While our rooms were small, they were comfortable and service also was very good.  We got turn down service every night where they put some chocolate on your nightstand every evening and slippers at your bedside.  This was a nice touch.  Also, location is key for the Shelbourne as it's right across the street from St Stephen's Green, a few blocks to Dawson Street and the Aircoach to the airport stops just a block away across the street from the seemingly open 24 hours Starbucks.  We also made use of the Horseshoe bar one evening.  The barman made us a couple nice cocktails for roughly 30 something Euros (pics of bar and drinks attached).  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,09,18
207,Comfortable stay,"Stayed with my husband for a night to meet up with friends from the US.

Lovely friendly staff.  Both bars very good.  Excellent cocktails & service.  We didn’t eat  in the hotel.

We had a small suite.  Bathroom, towels, gowns etc all very nice.  My only complaint was the double bed was 2 singles, badly joined together which wasn’t so comfortable.

Would definitely stay again though.

207,Amazing visit!,"Our family of three had High Tea at the Shelbourne and it was a wonderful experience we will always remember. Our hostess, Eimear, and her staff provided flawless service, seamlessly working with the chef to adapt the tea menu to our specific allergy requirements. The room was gorgeous and the atmosphere was absolutely relaxed and comfortable. Rarely have we been so pampered!

After tea, we were treated to a hotel tour by staff guest relations host Billy Kilkenny. His personality and charm were absolutely unparalleled - he was the personification of Irish hospitality and humour. In particular, his knowledge of Irish history and the story of the Shelbourne during the 1916 rising was absolutely captivating. 

Thanks you so so much for giving us such a wonderful experience during our visit to Ireland.

207,Memorable Stay,"We had 3 most enjoyable nights at this well appointed hotel.  The location was second to none.  You could literally walk to almost anywhere and the different modes of transportation were easily accessible.  We enjoyed lovely buffet breakfasts before heading out on our daily excursions.  The Concierge was extremely helpful, with ideas and points of interest to visit.  Our room was spacious and well equipped. The Bar was lively and the lobby was exquisite.",5,2018,09,17
207,"An excellent hotel on St. Stephen's Green,","The Shelbourne is a magnificent old hotel, brought up to date by the Marriott/ Renaissance management. Our three nights at the Shelbourne were delightful, made better by the thoughtfulness of the staff, who responded quickly to our requests for information, reservations, and bedding modifications. I would recommend the Shelbourne without hesitation. On top of excellent accommodations and service, its location across from St. Stephen's Green and a short walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, and Temple Bar make it ideal for visiting Dublin.",5,2018,09,17
207,Wonderful Restaurant,"In Dublin for afternoon and wanted to visit Trinity College, National Gallery and Merion Park- decided to stop at Shelbourne for lunch- food service and staff were excellent/ would have loved to go back for dinner- while we didn’t stay at hotel it is obviously the best in downtown Dublin",5,2018,09,16
207,Classic Hotel,"We wish we had more time there, but because of a Aer Lingus screw up, we arrived too late and had to leave way too early. But the Shelbourne is a wonderful hotel with a great  staff, but be sure to ask to see the back dining room with some fantastic cartoons.",5,2018,09,16
207,Pure Luxury,"Beautiful property in a great location, with attentive staff and all of the extras you would expect from a luxury hotel.  I especially liked the turn-down service and the room service was exceptional.  Very nice bar on site.",5,2018,09,16
207,The Shelbourne hotel Dublin,I have had regular reflexology treatments in this hotel this year and the treatments are amazing .After each treatment you can enjoy a lovely juice and fresh fruit which comes with your treatment and then relax . I would really recommend this treatment to everyone as the therapists are excellent . Carmel grant .,5,2018,09,15
207,Wonderful experience,Went here for afternoon tea with my friends and it was just Devine! Everything from the service to the tea was just spot on. Service was good and you really get what you pay for. Location is obviously perfect too,5,2018,09,15
207,High tea time,"Went to this place for tea,  wow.   If you love tea then check this out but it is not cheap.   The service is excellent.   The tea selection is outstanding.   Love the dinner food.  The setting and piano music is so calming,  loved it",5,2018,09,14
207,Great birthday surprise fab staff,"Had pre dinner drinks in bar on Saturday 8 th September 
Wonderful drinks  service from Lauralie , myself and my friend mentioned it was our birthday weekend and 5 mins later a beautiful complementary plate of desert treats were given to us ! It was such  a surprise and wonderful service as always 
It’s great when great venues continue to provide 5 star service 
",5,2018,09,14
207,Wonderful hotel great service ,"Wonderful hotel stay here for two nights with the St Stephen Green right in front of the hotel. Room was spacious and lovely decorated  and the breakfast was with a well stocked spread. Staff are friendly and had a wonderful time roaming the surrounding areas beautiful Georgian buildings. 

A historical building with its own museum! ",5,2018,09,14
207,Classy & Great Location,"We stayed for 2 nights. We picked this hotel due to location and being SPG/Marriott property. Check-in was quick and seamless. We were surprised that we got upgraded to a suite which was priced well over $1k without having to pay for a supplement. Thank you, the Shelbourne Dublin!

The overall service was great. We received a tray of welcome gift in the room. Fresh flowers and chocolates were provided daily. Staffs were always smiling and acknowledging us. The only complain is the slow service during breakfast. When asked for butter after delivering toast, it took like 15 mins to get it and that was after asking it twice. We also experienced a similar issue during breakfast the next day.

Highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a great hotel conveniently located and willing to pay steep price.",4,2018,09,13
207,A high class hotel still make you feel at home,"I thought at first I would be paying too much for my stay for a few nights. I was wrong. From the beginning to the end, I really enjoyed staying in this hotel, I almost felt wanting to stay than go out into town for sightseeing. Hotel is conveniently located near shopping center but quiet corner of St. Stephens Green.
Housekeeping staff are all very friendly but also very courteous. Everyone made me feel at home. I will return when in Dublin again.",5,2018,09,12
207,Flawless,"We usually stay at the Merrion Hotel, but because we had Marriott points, we opted to give the shelbourne a try. I was going to be satisfied with less service and fewer amenities. Boy, was I wrong! This hotel was perfect in every way: clean, fresh, flowers, great fun in the Horseshoe Bar, location...so impressive. The. Ext time we’re in Dublin, it will only be the Shelbourne for us.",5,2018,09,12
207,Elegance and Class,"My husband travels on business to Dublin, and when he stays here I go along . This is a classy, elegant hotel . Greeted promptly upon check in , and got keys and went to enjoy breakfast. Excellent breakfast , terrific buffet or order off menu.  Room small but felt luxurious and smelled amazing . Staff all very friendly and helpful . Bars are really well done and staff awesome as well! This is a Five star hotel for food, drinks , staff, and accommodations.  Oh, and the bed is so dreamy!! Close to great restaurants and the train. Luxury and elegance . ",5,2018,09,11
207,Upscale Hotel in a Great Location,"Wonderful hotel in a great location, an easy to walk to almost all the key attractions.  The rooms are well appointed, quiet, and have very comfortable beds.   They are also known for their afternoon tea, but we did not get a chance to do that.   We did have breakfast at the hotel, which was a great buffet with all the expected breakfast items, but nothing unusual or special.  We were with another couple so we had breakfast every morning at the hotel, however I would recommend branching out at least part of the time.  They did have a great new bar/patio area which we spent some time at, it was perfect.  In the morning the area had help yourself coffee and tea and at some point in the afternoon it turned into a low key bar area.  

Quick note, unless you have priority status don't expect early check-in.

Overall, a top notch hotel in a great location.",4,2018,09,10
207,Over rated,"The hotel is nice but not exceptional.  The staff were friendly but the check in and check out process were VERY slow!  The lobby is nice but has very limited seating (I think there are a total of  to 6 chairs).  The room is very small and as is the bathroom.  If you are a platinum member...no loyalty recognition given.  The heating system takes quite a long time to heat to the room.  Stay was OK...but for the price is should be EXCEPTIONAL and unfortunately it was not!  I would opt to stay elsewhere on future visits to the area.

BTW: The breakfast buffet was very good.",3,2018,09,09
207,Elegant hotel,We enjoyed our stay in this elegant hotel.  The location was perfect for visiting city sights. All the services you would expect  of a Marriott high end hotel. Staff was extra helpful. Valet parking only.,5,2018,09,09
207,Excellent hotel start,"Nice weather in the city when we visited and the hotel was on a perfect location to enjoy the sites.  

Staff was very helpful in us getting around the city.  The concierge service helped us with any of our needs.  

AC in the room worked very well. 

 ",5,2018,09,08
207,Fantastic Staff!,"I called yesterday about a (self-inflicted) issue with a voucher.
Patrick was an absolute delight to deal with. He was so so polite, and friendly, and supportive throughout the process. 
The hotel got back to me within a day to inform me that the issue had been resolved.
Struggling to put into words how much of a breath of fresh air they were to deal with.
Thank you!",5,2018,09,07
207,Exclent,Best place on earth because you can shopping and go out for dinner anywhere and it’s very close to Grafton street. Reception was very friendly and helpful. Service was excellent they were to late with anything whenever I wanted something,5,2018,09,04
207,High end Dublin experience,"This hotel is located off of St. Stephen's Green and is centrally located to lots of sights and activities, most within walking distance.  In addition to the food and drink available at the hotel itself, there are a number of excellent restaurants and pubs nearby.  The room was spacious for an old building, very well appointed and quite comfortable.  The staff on all shifts was pleasant and very helpful.  This is a great choice if you want to stay at a top-of-the-line hotel while visiting Dublin.",5,2018,09,04
207,Coming back!,"My husband and I stayed at The Shelbourne about 5 years ago.  We are again returning to spend a week in Dublin later this month and it was easy to choose staying there again!   Although via our Marriott Vacation hotel+price cost we know the room will not be the prime category we usually prefer, we are quite certain we made the best overall choice of a Dublin hotel to celebrate our 48th wedding anniversary and husbands impending birthday.   The only other place I have stayed in Dublin was the Merrion which was lovely, but in my book The Shelbourne is tops!!!",5,2018,09,03
207,Very Well-Located,"We picked the Shelbourn because we are loyal to the Marriott/SPG brand. The best thing about the Hotel is its location. We easily walked to restaurants, the shops on Grafton Street, Trinity College and the Little Museum of Dublin. The hotel has a magnificent lobby and the public areas are opulent. The room, however, was a little disappointing. We had a ‘Heritage Park View Larger Guest Room’ (second to top category), but felt it was very small. On the positive side, however, the bathroom was large and nicely appointed in marble (but could use a double vanity). Breakfast in the Saddle Room was lovely with lots of choices in the buffet. I would recommend this hotel.",4,2018,09,03
207,5 star hotel in the heart of Dublin!,"This hotel is THE place to stay in Dublin.  The rooms are very comfortable with excellent linens and pillows.  The windows are double paned so they block out any outside noise.  The bathrooms are large and have Elemis shampoos, conditioners and lotions.  We had an exceptional afternoon tea at Lord Mayor's Lounge and also enjoyed The Horseshoe Bar which has bartenders who have an extreme knowledge of their local whiskies.  The hotel is also very close to Grafton Street for shopping and has many excellent restaurants and pubs closeby.",5,2018,09,02
207,Another level of hospitality ,"A wonderful and remarkable restaurant. 

An outstanding experience and a beautiful place to eat....  

We celebrated my mums 60th Birthday here and started with our starters,  amazing fish and meat platters... and was a fantastic service.... 

This place is out of this world, and definitely worth booking a table. 

The service was impeccable and gave us a comfortable experience. ",5,2018,08,31
207,Amazing 5* Hotel Experience!,"We visited for a long weekend, retracing some family roots and celebrating a milestone birthday.

The hotel is centrally located and was the perfect 'base' for the excursions we had planned across the area. Including the famous Guinness brewery tour. There is also a bus stop directly outside to make things easier.

The Afternoon Tea offered by the hotel was a wonderful experience and the staff are very friendly and attentive. 

The room we had was magnificent. It was large, clean and very tastefully decorated. It was in keeping with the hotel's history but with a modern twist.

The breakfasts were outstanding and have to be tried to be believed, especially the Eggs Benedict!

It was simply a wonderous and luxurious experience from the moment we arrived until the morning we left.",5,2018,08,29
207,A 5 Star Hotel!,"The Shelbourne Dublin is a wonderful hotel!  It is centrally located in Dublin with an easy walk to most attractions.  Our hop on hop off bus picked us up just across the street from the hotel

Check in was quick.  We received a wonderful upgrade as we are a Marriott Platinum.  Both the hotel and our room were beautiful!  The service too was excellent!

We usually avoid hotel restaurants and bars, but when we arrived we were hungry - so we headed to the bar for a quick meal.  The food was delicious!  So when we were tired at the end of the next day we went back for dinner.  Our experience again, was the food was excellent!

Highly recommend this hotel!  Would definitely stay again!",5,2018,08,28
207,Excellent Location!,"Loved staying at this hotel!  I had no idea how historical this hotel was!  The constitution was drafted in one of the rooms at this hotel!  Great staff here that were always available for questions about what to do in the city!  Right across the street from a beautiful, large park.  If you have children with you there is a lot of play ground equipment in the park for them to enjoy!  Very close to Starbucks and there is a hop on/hop off bus stop right across the street from hotel and down to the right.",5,2018,08,28
207,Spectacular hotel and experience,"Our only regret in staying at the Shelbourne was that we only allowed ourselves one night to stay during a long weekend visit to Ireland!  We were told that our room was in the ""old"" building - but the rooms were renovated and outstanding. The room and bathroom were spacious, and incredibly well maintained and stocked.  The breakfast in the Saddle Room was very nice.  Disappointed we didn't have more time to enjoy the pub or their afternoon tea.  We also decided on our next visit, we'll allow ourselves more time there and schedule an appointment with their onsite Genealogist who is there to help any visitors looking to research their Irish heritage.",5,2018,08,27
207,Excellent Location and Afternoon Tea,"My family stayed at The Shelbourne Hotel for three nights and we enjoyed our stay, especially the hotel’s proximity to a lot of Dublin’s museums, Trinity College. St. Stephen’s Green, Georgian townhouses, great pubs, and shopping. The Afternoon Tea at the Lord Mayor’s Lounge was one of the best we’ve had, and my wife and I have been to quite a few afternoon teas in Ireland, England and Canada. My wife and I enjoyed a glass of wine and Guinness in the hotel’s very relaxing bar/lounge while the kids enjoyed the hotel’s Wi-Fi in our room. It’s expensive at this hotel, but it’s worth the extra cost if you’re able to splurge.",5,2018,08,27
207,"Excellent Hotel, Great Location","We stayed at this hotel twice on our trip to Ireland. It has a great location with a cityhopper (hop-on/hop-off) bus stop (multiple companies) and right near a number of tram stops. It's also walking distance from a number of attractions. 

The hotel itself is a typical 5-star European city centre hotel. That means you should expect winding corridors, smaller rooms than you'd expect at an American or Asian/Middle Eastern 5-star hotel and generally less space in the hotel common areas. That's what happens with a ~150 old building. 😊

The staff at the hotel are wonderful and quite welcoming throughout. They are reasonably accommodating of young children (ours are both under six). By this I mean, high-chairs at the main hotel restaurant along with children's menu's for dinner. This is sometimes a challenge at some city-centre 5-star hotels in Europe. The pool does stop allowing children in at 5PM, so that's worth noting (not well documented). 

The rooms are very well appointed; especially the Heritage rooms. They supply Elemis spa toiletries instead of the standard Renaissance stuff normally supplied. 

If you're a Marriott Rewards member, I think the Shelbourne is probably the best hotel in Dublin for a redemption stay. It actually should be a Autograph Collection hotel rather than a Renaissance Hotel from a brand point of view, as it is much more unique than your typical Renaissance Hotel. 

P.S. Tip, be sure to send one of the Shelbourne postcards in your room. Reception will post them for you for free (since it's free advertising for them I suppose). :)",5,2018,08,26
207,An Exquisite Afternoon Tea,"This was a beautiful treat. The service was super attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The tea menu was incredible with all flavours of tea available as well as “The Shelbourne Blend”.  Everything was explained on each tier superbly by our waitress and who constantly checked our table for tea cup levels or if we wanted more of anything in particular on any tier. Afterwards anything that wasn’t eaten was boxed up beautifully to take home. What an exquisite way of spending a couple of hours in Dublin. 

One of our party of 5 had a nut allergy and she was assured that her plate was nut free and that they have epipens in the event of an emergency.",5,2018,08,25
207,Perfect!,"My first trip to Dublin and was fortunate to stay a few days at The Shelbourne!  Location is a short walk to Temple Bar, Trinity College and Grafton Street.  Room was beautiful, staff friendly and attentive.  We only had 2 days so we followed Trip Advisors “3 Days in Dublin Guide” with a few changes .   We had drinks at the hotel bar but they also have afternoon tea. Plenty of places to eat near the hotel and not too far from the airport.  Go and treat yourself!",5,2018,08,20
207,First class hotel with fabulous staff,"Stayed in the Shelbourne recently as a birthday treat for my mother. Had a fantastic stay, made extra special by the staff, in particular Doireann Gately. Doireann greeted us warmly at reception and made my mother's birthday one to remember. We stayed in a suite overlooking St Stephen's Green. Beautiful room, delightful decor and spotlessly clean. All staff very attentive and welcoming from start to finish. We look forward to returning again.",5,2018,08,20
207,Beautiful and pleasant stay,"It is a charming old place. It is luxurious and comfortable and offers a unique hotel stay experience. The rooms a fairly spacious with excellent sleep quality. We stayed in two different rooms. Some of the rooms have literally no view and some have a nice view. We enjoyed both. 

The breakfast is expensive but is a great experience. 

The service and the staff were very friendly and helpful.",5,2018,08,20
207,Amazing as always,It’s always a great experience to stay in such a fabulous hotel and this trip was as good as ever. We lucked out and stayed in a most fabulous suite overlooking the Green. Breakfast was a lovely affair in sumptuous surroundings. Can’t wait til we visit again.,5,2018,08,19
207,Very Good Hotel,"I enjoyed this hotel; the service was very good, especially the concierge, but there was one doorman who had a bit of an attitude. The rooms are indeed nice, but for me they need to be a more special for 5 stars.  The breakfast is good, but I had to pay on top of my not so inexpensive room rates (two rooms at two levels). I would stay here again, but would first check out what else is available in the same price point before deciding where to stay.",4,2018,08,19
207,Beautiful older hotel,"That’s been updated. Nice rooms, double sink, safe in room, complimentary coffee or tea in room. Typical Marriott—as soon as you remove something from the fridge you bought it. Blow dryer can be used anywhere but the bathroom—no outlet.  Breakfast was included and good thing, continental was 22 euro in the restaurant.  Starbucks is less than a block away.  Remember its Europe, you have to use your key to get power.",5,2018,08,19
207,"Building is lovely, service impersonal ","I’m lifetime platinum with Marriott and have never written a bad review but, having stayed at the Shelbourne four times in the last two years, the service remains the weakest point. After waiting hours for a room — beyond the guaranteed checkin time — for a stay today in a trip for my daughters birthday, the hotel staff is without any empathy. The room I was assigned was too small for a rollaway for my daughter, so they downgraded us to the only room the could find to hold us — a dark dreary adjoining room for $500 per night. During the check in process, the person helping us would say they had found us a room but had to go speak to a hidden manager in a back room often returning without approval. At 3pm — the guaranteed checkin time and time we were told was the latest possible time — we were told the room had requested a Late check-out and would not be ready on time. On my last visit, the concierge served us with unusual disdain and unfriendliness and forgot to make reservations we had requested. I love dublin — it is filled with the kindest most wonderful people — but the Shelbourne service is an anomaly.",1,2018,08,19
207,Elegant and very expensive,Extraordinarily and mouth wateringly  expensive yet it’s hopping!!! Mainly with North Americans . The place to be seen. So so central  as a meeting place. Room with two double  beds and ample space to walk around- quite quiet too for central Dublin albeit on the fifth floor,5,2018,08,18
207,Stunning hotel in beautiful location but not good value for money,"The Shelbourne Hotel is a Dublin icon, housed in one of the city's most beautiful old buildings and overlooking St Stephen's Green. I live in Dublin and had always wanted to experience an overnight stay at the hotel. When we arrived the lobby was heaving with people and we soon realised that the Irish rugby team were staying in the hotel that night and guests were given Irish flags while a piper played music and we lined up to cheer the team as they left to play Fiji! The atmosphere was incredible and we waited a while to check in as the crowds died away. Once we checked in, however, we were left slightly deflated. We had paid over 300 euros for our room for the night and what greeted us when we got there was very disappointing. The room itself was one of the smallest I have ever been in, with just enough room to walk around the bed. The view from the window was of other hotel rooms and, most disappointingly, the en suite did not have a bath, just a tiny shower and toilet that would not fit two people standing at any one time. Despite this, however, the bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable, there was a thoughtful turndown service and we both slept amazingly well. Breakfast in the morning was nice, although we were asked to sit in the empty bar rather than the restaurant which we found odd but were happy enough with our view of Stephen's Green. We followed breakfast with a swim in the pool which was almost impossible to find in the warren of old staircases and was unfortunately quite cold the morning we were there. Overall the staff and service were pleasant but rather formal when compared with most modern five star hotels and rather than feeling welcome or at home, we felt less comfortable than we have during our stay at other Irish hotels of comparable status and price. If you are looking to stay in a one-of-a-kind Dublin institution, I would recommend a stay at the Shelbourne, but if you are looking for good value for money you may wish to look elsewhere.",3,2018,08,17
207,Top-Notch Hotel!!!,"The beauty of the hotel, the cleaniness, the staff, the service was top notch!!!! It’s location is desirable & many sites & tours are a walk away. The park across the street is great for a walk or a jog. The fitness center is clean; they give you a towel during your workout; however, if you want a bottle of water bring money down with you. I would go back to the Shelbourne & definitely recommend it to friends & others who are staying in the Dublin area.",5,2018,08,16
207,Glorious stay,"The Shelbourne is the perfect place to stay while on holiday in Dublin.  

The location can't be beat if you have a few days in town and want to see the sites.  We walked everywhere from the hotel's front door.
The breakfast, included with my deluxe room, was delicious.  Normally, I order eggs off the menu becuase I don't like the ones that have been sitting in the chafing dish, but this was an exception.  The prepared eggs were silky, fluffy and fresh.
There is a fantastic bar staff working in the horshoe bar who were extremely knowledgable about Irish spirits and local hot spots. 
The front desk team and concierge made some reservations for me and everything was in order wherever I went. 

There is a great pride the team at the Shelbourne take in providing excellent service and it didn't go unnoticed.  I enjoyed watching the special events department line up along the red carpet at the entrance to congratulate a bride and her wedding party.  Everyone was engaged and it made the scene quite lovely.
Physically, the hotel is stunning and historic.  The rooms are well appointed and large.  Beautiful flower arrangements everywhere you look and it was great to just sit with a cocktail and people watch.  I heard a lot of Irish accents and I liked knowing that this hotel is used by Dubliners and not just far away tourists like myself.  
It felt like you were part of the fabric of this wonderful city and I loved every minute of it.",5,2018,08,15
207,Just okay.,"This is the 2nd time we stayed here and our experience is the same - average (expensive) hotel. The whole place is dark and higgly-piggly. You access the reception around several crowded corners. Hallways are dark and rooms are small. Things were falling apart in the rooms and my husband, who had a new ankle injury, tripped on a loose carpet between the bedroom and the bathroom.

We were a family of 4 and had inter-connecting rooms but every time we want to get across the joint doors to the other room, we had to physically move a large arm-chair on both sides. The food is okay as is the staff. I didn't feel like any of them really knew me and certainly no one referred to me by name. The exception is the front door staff whom were lovely and helpful. Nice bar but the food and breakfast were just okay.

We were part of a wedding party who had booked rooms at the Shelbourne for the group. Otherwise, I would not have stayed here and I doubt I will again.",3,2018,08,15
207,Loved the Hotel - Location and people,"On our way to and from a Celebrity Cruise, we chose to stay at the Shelbourne on both ends of our vacation.  The ambiance is fabulous, the history fascinating, and location is perfect, right across St Stephen's Green, and only a few blocks away from great shopping.  Only real complaint was that when we called the hotel from the ship to get a taxi or car to come pick us up (this was only the second time the port was experiencing the turn around of a home-ported cruise ship), the concierge was beyond less than helpful. First telling us the cabs (which were lined up outside the front door) could not come to the port, then when trying to book one of their private cars to come get us, he first gave a 90 euro price, which we were willing to pay (cold and rainy), he said he had no cars and hung up. Being a Platinum Premier Elite Marriott member, this was extremely unacceptable.",5,2018,08,14
207,Great finish to a fantastic holiday,"We were lucky enough to book this fabulous hotel on our Marriott Rewards points. What a treat it has been, everything one would expect from a 5* Hotel, and a bit more. Situated in a great part of Dublin, this grand hotel was perfect for the last 2 nights of our holiday - we’re glad we didn’t start here, as nowhere else we stayed was as special (even though we stayed in some lovely places!). Highly recommended and hope to be back some day.",5,2018,08,14
207,One night in Dublin to see Wicked in Bord Gais Theatre,"Fab hotel, love love this hotel. Checked in early around 12 noon and was given our room which was great to drop bags and go. Had lovely lunch in the bar before heading out for a few hours retail therapy. Back to change and head to Bord Gais Theatre. Arrived back to hotel after show but was a bit disappointed as the Lord Mayors Lounge was closed for refurbishment...that was also a disappointed the following morning but we were just unlucky those two days. Wonderful breakfast in the morning, lots of choices and too many nice pastries to sample!!! Wonderful hotel, highly recommend it, the beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  Central location, amazing staff. If you want the best then book here!!!",5,2018,08,11
207,"Excellent location, Excellent Hotel, Excellent Amenities","I stayed here on a business trip. The hotel is right opposite St. Stephen's green park which is huge and worth a visit. It is close to lot of restaurants, shopping and entertainment.  The staff is also very polite and courteous and you will feel welcomed. The gym, pool and the restaurants are great too. The breakfast buffet is expensive but worth it. If I go to Dublin again, I am staying at this hotel. Oh yeah - dress up when you are in a restaurant at the hotel,",5,2018,08,11
207,Luke the bartender!,"Was visiting Ireland with some friends for my birthday, we decided to hit The Shelbourne for a couple of drinks. We were completely blown away by the hotel itself but what made our night even better was a bartender named Luke! He made individual cocktails designed for each of us depending our tastes, watching him make them was almost better than the drinks themselves! It's staff like Luke that really add to The Shelbourne experience! We will definitely return for more great cocktails, thanks Luke!",5,2018,08,09
207,Shelbourne is the finest ~,"I love this hotel. So much history. There is a documentary on nextflix about the Shelbourne. The staff are wonderful and attentive. The rooms are lovely.  You can walk to just about anything or the doorman will hail you a taxi.  Stephens Greens is just across the street and Grafton St. is close with may shops, museums, and places to eat.  ",5,2018,08,07
207,Its centered to all the best places around Dublin.,We looked at over 50 hotels planning our trip to Dublin. This was one of the finest hotels we have stay at in 20 years of traveling!!! The rooms the staff the food were simply amazing!!! I will recommend this place every time I can.,5,2018,08,06
207,Loved it!!,"The atmosphere was pleasant, customer service was spot on and the location was perfect for us right across the street from a hop on hop off bus stop. We really enjoyed the hotel overall would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,08,06
207,Afternoon tea,"As always it was fantastic ..... 5th time for afternoon tea and booked it again whilst there .... it surpasses all the afternoon teas I have been too and I can’t see it be beaten on setting, food, and staff 🤩🤩🤩",5,2018,08,06
207,Highlight of our trip,"We started our trip in Dublin and unfortunately only had the opportunity to stay in this fabulous hotel one night.  It was over the top extraordinary and of the eleven hotels during out three week trip throughout Ireland and Scotland, this was far superior to anywhere else we stayed.  The decor was exquisite and the rooms were extremely elegant, very clean and very well lit.  So many hotels in Europe use the tiny halogen lights making it difficult to see, especially in the bathroom.  Everything about this hotel from the staff, rooms, lobby, bar, dining room and museum in the hotel was so fantastic.  Breakfast was delicious.  I wished we had an extra day to do the high tea, as that looked marvelous.  The hotel was in a great location and we highly recommend it!",5,2018,08,05
207,Lovely hotel with excellent service,"Had just two nights in this lovely Dublin hotel. Immaculate, luxurious, friendly and a strong feel of history to it. Nicely situated on St Stephen's Green, it was easy yo walk to city sights. I would be very happy to return here",5,2018,08,04
207,Vacation ,"My wife booked this hotel in May, 2017 as our farewell to Ireland until our next return  visit. 
This hotel not only is top notch, it is centrally located near all the places we wanted to visit and see while in Dublin before our flight back to California. All be it on the upper end of our budget,  all I can say is it was well worth it.  The dining experience,  hotel staffing,  spacious layout, afternoon tea service and of course the bars. We also found an area on the main floor near the registration desk where we read the history of the hotel. They also have stacks of guests registry there dating back, I want to say 1700's?
Our reception there started after arriving in front of the hotel where 3-4 bell hops met us to carry our luggage inside and greeted us very politely. That kind of welcome is felt with everyone that works there.
We upgraded to a larger room with a balcony which was very nice. The room was very clean and comfortable. 
 We are returning again this fall for another vacation there to see more of the emerald island making this upcoming trip #3 in the last 4 years. We absolutely love Ireland! 
",5,2018,08,04
207,Luxurious tea-time experience,"This review is about taking tea at the Shelbourne. The first thing to know is that they have sittings. You can’t just come when you want, you have to reserve for one of the sittings. Our sitting was at 3pm, and we were there until 5. The setting could hardly be lovelier. The hotel has been renovated and everything is bright and new and fresh. There were mounds of fresh flowers everywhere and we watched them iron tablecloths right on the table. The menu offered a set selection of sandwiches and sweets and a wide range of teas. We had personable and knowledgeable servers. A few comments: They don’t bring you a pot of tea, they pour it cup by cup. This is great if you want to try a selection of teas, but it also means you have to keep calling servers over whenever you want a refill. Our first cup of tea was tepid, not hot, and we had to call the servers back to get us hot tea. In a place like this, you should never be served tepid tea. (It happened only once). The food was top-notch, but it was definitely skewed towards the sweet rather than the savoury. If I were to return, I would make a point of asking for more savoury than sweet. (Some places let you order a savoury teatime selection or a sweet teatime selection; this place had only one option.) We were able to get more sandwiches when we wanted, and clotted cream for the lovely mini scones. Overall a delightful experience.",5,2018,08,01
207,Will be back again (and again),"We had the pleasure of staying in two different suites at the Shelbourne in the last week. The first was lovely—nice size and well renovated—on the third floor.  

The second was the Michael Collins suite and was amazing. A full one bedroom, recently refurbished with soft green hues, and a marble bathroom with dual sinks and a strong shower. 

The common areas are beautifully done, especially the front bar and the residents lounge and terrace. The location is ideal for walking around the town during the day and nights out in town.  

We had a small snafu during our time there and the response of the manager was perfect. We have toggled back and forth between the Merrion and the Shelbourne over the years, but this experience sealed the Shelbourne as our favorite. Thank you for a lovely and too brief stay. ",5,2018,07,31
207,Expensive but beautiful property,"This place is shockingly expensive for a Marriott in Ireland. Hotel prices this high are ones I see mostly in New York and London. This was much higher than expected and although I was kindly upgraded to a fabulous suite, the cost left a bad taste for me. The property is very nice, beautiful restaurants and bars and a place you can relax and enjoy. If you've been then you know the location is prime for walking nearly everywhere that matters. I'd love to see them become more price competitive as I visit Dublin often. Perhaps some won't mind the cost but in the end, it does matter especially when everything you spend money on while there is also pricey.",5,2018,07,31
207,Fancy downtown hotel ,Classic hotel location is across from St. Steven green. Entire staff is courteous friendly and helpful. Rooms are spacious and comfortable bathroom are spa like. We ate in the Saddle room for breakfast which is sumptuous. Wonderful food. The main bar is lively bartenders are great drinks and appetizer are delicious. A wonderful stay.,5,2018,07,30
207,Fab,We came for the pre theatre dinner and it didn't disappoint. The Risotto was amazing. The beef was so tender. Staff v attentive.  Very relaxing restaurant. Wonderful cocktails. Would definitely recommed,5,2018,07,29
207,Afternoon tea and drinks ,I have only been to the Shelbourne a handful times but I loved it each time. The first time was afternoon tea which was a great experience. I bought 3 vouchers and we were treated like royalty. I have also bought 2 vouchers for spa treatment for my wife and her cousin and they loved it. The staff could not do enough for them. Every year we send my mother and aunt for a weekend stay. They have meals there both nights and all the staff look after them so well which means a lot to me. To me the Shelbourne is money well spent.,5,2018,07,28
207,Excellence,Our visit to Dublin was very nice. We splurged when choosing the Shelbourne and it was such a treat. The staff was lovely. Our room and every aspect of the hotel was a sheer delight. The concierge was very helpful with reservations and suggestions. ,5,2018,07,27
207,Five Star classic hotel,"The Shelbourne is classic elegant hotel exuding old world charm. The staff is unobtrusive and helpful. Hotel security was impressive, one of our bags were delivered another room and the staff able to review the indecent from security footage and locate the lost item. Unfortunately it was not returned before our departure but the hotel couriered the item to Canada at their cost.

The location opposite St Steven’s Green is central and provides a quiet interlude from the bustle of the city. The park was the central point of the uprising of 1921 and the event is well documented on plaques around the park.

The highlight of our visit was the High Tea served at the hotel. This is an expensive splurge but worth it for a special occasion. It is quite popular so reserve in advance when booking the hotel room.

Overall the Shelbourne is a very expensive classic hotel that lives up to it’s five star reputation.",5,2018,07,25
207,Lovely Experience,"The Shelbourne's biggest asset is without doubt their staff. The service was undoubtedly five star. Lovely touches like the staff being able to tell us about a particular gin, (in detail) ....and organising a little birthday token during lunch. Interesting observation on the bedrooms ..... very comfy beds, once you can get into them. They are not meant for the vertically challenged! Another observation is about the space available for 'lounging' around .... other than the bar area, there wasn't really anywhere to chill out and 'people watch'. There is a new terrace, but it was taken up by wedding parties both days. However, the stay in the Shelbourne was a fantastic experience, it's olde world class and style, centrally located with exceptional service.",5,2018,07,25
207,What a lovely hotel,"First time in Ireland.   My daughter is Marriott platinum.   We chose this hotel for that and it’s location right on St Stephens green.   The hotel was magnificent, the staff gracious, the food good, the room comfortable, the pool great for lap swimming.  This one is a keeper. ",5,2018,07,25
207,Dublin excellence...,"This is the perfect hotel for exploring and enjoying Dublin.  Situated right next to St Stephens Green and walking distance to all the local attractions, this is really a special place for families or couples. My favorite part was the amazing health club with swimming pool!  Additionally, the restaurants on premises are terrific.
",5,2018,07,24
207,Gorgeous hotel in a great location,"The rooms are wonderful- comfy bed, air conditioned, and huge bathroom with both a tub and shower.  Breakfast each day is very good- variety on the buffet and they offer a menu. Very good service.  Was a bit disappointed in the concierge.  We wanted to rent bikes and he suggested the bikes that are on the street to rent, but we found out later those are not for tourists and you need to have an account with them.  I would think as a local he should have known that.  Great service otherwise.  Location outstanding-  walking distance to a LOT of shopping, restaurants and parks.  Never needed a cab at all in 3 days.",5,2018,07,24
207,Awesum Service,"We recently stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights.  The hotel is ideally located for sightseeing in Dublin.  The breakfast includes a large buffet or the option to order items of the menu.  A big plus for me is that they oj was fresh squeezed. But in my mind what sets this hotel apart from others is the exceptional level of service they provide.  Everyone is super friendly and everything is done with a smile.  A few examples of what I am talking about follow.  When we got to the hotel about noon they did not have our room ready, which I expected since check in is 3 PM. We decided to walk a little and then went into their restaurant for some lunch.  In talking with the waitress we mentioned that we were just ""hanging out"" waiting for our room to be ready.  She offered to go check with the front desk to see if our room was ready and 5 minutes later came back with our keys. We did have a problem with the A/C in our room.  I went down to the front desk about 10 PM and a guest services manager came out and said they would find us another room.  He personally came up and moved our bags to an upgraded room with fully functioning A/C.  The next day we got a lovely handwritten note from Fatma in guest services, along with a box of chocolates,  apologizing for any inconvenience. We were ""blown away"" by the response. I have absolutely no reservations in recommending this hotel to anyone who has a trip planned to Dublin.",5,2018,07,23
207,Perfect Location in the Heart of Dublin,"We stayed here our first night in Dublin before heading off to tour the country. It is a great location because we could walk to some of the best sights like Trinity and the Book of Kells, St. Patrick's, and Temple Bar area. The hotel was very comfortable and food was great! We were not there long enough to try the Saddle Room, but will do so next time! We loved the old world charm of The Shelborne!",5,2018,07,23
207,Great hotel in Dublin,"The service, rooms and breakfast are great.  Location is convenient near the hop on and off green bus and walking distance to Trinity College. The bar was happening on Thursday night.  Really top class hotel with accommodating staff.",5,2018,07,22
207,Afternoon  tea ,"This is somewhere to go if you want to celebrate  a special occasion, absolutely  amazing staff lovely and very attentive.  I have had afternoon tea in many places around Dublin. 
And I must say the shelbourne is at the top of my list. 
It's not cheap but worth every penny 
Cost 98.00euro  per couple. ",5,2018,07,22
207,Poor Air Con - Overpriced Rooms,"This hotel is vastly overpriced for the experience you get. Rooms are small and cramped and when we visited they had technical difficulties with the air conditioning it was hot so we had to move from one small room to another equally small room. 

When you enter the hotel lobby it feels like a visit to Louvre Museum in Paris - lots of suits standing close by observing what is going on. I felt that this level of management and security detracted from the visit. 

If you are visiting this hotel prepare to spend on extras as your basic bedroom does not include use of the facilities (Spa, Breakfast, Bars) are all charged additionally.",3,2018,07,22
207,A Worthwhile Extravagance,"On every vacation, even though we eat in pubs and otherwise travel as inexpensively as possible, we pick one ""base"" for our touring that is ""top of the line"" to enjoy.  In Dublin, we chose the Shelbourne.  

This historic hotel fronts on one of Dublin's most extravagant green spaces, St. Stephens Green, and it is hard to imagine a more central or convenient base for touring Dublin.  Trinity College, museums, Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, shopping, and more pubs and great music than you could possibly explore in a week are within ten minute walks.

The hotel was what you would expect.  Very friendly staff, from front desk to porters, and every amenity one could expect.  From the large and luxurious bath and robes to the excellent draperies that actually make a room black as night, this property did not disappoint.  

While some of the other places we stayed straddled the line between ""B&B"" and ""hostel"" while exploring the West, beginning and ending our days in Ireland at the Shelbourne made the entire trip just that much better.  We left most of our luggage there after our initial stay, and being able to call up and have our luggage sent up to the room and have the air conditioning set the way we wanted for our return ensured a ""soft landing"" for the last night of our stay.",5,2018,07,22
207,"Great location, but.. Not up to snuff","Small rooms, cranky desk clerks and not at all up to Renaissance standards. The first impression of a hotel happens at the check in desk. Unfortunately, the impression that I got was, ""Oh no another tourist!"" Even with my Marriott status, I was not welcomed nor did I feel any warmth from the frowning desk clerk.  I travel to Dublin every other month of business and thought that I'd give the Shelbourne a try, I am going back to the Intercontinental. The hotel is historic and is in a great location, I guess they don't need to try. Note, the bellmen and the maids were lovely!",2,2018,07,21
207,"Nice, but overpriced","The hotel is in a great location right next to Stephen’s green however we were a little disappointed with the overall experience as a 5* hotel. Travelling a lot for work and having the opportunity to stay in many lovely hotels, my expectations for the Shelbourne were high. Although the hotel was lovely, clean and friendly (the door staff are just fantastic) there were a few things that let it down.

1. Rooms are nicely decorated but very small ... even the upgraded room that we were given.
2. The check-in process took 20 minutes, even thought I  had already checked in online via the Marriott app.
3. The options on the restaurant menu are very limited.
4. The overall atmosphere in the hotel felt a little dull.
5. No special treatment to make the weekend feel like a 5* experience.

I don’t believe the hotel is worth the expensive rate. You are paying for the brand and the location, not the experience.

For the same price, you can stay in the Westbury which is by far a superior hotel (disappointingly so as it’s not part of the Marriott group).

Overall, a beautiful hotel but not 5* in my view.",3,2018,07,20
207,Afternoon tea,Had afternoon tea with my adult daughter on our family trip. We loved the setting and the server was helpful explaining the tea options. Skip lunch as the 3 tiers will fill you. The room is fancy but not stuffy. We’d do it again!,5,2018,07,20
207,Falls a bit short of top class,"Very good but not excellent.  I would have expected the absolute highest standards of customer service in a hotel such as the Shelbourne for the price being paid.  
An example of where the hotel fell short is as follows:
I ordered a Scottish single malt whiskey in the bar.  Half way through I noticed that the very nice crystal glass actually had a crack down the side of it and a small chip from the edge.  The solution from the serving staff was to merely pour my remaining drink into another glass.  In a top class establishment, I would have expected some or all of the following:
1) A cracked glass should not make it into the hands of a customer in the first place
2) A sincere apology and expression of regret that such a thing could happen
3) Either an offer of new replacement drink OR
4) A write down on the bill for this item AND POSSIBLY EVEN
5) An offer of further recompense such as an additional complementary drink.

To me this is basic customer service stuff, especially at the level that I though the Shelbourne was trying to do business at.
In addition, I felt that the staff, in general and with some notable exceptions, were not performing to the level that you would hope to experience in a hotel of this standard.  They seemed to me to be tired, potentially over-worked and underpaid (just my impression), not particularly happy in their work and at best, functionally professional but without much warmth, joy, joviality, consideration, interest in or empathy with the guests.  
I hasten to add that there were exceptions to this, the guys on the door, Monika in and around the lobby, and one of the ladies who assisted us in our reservation for the Saddle room were all excellent.  In a way though, it just emphasises deficiencies elsewhere.  
I would be pretty confident that this is a failure of management to foster and promote the right feeling within their workforce rather than levelling the fault at the individuals.
Overall, I have to make clear, that we enjoyed our stay in the Shelbourne, a fabulous old style hotel, with excellent facilities, lovely rooms and a great sense of history.  I just feel that it could and should have been top class and it fell short of that.  The first incident outlined above is a very simple one to fix.  The second issue around the staff is a bit more fundamental and would take more time.  To me though, they are issues that should be addressed to be truly considered as excellent.",4,2018,07,19
207,Beautiful hotel but overpriced,"Yes its a beautiful hotel and housekeeping is awesome I don't know how they do it but whenever you leave at whatever time you come back to a clean room. Great location I have to say also.  Just nothing that put it over the top.  It was the end of our trip after being in London, York, and Edinburgh and I can not say it was my favorite hotel.  Staff was nice but nothing that special. I guess I could say nothing stood out.",4,2018,07,18
207,Classic Elegance,"The Shelbourne was everything we expected it to be. It completely lived up to our expectations in terms of both service and class. We booked this hotel before we knew about the TV series, but after coming across the show on Amazon Prime we were even more excited about our stay. If you are planning a stay, watch an episode or two of the show to give you some insight into the history and the daily life of this hotel. The Shelbourne is in a great location, directly across from St Stephen's Green and only a few minutes from Grafton Street and Temple Bar.",5,2018,07,18
207,"Great location, beautiful hotel","This is an historic hotel on St. Stephen's Green. The lobby level has two bars and a tea room. The front desk and the Navigator (concierge) were very helpful. The hotel did get very busy on the weekend, and there was one busload that came for Saturday night, but overall the hotel was quiet. The location is excellent with an easy walk to Grafton and Dawson Streets and to museums & Trinity College. St. Stephen's Green is across the street. We only needed a taxi once, and that was to go to the Guinness Storehouse. Very nice rooms, great service.",5,2018,07,15
207,Afternoon Tea - What a treat!,"Afternoon tea at the Shelbourne is an absolute delight.  While not cheap, it's a wonderful experience - charming and attentive staff, delicious food and drinks, beautiful surroundings and a lovely atmosphere.  For a special occasion, or as a gift (I was given a voucher as a present), it couldn't be nicer.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,07,15
207,My favorite hotel,"My husband and I stayed here while visiting Dublin. The hotel is beautiful, rooms are well appointed and extremely comfortable, the restaurants and bars are filled with great staff and wonderfully delicious food options. This hotel is why you take vacation. It is the epitome of beauty, grace, and elegance. I can't wait to return. The hotel is close to everywhere and everything that I wanted to see in Dublin.",5,2018,07,12
207,Perfect!,"Great location, lovely hotel decor.
The room was a good size and clean! Breakfast takes place in a very relaxing room with a good buffet and a la carte options.
Lovely staff made this a very enjoyble experience.
",5,2018,07,12
207,Light lunch ,Have not been to the Shelbourne bar in a long time . Early lunch. Great selection of food. Anything from good quality starters to more substantial fare. Service good. Able to talk which is always a plus. ,4,2018,07,11
207,Beautiful hotel in the perfect location!,"Gorgeous hotel with beautiful rooms and top notch service. The location is great, right next to the park and within walking distance of just about anything you could want! The staff was friendly and had great recommendations of food and drink nearby. Wished we could stay longer!",5,2018,07,11
207,Loved the Shelbourne in Dublin,"This is the coolest, fun and well placed hotel. Amazing service and gorgeous rooms,  smallish and perfect. We figured out how to come down from our third floor room to enter the front of the hotel by way of the grand staircase.Truly amazing.  Loved the decorating in every way.  Meals were very good, staff awesome.  Loved stepping out the door to all Dublin has to offer. Highly recommend the gem.",5,2018,07,10
207,The Best First Time in Dublin,"We had the most lovely stay at the Shelbourne before heading out to Dongloe.  The staff were friendly and professional.  Room services were fantastic and breakfasts were amazing.  Our next time in Dublin will include another stay at the Shelbourne.  From the Shelbourne we had easy walking and access to shopping, sites, tours and food.  Thank You...",5,2018,07,09
207,This is Definitely a 5 Star Wonder,"Apparently the Shelbourne is known throughout Dublin as well as other counties in Ireland. We stayed there for 5 of our nights in Ireland.
The Breakfast buffet is one of the best I have ever eaten. An array of fresh fruits, charcuterie, juices, pastries and staple Irish breakfast items await guests daily.
The staff is very friendly and the concierge always has the best answers to just about anything to do with Ireland and some don't miss spots.
The hotel is located in a prime spot. Across the street you have the park and it's walking distance to many of the museums as well as Trinity College.
We stayed in a mini suite which was more than accommodating and had that Irish charm about it. I honestly didn't want to leave!
The cost of staying here is not as bad as one would think it would be for a 5 star hotel.
If you have the opportunity to stay here or even the opportunity to visit Ireland, I strongly suggest one does not pass up either.",5,2018,07,09
207,Fantastic!,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel.  We were truly treated like royalty in one of the hotel's best suites - if not THE best.  Thank you everyone, especially Kris who checked us in.  The perfect topper to the end of our 2 week vacation in Scotland and Ireland.  Breakfast in the Saddle Room is top notch, don't miss it!  ",5,2018,07,09
207,wonderful afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea in the lord mayor's lounge & it was wonderful- the food was delicious, they have a very extensive tea selection, & the room itself was beautifully put together. We were taken care of by Maria, & received excellent service; she was very helpful in recommending teas, was able to provide a lot of information when I had questions about the room & the hotel in general, was very attentive. Will definitely return.",5,2018,07,08
207,A little bit of magic,Had afternoon tea  today was a wonderful experience the food was amazing I was very impressed with the redecorated Lord mayor room. All my visits are made even more special by the wonderful staff. I'd like to give a special mention to Billy &  niamh. Thank you for everything.  Jane Mc Dermott Dundalk,5,2018,07,07
207,Very close to perfection ,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for a week. From the moment we stepped in we knew this was going to be amazing. Perfect location, beautiful decor and plenty history. Very kind and attentive staff! We highly recommend it. 
Ireland it’s beautiful!! 
",5,2018,07,06
207,Lovely stay,We stayed in Dublin in the beginning and end of our visit to Ireland. The initial stay was at the Westin and now that we have stayed at the Shelbourne - the Shelbourne is much nicer. The location is better and the bar area and restaurant served excellent food in a nice atmosphere. I think we preferred the bar area. If staying in the city definitely consider this property. ,4,2018,07,06
207,Best Hotel on our Visit to Ireland,"This property is five star.  Great location near Trinity College and Government buildings.  Dignitaries from around the world stay at this hotel.  Restaurant was great.  Best breakfast included because I was a Platinum Marriot member.  Did the afternoon tea.  It was expensive 49 Euro but neat to do.  Bathroom was very big, nice shower, we were upgraded to a bigger room so not sure what the standard rooms were like.

Drinks and meals were much more expensive than the other cities we visited.  8 Euro for a bottle of Pelagrino.  15 Euro for a drink.  Other places were 1/2 that price.  So your in a city and at the best hotel so NYC type pricing for meals and drinks.

Only complaint was the service in the bar area.  Both nights went to the bar and it took a long time to be recognized and served.  First time we sat at the bar.  Second time in the lounge area.  First night the bar area wanted busy but the two bar tenders had to make drinks for the dining area so that seemed to consume their time leaving the folks at the bar with poor service.  Not enough of an issue to not go.  It is a gorgeous hotel and we would come back again.",5,2018,07,06
207,"Gorgeous, but the staff makes it even better","This an absolutely beautiful hotel in a wonderful location directly across from St. Stephen's Green. The smell inside is amazing! Lots of history at this place. 

What makes this hotel that much better though, is the staff. My cousin and I were there retracing the steps of our recently lost grandmother, who stayed at The Shelbourne in 1983. We began chatting with a member of the staff (Billy I think?) and he could not have been sweeter. He wanted to see the photos we had brought of our grandmother at the hotel and asked about our story. He shared the history of the hotel and some fun stories, and then offered to take our photo in front of the hotel with the doorman. The doorman (Robert I think) was also very interested in our story and photos, and shared lots of tips for our trip. They both went above and beyond to lift our spirits and made the pilgrimage so much more fun and interesting. 

The hotel alone is impressive, with a suberb location. But the staff are what made it so very special, and honestly its the people that you remember most.",5,2018,07,05
207,All renovated and beautiful,We've stayed here on every trip to Dublin.  The renovations are magnificent.  There is now a private lounge for residents only and stained glass in the main stairway with each of the four floors representing the 4 provinces.   Horse Shoe Bar is perfect as always.   We love this hotel.,5,2018,07,03
207,Great location,"I was just here for a night, but was impressed.  I had a great stay with a very comfortable and quiet room.  The location of the hotel was great, requiring just a short walk to many sites and places to eat.  When in Dublin in the future I’ll plan to stay again!",5,2018,07,01
207,Excellent,Grand hotel. We had standard room and the amenities were fine. We did take advantage of the genealogy butler. That turned out to be money and time well spent as Helen found some links we had never been able to find. Now we've got a link to our Irish ancestors. The breakfast was good every morning and filled us up. Doorman were a fount of information and directed us to our destinations with a smile and some Irish humor. We had fun here.,5,2018,07,01
207,"Great Hotel, Great Location",We had two rooms at the Shelbourne for a week and had a wonderful time.   The hotel brought in old style charm with updated amenities.   The staff was spectacular.   The food and service was fantastic.   The rooms were rather large and everything you needed was available.  The location to everything in town was perfect and being able to walk over to the park each day made the stay wonderful.   I would highly recommend this hotel and understand why it is part of the American Express Fine Hotel Line.,5,2018,07,01
207,Wonderful Hotel ,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Rooms are very comfortable, great air conditioning during unseasonably warm weather. Excellent water pressure in the shower, plenty of hot water. Rooms were quiet, staff was very accommodating.",5,2018,07,01
207,Not a bad thing to say about The Shelbourne!,Wonderful hotel located in the heart of Dublin.  Beautiful old world charm with top notch amenities.  Can't say enough good things about our stay or the wonderful service there! Rooms were quite spacious and the included breakfast was delicious! Would stay there again in an instant!,5,2018,06,29
207,"Checked into 6 rooms with entire family,kids and grandkids","Over the top welcome for travelers who flew overnight from LAX.
Service and attention was superb,accommodations better than typical 5 star hotels and the restaurants were awesome in design ,utilization and excellent food.
The Shelbourne is an historic hotel,located conveniently across from St Stevens Green. The interior design of the hotel recognizes its place in history while catering to today's modern travelers.. We liked the hotel so much we added 2 more nights following the conclusion of our tour.",5,2018,06,28
207,Ladies Mini Marathon Day Charity Stay,"My first ever visit to the Shelbourne Hotels was planned as a special treat. Following my a year of illness which took two difficult years to recover from a friend of mine invited me to join her to partake in the Woman’s mini marathon in Dublin. 

We knew that I would be unable to run the race however I was encouraged to join by my family, on a personal level I felt that the goal of finishing the route would be a great motivation to spend more time outdoors and be as active as possible.

The night before the race I traveled to Dublin from Co Clare, my confidant had arranged for us both to stay at the Shelbourne Hotel and I felt a great sense of anticipation as I arrivedon the that afternoon.

When we booked into our room which had been arranged as a special treat for us both. I was instantaneously surprised that we both had to share a small bed in a room which was particularly small for one person not to mention two of us. That evening we enjoyed a meal nearby and spent some time people watching in the hotel lobby.

On the morning of the race we both went for a short walk in the beautiful St Stephens green and we decided to have a light breakfast in the hotels dining room. My appetite was somewhat reduced as I was anxious as to the day ahead and I opted to have some porridge and toast. The butter which I was presented with had been cut for some time and it was far too hard to use so I ate my toast without it. The food area was very busy and a little problematic to navigate as all of the other guests congregated in the small entrance way as they waited for breakfast tables. 

When we came to pay the bill I was uneasy when I saw the price of the breakfast my good friend had to pay for paltry breakfast. We had assumed that for the price of the room that breakfast was encompassed – at almost €60 it was an unexpected addition.

After check out before going to the gathering point I arranged to leave our personal items in the store and the porter gave me a ticket. The hotel was lively with other ladies who had gathered in the hotel bar to meet before the main event of the day.

The big race was wonderful event to partake in and it was a truly joyous affair. When I passed the finishing line I had a sense of completion and joy. atmosphere in the city was vibrant and I was personally especially proud.

I returned to the Shelbourne Hotel where many hundreds of ladies had gathered and were singing and rejoicing the special day. 

At the entrance the security man stopped me and told me that ladies in sports clothes were not allowed in today, he was unkind and abrupt. I explained that I had been competing in the Mini Marathon and having stayed at the hotel the previous night I had made arrangements to collect my belongings – he was not heeding and I decided to speak with a younger man. 

I explained once again that I had made an arrangement to collect my bag prior to traveling home; his response was along the lines of the new manager had made the rule and that he could not undermine his companion. felt overcome with emotion and tears gathered I walked away from the entrance to compose myself. As stood back I could see that many other ladies were receiving the same treatment that I had received and the security men had obviously received a brief to refuse entry.

My friend and I decided to take a short walk to a close by hotel so that we could telephone the manager to explain our dilemma. We called Hotel and the man with whom we spoke instructed us to call in the morning to report our missing bags with the security manager. He did not appreciate our plight!

It took several further attempts make contact and final I was given permission to return to collect my belongings. I will not forget my experience that afternoon and the way I was made to feel. 

I took time to write to the security manager and my correspondence must have joined a large collection of associated complaints. I know that I was not the only participant to be treated in this manner and I had expected that I would be contacted – however as a month has passed I have not even received a call.",2,2018,06,28
207,Just average,"My husband and I spent one night here.  The room was lovely, comfortable, and nicely furnished.  The bathroom was large, but we were shocked to find mildew in the shower in several places.  When we told the front desk, they basically shrugged it off and just said, ""Sorry.""  We found the staff at the front desk to be very cold and not friendly. This was a stark comparison to the wonderful doormen and bellhops who were as friendly and helpful as you could hope for when visiting a new city.  The location is great, but I feel that as a hotel in this price range, it was disappointing.",3,2018,06,27
207,Amazing Irish Hospitality,"This hotel has the best location of any in Dublin. It busy daytime , essentially there is always a buzz. It's architecture is classic Dublin Georgian and aliitle but of art nouveaux mixed in with the lamps outside reminiscent of Paris.
The staff are the best you will find anywhere is in the world simply exceptional! 
Beds were so comfy we slept like babies in the heart of a city!
We hope to be back soon, great impression to start an Irish trip.Have an Irish coffee in the bar and chat to locals and travellers from all over the world who are open because there in Dublin and not afraid to talk like in London ;)",5,2018,06,25
207,A Perfect Place to Stay in Dublin,"We recently had the good fortune to arrive at the Shelbourne on a beautiful May day.  The location was perfect for travelers and on this sunny day, we walked right across the street to St. Stephen's park to join all the happy sunworshipping going on in this lovely peaceful park.  We returned for a welcome drink in the lively and beautiful bar.  I must mention the amazing flowers that welcome visitors and are throughout the hotel.  The arrangements were beautiful and we were lucky to be there on the day they were changed so we got to enjoy two different looks.  Our rooms were lovely and well stocked.  
I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,06,24
207,Superb.. Afternoon Tea,"Attention to detail, quality of food, ambiance, service, value, friendly atmosphere, tick tick etc. From the moment you enter to the moment you leave what a wonderful experience. Celebrating my daughter's graduation here couldn't have been a better experience and   not stuffy at all so don't be put off.. one of the best opportunities to have a wonderful time.. thank you to all the staff..you are amazing ",5,2018,06,24
207,Classic Hotel in Dublin with Excellent Service and Dinning,"This is a classic hotel in the heard of Dublin.  The service in the hotel and it's dinning venues was great.  The price is on the upper range but worth it.  Because the building is old it has some quirks like uneven floors. The indoor swimming pool is large by hotel standards and very useful for serious swimming.  The hotels two dinning venues had good food and service.  Did not try the tea room but from what I could see it looked good if you are in to ""High Tea.""  Good location with many of Dublin's attractions within walking distance.  Large selections are also within walking distance.",5,2018,06,24
207,Afternoon High Tea,We reserved a table for an afternoon setting and couldn't have been more pleased. Every single staff person was pleasant. Think about that. We chatted with 5-6 people on staff and they were all wonderful to us. Tea options were plenty and delicious. If you're looking for a classic high tea with live piano in a well appointed room ... this is the one for you both.,5,2018,06,24
207,The place to stay in Dublin,"It was truly an outstanding part of our trip.  Great location, walking distance to many great attractions including the home of Riverdance! They made you feel great about being there.  Defiantly will return the next time we're in Dublin.",5,2018,06,23
207,A gem in Ireland,"I would classify this hotel as a large boutique hotel. From the time you enter (greeted by a top hat valet) to the end of your stay you are met with the optimum Irish hospitality by everyone, which says a lot when I consider the Irish people one of the most friendly and helpful we've come across in our travels. The hotel itself is located right across from St. Stephen's Green which is a beautiful park in downtown Dublin. There are many attractions within walking distance such as Trinity College (Book of Kells), Grafton Street (shopping) the Dublin Castle and many more.  Too many restaurants to count but a talk with the hotel Navigator (concierge) as to what you want to eat and reservations are made (and easily changed when you are running late). I mentioned a particular allergy I have and he passed it on the restaurant who were ready for us when we arrived with a modified menu. Service was above and beyond. We had a problem with our North American outlet. Engineering was up while we were out and couldn't fix the problem so he left us several adopters. They didn't work either so a second call was made. Response time was almost immediate. He still couldn't fix the problem and said he would be back (in North America it usually means go have a drink at the bar). He was back almost before I had a chance to shut the door as he left. He came in with as ladder and proceeded to do what he had to do to get the outlet working. His service was amazing but no different than the staff in the restaurant or bar (got an amazing course on Irish whiskey from our waitress at the bar). 
We our Marriott gold members so we received an upgrade. The room overlooked the park, was quite large (by European boutique standards) and had a washroom the size of some rooms we've stayed in over the years. Breakfast was included and between the buffet and a la carte menu  kept us going until dinner. I would suggest you seriously consider the upgrade on checking in. 
Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else next time were back in Dublin.",5,2018,06,23
207,Very busy but nice to watch crowds.,We meet up here at Christmas for a drink and a scone. Needless to say the place was packed but there is just a great buzz in here throughout Christmas. We know it’s on the expensive side but as a treat it’s worth it.,5,2018,06,20
207,Superior Service and Lovely Property,"We started our Ireland adventure with 5 days in Dublin at the Shelbourne.  Jet lagged and weary, this hotel is a wonderful oasis in the bustle of Dublin.  Located on St. Stephens Green, it's a short walk to Grafton Street; a wonderful location for two travelers who like to walk and see the sights.  Staff are both professional but very caring striking the right balance to ensure our stay was perfect.  The best for us is that this is a Marriott Property and we were able to use our points!  Score!",5,2018,06,20
207,"Spacious room, plentiful amenities, comfortable bed","We begin our Ireland adventure with 4 nights in Dublin at the Shelbourne. Our room was large enough for two people to eat a late snack or relax and try to watch the Quiet Man before falling asleep. My traveling companion never did make it through the whole movie - the chairs and bed are THAT comfortable. I forced myself to stay up our last night just to finish the movie. The Shelbourne's location is close to perfect, right across the street from St Stephen's Green and within walking distance to Grafton St. Breakfast here can be quite pricey. If all you require is coffee and a roll or a light breakfast sandwich, walk 150 feet or so up the street and have breakfast at Starbucks.",5,2018,06,20
207,Super ,Stayed here with my parents for my sons graduation. It was perfect from start to finish. We ate in the restaurant for dinner service and food was excellent. Had lunch and drinks in the bar they were top class also ,5,2018,06,18
207,Drinks at the main bar,"On our last night in Dublin we walked down the street to The Shelbourne and had drinks at the main bar.
Theo was our server and she was friendly and provided great service. The prices were reasonable. My Guinness was excellent and my wife had a tasty Cosmopolitan to start her evening.
It was a relaxing atmosphere and we ordered another round. 
We had a great time looking at the small museum off the lobby and checking out the beautiful details in the other public areas.
Next time we are in Dublin we are staying at The Shelbourne.",5,2018,06,18
207,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea at the Shelbourne is a special treat.  Expensive, but worth it.  Impeccable service in beautiful surroundings complemented  a dizzying array of fine teas and coffees, accompanied by a fine selection of sandwiches and pastries.  I recommend the whiskey tea.",5,2018,06,18
207,Wonderful Historical Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel that has an understated luxury to it.  We stayed here as a part of a group trip so we ate meals in a group setting and not in the restaurants.   The food was quite good for every meal.  The service was first rate.  The location is ideal to explore Dublin.  It is within walking distance to the Temple Bar district if you are looking for a little night life. Our room was nice, quiet and clean. The bathroom was large with heated towel racks and a spacious shower.  Wifi worked well all over the hotel.  There is even a garden across the street from the hotel that provides a peaceful retreat in the middle of a busy city.  This a good choice for your stay in Dublin city center.",4,2018,06,12
207,Wonderful,"Stayed here for three nights got a great deal brilliant hotel and perfect location 
There is so much history here it is much more than a hotel. Staff and service at super fast and super friendly wlll definitely return",5,2018,06,11
207,First Class with Historic Style,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for a week in April.  Bellmen, Concierge staff (esp. Denis O'Brien), front desk staff, and wait staff at restaurants all very skilled, diligent, and helpful.  Sampled all the restaurants--very good.  The chateaubriand in the Saddle Rm was outstanding!  Had the aft tea at Lord Mayor's lounge, which my wife liked more than I did.  Ate twice at No. 27 bar & lounge--very limited menu.  Horseshoe bar, historic but small and easily crowded.
Breakfast in the Saddle Rm was uniformly excellent!
Would stay again mostly due to the quality and attentiveness of the staff.
If you plan to stay at this hotel, watch a few episodes of The Shelbourne on Amazon Prime.",5,2018,06,11
207,Great Hotel in Dublin City Center,"Great city hotel near St. Stephens Green, walking distance to almost everything. They hotel has all the modern conveniences, but maintained it’s character of yesteryear. 

We used Marriott points to book our room. Typically in the states they place you in less than desirable rooms. Not the case in Dublin. We seemed appreciated for our loyalty to Marriott brand and was upgraded to a corner suite! Upon check-in we were also given (2) complimentary drink vouchers.

The service at the hotel was superior. The break-fast was above average. We would highly recommend staying here.",5,2018,06,10
207,Outstanding Hoel.,"A group of friends stayed here and were very impressed with the service and quality of the rooms.  The beds and pillows were great. This was one of the few hotels in Ireland that had air conditioning. The breakfast was also very good. Claire at the front desk provided very pleasant service and made us feel welcome. Also, great bar and personnel.  Very knowledgeable.",5,2018,06,10
207,Ireland Tour,"This was an absolutely fabulous stay. The service was impeccable. The rooms were spacious. The food really yummy. It’s a magnificent location on St. Stephan’s Green; so close to everything; not too far from the airport, also.  We would all stay there again.",5,2018,06,10
207,Drinks ,"Went to Shelbourne for drinks on Saturday night. Just a few to Finnish night off. Lovely hotel , memories, as we got married there recently. Our waitress, Caoimhne, was class. Very attentive & professional. We love this hotel as we have stayed there loads. Really nice hotel. 👍",5,2018,06,09
207,The best of the bunch,"This might be the best hotel I've experienced. We had two rooms for three nights in the Heritage wing of the hotel, a larger guest room and a junior suite. Both were exceedingly well appointed, the junior suite was amazingly spacious. I am really picky and focused on detail, especially when paying the tariffs charged at the Shelbourne... Apart from doors that could close more quietly, I have nothing - truly nothing - negative to say about the rooms or the stay. Elena tended to our room and she was so meticulous and considerate -- when she left, it was as though the room had just been renovated.

The breakfast is buffet or à la carte, the gym is small but modern and well equipped, and the two bars are very different (one light and airy, the other dark and intimate) and top notch. 

The location is on St. Stephen's Green, convenient to an early morning or end-of-the-day walk. Everything you would want, tourist-wise, is within a mile or so of the hotel. I would not stay anywhere else in Dublin if I were to return.",5,2018,06,09
207,Perfect Hotel to Wander Dublin,My wife and I stayed for two nights at the Shelbourne at the very end of a two week vacation to Ireland.  The Shelbourne was the perfect location for us to wander Dublin and access great restaurants.  It's hard to not start a great visit when you are put into a suite named after a movie star who frequented the hotel.  Beautiful room; the staff were extraordinary and the the weather (not under their control) was beautiful.,5,2018,06,08
207,Truly Outstanding!,"Excellent location just off St. Stephens Green and very close to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and the River Liffy.  We were staying on Marriott Reward Points so upon arrival we got 2 drink coupons good for any beverage in either bar.  We also had the breakfast buffet included - which was €29 each so a really great perk.  The 	hotel was historic and had a small museum in the lobby.  Our room was beautiful - extremely comfortable as you would expect from Marriott.  We even took advantage of the indoor pool.  Definitely a great place to stay and truly a 5* hotel!",5,2018,06,06
207,Location Location Location...and a touch of class,"Ok you expect a touch of class from a 5 star hotel  but What an AMAZING location, right in the center of Dublin City overlooking their version of Central Park. We loved our stay here and the service and people were absolutely superb.",4,2018,06,06
207,Very Nice!,"Well located in central Dublin, the Shelbourne is a grand hotel that has served famous and just us others folkes for years. Great pubs and restaurants in the hotel and nearby.  High tea is a treat for the ladies.",5,2018,06,06
207,Classic hotel with all of the amenities,We love this hotel.  The premium rooms and suites are beautiful.  The breakfast is the best we ever had while traveling.  The doorman are extremely helpful in coordinating all of your needs.  The front desk was very helpful but at times was confused with prepaid reservation.,5,2018,06,05
207,History pure history,This is one of those hotels that deserve never to be totally modernised by that I mean the theme of the hotel remains unaltered this hotel stands proudly facing the world famous St. Stephens Green and has although upgraded to a point still retains that famous charm that the hotel always has for instance the famous Horseshoe Bar is totally the same as before although expensive this is an experience not to be missed.,4,2018,06,05
207,A live worm in my orange juice - from the breakfast buffet's juice container,"I had one of the worst experiences at a hotel here. I am a Marriott Platinum Premier (top 5% of Marriott platinum) member and I spend over 100 nights a year staying at Marriott properties. I was pretty excited about staying in this hotel and was quite excited about their breakfast buffet because of the good reviews it receives. Much to my dismay my orange juice at the breakfast buffet had a centimeter long live 'black worm/maggot' in it. I was absolutely shocked and disgusted by this. I poured the orange juice was from the self-serve container so the first thing I did was point out the worm in the juice to the waiter and asked him to get rid of the orange juice container which I really hope was done immediately. The manager did come and apologize and I could see that she was trying to be nice but she offered me more food/drinks when I was feeling sick to my stomach. There were three of us dining and as a premier platinum, two of our breakfasts were comped so she went ahead and comped the third one. I appreciate the good gesture but my ""buffet"" really only consisted of half a slice of bread and a cup of coffee because I was pretty nauseous after what I saw and to be honest I wonder if I will ever be able have an orange juice again. I was also given two drink coupons which I thought was slightly offensive after what had happened although I am very certain that the managers intentions were just to make me feel better. Anyway, I left the coupons on the table. Overall, I think the situation should have been completely avoided by assuring the cleanliness/quality of the drinks being served. Sherbourne is a five star hotel and this kind of incident here is frankly unacceptable. Again, this worm came from the juice container from which others poured their orange juice as well. 

In contrast to the horrible experience I had during breakfast, the hotel otherwise is really historic and nice. The staff is welcoming and the room interior looks great. My room had a view of used hotel laundry but I had booked a king room and was given two double beds on request so I have no complaints. Housekeeping did an excellent job during turn-down service. Location is pretty much hands down the best in Dublin for a tourist. 

Overall, I think the breakfast situation should have been completely avoided by assuring the cleanliness/quality of the drinks being served and if such a thing happened it should have been dealt in a better way. I was quite disappointed that this incident did not get the seriousness it deserved. I am pretty sure that I will never be eating at the Shelbourne again but I do hope the hotel management looks into this matter and ensures this does not happen for the sake of other guests who will.",1,2018,06,03
207,Perfect Location,"The hotel was beautiful and in a perfect location, but a bit pricey. 

For Marriott Gold and Platinum guests, there is a complimentary breakfast. 

Bring your swimming trunks as they have a great health club and pool that is definitely worth taking advantage of.",5,2018,06,02
207,Elegant Hotel,We completely enjoyed our stay here.  The location is perfect for exploring Dublin.  The rooms are elegant--the attention to detail makes this hotel special.  Breakfast was extremely good.  You can order from the menu or do the buffet.  The doorman is wonderful at arranging taxis and answering questions.  This is a very special hotel in Dublin--very historical--and the staff is absolutely wonderful.,5,2018,06,02
207,Beautiful historic hotel,This is a beautiful historic hotel that is in walking distance to almost everything.  The staff is pretty helpful and the beds are very comfortable.  Would recommend if you are looking for something in a higher price range.  ,5,2018,05,30
207,Enchanting Ireland stay,"We spent 3 nights at the Shelbourne in May 2018 with a family of 5.  The service was impeccable and the updated surroundings were luscious.  There was a glitch with one of our rooms for 1 night (my fault) and they were so very accommodating to our needs.  I would highly recommend this beautiful, old world hotel to any traveler.",5,2018,05,30
207,Lovely hotel,"Absolutely beautiful hotel.
Wonderful rooms, with excellent concierge service.
The hotel is full of history, with great amenities. The pool and spa are great, but the pool could honestly do with a deep clean. However this doesn't detract from the overall excellence and ambience. 
The breakfast is wonderful but if you are staying for more than one night, is recommend walking 5 minutes to Bewleys on Grafton Street. Another beautiful building with great food and service.
Definitely stay at The Shelbourne next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2018,05,30
207,Stay in a very classical environment with good service,The Hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Dublin. Very suitable for business meetings or just a stop over. Nice restaurants close by. Service as good as it can be in Dublin. Somewhat a challenge if you arrive with your own car.,5,2018,05,29
207,Georgian Classic in the heart of Dublin,"Excellent location, energetic public spaces, bars and restaurants. Horseshoe Bar was crowded, but the service was spot on. Bar No. 27 is a busy gathering spot for hotel guests, shoppers and general fun-seekers.  A B.I.G.shout-out to LAURA who took care of our group of 5 hungry, thirsty American tourists very thoughtfully, attentively and engagingly.  Thanks L-Unit!! Hotel rooms are modern, capacious enough for the price with generously sized bathrooms. My only complaint is with those mini-bar fridges that ring you up automatically if you move the bottles around.  Makes you feel like an untrustworthy potential thief, plus there's no place to stow medications requiring refrigeration. Very Vegas...  All in all a fine, upscale home-away-from-home for travelers who favor big and happening.",4,2018,05,28
207,Great hotel,"Clean, well appointed rooms and common areas.  Good food both in bars and in room service.  Worth the cost.  Service was excellent. Location is great can walk to many interesting places in Dublin and right by a huge beautiful park.  Bed was comfortable.  I would return and stay there again.  ",5,2018,05,28
207,Clan gathering,Great hotel. The staff was amazing. Just out of the city centre but thats no problem with the tram service 2 minutes walk from hotel. Breakfast very nice buffet service. We also had meals in the bar which we couldn't falt great portions. No hesitation to stay here again on out next visit,5,2018,05,28
207,"Excellent location, luxurious, expensive","The ""grande dame"" of Dublin hotels, the Shelbourne has a wonderful location across from St. Stephen's Green, a park with walks, flowers, ponds, ducks and swans, sculptures, and lush trees. The hotel is a complex of buildings almost seamlessly connected. The many staff members are all kind and helpful. You can walk to just about everything--the Gaiety Theater, the shops on Grafton Street, the major museums, many restaurants, and Dublin Castle.
At first  I was in a standard room--fine, clean, with everything i needed, but just a bit bigger than the queen-sized bed. Then I was upgraded to a much larger and more comfortable room.
The bathroom had a sparkling chrome arrangement for the tub/hand shower that should have come with an engineering manual. It also had a walk-in shower that i used for three days before I saw very faint lettering on the shiny steel wall plate indicating hot and cold.
A generous breakfast was included in the room rate. I also ate in the busy bar/restaurant off the lobby and found the service and food were excellent.
But, for a 5-star city-center hotel, it lacked some things almost every hotel has. There was no helpful book or folder in my room telling me about the hotel's amenities. Where was the pool and spa? Where were the restaurants? The business center? What were their hours? The staff answered my questions, but I should not have needed to ask. By asking I did discover how to find the pool (complicated) and learned that it closed early on weekends, when I would have expected it to stay open later. There was no booklet describing ""What's on in Dublin,"" with a listing of museums, restaurants and bars, theaters, etc.",4,2018,05,27
207,Star Inflation,"The Shelbourne is a very average 5-star hotel with above average 5-star prices. If it wasn’t for the efforts of many, but not all the staff, I’d rated it even lower.

The public areas are, without exception, very crowded. During our stay, it was not unusual to see queues for both check-in and check-out and the overall impression was of a hotel that was over-trading.

When visiting a new hotel, I like to read the Hotel Directory. At the Shelbourne, there didn’t seem to be one. By comparison, when we first visited our favourite 5-star hotel, which is a short walk from Hanover Square in London, not only did they have a comprehensive Hotel Directory, but, even as ordinary guests, we were given a conducted tour round the property, were shown to our room and were then offered a complementary pot of tea.

You might have thought that, if a hotel provides a comfortable seating area in your room (which was pleasant), it would be possible to view the television from there. This was not possible due to the absence of a cantilevered TV wall bracket. The bottom sheet for the bed was also far too small.

On the first morning of our visit, we had to queue for breakfast with little in the way of apology. It was almost as if the staff viewed the situation as being the guests’ fault. Breakfast, itself, was a buffet which, again, is something you don’t expect in a 5-star hotel and means that most of the hot food ends up being overcooked. Also, the tables were both small and crammed together. The service at breakfast was considerably better when Sorcha was on duty.

The food at No 27 Bar and Lounge is hit and miss. My wife enjoyed her fish and chips. The menu describes “The Shelbourne Prawn Cocktail” as including “plump and juicy medium size shrimps”. This doesn’t seem to recognize that prawns and shrimps are different species of Decapod crustaceans. In the event, it turned out to be a generous helping of lettuce, accompanied by a few tired pieces of shrimp without any bread and butter. This is hardly what you expect from “the place to see and be seen in Dublin”.

In the hotel’s museum there is a sample menu dating back to 1949. This makes it clear that, in those days, dinner was both more imaginative and significantly better value for money.  Mixing the Table d’hote and A la Carte menus for dinner for a party of four in the Saddle Room seemed to cause our waitress a degree of confusion.

All in all, disappointing.",3,2018,05,27
207,Afternoon drinks in No.27!,The Shelbourne hotel was buzzing on this sunny Saturday afternoon...we had to perch at the bar while we waited for a table to become available. There is a large interesting gin menu though we all thought the bar man was rather surly as he was unable/unwilling to engage. Drinks here are expensive but it’s a very gracious building and worth it for the ambience.,4,2018,05,27
207,Hotel #1 on our Globus Tour,"This was our pick for our Globus Emerald Isle bus tour, hotel on our own before the tour.  Beautiful.   Perfect spot in the middle of everything. Comfortable room. Bar was a fun place.  Wished they didn't make wait for room until 4 pm as we were tired from our red eyed flight.",5,2018,05,26
207,Little did we know the place this hotel holds in Irish history,"As we walked past this hotel, something drew us in. It was hot outside but there was something else. We just wanted a drink and were welcomed in with the usual Irish good humour. A pint of Guinness and a cocktail in just delightful surroundings. That could have been enough but as the week-end unravelled we came to find out that this hotel had played a very important part in the Uprising. that was not obvious on a visit but perhaps that's what drew us in. We didn't stay here but may do next time we visit Dublin.",5,2018,05,26
207,A perfect glossy city escape,"Location is second to none, never mind their cocktail bar is so lively always and the glossy feel about the place ahhh, staff are exceptionally friendly, the spa is not to forget about, (ask for Nikky best therapist), get all your recommendations about whats to do in the city from the most informed concierge service... the list can go on. It basicaly, should be anyones 1st choice for a best Dublin City experience.",4,2018,05,25
207,Horseshoe Bar...... lovely Experience,Visited the Horseshoe Bar after dinner and what a relaxing experience. The 3 young men behind the bar were a great advert for the friendly efficiency that one would expect in a famous 5 Star Hotel. I travel a lot for my business and regularly stay in 5 Star hotels but the teamwork and service with a smile that i witnessed in the Horseshoe was terrific to see. I would compliment the Hotel Management on there choice of staff in this old bar and also the training of the staff .... well done. I can’t remember the names of the Bar ‘Ambassadors’ but they were the talk of my group and a superb team who interacted brilliantly with the customers and also had fun and banter amongst themselves.... superb,5,2018,05,23
207,Best in Dublin,"This was our first trip to Dublin, so we wanted the perfect hotel. We found our perfect place at the Shelbourne. The location is central to everything and across from beautiful St Stephens green, an oasis in the city. The rooms we had were beautiful and comfortable, with fabulous beds and bathrooms. We ate breakfast in the Saddle Room every morning and the buffet had absolutely everything and was delicious. But the best thing about the hotel was the super staff! From our arrival, and welcome by the gracious head doorman, to the receptionists, concierge, waiters at the restaurant, bell staff, and cleaners, everyone was friendly, yet professional, and helpful. My husband has difficulty getting around and the doormen were so very kind, always helping at the door and into and out of taxis. They went out of their way and treated us with kindness. This was one of our best hotel visits ever. Highly recommend!",5,2018,05,23
207,Lovely tea!,We went for tea to relax after a trans-Atlantic flight.  We were 6 people and we had a reservation.  We were seated promptly at a nice table next to the window.  The choice of sandwiches and sweets was great and we all enjoyed ourselves.  My brother is a vegetarian and he had an excellent choice too.  Service was friendly and very efficient. ,5,2018,05,22

And such a lovey tradition 
Please pass my thanks to all involved

207,Shelbourne Hotel,"Staying here is like staying within a part of Irish history.  Since joining the Renaissance Group of Marriott Hotels, a large amount was re-invested into updating the hotel with extraordinary results.  I have been in small rooms up to and including excellent two room suites.  All outstanding.  Staff  very responsive.  In fact I have a great story of extreme kindness on the part of a front desk agent that was excellent. ",5,2018,05,21
207,Maria was the greatest joy,The hospitality here was wonderful but no one went above and beyond like Maria one of the hospitality managers. I cannot say enough good about the detail and splendid level of service she provides. Completely made the experience!,5,2018,05,21
207,Wonderful hotel in perfect location,"This is a luxury hotel from start to finish. It has all the bells and whistles you would expect in a 5 Star Hotel. The location, across the street from St. Stephens Green Park, is terrific. You can pretty much walk to many of the main points of interest from the hotel and there are numerous good restaurants nearby.  If we are in Dublin again, we will stay here.",5,2018,05,20
207,Luxury experience,"Luxurious lobby and big, well-decorated, elegant room.  Very comfortable bed and a heavenly place to sleep after long international travel or busy days touring Dublin.  Gorgeous marble bathroom, with big tub and spacious shower.  Wonderful products and big towels.  Delicious breakfast with big buffet with pastries and smoked salmon, plus made to order entrees like eggs Benedict.  Just a wonderful place to stay close to parks and the pedestrian shopping street, but a bit further walk from touristy areas like Temple Bar.  Airbus to airport just a block walk.",5,2018,05,17
207,Worth the wait.,"After numerous visits to Dublin we finally stayed at The Shelbourne.  We had dined here in the past, as well as drinks and the afternoon tea but this visit allowed us to spend two days and a night.  Absolutely top-notch and great value.  Wonderful staff.
It seems as though the better Dublin hotels set their prices just below this hotel so why not just stay at this classy lady.",5,2018,05,16
207,High Tea,I had been watching this series on Amazon Prime and when we pass on the tour bus insisted to the rest of my friends that we go back for high tea!   What a delightful experience!   Treated like royalty and the food was so yummy!  This was definitely worth the time and money!  What fun!,5,2018,05,15
207,Great Location,Beautiful Hotel in a great location. Room was very spacious and had a great view of St. Stephens Green. Walking distance to some great area attractions. Restaurant in the hotel was great with amazing oysters. Staff was very friendly.,5,2018,05,15
207,Lovely Pricey Hotel with Americans,"
I believe the hotel is overpriced for what we receive, but a lovely stay. Americans clearly are fueling the fire here.The staff seem warm and slightly frazzled. Two were in training on our buffet breakfast day, making a mess everywhere. With my service dog, we were seated in the most remote separate room at buffet breakfast, making me feel like a non-guest. Trash in halls and windows that don’t open despite handles were disappointing. Give yourself 25 minutes to find and then make your spa appointment in time. Our shower was a lovely experience.  The doormen are a true asset to the staff here. We had a reservation to stay here after our cruise as well, but we have decided to look for a less expensive option in light of the fact we feel we receive little luxury value for the high amount we pay.  The park across the street is lovely. ",4,2018,05,13
207,Beautiful luxury hotel,"We had a wonderful two night stay at the gorgeous historic Shelbourne Hotel.
Everything about the hotel was first class. We had a beautiful large room with lovely, comfortable furniture and a beautiful bathroom. 
The service was excellent, from the moment we checked in to the moment we left.
We had the breakfast package , which included a sumptuous breakfast buffet and fresh made to order breakfast items as well.
The location of this hotel was perfect for us. Across the street from St. Stephens Green,  where we spent much time, enjoying all the beautiful spring flowers in bloom.
The profusion of tulips was breathtaking!  Don’t miss this park, which is also home to
the famous reclining statue of Oscar Wilde reclining. It is a hoot!
This property is also close to Grafton Street, Trinity College, and several museums.
I believe it is the best location for sightseeing in Dublin. We were able to walk everywhere.
I recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a luxury, historic hotel in a great location.

207,Disappointed ,"I’ve stayed here quite a few times and very disappointed this time, will be looking elsewhere for our next trip to Dublin. For the price we paid, €412 with NO breakfast, a very small bedroom with tiny bathroom overlooking another building. The room wasn’t ready when we arrived Even though we’d checked in via the app earlier.  Not only that, room wasn’t ready half hour after official check in time. When we complained we were given another room. We were also offered an upgrade for an extra €120 for the night which we declined. I was celebrating my 40th birthday while there and received some chocolate strawberries and a card. Nobody asked on departure how our stay was. Had they, we would’ve said, fine, not special, not worth it but fine.. as I’ve said we’ve stayed many times before over the last 10 years and it was always so special, we felt it had lost that this time.. disappointing.. ",3,2018,05,12
207,Grand elegance with contemporary excellence ,"Ok, so here is the bottom line. Convenient city center location across from St Stephen’s Green. This grand old hotel expresses style and service. Don’t know when the rooms were last renovated, but our room had a fresh, clean and elegant look and feel. Front desk and bell staff were friendly, professional and knowledgeable. The two consierge staff we dealt with (Allen and Keith) were very knowledgeable and helpful in selecting restaurants, how to get about town and info about attractions. The front doorman greeted us upon arrival by taxi, immediately took care of our luggage and walked us in to the front desk while informing us about the hotel. We only ate breakfast within the hotel but that buffet was very good with friendly and attentive staff. ",5,2018,05,11
207,Every detail large and small is grand at this hotel!,"I would love to go back and stay longer at this truly grand hotel! Its location across from St. Stephen's Green allowed us the opportunity to walk anywhere with ease and to catch public transportation. We spent two nights in #636 -- a lovely one-bedroom suite that had several closets and elegant, but not stuffy furnishings. I loved sleeping on the bed with its perfect mattress and soft linens. The bathroom had loads of thick, plush towels and oversized versions of Elemis toiletries. The living room had every possible comfort and amenity -- even though we didn't avail ourselves of most of them!  Framed black-and-white photos of Jack and Jackie Kennedy, and young Caroline and John when they visited Ireland, were thoughtfully placed throughout the suite. I also enjoyed seeing The Irish Country House coffee table book as I had wanted to visit several of these but didn't have time on this trip. The woman at the front desk (actually located near the back of the main floor) was very gracious when we checked in. The public rooms are stunning as are the stained glass windows on every landing, each featuring a different county in Ireland. This truly is a grand hotel that is deserving of its illustrious reputation but makes a tourist feel most appreciated!",5,2018,05,10
207,Superb Hotel in central Dublin,"Enjoyed a wonderful weekend stay in this prestigious hotel located in central Dublin right beside beautiful Saint Stephens Green .

The staff were very efficient, polite and could not have been more helpful.

I will be booking  another visit to this hotel  in July and will have it as my first choice each time I visit Dublin.",5,2018,05,10
207,Wow. Stunning,"From the minute you pull up the staff are polite and helpful. The decor is stunning. Rooms are beautiful. We had dinner in the Saddle Room. The food was amazing. However - when I ordered a chocolate fondant for dessert- I did not expect the ice cream to be sat on a bed of nuts. As someone with a nut allergy this was not ideal. It was immediately replaced. 

",5,2018,05,09
207,Martin and Dagmara ,Unsure if they are still working there but they are singlehandedly two of the finest people hospitality has to offer. Without them F&B wouldn’t function. They treat everyone with the same respect and sensitivity we all deserve. Nothing is ever to big an ask and they treat other staff members like royalty too. Miss and love you both always xx ,5,2018,05,09
207,Good,"We stayed here for a night last Saturday night on a short visit to Dublin.

The hotel is very pretty. The decor is great but not consistent it also has some really nice touches throughout. The team are very friendly and welcoming. We ate at Hugo’s nearby on their recommendation and that was fantastic. Breakfast in the Saddle room was also good.

Our room was adequate and included tea and coffee making facilities and basic Elemis toiletries .I wish they had supplied me with a toothbrush like other 5 star hotels do. 

We had been upgraded to this particular room with a view of the wall. 

Overall not bad.

207,Beautiful 5 star hotel with 6 star people and service,"My wife and I stayed here in December. A beautiful place with lots of character. Place is immaculate .....you can walk from here to a lot of great pubs, and also a mall, and Grafton street for shopping . Nice park across the street. We did the hop on hop off bus to see the sites.
Ireland has the nicest people I have ever met.
Note, just ask the bell hop outside about where to eat or shop, these guys are great.

Also, from the states, no need to bring adapter for power plug, they will give them to you",5,2018,05,08
207,Spa,"me and my partner were in for massage treatments yesterday for our anniversary the 5th of may , we were extremely unhappy with the whole experience , we arrived At reception and we were waiting there for a good few minutes untill we got called for our treatments , once the treatments were over we were brought back to reception and that was it , we didn't get put into robes before or after our treatments ,we weren't brought into the relaxation room to relax , so we didn't get the full 5 star spa experience that we hoped for , I'm not sure what the reason was behind this but we were extremely unhappy as we expected more from the 5 star spa , it felt like we were just pushed out! Every body else was in robes, except us! I work in a 4 star spa so i did  expect a lot more from this 5 star spa ! We were looking forward to it so much , but it was a real let down !  we thought we were going to get changed into robes and brought into the relaxation room after our treatments to relax but we didn't.We were staying the night in the hotel and paid a lot of money for the hotel and the spa treatments so we expected at least to be brought into the relaxation room and put into robes! the hotel and room were amazing but the spa really let it down . very annoyed by the whole spa experience !

207,5 Star from start to finish! ,"My boyfriend surprised me with an overnight stay in the Shelbourne hotel for my birthday. We've been here before for drinks but never had the pleasure of staying before. 

Our stay was absolutely first class from start to finish. From the warm welcome of every staff member to the beautifully decorated room, the lovely lunch and the surprise bottle of prosecco in our room when we returned. 

This was genuinely the nicest hotel that I have ever stayed in my entire life. As it was a birthday surprise, I have no idea of the cost but it would be hard to out a price on the fantastic day and night we had in the Shelbourne hotel. 

I look forward to returning for a special occasion at some point in the near future! ",5,2018,05,07
207,WOW,"This is just a beautiful hotel, with a great location, incredible history and a very attentive staff.  You will not want for anything when you stay here.  Can’t say enough how much we enjoyed our nights staying here",5,2018,05,07
207,Dublin finest stay,"When a Dublin taxi driver tells you that you're going to the best that Dublin has to offer, you can believe him. The Shelbourne is a beautiful historic hotel in the best part of town (across the street from St Stephen's Green) with abundant dining, shopping and entertainment. Our room was clean, spacious, quiet and beautifully furnished. Our service was excellent from start to finish. We ate breakfasts at the hotel buffet and everything was fresh delicious.

This stay was at the end of a month of travel, starting with a transatlantic crossing to London (Southampton) and progressed through England and Ireland ending in Dublin. We enjoyed great lodgings along the way but this stop exceeded all expectations.

I had some problems with an old knee injury and the hotel staff were most gracious in offer us assistance. This ranged from delivering ice packs to our room several times a day to recommending a walk in medical doctor near the hotel for a couple prescriptions. Every staff member was gracious and helpful throughout our stay. When we return to Dublin there is no quesrtion where we will stay.",5,2018,05,06
207,EXCELLENT!!,"Beautiful hotel with beautiful rooms, fabulous location for exploring Dublin, staff could not be faulted, first class service from start to finish, stay in Dublin regularily and after this visit I won't be staying anywhere else in future!",5,2018,05,02
207,Trip to Dublin 27th April,"This hotel is outstanding in every way - apart from its central location, the service was faultless and the hotel is excellent. There was no external noise at all in the room that I stayed in, and the bathroom was large with separate walk in shower and nice toiletries. Every member of staff was pleasant, very helpful and wnet out of their way to please",5,2018,05,01
207,"Good Location, poor Service ","The Hotel is located close to all Highlights of Dublin. The superior double room was clean but nothing special. But the service was disappointing. First evening: no turn down service. Next morning: no room service until 2:30 on. We had to talk to the reception to get things done. On the second day we asked the reception to make a reservation for us in a Restaurant. This didn‘t happen.
The Lobby is loud and busy. Same with the breakfast-restaurant. 
The pool is big and well heated, the beds very comfortable",3,2018,05,01
207,5-Star,"We enjoyed one night in a Heritage room overlooking St. Stephens Green. 5-star service from check-in to leaving. Exceptionally high quality room. No noise from traffic on the busy street below. 
In-room dressing gowns & slippers were so soft and comfortable. Nespresso machine was also a welcome inclusion.
One of the best breakfast menus we’ve had internationally. Attentive staff made sure that any requests were promptly managed.
A luxurious atmosphere throughout, without being any way overbearing. 
Thank you to Billy in guest relations. We look forward to returning again soon.",5,2018,04,30
207,Wonderful cocktails,"We visited the Shelbourne recently, we didn’t stay overnight; just popped in for some cocktails. The bar service was excellent, really friendly & welcoming. The cocktail menu was fab and we sampled quite a few on our visit. Next time in Dublin, we will definitely stay at the Shelbourne",5,2018,04,29
207,Great Location and great hotel,"We spent 2 nights here and was so convenient to walk to other tourist spots in the city, is opposite the stop where the hop on-off buses are so you can get other places and, it has a great restaurant and bar. Would definitely stay here again! Also if you are a ""resident"" go up to the newly opened second floor bar for few drinks or a nightcap by the fire... decor is gorgeous and very comfortable.",5,2018,04,28
207,Fabulous Hotel,Great location and very friendly service. Old historic building.  Rooms were comfortable with great bed. Great lobby bar and good fitness facilities. Breakfast was excellent.  Walking distance to many sites. Best hotel I’ve stayed at in Dublin ,5,2018,04,27
207,"Great location, beautiful property, but very 'chain'","The Shelbourne is a Dublin Institution, and while I know Dublin really well, I had never stayed there, so we booked a weekend away in one of their rooms. It really does deliver in the public areas, the horseshoe bar especially is just excellent. Valet parking was great, up to the point where I used the Marriott app to ask for my car to be brought around, and it completly didnt work, so I was left waiting for 30 minutes while my car was retrieved. Room Service and Breakfast food was pretty weak overall, well executed chain hotel food really, we didn't eat in the restaurant.",4,2018,04,26
207,An Air of Elegance!,"The Shelbourne Hotel is truly a lovely place to stay when touring Dublin.  It is in walking distance of every tourist destination and a luxurious place to come home to when you are tired!  The king size bed offered an wonderful night's sleep and the spacious marble bathroom had a large tub for soaking every night!  We stayed three nights and I did not want to leave!  Highly, Highly recommended!",5,2018,04,24
207,Afternoon Tea,"Hi All,

If you are looking for an unforgettable experience in luxury, good food/drink and customer service, look no further than ‘The Lord Mayor’s Lounge’. 

I brought my Fiancée there for her birthday and we were blown away with the friendliness or the staff (Imelda and Matilde) and the manager - Eimear!! Their attentive service coupled with a constant smile and warmth made our first time experience unforgettable!!!

They couldn’t have done more for us! We booked at short notice and we given a reservation straight away! We were never felt rushed and asked if it was a special occasion! Half way through our Tea Service, they surprised us by bringing going a Happy Birthday plate for my Fiancée as the resident pianist played happy birthday on the Grand Piano!! 

Eimear was so polite and helpful, she noticed that I was still hungry after the sandwiches were all ‘munched’ away and asked would I like some more and knew I was apprehensive about asking for me! She put me at ease! 

Another example of Eimear’s 5* service was her attention to detail! She knew I liked Tea and could tell I was willing to try any and all tea available and suggested some that were spot on to my tastes! She even gave me an address for a Tea store that sold some of the tea they served!

I was blown away from the customer service! Something I hold as a key point in customer focus businesses! The Shelbourne’s are trained to the highest standards!

I couldn’t recommend afternoon tea here more strongly. I thought €49 per person was expensive before in had experience their service and food / Tea. After I can honestly say totally worth every penny! Definitely going back!! 

Thank you Eimear and your staff once again for a great experience.

207,"Extravagant, elegant and historical experience in the heart of Dublin","The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin is truly a magical experience. Each detail, from the unwavering dedication to excellent hospitality, beautiful restaurants and bars, gourmet food, beautiful hotel rooms, to the small extra touches, each moment in the Shelbourne is unforgettable. My girlfriend and I were staying at the Shelbourne for the weekend for her birthday. As a Gold Rewards member, we got upgraded to a Heritage Park Premium Room, with free breakfast in the beautiful dining room (awesome buffet breakfast- so worth being a Rewards member for this treat). The room was huge and the bathroom was beautifully adorned with walls of marble. I mentioned it was her birthday and we received a ""birthday plate"" for free that included (on my request, because my girlfriend loves prosecco) a bottle of prosecco, a plate of beautiful brownies, and a handwritten card. The bars are beautiful, the location is extremely central and easy to get around on foot, and each moment spent at the Shelbourne makes you feel like royalty. We will certainly be back soon.

Finally, the hospitality of the staff truly made a difference to us. I want to thank the front desk (especially Suzy and John, who corresponded with me over email), the man in in-room dining who brought us a bottle of prosecco, and the lovely women who served us at breakfast each morning. You are truly the heart of this beautiful hotel.",5,2018,04,23
207,Dublin April 2018,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel this month for three nights and I didn’t want to leave! The building and rooms are beautiful, with an accommodating, attentive staff, a fun bar with talented bartenders and an amazing location. Close enough to walk to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College, and St. Stephen’s Green which is right across the street. A lovely Residents Lounge on the second level was a Godsend while we waited for our room to be ready after an early morning arrival from the States; we had tea and relaxed by the fire. And the room was worth the wait - beautiful, spacious junior suite with a gorgeous bathroom and incredibly comfortable bed. My only disappointment was that Lord Mayor’s Lounge was under construction while we were there so we didn’t get to experience the high tea service that gets great reviews. So we’ll just have to go back!",5,2018,04,21
207,"Classic, elegant, great location. Love the quirkiness.","Love the classic feel of this hotel.  The little nooks, the meandering hallways.  My room was large and quiet - so comfortable.  The gym was in the basement and hot, but it was functional.  The private bar for guests was so elegant.  Breakfast buffet was ok, but the staff was thoughtful and remembered me each day.  Right outside the doors is a park, plenty of restaurants and shopping.",4,2018,04,20
207,Wonderful Irish hospitality / Impeccable Hotel,"Cannot say enough good things about The Shelbourne.   A wonderful -- and beautiful -- hotel right on St. Stephen's Green.   Outstanding, vibrant bar area with great food and terrific bartenders.   Also an excellent gym with 10 spin bikes.

Best of all was the exceptional and very gracious service.  One of the great managers, Ian, arranged for a spin bike to be placed in my room to accommodate a very early morning workout.    Could not ask for more and will definitely return.",5,2018,04,19
207,AMAZING SPA!,"Spent an amaxing, totally relaxing day at the spa! Priced upwards of 200€ but worth it if you want to ""treat yourself.""

207,A perfect short staycation,"A friend and I planned a last minute short staycation in our home town... and where better to do it than the glorious Grand Dame of Dublin, The Shelbourne.

From arrival to departure it was one super experience after the next - from the welcoming and attentive staff at check in, to the delicious lunch in the No27 lounge, fabulous treatments in the award winning Spa (Followed by Champagne in the relaxation room overlooking St Stephens Green) and late night cocktails in the Horseshoe Bar.

We felt loathe to leave and so lingered for one final lunch and cocktails before departing relaxed, rejuvenated and planning another visit soon.",5,2018,04,18
207,Nice stay,"Had a lovely couple of nights in the Shelbourne . Arrival experience was great with a very friendly valet and check-in
The bars were very busy so had to leave the hotel on the Friday night to have food and drinks . Ordered room service at 1am which was great .
Breakfast selection good , arrived 15 mins before last seating luckily as the chefs cleared down at 11:06. Wouldn’t have had breakfast if I couldn’t see them from where I was sitting . A tall male waiter at breakfast was not really switched on , but the girls made up for his apathy.
Had lunch in the 27 bar on Sunday . Oysters were great as was the shrimp Caesar. 
Out server was terrible but we were rescued by the lovely Sorcha , who was without a doubt the star of our stay.
She should be used as an example of how it should be done . 
We would return to the hotel purely based on her personality and efficiency .

207,"Beautiful, classy hotel. ","We had a wonderful stay at the Shelbourne - somewhere I had wanted to stay for years and I wasn’t disappointed. Staff were so attentive, and room was absolutely stunning. The attention to detail in the hotel makes it what it is - from being offered juice/water whilst waiting to check in, from the crystal glasses and bath salts in the bathrooms. Hope to be able to return again in the near future, it was so enjoyable. ",5,2018,04,14
207,Wonderful Hotel!,"I would give The Shelbourne more stars if I could. We had a beautiful room overlooking St.Stephen's Green. The lobby flowers are gorgeous. Every staff member is charming and helpful. Close to museums, attractions and shopping. Just an overall wonderful time.",5,2018,04,14
207,"Not so special, Very Expensive","I stay here when visiting Dublin my company has a “deal” with the hotel. This is my fifth visit and consistently this hotel under performs given its rating and the prices they charge. 

It’s a very disappointing place to stay. Yes the rooms are ok, and the bar is shockingly expensive with drinks double the price of a regular bar with average service.  You can get award points but there is no club lounge or amenity for members, eggs at breakfast will set you back $50.

What really lets this place down is the lacklustre service, guys at the door - unhelpful, excessive charges for food and drinks.   

Rooms do not get cleaned thoroughly and as an example today, still not made up by 1600. Really? 

Looking forward to my company deal migrating to another hotel, indeed will push for this. Had enough at this stage.",1,2018,04,13
207,Grand style to end my trip!,"Recently spent two weeks in Ireland and Scotland. I pretty much stayed the entire time in budget and mid-range level hotels, so that I could save money and splurge at the end of my trip. The Shelbourne is indeed a big splurge. From the doorman who greets you, to the beautiful lobby, to the professional and warm welcome/check-in process, and the elegant room, this was pure luxury in which to enjoy my final night. The room was quiet, the bed comfortable, the bathroom large and modern and the amenities first rate. To boot, I'm a Marriott Rewards member and received some nice points for my stay. My only complaint would be that I wish I had stayed longer; perhaps next time. Go ahead -- splurge a bit!",5,2018,04,10
207,A special treat,"Both me and my friend had a most wonderful stay at the Shelbourne. Beautiful building, luxurious bars, and cloud-like beds in lovely rooms. We absolutely loved it and didn't want to leave. 

A special shout out to the front door staff, who are fantastic! And also to the lovely Patrick, who checked us in. Such genuine, lovely staff. 

We did have an issue with how breakfast was billed, which I would like to e-mail the hotel about privately",5,2018,04,10
207,The Irish rock!,"Very small room. But that may be the norm there. However, the room was clean and very comfortable. It was just me so it was perfect. They also took American dollars. The front desk staff were very nice and I was walked to my room. I wasn’t able to tip the gentleman since I spent the rest of my money on the taxi. He was very gracious about it tho. I’d recommend it. ",5,2018,04,09
207,Elegance at its finest!,"This was a wonderful experience.  When you walk in you feeling like your are entering an elegant hotel from a previous time.  Everyone was wonderfully helpful and welcoming.  The staff really tried to get to know us and feel like we belonged.  I loved the doormen!  Especially Christopher.  He helped us with suggestions of things to do in Dublin and how to get around. 

I would definitely stay there again when I return to Ireland.",5,2018,04,09
207,"Lovely, Historic Hotel","Stayed at this delightful hotel for four nights.  Impeccable service and the cleanest of bathrooms we have seen in a long time.  The hotel rooms have all been recently renovated.  Spacious and well-appointed rooms.  Lovely and original artwork.  Great air circulation and even air conditioning!  

You can walk anywhere in the City Centre from the hotel.  Very convenient!

The only negative was that the hotel room we had faced an office building, so we really could not open our drapes during working hours.  It was okay, because we were out sightseeing every day, so we were not that unhappy about it.

Breakfasts were good and dinners were ample, yet a bit pricey.  Stay with the fish. Meats are okay, but over cooked for American tastes.  If you order meat, order it rare, and it may turn out medium or medium well.

Afternoon tea is about 47E.  ",5,2018,04,09
207,Cocktails,"We dropped into the Shelbourne bar recently for some after dinner Cocktails. I had the Sky is the Limit cocktail , Im not sure that was the name ...but something along that lines, it was one of the first on the list and it was a blue! Although well made it wasnt for me and I continued on with the trusted Mojito. Barman and lounge staff were both very pleasant. A beautiful decadant hotel that is always a pleasure.",4,2018,04,09

As you would expect with a well run and expensive hotel, the rooms are comfortable and the service is a high standard. The Irish charm of the friendly staff was found throughout. 

Two small issues - the lobby area is uncomfortable and does not invite guests to linger and the lunch in the bar was disappointingly ordinary (and it was not worth the cost).",4,2018,04,06
207,Wedding,"We got married in The Shelbourne on Friday 23rd March.  I cannot speak highly enough about the staff, food, stunning location & atmosphere. Simply the best. Everyone on the day helped us have the most amazing day.  Highly recommend for any occasion. ",5,2018,04,05
207,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We booked three rooms for four nights. Hotel was on the ""Green"" and walking distance to many attractions. 
The staff were very helpful and our rooms were clean and comfortable.
We got to see several celebrities in the lobby..great fun!
Restaurant was very formal. We found area dining met our need for more casual meals.",5,2018,04,04
207,Pretentious Pretender,"The lobby of The Shelbourne contains a shrine to former guests, including prominent politicians and actors (John Wayne, Grace Kelly, etc.).  With all the trappings of a 5-star hotel, you'd think the rooms and service would be superb.  Wrong.  In our just-completed two-week trip around Ireland -- in which we stayed in 8 hotels purportedly rated 5-star -- this venue was near the bottom.  The room was small, the drains in the tub and sink didn't work, and the hotel restaurant was beyond pretentious (enforcing a dress code, with prices that would embarrass Ruth Chris Steak House, and food that could only be rated as ""edible"").  Having to leave early for the airport, we expected -- incorrectly -- that the lobby would at least have coffee available.  Wrong again.  Other hotels in Ireland prepared breakfasts-to-go and even opened their restaurants early for guests with untimely departures.  This place may once have been ""grand,"" but its standards have slipped into the Motel 6 category.",3,2018,04,03
207,Attention to detail fantastic and staff super friendly ,"Went here with my husband for an Easter Sunday trip: 

Had lunch in bar 27 and were served by the. Most bubbly and friendly staff. Ceases salad delicious and massive and club sandwiches very tasty. 

Had dinner in the saddle resturant and it was delicious excellent service and the truffle fries were so tasty. 

Breakfast was a great the shelbourne pancakes were a treat and every staff member made you feel welcomed and special. 

The rooms was beautiful and spotless clean with everything having that touch of class. 

Really enjoyed our stay! ",5,2018,04,02
207,Disappointing,"Great location, beautiful room.  Overpriced and stuffy.  The staff was mostly friendly.  The maid was persistent on cleaning our room even though there was a 'privacy please' placard on the door.  There were 2 robes in the room, but after the first cleaning, there was only one.  I went to the front desk to notify them not to charge me for a robe that I did not take.  I was asked if I wanted another robe for the room.  I stated 'yes'.  Another robe never appeared.  Tried calling the concierge AND the 'pleasure to serve' phone lines several times, but there was no answer, it kept ringing and ringing.  Same with room service.  They eventually had to be contacted by radio to call my room and take an order.
It is unacceptable this day and age to provide ""free"" internet on an unsecured network.  Marriott makes enough profit and should help keep their guests digitally safe.",3,2018,04,02
207,Very nice,"Really nice hotel.

Staff was universally friendly and helpful. 

Comfortable rooms, both bedroom and public. 

Nice bars, great drinks. 

Classy decor. 

All the meals we had were tasty and satisfying. 

Couldn’t fault the stay to be honest. 

",5,2018,04,02
207,Can’t add anything else....,"....to what others have already said. The hotel is spectacular. Gold/Platinum Elite members get free breakfast. It’s very good. No concierge lounge, but we received two drink vouchers.  What I can say is this: our first night we were in the room for turndown service. I told the attendant that we were fine, and she asked if we wanted water or chocolates. (Never pass up a free chocolate) I said I’d take a still water, and my daughter wanted sparkling. Attendant brought us a bottle of each, a few chocolates, and said good night. EVERY night after that, a still water was on one side of the bed, a sparkling on the other, and two chocolates in each pillow. That is service and attention to detail. ",5,2018,03,31
207,Just have to figure out how to be rich enough to stay here full-time,"My word, what a beautiful hotel and experience. We were upgraded to a junior suite without asking and it was spectacular. We had a beautiful little sitting room with couches and a full bar (with real crystal glasses). A lovely and spacious bathroom, a cedar-lined closet, and a beautiful bedroom with a very comfortable bed. This stay was top-notch. 

The concierge service was efficient and knowledgeable and reliable...they managed to get us a taxi at 0300 when we were leaving for the airport. 

Unfortunately, we were only there for such a short time, so I can't speak on some of the other amenities, but we did have a drink in the smaller of the lounges, and it was quite comfortable. 

Highly recommend this experience for a thoughtful taste of luxurious accommodation in a wonderfully central part of Dublin.",5,2018,03,31
207,Excellent Bar,"I always visit this hotel when I am in town, there is something so exquisite about this place. The bar is a great place to sit and have a drink and people watch. The hotel is very traditional and the staff are extremely professional. Its a must visit, even if its just for a glass of prosecco :)",5,2018,03,31
207,Historic Hotel with Great Location,"The Shelbourne is a classic hotel in the heart of Dublin.  Great service, wonderful room, and quiet location. The Horseshoe Bar is a must visit for friendly service and a great Guinness.  I would highly recommend this hotel when staying in Dublin.  ",5,2018,03,27
207,"Elegant, Beautiful, and cozy","This hotel is a gem.  It is within walking distance of many sites in Dublin and directly across the street for St. Stephens Green Park, which is beautiful!  There are many restaurants and pubs within walking distance as well, so you have lots of options for food.  All of the food we ate at the hotel was very good as well.  The rooms are very comfortable and beautifully decorated.  We had a small maintenance problem and someone was there to fix it within 15 minutes.   Every staff member was kind and helpful.  We had no complaints whatsoever.",5,2018,03,26
207,Celebrating,"Myself and my best friend visited the no.27 bar this month to celebrate her recent engagement. Although the atmosphere was good and the staff were helpful, friendly and very prompt we did leave slightly disappointed by the menu. My friend is lactose intolerant and the variety of dishes available to her were very limited. There was no information provided on the menu meaning the staff were running back and forth to the kitchen to ask which dishes contained dairy. More options and more information would have been helpful.",3,2018,03,25
207,Elegant and lovely,"There is not much left to say, its such a classic and the service is fantastic.  Its a historic property, all the rooms are different and that's what makes it a gem.  The absolute best location in Dublin.",5,2018,03,24
207,Kieran O'Rourke,Food Tasting at the Saddle Room pre wedding. As usual excellent attentive service from a well polished professional team. Food and presentation outstanding with flawless service on a busy Friday afternoon.  Watching the busy Kitchen adds to the feeling that you are part of a wonderful experience. ,5,2018,03,23
207,Excellent as always! ,"Another fabulous stay at the shelbourne! We had a nice room with a very good sized comfortable bed. Our meal in the Saddle Room was excellent, we really enjoyed the beautiful spa facilities and proximity to Grafton St! It never fails to disappoint! ",5,2018,03,20
207,Ireland 2018,"Our visit to Ireland was very enjoyable overall. The weather was still a bit cold. In fact is snowed a couple of times. The people of Ireland are friendly despite the less than stellar weather, however. Dublin was lovely and easy to get around. We were adventurous enough to rent a car. Driving on the opposite side of the road may have proven a challenge, especially in Dublin. Lots of food, lots of pubs, lots of shopping, lots of history. We had the unique experience of enjoying St. Patrick’s day here. Tons of fun. Temple bar was fun and I would recommend the Shack for lunch. The lamb shank and fish and chips were delicious. Took a guided tour to the cliffs of Moher. Breathtaking!  Spent a day in Kilkenny. I wish we’d had longer there. The castle has been nicely restored and the cathedrals are beautiful. Ate at the Marble Bar. Very good.  The Shelbourne is lovely. Very comfortable room and excellent staff. The coffee machine in our room has been a bit maddening but if that’s all I can find to complain about there is obviously not much to complain about. Dublin was well worth the visit. Thank you Ireland. ",5,2018,03,20
207,A classic Dublin Hotel,A classic hotel full of history. Renovated a few yeas back and currently undergoing more interior work in the Lord Mayor's Lounge. The rooms are spacious but perhaps a bit too faux antique. The horseshoe bar is a popular spot although I preferred it 20 years ago for atmosphere to now.,4,2018,03,19
207,Michelle Obama stayed here,"Top of the line hotel located in best part of Dublin.  Close to Trinity College and high end shopping district on Dawson street. You'll meet the upscale guests to Dublin here.Big bucks, but you get what you pay for.  Very close to Marion Square and St. Stephen's Green.",5,2018,03,18
207,Perfection ,"This is an expensive hotel but worth it due to the history, service, and comfort of the rooms. Breakfast is nice too. It’s conveniently located near Grafton Street just across from St. Stephen’s Green, so you’re in the middle of many options for whatever you want in the city.  I will be in Dublin this summer again and will return. I loved it. 

One weird thing is the artwork of Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, and Bono staring at you while you sleep. It seems out of place in an otherwise elegant hotel, but I know the Irish are proud of their local celebrities. I wonder how they decided on these three though!",5,2018,03,18
207,Perfect hotel to chill out in Dublin,"Spent a few nights recently at the hotel on vacation in Dublin. Away from the Temple Bar anarchy, set in front of a small park, this was perfect for me to unwind and relax.
The service of everyone was top notch, the room was comfortable. Being an old building the room size and the bathroom was spacious enough. 
I would definitely recommend this place for a hotel in Dublin. The morning breakfast in the restaurant was delicious, although the buffet gets repetitive after a couple of days, the manager offered me to have the cooks make up anything from the menu or even something thats not on there as I desired. Thats the level of service.
The two hotel bars are top notch. Worth a visit for sure. Unfortunately couldn't enjoy the high tea as that place was being renovated. Probably next time when I visit Dublin.",5,2018,03,18
207,Spectacular,"When you imagine the luxury hotels of time gone by, with the beautiful inlaid decorations, molded pillar crowns, crystal chandeliers, marble flooring and sumptuous bedding. Well you are imagining the Shelbourne Dublin.   

It is among the most beautiful hotels I've stayed in and everywhere you look has something else gorgeous to see. 

The bedroom is absolutely lovely, the bed is so comfortable and the room is generally luxurious. The bathroom is equally luxurious.

The bar was absolutely lovely and served some great drinks and a proper good Irish Coffee. 

The breakfast served was delicious and had a great choice of items on the buffet, even fresh honeycomb, which was amazing. 

The staff are very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. The service they provide is honestly, outstanding. Everyone from the reception, to the doormen, housekeeping, restaurant staff, bar staff and concierge team as well as the staff met during our stay.",5,2018,03,17
207,Whirlwind trip to Dublin.,We stayed here for 2 nights and couldn't be happier! Beautiful hotel with genuinely pleasant staff and nicely appointed rooms with soft pillows and medium soft mattresses. The food is top notch. The Shelbourne hotel has earned every star in it's rating! Would/will love to stay here again in the future!,5,2018,03,16
207,Visit with my daughter ,This is truly an amazing hotel and you can feel the welcome from the time you arrive at the hotel door. It may be a little more expensive than some nearby hotels but you are paying for a premium experience. To be greeted and welcomed so warmly. To avail of a superb room service menu with lighting speed delivery. To be catered to at breakfast like you’re every need really mattered . We had ALI attend us the first morning and he kindly offered us tea with tea leaves. A breakfast experience we won’t forget. The staff here care about your reason for visit and ask you how you enjoyed your event afterward. You are more than just a number in this hotel. You are a valued guest who feels comfortable and welcome from the first check in. This is what we paid a little extra for and will gladly repeat it   ,5,2018,03,12
207,Mesmerizing!,"Proper, old fashioned five start hotel. Amazing service, fabulous room, breakfast to die for and superb bar with a fantastic atmosphere and cocktails. staff on reception could not be more helpful and made our stay a really enjoyable.",5,2018,03,12
207,Well  Known Hotel...Top notch service,"Stayed first night of my Ireland trip. Attentive staff. Rooms are small. Ok my room was small. I am sure that others had bigger rooms. Turn down service...chocolates in room. ..slippers by the bed...do people actually pad around in a 10 ft room in hotel slippers. Hotel has a spa, weight room. Old school cool and opulence. Can get your genealogy researched...don’t know how much it costs. Concierge recommended several good restaurants like “The Bank”. I think the Irish Constitution was signed here. Breakfast was good.Good variety. Parking is stiff.
Think it was 35 euros. Great location. Close to everything.",5,2018,03,12
207,Very well known hotel.,"The first thing you notice as you pull up to the hotel is the very attentive staff. I felt like a queen! Apparently there is good reason for this as this hotel is favored amoung the rich and famous. The even show a video in the lobby of their most notable guests, and there were many! I was particularly entranced by their very old ledgers and books that are krpt in a small museum room. There were two separate bars and both were beautiful. Their restaurant was very comfortable and staff, again, very attentive. The rooms, as is the european norm were small but comfortable. The bathroom was extremely tiny. The location was fantastic for walking to mearby interest points as well as many restsurants. I truly enjoyed my stay and look forward to teturning.",4,2018,03,11
207,Excellent ,This hotel is exquisite! Well deserving of all the 5 stars noted. Helpful and friendly staff members. The bed was so comfy! I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a little luxury during their stay in Dublin,5,2018,03,08
207,City Break,"In all our years coming to Dublin and meeting clients and friends at the Shelbourne we had never stayed there. So much to our delight we received a voucher from a family member at Christmas.
Arrived on a sunny Sunday afternoon and after a little confusion with road works we finally handed out keys over to a very welcoming concierge.
Our room was amazing and we were delighted to be escorted to it by the guest relations manager.
Complimentary chocolates and wine helped.
That evening we ate out with family and had a late drink at the bar, nice atmosphere but we didn’t stay too long.
We had an early appointment so delighted that breakfast was served so early. I’m a big snob when it comes to breakfast and it was amazing! My favourite part was fresh honey. Service both mornings for breakfast was excellent and when I couldn’t choose between French toast and pancakes they offered a mixture 👍
We returned to the hotel Monday afternoon, used the sauna and pool. The gym was impressive and pool was quiet which is always nice.
Later than evening we are in the bar and the service wasn’t great until we complained to our server after waiting over 20 mins after being seated before anyone approached us for a drink/menu but after that they were sent some drinks as an apology.
Overall excellent service and very cosy atmosphere.
Wonderful to experience this beautiful hotel that is filled with such history.",5,2018,03,06
207,Incredible,"We spent 4 nights at The Shelbourne during the ""Beast from the East"" last week. Not only was the hospitality of the staff on full display during this time but the hotel itself served as a great oasis during the storm. From the fitness center and pool to the top notch restaurants and bars to the beautiful rooms, there is no where we would have rather been while the city of Dublin was essentially closed. The free Whiskey and Gin tastings, movies, and constant communication from the staff regarding business and restaurant closures and openings made what could have been a disappointing visit to Dublin much more bearable and worthwhile. Thanks to Leah, Erin, Cian, Dennis, Nicholas, Caoimhe, and everyone else for a wonderful stay last week! I know I'll be back!",5,2018,03,05
207,Stay here!,"Our experience at The Shelbourne was hands down one of the best hotel experiences my wife and I have had to date. From the Bell Captain remembering our names after only one introduction, to the waitstaff in the restaurant seating us at the same table each morning, to the well appointed rooms and incredible location, this hotel is a must. 

Stay here - it's that simple.",5,2018,03,04
207,Great stay,"Gorgeous room. So luxurious and a real treat to stay in, even for one night. The staff are so friendly and  provide great service. So worth it for the experience and it's central location means you're free to wander your surroundings.",5,2018,03,03
207,Unfailing hospitality,"I spent several nights, and days, at the Shelbourne waiting out the “beast from the east” storm.  The facilities are so very nice but more importantly the staff never lost their sense of hospitality and good service.  The front desk and concierge were helpful, the front door staff always managed to find a cab and the restaurant and bar never stopped smiling. It was such a haven during what could have been a long, cold couple of days.",5,2018,03,03
207,The best hotel in Dublin,"If you can afford to stay at the Shelbourne, do it. The costumer service, the location, the concierge and the hotel itself are amazing. It is a very historic building and you see it in every detail, they even have a little museum inside the hotel, where you can find more about the hotel. We stayed for only a night because we want to experience the other hotels in the city as well, but of course, this one is the best. We had dinner at the Saddle Room and it was so tasteful and very first class service, even on our breakfast, you feel like you are a queen!!!",5,2018,02,28
207,WE ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE SURE A GREAT HOTEL IN OUR CITY,I am a regular diner of this great landmark Hotel in the Heart of our city and i always feel so special when i eat there. i was there last week for a lunch function which had 120 people and the food and service was five star.,5,2018,02,27
207,A tremendous option,"I like the Shelbourne hotel in Dublin very much. It’s location is great, and the hotel itself has a classic class to it, but without being stuffy. 

From the doorman to the lobby / reception to the rooms, everything is stylish and classy. The hotel is is great condition and is clearly well looked after. 

Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,02,26
207,Lovely Anniversary Celebrations at the Shelbourne,"Myself and my husband we're at the Shelbourne to mark our wedding anniversary with our daughter and son-in-law. The surroundings, service and the food was first class. I look forward to returning to try the Afternoon Tea very soon.",5,2018,02,25
207,Tea,I bring my mum here every few weeks and it never disappoints. We have tea and scones is the most beautiful surroundings looking out onto Stephens Green. The staff are all so friendly and attentive. We will continue to visit. One of my favourite places! ,5,2018,02,25
207,Just divine ,"Myself and my cousin stayed here on the 19th of Feb . She received a phone call to say all the electricity was cut off in the area and they were working on a generator and so sorry for the inconvenience, we were given an upgrade to a deluxe room and while we had lunch included , they offered evening dinner a la carte instead . I arrived in a taxi and the doorman opened my door and took my overnight case to reception , so friendly and so nice . Reception staff were so informative and so friendly too . Our room was just divine , and the bed heavenly . We had booked a facial at 4 , Jackie from cork looked after me , one of the best facials I have had in a long time , such a lovely friendly girl . Our evening meal in the main restaurant was just spectacular. The food , the service , attention to detail , A meal and experience I won't forget . Breakfast was so nice . The staff in the shelbourne are if not the best at how they treat their guests .Have to commend whoever trains them !!  Our stay in the shelbourne was more than I expected it to be , memorable. Well done to the managers and staff for making us feel so special . ",5,2018,02,21
207,Excellent staff,Stayed at the Shelbourne recently for the first time. The room was extremely comfortable and all staff were outstanding. Somewhat expensive but you get what you pay for..Only disappointment was the breakfast which was quite disappointing.,4,2018,02,21
207,A not so quick cocktail in a nice bar,"Went to the front bar in the Shelbourne for a drink with my sister,brother in law and his brother and fiance before our evening meal yesterday evening. Below is a high level review:

1)Poor service, was waiting close to an hour for one round of drink five drinks.
2)Lack of attention to detail, the drink order was wrong, even after being confirmed by two members of staff.
3)Lack of professionalism,
(a) When the unsatisfactory wait time was highlighted to the member of staff which eventually brought us our drinks the excuse of being unsure of our order was given, which we did not understand as the order was confirmed twice.
(b) After receiving our drinks we immediately noticed that two of the cocktails were served straight up, not as order,  when we asked for ice it was served in an empty pint glass instead of a container more fitting of a 5 star hotel.
4)Overpriced, drinks were beyond overpriced especially considering the wait and difficulty I would expect some sort of acknowledgement that the service being provided was not the normal standard in the form of either a complimentary drink or some sort of discount. Neither was offered. 

All in all, while the hotel is pretty and its quiet enough to have a conversation I wouldn't recommend the bar based on that experience. This was on a quiet Tuesday evening, I would not like to see how the Shelbourne fairs on a weekend.",2,2018,02,21
207,Absolutely Not Five Star Experience,"This was a real disappointment and the complete opposite of what we've experienced before.  In late January, as a treat for my wifes birthday, we booked in for one night.  The room we were given overlooked Kildare Street and was fine except for the bathroom.  At least three of the floor tiles were broken and unsightly.  The button on the toilet was broken and missing the water-saving part.  The remote for the TV was not working and when I called reception, I was told that someone would be up very shortly.  35 minutes later I had to call down again.  I was told someone would be there in 2 or 3 minutes.  It was 10 minutes before anyone showed up. (this is a long time when you are staying only one night)
During our stay we passed through reception 6 or 7 times and only once were we acknowledged (asked how was our day) - that was by the concierge and not the reception staff.  They seemed very interested in conversations among themselves, but not with their guests.  When we've previously stayed here, everyone is usually very friendly in a warm and genuine way.  Not this time.
Breakfast.  We were very disappointed with breakfast.  Whilst the buffet is very well presented, the hot food was on the cold side of luke-warm - not good enough at €35 each.
We did some shopping on Saturday morning and I went to check out whilst my wife went to the room to get our bag.  I advised the lady at reception of this and asked her not to deactivate the door lock.  She assured me this could not happen as it was 11am and the doors only lock after 12 midday. Great.  Guess what?  The lock was deactivated and my wife had to come all the way back to reception.  They gave her a replacement key.  Guess what?  It didn't work either.  This time my wife asked a chamber lady to let her use the phone in a room she was working in.  When she called down, Reception said -
""You need to come down again?""  Seriously?!!  
She didn't...
When I was paying the bill, the receptionist didn't ask whether or not we'd enjoyed ourselves…
I also found the individual who was responsible for retrieving the cars to be quite short and brusk in manner. 
Whilst I was waiting for him I was approached by a nice lady from 'guest relations' and for the first time was asked about our stay. After I relayed the list of disappointments we'd experienced, I was quite interested in her response.  

She nodded sympathetically and said she was sorry and that it was important that guests should always be happy and enjoy their time at the hotel. (I agree!) She insisted on getting me her business card so I could contact her next time we stay...  When I asked her why? she answered: 
""So I can make sure everything runs smoothly...""  
I'm still scratching my head about that. Shouldn't we expect excellent service without making special phone calls? How exactly does this makeup for the poor stay we've had? How does that conversation go?  
""Hi, I'm the guy who complained to you about the sub-par service and experience we had the last time we stayed?""
Surely customer relations is about looking after your guests?

Look, every business has the odd error or problem, we get that and can excuse it.  But when you put yourself up as a 5-star hotel and charge accordingly, there is no excuse for such a litany of mediocrity. The response from guest relations belied an attitude of a hotel that just couldn't be bothered.
Not sure we'll be back for a while, to be honest.  Not sure the Shelbourne will notice or care. 

p.s The three stars rating is because I love this hotel.  It has great historical significance for our family.",3,2018,02,19
207,Just perfect,"Spent 3 nights for my 50th birthday celebrations. Family and friends dinner party was superb in every way. Food fabulous and service exquisite. It was those small finishing personalised touches that made it. Thank you so much to all the staff for making my weekend very special for us all, in particular the Saddle Room management.This hotel is a cut above the rest. Thank you again. We can’t wait to return. Mr Fowler & Ms Hodgman",5,2018,02,18
207,Great location and an amazing place,"Just located comfortably close to everything, is this hotel. Parking is pricey, but if you can find street parking or else pay for the convenience. Just opposite, I could never make it to St. Stephen’s Green because of my schedule. Walkable to Grafton Street and all the action is another plus. The staff was friendly in the historical setting of the hotel, in particular Renata at the front desk. Don’t miss the museum in the reception which showcases the historical setting of the hotel. 
House-keeping staff was efficient and dropped by to take feedback. Makes sense for the hotel staff to bring the luggage, as you could encounter a small flight of stairs on your floor. Breakfast service is as expected for a hotel of this category. The concierge can help you with restaurant and pub choices up until 11 pm.  
My room had a lot of closet space and smelt fresh. My only complaint was I taller than the shower which made a shower slight challenging. The mineral water in glass bottle was a nice touch to avoid plastic.Another plus is the dedicated elevator to the gym and swimming pool. My personal favourite was the firm bed where sleep quality was a perfect ten and a quiet room. The bathroom could use some plug points in an otherwise spacious area.",4,2018,02,18
207,Best hotel in Dublin,"The location of this property is across from St Stephen's Green which is always worth a walk- regardless of the weather.    Rain or shine the beauty of the hotel and the gardens will be a highlight of your trip to Dublin.    Walkable to the Grafton street shopping district is also a plus as are the multiple choices of dining- in and out of the hotel.    The service, food and drink at the Shelbourne are top class.    You won't be disappointed!",5,2018,02,14
207,A visit for lunch and drinks,"I visited here for a lunch booking in the saddle room restaurant (see separate review)

Pre lunch I visited the number 27 bar and restaurant for a drink whilst waiting for my uncle to join me I have to say the surroundings and service was outstanding 

The price of the drinks were reasonable given where you are.

Post Lunch myself and my uncle had a drink in the horseshoe bar which is a stunning quint old bar which is great to have a quite drink with family or friends  ",5,2018,02,13
207,Business Meeting,"We held a small business meeting of about a dozen people. We were very well looked after. The TC equipment worked perfectly and the staff were extremely attentive. The food was excellent. A great venue for business folks, highly recommended ",4,2018,02,13
207,Great Stay,"Was an excellent stay. Service great.  Room fine, standard, could not get a view.  They were able to get us further away from noise in the back.
Bathroom needs outlets, but lots of shelf space, beds comfortable. Could use some charger outlets.
Location great.  Right now doing a little construction, so no tea or sitting areas.  Staff was helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable.
Great stay",5,2018,02,12
207,A wonderful stay!!,"This is our sixth time staying at The Shelbourne and yet again it didn't dissapoint. Our room was stunning and the beds felt like we were sleeping on clouds! Nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff. Three staff members particularly stood out to us. Iain, on front of house is so professional and very efficient. Kinga, was extremely helpful in reservations and Pawell, in The Saddle Room, was extremely knowledgeable of his wines and made us feel so welcome. We can't wait to stay again in our Shelbourne Bubble!!",5,2018,02,11
207,Great hotel that strives to be even greater,"We upgraded on arrival to a room at the front of the hotel overlooking St Stephen's Green. The room was really special and I'd recommend the extra €€ spend if you have it. The soft furnishings and decor of the room were perfect and the bathroom filled with Elemis products and an abundance of towels.
Everything surrounding accommodation was excellent;the quality of room servicing, turn down etc was seamless.
As with almost every hotel, the staff that make or break it. We drank in the resident's bar on the first evening and from first contact there, through to concierge service for table and restaurant ideas, to restaurant staff and room service - all were experts in their chosen field. They were also really pleasant professional people which is something money can't buy.

Not everything was perfect but everything was handled perfectly. If only everywhere learned from this as it can make a sour note turn into a positive.

They are undergoing renovations which makes breakfast a squeeze at different times. They make sure you are feeling okay about what is going on and crucially notice and explain the difficulties and their solutions. The Shelbourne staff feel customer focussed in this way and it makes you feel as though your enjoyment is cared for.
Our TV had a glitch and this was handled in moments - smart TVs have not made it to the Shelbourne and this is their only failing with limited viewing options.

We ate in their Saddle restaurant on one evening - as my mother wanted to enjoy a steak and on a Sunday her options were limited. We rarely eat in house but if you get a chance do so at the Shelbourne, the food was excellent, the Sommelier superb. We also enjoyed room service and it was to a high standard.

We genuinely had an excellent stay and I would recommend it.",5,2018,02,10
207,Rude and Unprofessional Concierge ,"My friends and family recently stayed at the Shelbourne for a weekend to help me celebrate my birthday. On Saturday 3rd Feb I went to the Concierge desk to ask for help contacting a restaurant for lunch. I explained we had been trying to phone the restaurant but it must be busy as they did not answer, we were scheduled to go on an excursion and I asked Alan Grange if he would kindly keep trying as we would be unable to phone. I was absolutely shocked when he replied “well if they’re not answering for you why would you think they would answer for me?”! I looked at him in disbelief and asked could he at least try for us? I gave him my mobile number and asked him to phone me with an update, unsurprisingly given his disgraceful manner he never contacted me at all! The following day after we had checked out and were waiting for our car at the main door we noticed some pieces of rubbish on the floor inside the main entrance and who should come in the door look down directly at the rubbish and walk past it, well it was Alan! Within 2 minutes of this happening another member of staff was passing noticed the rubbish and went out of their way to pick it up. I can honestly say that I found Alan to be incredibly rude, bad mannered and unprofessional especially given he is supposed to be professionally trained in customer service and in one of the main guest facing roles. Also just to note my husband is a Marriott Gold Elite and we would expect more from this hotel.",2,2018,02,10
207,Anniversary present,"We stayed here in January.It was an anniversary present from our sons.It was amazing to stay in such a historic hotel and remember the people who stayed there.They have a lovely small museum beside the reception that details the history of the hotel and all the famous people who visited.
The food was great and the attention to detail was amazing.
The only negative was our room was overlooking an office block and we even got waves from the staff.I would have loved a room overlooking Stephens Green.",5,2018,02,06
207,Fantastic hotel in the city center,"Having no knowledge of Dublin or what hotel to choose, I read the Tripadvisor reviews - and for The Shelbourne they really are correct. The location is perfect, in walking distance to everything, and the room was great. We are coming back!",5,2018,02,04
207,Luxury on the Emerald Isle!,"The Shelbourne is an experience that is well-worth the splurge!  You will enjoy the attention to detail on every level at this historic hotel which boasts many famous guests.  The rooms are appointed beautifully and the beds are supremely comfortable.  

It is located directly across from Stephen's Green and within walking distance to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Trinity College, as well as many other places in Dublin.  

The breakfast buffet is sublime and elegantly presented at The Saddle Room, an elegant, award winning restaurant at the hotel.

Don't miss the best Fish n' Chips in Ireland at No. 27 Bar & Lounge.  Seriously,...this is no joke!  Don't forget High Tea at Lord Mayor's Lounge, and finally be sure to have a cocktail at the Horseshoe Bar.  They make a mean and dirty martini, just the way I like them.  Each of these places at the Shelbourne have their own distinct style and will make your stay feel completely immersed.",5,2018,02,03
207,Best hotel in Dublin,"We checked in on the 15th December for one night and we immediately fell in love with this hotel. From the immaculate service on entering the hotel to the beautiful aroma throughout the hotel we knew we had booked the right hotel for a memorable day. We were offered a complimentary mulled cider on arrival and offered a very reasonable upgrade on our room. We had an amazing room, completely immaculate and very well presented and we simply couldn’t fault the hotel on any grounds. We took a stroll around Ivegah Gardens where I proposed to my girlfriend and made our trip even more memorable in our favourite city! We then went out for dinner and came back to the residents bar for a wide selection of local drinks and stumbled upon Bertha’s Revenge gun which finished off a truly memorable day! Everyone at the hotel was so welcoming and when my fiancé informed the check out team that we got engaged whilst we were staying, she genuinely was over the moon that I chose the Shelbourne to stay at on our first night as an engaged couple. I’m disappointed that I didn’t inform the hotel before I got there as I genuinely feel as though they would have took the time and effort to make it even more memorable for the both of us! We have vowed to return every year to our favourite city to celebrate our engagement and after our experience at this hotel, I can assure you, we will not be staying anywhere but the Shelbourne when we come to Dublin! Thank you for such an amazing experience and for making it such a personal and professional service!",5,2018,02,02
207,"Lovely Hotel, great staff!","Boyfriend and I stayed for 1 night as my birthday present. We have stayed in a few 5 star hotels around Ireland and whilst you cant deny this hotel is fabulous there are a few things that I think let it down.
Whilst it has a spa and pool one thing it is definitely lacking is a Jacuzzi or thermal suite. I would have expected a 5 star hotel to have this facility.
Also for most 5 star hotels you expect a separate bath and shower in the bathroom. Not so in the Shelbourne.
These may seem like small items to nitpick on but the hotel prides itself on being 5 star luxury and items like this leave you slightly disappointed.
In saying that the staff are wonderful and super helpful. Our hairdryer blew the power twice in our room and staff were on hand very quickly to fix it. When we checked out it was mentioned to us about the power and if we were happy with the speed of the issue being rectified. We said yes to which we were asked if we wanted any further resolution. Of course we declined as these things can happen and we were happy with the speed it was fixed, we would never have expected anything more (im assuming they were hinting if we were going to ask for something to be knocked off the bill which I would never dream of for something so minor but pleasantly surprised that they double checked we were happy with the issue being rectified)
We had drinks in the horseshoe bar and lunch in No27, both were fantastic. We also had cocktails in the residents bar up the stairs from the lobby which was lovely, such a nice atmosphere with the fire!
Lovely Hotel? Yes!! Luxurious hotel?? Mmm not so much compared to other 5 star hotels out there.",4,2018,02,01
207,shopping trip,"Stayed here recently for one night. lovely hotel, staff were brilliant especially David  Murphy ( I think ) on reception who was extremely helpful and welcoming.Nothing was too much trouble.
Would definitely stay again",4,2018,01,30
207,One of the best hotels in the world,The shelbourne hotel is one the best I have stayed in.  The rooms are nice and spacious and it is located very close to grafton street which has nice restaurants  and shopping options. The breakfast is absolutely amazing. Worth a stay !!!,5,2018,01,29
207,Girlie nite out,Beautiful renaissance hotel. This hotel is beside a beautiful park and near grafton street for shopping.Very posh bar and residents bar . Lovely staff and drinks were lovely but expensive. We wil return soon. Great girlie nite out in Dublin. Beautiful city. ,5,2018,01,28
207,Over rated ,"Stayed here for 2 nights. 

When I arrived my expectations were very high and I was disappointed .

It was very nice I cannot deny that but I defiantly don’t think it’s worth the money or the 5 stars .

Wouldn’t stay again 
",3,2018,01,27
207,A touch of class in a spacious setting ,"We visited the Saddle restaurant at the Shelbourne hotel in Dublin for a special treat.  We had dined there last year and enjoyed the experience.  This visit did not disappoint.  The hotel is spacious and grand but not intimidating.  Guinness is served on the bar but we started with gin (gunpowder) and tonics.  Then we had the €47 three course meal. The beetroot purée and goat cheese was excellent. Likewise the cod and mushroom purée.  The venison was soft with a hint of cumin. Interesting and not overpowering.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Not cheap but not exorbitant considering the space and imposing architecture.  The white wine, a French Chardonnay, was one of the cheapest at €33 a bottle and the whiskey selection impressive.  Good for a special occasion. ",5,2018,01,25
207,Feeling like you are welcome in every way,"From parking the car for you to checking in with friendly polite efficient staff, a warm welcome as anyone would dream of.
Close to Grafton street and an abundance of restaurants and pubs and museums it is the perfect location to discovering Dublin center, we chose to eat in the hotel's own restaurant which we did not regret: lovely attentive service, food was excellent and not rushed, overall a very relaxing experience, 
the spa was a nice contrast to the busy city activities ,
i cannot think of anything that would have made our stay more enjoyable except that it was too short. But we will be back.",5,2018,01,24
207,"LOCATION, HISTORY and  ELEGANCE!","We spent 4 nights in this lovely hotel.  The Shelbourne is within a short walk to many restaurants, as well as Grafton(the pedestrian) Street, Trinity College and directly across the street from St. Stephen's Green.  The interior of this hotel and its staff exudes elegance and warmth(in true Marriott style!). It was a wonderful respite upon our return from daily excursions around Dublin.",5,2018,01,24
207,Beautiful and Busy in December,"We were at the Shelbourne in December and it was wonderful to pull up to such a beautifully decorated hotel for the holidays.  The location was perfect, easy to walk everywhere and directly across from the park. The lobby area was very busy as were the hotel bars, but once you got past the front desk the hotel was very quiet.  We had a heritage premium hotel room - perfect- the bathroom was huge, bed was very comfortable. We were able to keep the room cool, which is important to us. No view, but also that wasn't expected.  The bartenders were somewhat aloof, and slow. They were busy and didn't seem to care about keeping my husband's beer glass full the way the good bartenders do in the states.  We found a much nicer hotel bar around the corner at the Merrion, better wine too for me.  Go to a pub or somewhere else, or have patience.   We would stay here again.",4,2018,01,22
207,Untrained bar staff,"Went to the main bar here for drinks here on a quiet Friday night 
Ordered our first drink no problem
Nobody came near us when our drinks were finished even though we were trying to get a waiters attention for 15 minutes 
The couple beside us eventually went to the bar to get a drink
We eventually ordered and 20 minutes later no drinks arrived 
Waitress walked past us many times but made no eye contact we eventually ordered with another waiter and were finally served
Then the first drinks we had ordered also arrived !!! We voiced our dismay at the time our order took 
Eventually the drinks were given complimentary 
Other customers joined our table and also gave up on trying to get served
The waiters are clearly college students and not very well trained , not their fault but the management are remiss in putting untrained staff serving in dublin's premier hotel",2,2018,01,21
207,Saturday night treat,Slow check in due to system problems - could have communicated that situation more clearly. Great staff who were always on hand to help. Excellent service and clean spacious room with free with financial sky sports,4,2018,01,21
207,The perfect location!,"The Shelbourne is a beautiful
Hotel property in the perfect location! We could walk to everything. The rooms were spacious.  The hotel staff and service was amazing! Everyone was genuinely so nice and helpful.  The hotel has a great atmosphere with 4 bars to choose from but is still very quiet at the same time.  The food on site was top quality as were the cocktails. Also, I would recommend an appointment at the spa/ salon...again, great service and staff there as well.",5,2018,01,21
207,5 star dining,"Have been here 3 times for dinner and the service is just outstanding.

The layout and decor of the Saddle room is just stunning. Even the linen napkins are just perfect and you almost feel guilty using them.

I went with a vegan friend and they have some brilliant options for her to chose from. Waiting staff are fabulous and very knowledgeable on the wines available. 

The Sunday lunch and pre theatre menus are great value and the truffle fries are divine!",5,2018,01,20
207,Marriott rewards worth the splurge ,This “fancy” classic hotel is worth the splurge of using Marriott Rewards points (point to Euro conversion is great) especially if you stay 5 or more nights you can take advantage of the 5th night free. You will be treated with a classic hotel used by many dignitaries and movie stars and royalty (Princess Grace Kelly). The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The service is excellent. Marriott Gold/platinum members enjoy complimentary full Irish breakfast in the Saddle Room restaurant which is a 29 euro per person benefit. The fitness center and spa are nice too. The hotel is nicely located just north / across the street from Stephens Green and easily walkable to all of Dublin City Centre. ,5,2018,01,16
207,Sunday lunch at The saddle room January 2018,"My daughter booked Sunday lunch for myself my partner and herself yesterday afternoon.We were seated and the waitress came to us right away  with the lunch menu. We said we would like to order wine (wine menu not offered) but she siad she would take the lunch order first , we said we would prefere to order our wine and then give our lunch order. When we had ordered our wine and the young lady brought it to our table she didnt offer if  anyone would like to  taste and in fact without asking us she just poured three glasses. She then proceeded to take the lunch order and said she would start with the gentleman first !! My daughter did tell me that i was old fashioned when we discussed this during lunch and perhaps i am so wont worry too much about that.
Our food was delicious and we could not fault it in any way . We finished with three coffes all different but when they arrived they were all exactly the same and in fact mine was cold but was changed immediately when requested. Now perhaps this young lady was in training and everyone has to start somewhere but really not on a busy Sunday afternoon. Having said that the food was excellent.",4,2018,01,15
207,Lovely hotel,"I recently visited this hotel with my husband. We arrived at 3pm for check in and we had to wait about 10 minutes because of the que. We had booked a deluxe room. Which I am glad of because it was on the small side. The bathroom was nice but the towels supplied were awful poor quality towels and two different shades of grey.
Also I would like to inform people if you book your parking (previous day) off site before your stay it is much cheaper.
Breakfast was very good and great choice for everyone.
Great location and will be back.",4,2018,01,15
207,A Night to Remember,I night away to remember. From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed our stay at The Shelbourne was amazing. We stayed in the Heritage room which was fabulous. Down to every little detail The Shelbounre has got it covered. The Staff in every department are very well presented and trained to the highest standard. Thank you so much for your help in making our stay over the busy Christmas period a stay to remember. We will be back again.,5,2018,01,14
207,Luxury and History together,"My wife and I decided we wanted to stay in the City Centre on our holiday to Dublin so we selected the Shelbourne, this was a wise decision. Although we arrived in the morning, well before our room was ready, the staff was very accommodating. We checked in, our bags were secured, and we were provided with a map of the area so we could find some things to do while we waited on our room. We sat in the Lord Mayor Lounge, a beautiful dining/lounging area while we made our plans for the rest of the morning (in the afternoon this is where you can enjoy high tea). When we returned from our exploring, after lunch, our room was ready and the luggage was already there. This is indicative of the attention to detail we received from the staff. 

After only a couple of days at the hotel we were greeted by name and the concierge was always ready with answers to questions and suggestions for sights and restaurants. Although all of the concierge staff was outstanding, Paul went out of his way to ensure we had a remarkable stay. He was able to get us reservations at restaurants that were fully booked and even once dealt directly with a restaurant where we had a less than stelar experience.

The Shelbourne was also a pivotal location for the Easter Rising and the effort for Irish independence. Only a block away is the Little Dublin Museum and Trinity College is only about a 10 minute walk away. 

When the time approached for us to leave we were informed by the airlines that the airport we would be flying into would be closed due to an approaching hurricane. The airline was able to book us on a flight 4 days later. We spoke with the staff and, although it was last minute, they were able to extend our stay until time for us to fly out. 

Whether you stay for just a couple of days, or do like us, and make it the staging area for your entire holiday, the Shelbourne is certainly the place to stay.",5,2018,01,13
207,Absolutely gorgeous!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here in between Christmas and New year and it was absolutely amazing! From the moment we arrived, the staff were so lovely, especially the valet men out front, they made you feel like you were coming home.
The hotel was decorated for Christmas and was stunning. We stayed on the 4th floor, and our room looked out over St Stephen’s Green. The room had everything we could possibly want, and was comfortable we didn’t wan to leave! 
We had dinner in the Saddle Room restaurant and the food was divine!
I only wish I could stay here every time I came to Dublin!",5,2018,01,13
207,Doesn’t get any better,"We have stayed at the Shelbourne many times, always in January when it’s quiet, and the hotel never ceases to amaze. We like to think of it as our second home (if only!) The service is first class and continues to get even more excellent than during our previous stays. We love the classic interior and appreciate the new Residents’ Lounge on the second floor that is cozy and classy. We do hope they keep the TVs shuttered and wish there was a pulley system so the waiters didn’t have to lug glasses and bottles up the stairs. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the wall paint is peaceful. We always enjoy a good night sleep and relish the full breakfast the next morning. A special thanks to David Murphy at the front desk for promptly and helpfully changing our room after the first night due to a slight odor, maybe of a smoker. We appreciate all who work there and oh, the Salon is delightful. Julio is brilliant with Hair and Sade and Isabelle with nails. One improvement to salon service could make would be not to forget clients who are waiting in the relaxation room on the second floor! Can’t wait to return!",5,2018,01,13
207,Excellent Historic,Historic property on the south side St Stephens Green.  Knowledgeable and helpful staff.  Rooms are clean and everything you’d expect from this level of property.  Worth the money and always hard to leave. ,5,2018,01,12
207,Overnight ,"My wife and I returned to the Shelbourne on a overnight stay , must say as good as ever , food was lovely as was breakfast,  delivered to room following morning . All in all wonderful for the time we spent in the hotel , it's good to treat yourself once in a while ! ",5,2018,01,12
207,"Great location, fabulous hotel",We were traveling from US to Galway and needed to spend one night in Dublin. On advice from a friend we chose the Shelbourne. Perfect.  Staff were excellent.  Location percect for walking to dinner and the bar was very cool.  The only downside was that we did not have time to stay longer.,5,2018,01,11
207,Very disappointed,"I recently stayed at the Shelbourne Dublin (late November early December 2017) with my daughter for a vacation. 

I had been looking forward not only to my first trip to Dublin but also to staying at the Shelbourne; I had heard several positive reviews of the hotel.

While the lobby of the hotel is beautifully appointed, I was disappointed with the general attitudes of some of the front desk staff, as they were relatively unfriendly and somewhat unhelpful with our questions. 

While checking in the receptionist told me I was eligible for an upgrade to a room overlooking St. Stephens Green. Based on my past experiences, when a hotel offers a room upgrade it is free of charge. It was only when I asked if there was an additional cost for the upgrade did she tell me I would be charged an extra €120 per night. This was misleading. I declined the upgrade.

Additionally, the WiFi at the hotel was inconsistent at best; each afternoon and evening when we returned to the hotel we had difficulty logging into the Shelbourne WiFi. Two of the three evenings the WiFi did not work and we were unable to check email etc despite notifying the front desk of our technological issue. Considering the nightly cost of our hotel room, I find this to be unacceptable.

I would, however, like to mention that Sarah (front desk), Alan Grange (Concierge desk), and Pavel (waiter during our breakfasts), were all courteous, friendly, and quite helpful.

I have stayed at Marriott properties in the past and have had favorable experiences and I️ expected the same standards during my stay at the Shelbourne. I was greatly disappointed.

 I  contacted the hotel. I’m still waiting for a response",2,2018,01,10
207,January Break,"Top class from friendly staff, bright, clean room overlooking Dublin to wonderful food.
Very hard to fault anything but if I was to pick something and this is very trivial is that their butter dish at dinner which was a small white ramekin sticks out like a sore thumb compared with the fabulous Royal Daulton. Would definitely be back.",5,2018,01,10
207,Best of the best!,"From being escorted to the Reception on arrival to being greeted by the warmest receptionist ever, my stay between Christmas and New Year was exceptional on every level. It was my first time staying there although I did have my 'debs' (High school prom) there in 1980! The ambience, friendliness of the staff and quality of the food and drink was superb. Thank you for the great stay.",5,2018,01,07
207,FOOD WONDERFUL. MATTHEW EXCELLENT WAITER. DRINK EXPENSIVE...,"We attended a wedding here and having been quoted Euro406 for a room for the night (it was New Year's Eve!), we didn't take the offer! A Gin+Tonic was Euro10, so not much drunk that night! The risotto given for a vegetarian meal was not appetising at all. On the plus side, the steak we had for the dinner was superb (a few more veg would have been great). MATTHEW was excellent- very helpful and professional.. In fairness, it was very busy that evening and all credit is due to the Staff. Overall, a lovely, atmospheric hotel, albeit expensive (to be expected unfortunately) ENJOY!",4,2018,01,06
207,Great nights sleep ,"My priority is always the bed. Most comfortable one we have slept in for some time. Lovely. Quiet at night though central. Well stocked bathroom and made the most of the bath.

We had a couple of drinks in the bar which was lovely. As we had an early ferry we sadly didn’t get to try the breakfast. Next time hopefully.

Attentive friendly staff. 

Thank you! ",5,2018,01,06
207,Vicedirektør,"High Class, traditional and discrete hotel service the good old way with dignity and very polite and friendly service.  Don't expect a cheap deal, rather make good time and prepare for a luxury treat and be prepared to pay.",4,2018,01,05
207,Magical Hotel,"Fantastic hotel, 5 star service from friendly  staff. Great location in the heart of Dublin.  Excellent food. Great atmosphere in the bar. We'll be back . Room to the front of hotel has beautiful views over st Stephens green. Can't fault this hotel",5,2018,01,05
207,Wonderful Experience of a Lifetime,"Being from Dublin I have always wanted to stay in The Shelbourne. We had my father's 50th in the ballroom there years ago and it was a fantastic experience and ever since I wanted to stay there. I was apprehensive that it may not live up to expectations.

We had the pleasure of staying ten nights there over this Christmas period(2017). It should be sufficient to say that we have staye in amazing five star hotels in the US and  Europe and this hotel beats them all. There is nothing we could even give as ""constructive criticism"". Everything about it was perfect.

The whole hotel was decorated in traditional Christmas decorations with fabulous Christmas Trees everywhere. The  staff were amazing, the food was fantastic and just the whole visit was second to none. Our taxi driver on the way in from the airport said ""well, you will have a great time there, they are not the #1 for nothing"".......we could not agree more.

Thank you to the whole team for making our Christmas magical.",5,2018,01,04
207,Just Average,"I have a daughter at Trinity and came from California for a visit. As a special treat, I booked a room at the Shelbourne with big expectations. Honestly, I was disappointed. 
Pros:  Tea room is for house guests only and they have a nice breakfast. Nice drinks at the lively and local bar. 
Cons: Updated but Tiny room and bath. Barely fit the double bed never mind our bags. Afternoon tea was overpriced for mediocre tea compared with other spots in Dublin/Ashford Castle etc. 
I have lived in Dublin the past few months. While I enjoy the occasional drink in the bar, it would not be my first spot for tea or an overnight stay sadly. ",3,2018,01,04
207,One night stay to see “Annie” ,On arrival and meeting Sarah on reception I quickly realized I’d accidentally booked the wrong date and was a week ahead of myself. With my five year old daughter in tow to see Annie the musical I envisaged a nightmare of searching for a other hotel as we’d pre paid and booked the hotel. Sarah phoned her manager and looked after us so eloquently and made our trip to the city more than perfect. Thank you Sarah! The hotel is super central and full of charm on every level. A most memorable trip ,5,2018,01,03
207,Best hotel i’ve ever been,"The service in this hotel is amazing, the quality of the service and food as well, outstanding! Its an old hotel with soul and very welcoming! The location of the hotel is great, everything is there! I would definitely reccommend this hotel always! 
",5,2018,01,02
207,Lovely Engagement Surprise,"My fiance and I got engaged on the morning of new year’s eve in our brand new home. As a surprise we went to the Shelbourne for lunch and drinks later that day. I have to say the staff went out of the way to make our day special. In particular, Sorcha,  a lovely girl working in the bar was so friendly and chatty. She remembered our names and was incredibly attentive. I would highly recommend this hotel for a special occasion. Our engagement was most definitely a day I will never forget!",5,2018,01,02
207,Great hotel right in the middle of everything in Dublin,"(Originally visited on May 2015)

My wife and I really enjoyed the time we spent at this hotel. Our first introduction to this hotel (and the city of Dublin) was the enormous breakfast that we were served. I'm pretty sure I put on a few pounds just looking at the array. The staff was lovely to us once we checked in and throughout our stay there.

What was great about this hotel was the fact that it was central to so many areas. We were literally walking distance from a mall, a park, a college, and a castle. I can't think of many other hotels in major cities where that can be said. That being said, because of the fact that the hotel is resided in such a busy area, the scenery from your hotel window is not the greatest (Be prepared to be staring at the building next door from your window).

Outside of breakfast, my wife and I ate outside of the hotel so unfortunately I can't tell you much about the places to eat in the hotel. I certainly can tell you that the breakfast was splendid.

All in all, this was a great hotel to stay in and is certainly worth a look at if you are planning on visiting Dublin.",5,2018,01,01
207,Shelbourne Hotel,"The Shelbourne Hotel in my opinion is very expensive for the quality of the hotel. The entrance and the ground floor lobby and bars I believe give a false impression. As when you walk in you have the feeling of a very grand hotel. The rooms are incredibly small and if a couple had two carry size luggage you would struggle to find a place to place your bags. When it is mentioned the reception tells you the size of the rooms are mentioned on the web site. This is correct and worth fellow travellers noting because unfortunately when booking I did not notice the very small sq. ft size. As stated the hotel is expensive and now you find to receive a half decent size room you have to pay more. Forget the upgrade you just need the space. 
We ordered breakfast to the room for the next morning as we had to go out early for an event. I ordered a continental breakfast in which I requested toast as one of my choices. When the breakfast arrived I had a slice of brown and white bread. Believe me neither had been near a toaster or grill. 
We had a lovely time after that and the hotel was nice for the weekend but there are better hotels in Dublin that are far less expensive. 

",3,2017,12,31
207,A perfect location with lovey service,"Although the hotel is quite busy at Christmas, it is still a lovely place. The recently opened Resident lounge gives guests a place for a quiet drink away from the crowd. The service is impeccable and the staff is very accommodating. It’s very centrally locates with lots of bars, shops and restaurants within walking distance. ",5,2017,12,30
207,Best Place for Christmas Drinks,"My wife and I called in for some pre dinner Christmas drinks, after getting the train into Dublin, to soak up the festive atmosphere and get into the Christmas Spirit.  The main bar in the hotel was buzzing with couples and larger parties and we found a quiet corner by the window looking out onto Stephens Green to soak it all up and enjoy a few tasty Gins from the extensive drinks menu before reluctantly leaving and heading on to our next stop.  We really enjoyed it and it was a great place to start the night and hopefully will do the same next year.",5,2017,12,30
207,Not 5 Star ,"Very disappointed!! 
The spa is nothing compared to powerscourt or other spas I have been too the spa was a big let down no hot tub the pool was cold.  Room was small 
My main problem with this hotel was the staff the service at breakfast in particular. 
The breakfast was not great the scones were stale, not acceptable for he price your paying.
Will not be returning will stay in the westbury in future.

The guys on the front door who took my car were really chatty and friendly .",2,2017,12,29
207,Top class,Beautiful hotel. Perfect location. The spa is fabulous. Well worth a visit. The staff are friendly and professional. The hotel is a landmark steeped in history. The swimming pool is lovely. Bedrooms are roomy. Shower is great. I can not say enough good things about this hotel.,5,2017,12,29
207,Lunch visit.,Excellent lunch in central Dublin.  Good friendly service and surprisingly good value.  Great pint of Guinness.  The Shelbourne is a Dublin landmark which offers a pleasant retreat from the chaos of the city outside.,5,2017,12,28
207,Warm friendly staff,Staff in general very welcoming and professional. Breakfast buffet was good and tasty. Atmosphere in the hotel generally warm and welcoming unlike other 5 star hotels where it can be sterile. Suites well appointed and comfortable. Enjoyable stay ,4,2017,12,28
207,Great hotel,"I was very happy with my stay.
My room was small but well appointed and quiet.
The swimming pool was kept at a warm temperature and was easy to get to from my room.
I had a light breakfast in the Lord Mayors Lounge which was good and I  was very happy to see that they have decided to bring back flatware that is silverplate. Too many four and five star hotels today are cutting corners with stainless steel which is never acceptable at a luxury property.
",5,2017,12,26
207,Up there with the best!,"Spend a lot of time in hotels around the world. Decided to treat the other half with a night away from the family before Christmas. Even though it’s a 10 minute walk from our home we decided to check in for the night. From the moment we left the car with the valet to checking out today we had a fantastic experience. Conor and his crew in the car couldn’t have made out pre drinks any better. The staff and service in the Saddle Room was second to none and Hannah at the desk at The Lord Mayors Room couldn’t have been more courteous and helpful. Thanks so much for making our Christmas and we will see you again next year.

Well done!

207,"Lovely hotel , requires more staff and areas for hotel residents ","The hotel was lovely, very busy due to the time of year. Requested early check in , didn't get it but that was fine. Room was lovely , nice toiletries. Both bars were packed at night, nowhere to sit for residents , the lounge was for afternoon tea only , didn't realise AFTERNOON tea lasted until 10 at night. The hotel really needs an area residents can sit and drink we had to go sit in our room.

Breakfast was only ok. We were sat in the bar which I think is disgraceful. We had to almost beg for tea and toast , no-one came to serve us at all. The buffet breakfast is sparse and in such a small crowded area, the granola was empty and no bagels for the bagel toaster. 

These were disappointments to the stay. 

I would stay again but I do feel the residents of the hotel come 2nd to the public who use the hotel. ",4,2017,12,23
207,Overrated ,"This is a hotel that’s lucky that it is located where it is. Joined
a small group for lunch and its just so so in terms of quality
and creativity. Service was good and restaurant greeter very
pleasant and helpful. Chef needs to see some new cuisine and as for the Xmas mince pies they definitely come from a supplier
of mass production low quality pie.",3,2017,12,22
207,Elegant setting and a great location,"Was in Dublin for one evening before returning to the U.S.  I loved this place.  They gave me an upgraded room (bonus), the place was lively with people at the holiday season.   The concierge was very helpful.  And the place was a great location for walking everywhere and the bus to airport was just across the street",4,2017,12,21
207,very pleasant,Excellent hotel with great location. I just loved decor of my room and all the amenities. The best part of my stay was breakfast. I had Shelbourne eggs benedict. Great option. I can strongly recommend!,5,2017,12,20
207,Perfect spot to unwind after a busy day of Christmas shopping!,"I travelled up to Dublin recently for a spot of Christmas shopping and decided to drop into the bar in the Shelbourne that evening for a drink. It was my first time to visit and I have to say it really lived up to its reputation. The bar is really lovely but it was packed and we were lucky to grab a table with a view of Stephen's Green. We decided to go for cocktails and although I did find them a little on the pricey side they were really outstanding. The barman, Daira, looked after us really well and was able to make us recommendations when we told him what type of drink we fancied. I tried a Bramble and it was genuinely the nicest one I ever had. 
Overall a really lovely experience. I probably wouldn't visit really regularly as I mentioned it is on the pricey side, but it's lovely for a special treat with friends or for a date. 
Will definitely be back!",5,2017,12,20
207,weekend away,"Arrived Friday and stayed till Sunday. Had an amazing lunch in the number 27 bar. prawn cocktail was beautiful and a lovely steak sandwich. Room was lovely, yes on the small side but its a city centre hotel so just normal. Although it hardly mattered as most of the time was spent downstairs, which is perfect in everyway. Had drinks in horseshoe bar and later in the evening in the front foyer. service was second to none in every area. Breakfast both mornings was lovely, and dinner the second evening for me was amazing having a seafood platter but my wife had fish and chips which was disappointing as it was tasteless. will be back again next year for definite!!",5,2017,12,18
207,Raquel,Popped into The Salon in The Shelbourne and had an Elemis facial with Sade - left leaving with my skin feeling amazing  and had a fab blow dry - great guy called Tiego - highly recommend if you are going out and want to look fabulous. ,5,2017,12,17
207,Disappointing,"Myself and my husband decided to treat ourselves with a stay at the Shelbourne in the run up to Christmas. Unfortunately, we didn't experience what some people would describe as a 5 star experience. We had requested an early check-in and arrived at 1pm. The hotel had been fully booked the night before and so the room wasn't ready which we totally understood. The receptionist recommended a drink in the bar and said that she would phone us when the room was ready - she never did!!! We decided to go to the bar for a drink and also to have some lunch. There was a sign saying to wait to be seated which we did - and waited - and waited! Three different members of staff passed us by and completely ignored us! We got fed up waiting and to be honest, felt a little embarrassed, so we left and ate elsewhere. We checked into out room later on which was clean and tasteful in decor - nothing special. The hotel was so busy that anytime we tried to get a drink it was impossible - not a seat to be had. This is understandable at this busy time of year but as a resident you certainly don't get to enjoy the experience of the Shelbourne. The next morning we went down for breakfast at 8am and the restaurant was nice and quiet. We were seated promptly but nobody came to ask if we wanted tea or coffee. My husband ended up having to leave his hot breakfast and go and find someone to ask for the tea and coffee! Breakfast was nice but again, nothing special. Upon check-out we inspected our bill to see that we were being charged for drinks that we didn't have as well as the cost of the valet for two cars when we only brought one! There was no problem amending the bill when we explained that we were being over-charged. To be fair, the staff were all very friendly and helpful - particularly the front-of-house staff. We paid our bill and we were surprised that we were not asked if we enjoyed our stay or of everything was okay! All in all it was a real disappointment and not somewhere that I would recommend for a luxury break or experience.",3,2017,12,17
207,Christmas shopping in stylr,"While doing our Christmas shopping my husband and I decided to spoil ourselves by staying over night in the Shelbourne and availing of their excellent valet car parking service. 
The Hotel did not disappoint. It delivered on ever level. The staff were top notch, the bedroom though small was perfectly equipped including with a very comfortable bed, the bathroom was cosy but had everything. 
As for the Christmas atmosphere it was everywhere in spades. The tree in the lobby, the stair lined garlands and train set at reception were just some of the delightful details. 
We enjoyed an excellent dinner in the Saddle Room and the next morning breakfast did not disappoint.
Tip: the Saddle Room tends to get very warm, dress for such conditions",5,2017,12,15
207,What a great hotek,"What a great hotel!

Situated right across the street from St Steven’s Green it is wonderfully located. 

From the moment you pull up and the doorman opens the door you really feel like you are on holiday.  They have a wonderful model holiday train right behind reception and the lobby is beautifully decorated. The room was quaint and functional. The bedding and bed were super comfortable. 

We had lunch at the bar and it was terrific. It was crowded and it took a while to get a waiter but once we did the meal came out quickly and was great. We had breakfast every day we were there and it was delicious and had an amazing variety. 

Lastly, but definitely not least, Denis, the concierge. He provided fabulous insight about the city and tips about traveling. He also seemed genuinely interested in us having a great time. Upon checkin our he asked where we were off to. We were going to Galway and he knew the hotel. He had worked there 35 years prior. He called them and made sure they took care of us.  

It was an unforgettable trip with exceptional service and class from everyone at the hotel.  
",5,2017,12,15
207,Special thank you!,"I set up this hotel as the end point on my parents 50th anniversary trip.  They both still work and this was a special time for them to take a break from all the stress and chaos in their everyday lives. I wanted to do something special for them and set up for a cheese and fruit plate to be delivered after they checked in. Ms Fatima Medina, head of guest relations, went above board to make sure their stay was nothing short of perfect.  (I owe her a special shout out as initially my folks said they didn’t receive anything.  I expressed my displeasure to Ms Fatima. I think they were just overwhelmed and finally relaxed.  After some sleep, they sent the picture to me and it was beyond perfect. My sincere apologies to Ms Medina as she had indeed sent them their surprise.)  The hotel and staff went out of their way to make their stay, and end of their trip, perfect.  The location was perfect for the Christmas market and the concert at the national Concert Hall.  Would highly recommend the hotel to anyone that wants a little pampering. ",5,2017,12,14
207,Visit for afternoon tea.,Really great visit.  Cocktails in the Horseshoe Bar (non alcoholic one for the child) followed by a lovely afternoon tea with my nieces.  Looked after by a lovely girl called Roisin who was so nice to my young niece  who was celebrating her birthday. The whole afternoon tea experience is just fantastic  - beautiful rooms and we were treated so well.  For a special occasion it is just so lovely. Well done to all the staff.,5,2017,12,13
207,Worth a visit,"Always drop in for a couple of drinks pre Christmas. Has a had a great make over, and, hey, great tradition. Nice drinks lounge to meet family and friends and a good atmosphere. Problem for our small group, the Guinness is very average and a shame but average Guinness seems to go hand in hand with Hotels in Dublin (my experience) .  Still, good service, a nice place to drop in to and nice clientele.",3,2017,12,13
207,Fabulous hotel ,"I finally got to spend a night in the Shelbourne Hotel on Dublin’s Stephen’s Green. From the minute you enter the door you get the wow factor. The Christmas tree was up, the fire was lit and the atmosphere was buzzing. We relaxed with a glass of wine in the Horseshoe bar while we waited to check in. We got an upgrade on our room which was a lovely surprise. The room was perfect and so comfortable. We had a gorgeous meal in the Saddle Room restaurant and relaxed with cocktails in the residents lounge after. My favourite hotel in Dublin it’s hard to beat.  Staff are very friendly and helpful. ",5,2017,12,13
207,Burling hotel Dublin Ireland,"fabulous hotel the in the city center. The service was excellent, The room outstanding.
with a view of Stephens green 
The service was excellent, 
I am a very bad sleeper the only complaint I would have was my room was noisy",5,2017,12,12
207,Not worth it,"The Shelbourne has spent a lot of money upgrading, and it does show, but the unusually high cost just doesn’t make it worth it. Better accommodations just down the street at the Conrad. More space in the rooms, better bar and better breakfast.  ",2,2017,12,12
207,Exceptional.,"From our arrival to departure this was a highly enjoyable stay.
The hotel is beautiful and the room we had was perfect.
Its extremely comfortable and well looked after.
Breakfast is excellent and very good quality.
Afternoon tea is a real treat and was really nice.
I have to specifically mention a Manager called David Murphy who acted above and beyond the call of duty with regard to a housekeeping issue we had. He was extremely helpful and very understanding.
To stay in the Shelbourne is an experience.",5,2017,12,12
207,"An institution, part of the social scene but expensive.","The Shelbourne Hotel, founded in 1824, is a Dublin institution located opposite to St Stephen's Green and a stone’s throw from Grafton Street. It is steeped in history and is the premier city centre hotel. During the 1916 rising against British occupation the hotel was occupied by British to counter the Irish Citizen Army and Volunteer forces, some of whom had taken up positions in St Stephen's Green. The hotel is very popular for meetings, weddings and other celebrations and is well equipped with classically-designed meeting rooms. Our bedroom was tiny but elegantly appointed with comfortable bed and deluxe amenities. However, beware of the expense - afternoon tea may cost over €40 for snacks and the evening meal tastes great but is rather high. The Horseshoe Bar is part of the Dublin social scene; great for a night cap. The no. 27 bar is famous for its cocktails -  the no. 27 signature drink is recommended.",4,2017,12,12
207,The Shelbourne never disappoints - a lovely Christmas treat,"We stayed in the Shelbourne last night & were not disappointed with our lovely room - we were upgraded to one of the heritage rooms on the 6th floor which looked out on Kildare St - it was very spacious - spotless and had lovely little touches.

The hotel is beautifully decorated and we enjoyed drinking cocktails in the Horse Shoe Bar before dining in a restaurant close by called Hugo's - that was great too !
On our return we had another drink in the room reserved for residents while enjoying the Christmas decorations and Christmas tree.

Breakfast was busy and we initially were seated quite far away from the buffet but were moved closer to it when a table became free. My husband enjoyed a little bit of whiskey on his porridge. There is a good choice of lots of fresh fruit and hot food and pastries / cold meats / smoked salmon and cheese. One thing I could not locate was natural yogurt but maybe I just missed it.

It's always a treat to stay in the Shelbourne especially at Christmas time.
We walked in St. Stephens' Green before our breakfast and enjoyed watching the ducks slip and slide on the frozen water.

We will be back. Happy Christmas to all the wonderful staff !",5,2017,12,11
207,Fantastic Hotel,"Arrived on Sat for an overnight stay to attend Trinity College Dublin Open Day .Its the best address in Ireland and it is worthy .Great Staff, Huge Buzz in the Hotel Fabulous Food and our Suite was 7star congratulations to all will be back soon",5,2017,12,10
207,5 star all the way.,"We stay in the shelbourne every
Christmas & this year one again our stay was spectacular 
Location is fantastic. The ease of pulling up outside the door & not seeing car until departing Sunday at door for us again. 2 minute walk to Grafton Street.
The atmosphere in the hotel is unique. Great buzz. Staff very happy
& attentive 
We only ate breakfast in the hotel as was out most of the time. Breakfast was excellent. Be prepared for a delay  if you like us took advantage of a lie in & last minute arrived for breakfast. We had to wait 10 minutes for a table but coffee was served so not a problem 

",5,2017,12,10
207,The best hotel in Dublin,"We love staying at the Shelbourne. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. From the door staff, to the front desk, concierge, housekeeping, everyone. They go out of their way to be helpful. I got turned around trying to find the spa and asked an employee I happened across on the second floor and she walked me over to make sure I found it (from where we were it was easiest to go outside to get to the spa, I was very turned around). The walk over she and I had a wonderful chat, almost like two friends out for a stroll. 

The rooms are comfy, clean and well appointed. They’ve down several upgrades since we first visited in 2012 but have kept the specialness and history of the hotel. 

The restaurants are wonderful within the hotel, and the serve my favorite Irish cider, Stonewell. 

Great location, easy walking to stores, shops, restaurants and the train station. ",5,2017,12,09
207,Fab relaxed stay,"Came here with hubby and my parents to celebrate my graduation. From the moment we got in we were treated so well. Staff are excellent. Can not fault anything about this hotel. Love the Lord Mayors Lounge. So relaxed when bars were so busy. Breakfast and Dinner were A1

Would highly recommend",5,2017,12,06
207,Spectacular Shelbourne,"The Shelbourne Hotel has been in existence for almost 200 years.  It is located in a great area of Dublin, easy walking distance to Grafton Street and many excellent restaurants and historic attractions.  The hotel itself is truly magnificent from the moment you take your first step from the sidewalk toward the hotel entrance.  The staff is wonderful in every way, accommodating, helpful, kind, gracious.  There is no frenetic scene at checking in or checking out.  Everything is done expeditiously and kindly.  Our room was beautiful, appointed well in every way.  The bathroom was lovely, the bed excellent, and the amenities aplenty.  Afternoon tea, which is expensive, is also a wonderful treat and something to experience at least once.  The breakfast buffet, hot and cold, including wonderful breads and desserts, is amazingly delicious.  I cannot say enough about the care taken in its preparation and presentation.  The hotel truly leaves nothing to be desired in any way.  The concierge with whom we worked most, Alan, was just the best, recommending some excellent places to eat, especially where locals go.  He was a star.  This is a hotel in the grand tradition of great hotels and the staff is clearly devoted to making your stay a wonderful one and a lovely memory.  The Shelbourne is not just a great place to stay in Dublin.  It is a great experience to be there and we are already looking forward to the next time.",5,2017,12,05
207,Morning Coffee,"My wife and I took morning coffee at the Shelbourne Hotel recently. The room was very quiet and we had a seat by the window. We were attended to very quickly by a lovely young lady who took our order. My wife had tea and a scone and I had a decaffeinated coffee and scone as well.  The presentation was wonderful and the scones were warm and delicious. 

The only suggestion that I would make was my wife was given a pot of tea which filled her small cup maybe three times while I only had one small cup of coffee and had to order another.  A small pot of coffee or a refill would have been appreciated.",5,2017,12,05
207,Historical Hotel,"The hotel has a great location in Dublin city. Close to museums, some shopping areas and also old traditional Irish pubs. The hotel is beautiful and service is top notch. 
The front desk is always busy helping guests so you might have to wait for their service.
This hotel is now chain with Marriott so you will be able to do the mobile check in using their app if you do not want to wait....
They have a beautiful bar on the ground floor and local people are also stop by the bar for drinks. This hotel has a great history and they have maintained it's original historical beauty.
Love to walk inside St. Stephen's Green park in the morning. Just across the street from the hotel. Many good restaurants near by. You feel like a princess if you stay at this hotel :)",4,2017,12,03
207,No Introductions Needed!,"Everything about this hotel was first class - from concierge parking , check in, and bag drop. It was a smooth operation. I had the best night's sleep there in recent memory. Bar downstairs was very busy and so was restaurant. Location in the heart of Dublin made walking the CBD very accessible.",4,2017,12,03
207,Celebrating my daughter's 18th birthday in style ,"Our stay in the Shelbourne was exceptional, the customer service from the time we checked in to the time we checked out was impeccable.  We were given a complementary upgrade to a heratige room overlooking St Stephens green & a plate of delicious macaroons & a birthday card was delivered to our room, the chef also brought out an assist of desserts following our meal, my daughter was made feel like a princess, this hotel deserves every one of its 5 stars & more ",5,2017,12,02
207,A bit hit or miss,"I stayed twice with the hotel this week and found it to be a bit hit or miss. My first stay was excellent and one of the best night’s sleep I’ve had in a while. Upon checking in for the second stay I found a number of small issues in my new room compared to my earlier stay. The front desk manager David had maintenance come to my room to resolve the issues and even sent a bottle of wine to apologise - a very nice gesture. However when maintenance was servicing the fan in my heater they must have disconnected the hot water because it was only blowing cold air. After asking the next morning to have it fixed the issue wasn’t resolved when I returned for my last night. 

Overall a nice historic hotel however they are lacking the in-room attention to detail that I expect from the brand.",4,2017,12,02
207,Wedding,"We had our Wedding there this month, all I can say was WOW. Not cheap But You  get what you pay for. Shear class etc. From lads at front door to bar , waiting staff etc . Absolutely class. Cathy our Wedding co ordinator, Mr Byrne who ran Wedding that night, all of them top of their game. Thank you so much. As some of our guests have said, if Carlsberg did weddings them ours was One. So many thanks to all staff at The Shelbourne for making our day so, so special. 👍",5,2017,11,30
207,A great old hotel in a perfect setting,"This hotel, which has been a part of the Dublin landscape for nearly 200 years, continues the traditions of the great old hotels of Europe. Afternoon tea is still an important part of the daily routine, and the restaurant offers excellent food in an elegant setting. Service easily meets the same high standards. Everyone from the valet parking staff to the restaurant wait staff did their best to make us feel at home. The hotel is steeped in history, reaching from the early19th century to the dark days of the Easter Rebellion and beyond. The Irish Constitution was drafted in one of its many rooms. This is  wonderful place to stay, right on St Stephen's Green, close to most of the major sights of the City. Next time you are in Dublin, treat yourself to a stay here. You won't regret it.",5,2017,11,30
207,Thanksgiving in Dublin,We stayed 5 nights in late November for a Thanksgiving Vacation. The hotel was decorated for the Christmas season and looked incredible. The staff was very friendly and the room exceeded expectations. There were even outlets for American Electronics. The location is very central and across from St Stephens Green. ,5,2017,11,28
207,Afternoon Tea,"I organised Afternoon Tea for myself and 4 other Ladies as an alternative baby shower for my Cousin. We had the Festive Afternoon Tea? Which cost €58 per person and your table is provided for 90mins max. Afternoon Tea is served in The Lord Mayor Lounge, which is a cosy room with Piano played in the background (a nice touch). They have a huge selection of Teas to choose from and you can drink as much tea as you want. They also offer various Coffees. Each person recieved a selection of 4 sandwhichs, 2 scones and 4 desserts. All the food was fresh and very tasty. They also provided an extra little Congratulations dessert to my Cousin! Any left over food can be taken away in a nice little box if requested. Although I really enjoyed the experience, I did find it a bit pricey and it is something I would only do again for a very special occasion.",4,2017,11,26
207,Not a 5 star treat,"Definitely not the 5 star treat, booked through a bed-bank but booking was not on record when we arrived - these things happen - but was then told they checked it out and I had booked on a fraudulent website, my money was gone and credit card compromised he even apologised for being the one to have to tell me. Have used the website before so I rang the Dublin number on the voucher and it got sorted, Booking went to wrong hotel.
I would expect a 5 star hotel to be able to resolve these dropped bookings with some professionalism rather than having to alarm guests. They never explained how they checked or came to that conclusion ?
Tried to get a cocktail before dinner but lobby was like Croke park, bar staff lack basic manners, and breakfast I thought we moved way beyond rice crispies, coco pops, all bran, sausage bacon and scrambled eggs precooked and under heat lamps. 

So a birthday 5 star treat turned in to nothing but a hassle and a BIG disappointment - frank & linda fahy",1,2017,11,26
207,Old World Charm,"We stayed only one night in the grand old dame in Dublin. It was lovely, offered an excellent restaurant with good food / service . 
The lobby and front door staff was very good. The location across from a major park was nice/ convenient to many of the top destinations in Dublin are within walking distance.
   As we had an early flight we didn’t have a chance to explore their breakfast or spa . 
    Our room was dated and small for a deluxe room.
     All in all the service and charm made up for the mediocre room.",4,2017,11,24
207,Really good,"But not perfect. I still give it 5 stars. The hotel is historic and lovely. The hotel service is outstanding. 

The room is ok, but the bed was terrific. And the climate control looked very iffy — two old fashioned gold-plated knobs — one marked warmer/colder and the other marked fan hi/low. But it worked really well!

My two complaints were breakfast and the bathroom. Breakfast looked nice, but most of the food was uninspired. Croissant was not soft and flaky, the two cheeses were pedestrian, bagel looked awful. The hot selections were mixed — the pork sausages were yummy, but the bacon was cold and rubbery, and the hash browns were cold and rubbery too. The mushrooms were pretty good. Staff had trouble with the basics — no one came to me for tea or coffee for the first 20 minutes. No one seemed to care whether I was there or not. Nor did I. I did not go back for breakfast day 2, even though it was free. 

The bathroom was the biggest disappointment. The shower was in the bathtub. A very, very narrow bathtub. So narrow that one cannot stand horizontally across the water. I.e., the width of the tub is less than hip distance. The only way to do it is with feet touching. Which defeats some of the purpose of washing the inside of your legs, etc. The water pressure was essentially nonexistent. So there is a big shower head that sends out a very large size (surface area) of water, but very little volume.  So it is more like a dripping fountain than a shower. The shower head not only doesn’t project forward, it is positioned approximately 6 feet off the floor, so unless you are very small you have to bend to get under it. And because of the narrowness of the tub, you are bending sideways. And unable to avoid standing on the drain and inadvertently pushing it down. 

Oh yes, the drains in the bathtub and especially the sink don’t drain very well. Not a huge problem — I’m always leaving behind an icky mess to drain and then clean, but that cleaning is done twice a day and I don’t use either the sink or the shower more frequently than that so not my problem. Same with the toilet, which flushes fine but never quite stops running. Maybe it’s time for some maintenance spending on the bathrooms?

Anyway, these were pet peeves, but overall it’s a nice hotel, and well located. And everyone is so impressed when they hear you’re staying there! I’d recommend it, but it’s not quite works class, and it certainly could be. 

",5,2017,11,24
207,"Fantastic, ticked all the boxes.","When I stay in Dublin, I like to have a central accommodation, The Shelbourne couldn't be more central, and its access to the beautiful St Stephens Green just across the road is a bonus.    Staff are excellent, our check in receptionist was exceptional, pity I don't remember her name.   The door men (yes, as far as I know - all men) are very friendly and accommodating.   There is no snootiness here that you might expect to find. Our room was small but pretty perfect really and had everything you needed for a very comfortable stay.  Turn down service every night included replacement bottles of water.  Our view was of a service yard but we weren't there for the view (this time). The leisure centre which I got to use a few times is perfect.   A good sized swimming pool to do some lengths, a steam room, and sauna.  Children are restricted to certain hours here.   Spotless changing rooms and complimentary towels + toiletries.  There are a number of other rooms in the leisure centre for weights and cardio workouts.   We did not use the Spa, but a peep through the door confirmed its luxury.  Breakfast is buffet and one of the best I've ever seen and eaten.  Think of anything you want for breakfast, and it's there for you.   Silver Service table setting - I just wanted to sit there all day.  Best hotel coffee I've tasted in a long time.   We ate twice in one of the hotel bars called No. 27 and it was bitterly disappointing, but I don't want that experience to detract from the overall experience of the Shelbourne, so I am going to write a separate review of No. 27.    The Horseshoe bar was undergoing some floor maintenance when we were there, so we did not have a chance to check it out. A wonderful treat, and one that will ""cost you"", however sometimes, we are worth it, aren't we?",5,2017,11,23
207,Historically diverse hotel in the centre of Dublin ,"I had always wanted to stay in this hotel and was lucky enough to get a deal to stay. 

The room was small but neat and well furnished. On going refurbishment was a bit off putting.

The breakfast was amazing. I am coeliac and they catered to my every need, even preparing pan cakes.

The staff where wonderful and extremely helpful. I would recommend staying here. ",5,2017,11,22
207,Fab,"Stunning. Exquisite! Romantic and fancy and lovely. 
I think though the hotel bar was really dark and the chairs were uncomfortable and massive and too hard to reach table to your food?! Menu was quite poor also. Only complaint. 
Would really recommend other than that, it was just lovely. The Staff to decor to room to little treats we received as it was our anniversary! 
",5,2017,11,22
207,Beautiful! ,The hotel is absolutely beautiful! The room was quiet and more than we expected. There was a crowded queue when we were checking in- but a staff member made that nice by offering us delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. Attention to details. I’ll stay here on my next visit for sure! ,4,2017,11,21
207,Would never recommend!,"O my...we had such high expectations of this hotel!  It was awful, especially for what they charged!  The walls and ceilings were so thin and old, it felt like an earthquake everytime our fellow residents walked across the floor!  The food at room service was cold and the coffee terrible.  Black mold in the shower stall?!?!  Yes, the bed was comfortable, and there was plenty of  hot water and a terrific bathtub, but, thats why they received two stars, certainly not for the service or the quality of the hotel.  Marriott, get it together! ",2,2017,11,20
207,Mother daughter,I brought my mother here for a night as part of her birthday present. We had a double double room. Dinner in the saddle room & afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors lounge. It was amazing from start to finish. Nothing out of place. Food amazing. Cocktails fantastic. The staff so attentive & eager to help. Will definitely be back ,5,2017,11,19
207,Style and Luxury - awesome,"The Shelbourne is acknowledged as one of the finest hotels on Ireland. It really is, the rooms are well appointed but not untypical of a Centre city hotel , they can be a little on the small side, but lovely.
It is the Bar, lounge and tea room area that set this hotel apart, they are beutiful comfortable and bustling with a great crowd.

The hotel is very centrally located and opposite the st Stephens green.",5,2017,11,18
207,Not a place to start a honeymoon....,"I booked a luxury room in this hotel for the first night of my honeymoon and have to say it is a beautiful hotel and definitely 5 star for quality of room and finishes but this hotel is lucky to get a 1 star rating for customer service and experience. The only way they could have done less is by forgetting my reservation all together. As an afterthought they gave us 3 chocolates perhaps to make up for things but seriously....if you want 5 star treatment avoid this hotel and try one of the other 5 star rated hotels in Dublin. I hope you have better luck than I did. 

Worst of all is I even contacted the hotel a few times previously to make sure they knew it was a very special day for me. The hotel is part of the Marriott group and as such any time you contact them is through a central reservation portal. Issue is they merely pass you around from department to department and nobody actually deals with your queries or even answers your questions. 

If you want true attention to detail find a boutique type hotel and forget about Marriott altogether. 
 
As I say. 5 star for the room and finishes. 1 star for customer service and attention to client needs. Definitely not worth the €€€€’s

207,Disappointed considering the hype,"Just disappointing considering this hotel is hyped up so much i really did not see the fuss, afternoon tea was average;.. I also felt the staff came off very fake and forced in their interactions.....",3,2017,11,11
207,afternoon tea with a friend,"I received a lovely thoughtful gift of afternoon tea for two people at the Shelbourne hotel, Dublin.  I invited my widowed sister-in-law to join me and I rang and booked for Thursday 9th Nov. I got the last available sitting for that day - 12.30.  It was a really lovely event and we enjoyed it very much.  The service was wonderful and the presentation was very professional.  As it was a gift we were not aware of the cost but because my companion enjoyed it so much she was considering it as a possible Christmas gift for two friends who she thought would enjoy the experience, so we asked the young lady who was looking after us what it cost - €49 per person at the moment and scheduled to go up to €58 in the New Year.  We were a bit taken back by this cost.  The food was nice and well presented but it was after all  Afternoon Tea - not a 3 course lunch or an evening meal and €98 for two light snacks is rather excessive.  We enjoyed the experience but we definitely will not be returning.",4,2017,11,11
207,Wonderful Afternoon tea service,"Every friday  I take a long  Lunch and try to slow down as the working week is drawing to an end , This week I was in the shelbourn I had smoked salmon and brown bread and afternoon tea , it was just wonderful to sit by the fire in total peace .",4,2017,11,10
207,"Either very nice, or very noisy, depending on the room","I stayed at The Shelbourne in November 2017 to finish some paperwork after leaving the city (I lived in Dublin for over four years). I chose the hotel because of recommendation from colleagues, and due to a favourable corporate rate. I'm Marriot Gold Elite, though I was not given an upgrade at check-in.

After checking in i was given a room on the sixth floor towards the back (elevators bank to the left of reception) — the room was not particularly large but well curated. Plentiful of power sockets, including US and European sockets, bahtroom with tub, minibar, and two bottles of water (sparkling and still). No coffee machine, but a kettle  Except, after taking a shower and trying to get to sleep, I noticed a terrible humming noise from the outside. After some back and forth with reception and the night manager, it turned out to be an extractor fan from the kitchen, that was meant to be turned off already, but wasn't. In addition to that, someone knocked on, and abruptly opened my door in the morning (before 8am) as I was still sleeping.

Because of these two issues, I was offered a new room at the front of the hotel, looking over St Stephen Green (elevator at the right of reception, not an accessible room, as it includes three steps up and three down). The new room was significantly larger and nicer, with reception space, a bigger desk and bed, a Nespresso machine with a selection of coffees, a larger bathroom with both tub and walk-in shower, and a separate toilet room. This room was much quieter, although neighbouring rooms can be heard if loud.

I could only notice two drawbacks on the nicer room. The first was not having a easy power socket on top of the nightstand, unlike the smaller one, but this is a minimal inconvenience as bad. The more important problem was with the toilet room: this also overlooks St Stephen Green, but the window is not as insulated as the main room's, and particularly with the wind blowing, there's a continuous draft. Given the lack of heating in the small space, going to the bathroom during the night or early in the morning is very cold.

Common positive notes about both rooms were the block-out curtains that made the room comfortably dark even in the morning, and iHome bluetooth speakers on the nightstand, making it easy to listen to podcasts while getting ready in the morning.

WiFi is available and free of charge, though the speed is not quite impressive. No device limit either, since the registration does not connect to a room number or reservation.

The Horseshoe Bar at the lobby level is tiny but quiet, and they make good drinks both with and without alcohol. If you want to use your check-in vouchers you may want to be aware that they discount from the cheapest drink up (which seems a bit silly, since you can just make a separate order for the more expensive drink to use the voucher on).

As for the location within the city, it's impossible to be more central than St Stephen Green. Grafton Street and the shops are on the same side of the park, as is the LUAS (light rail) stop. And effectively everything is walking distance from there.",3,2017,11,10
207,"Great expectations, fell on its face","The hotel itself is nice, slightly dated, but well kept up. The staff friendly and responsive but not helpful. We had an item stolen from our room by the housekeeping staff, medication.This caused quite an ordeal, could not get refilled overseas and sent a two week vacation over Ireland off on a extremely bad pace.",1,2017,11,08
207,Great old hotel and location,"This is my 4th or 5th stay at the Shelbourne. Great place and walk to everything. Grafton Street is a short 3 block away. Tons of restaurants. Walk to Trinity College.

Great lobby bar. Great place for lunch or a Guiness. 

A great choice to stay in Dublin",4,2017,11,07
207,Afternoon tea,Fabulous surroundings in the tea room in Shelbourne. Pianist playing. Service excellent. Food gorgeous. Portions quite small. Thought would be full for the day but hungry shortly after! They had fab spooky themed desserts. Gorgeous but portions small.,4,2017,11,07
207,"Superb Hotel, but expensive rooms! ",This hotel is excellent. Superb customer service. The Saddle bar restaurant is excellent. Go for the theatre dining fixed menu before 1845 for unbeatable value and quality. Just €34 for 3 courses! Wine was €10 a glass though! Room was very good. Not huge but very comfortable bed and very quiet. Small bathroom. Did not justify €315 a night. Book the breakfast on check in to save €10. Well worth the €19 after discount. Excellent location. Walking distance to most attractions. 15mins to Temple Bar. Recommended for a special weekend. ,5,2017,11,05
207,Afternoon Tea in June!,I went for afternoon tea here last June for my little sister's birthday and it was a lovely experience. We were served by Roisin who was very helpful and friendly. The food and tea was delicious. I recommend the cookies and cream flavour tea.,5,2017,11,04
207,Elegant Historic Hotel,"Beautiful historic hotel. Had a room,  overlooking St Stephen's Green, that was simply amazing. The staff was impeccable helpful beyond believe. From keeping the room in readiness for our every comfort to include turning down the bed, to having taxis available as if they reading our minds. I could not recommend a hotel more than the Shelbourne.Dublin.",5,2017,11,04
207,Excellent food in a dirty room!,"i am a platinum member of marriot rewards and i usually stay in Renaissance or marriot hotels because i really like the hotels. however, this time, it was disappointing due to two main reasons:
The first one because when i booked the hotel i requested a double bed (it is also in my preference profile) for me and my partner, but when we checked in, the receptionist assumed that we want two separate beds because we are two girls and she didn't ask or confirm if we wanted double bed or separate beds - bshe assumed we are not a couple - this is the first time it happens to us in a Renaissance or marriot hotel. Whenever we stay for example in the Renaissance Fira Barcelona, they always give us the king bed without even asking or changing to two separate beds.

Secondly, the room was not clean properly to our surprise. I dropped something on the floor so i moved a little bit my bed and under the bed there were two flip flops and a dirty tissue.
The next morning when we checked out we told the reception and instead of apologising or saying that this is not normal in the Shelbourne she said ""ohhh the previous guests must have left it"" - well, we would have expected that the room is properly checked and cleaned and at least and apology from the hotel.

The service for breakfast was very good, but to be honest for a 5* hotel that cost 300 euros per night, I felt the selection of food for breakfast was poor. For fruits they had what any other hotel has and if you wanted a natural juice you need to pay for it. 

It’s a shame about the cleanliness of the room and the fact that the staff in reception is not open minded about same sex couples. And in addition, when we reported the problems, the receptionist didn’t even apologise. Everything else, i.e.: the dinner and the service in the bar was fantastic - but the room and the fact that in reception they assumed two girls cannot be a couple was very disappointing.",2,2017,11,04
207,Mediocre ,"I've always visited the Shelbourne while in Dublin. Last weekend I had a guest artist visiting for a show & brought him for cocktails here. The bar staff were friendly but the atmosphere was seriously lacking in the main bar. 
The deciding factor on our departure to The Westbury Hotel was the door staff! They were incredibly rude when we went out for a cigarette and treated us so disrespectfully that we got the first available taxi and left!",3,2017,11,03
207,Very Disappointing Visit,"We stayed in The Shelbourne the end of October for my parents in-law 50th Wedding Anniversary, there were 10 adults in total.. We had booked 5 double rooms b&b and an evening meal... The hotel can't be faulted on appearance, service & staff, it was excellent from start to finish but our evening was just about adequate & so disappointing... My soup was ""warm"", not hot but ""warm & the same with anyone else that got soup... I had lamb for main course & my 3 year old would have eaten more & again it was ""warm"", my husband got the fish & it was equivalent to 1 fish finger... We didn't get any vegetables & the was just 3 bowls if boiled potatoes put on the table..my lemon posset was not edible, awful... Y didn't I complain?? Well it was a family occasion & I didn't want to be causing a scene... 
We all quickly left & we to the bar where we all came to the conclusion that not one of us enjoyed the meal & we were very disappointed we were so looking forward to a nice evening but it wasn't... Would stay in the hotel again but would definitely not eat there... 3* rating for food...   ",3,2017,11,02
207,The warmest welcome,"We stayed at the shelbourne for 2 nights recently as a special treat, the hotel was beautiful  and afternoon tea to die for however it is beyond a shadow of a doubt that Lauren the sweet bubbly girl on reception was exceptional she went out of her way to infect us with her contagious smile. We will most definitely be returning in the very near future.",5,2017,11,02
207,5 star luxury at its best,"I’ve always wanted to stay in the Shelbourne ( coming from a hotel background) and more recently seeing the RTÉ documentary. 
Having 3 kids one of which is autistic myself and my husband don’t get much alone time together so we really looked forward to this little retreat away.
Shelbourne certainly didn’t disappoint.
Our room Michael Collins was spectacular and a real treat. 
Service was top class along with hospitality and staff Shelbourne knows how to please.
I can’t wait to return again in the new year",5,2017,11,01
207,Afternoon Tea,"The Shelbourne Hotel is always worth a visit. The ambiance is truly fabulous. 
We had afternoon tea as a special treat and throughly enjoyed the whole experience. The food was delicious and beautifully crafted and the service excellent. 
Lots of sweet treats but the savouries really were my favourite. I’d have loved more savoury bites so that was the only issue I had. We bought the cakes home and so continued to enjoy the experience long after we had left. ",4,2017,10,31
207,"Nice, but underwhelmed. ","I live in Dublin and the shelbourne has always been one of those hotels that I’ve always revered as being “THE place to stay”. Opulent with a central location. Last year’s show On RTE made this hotel out to be luxury personified. 
So after not getting away anywhere for a long while, I had thought this would be the perfect getaway for myself and my husband. We checked in, and front of house were lovely, we arrived into our room and I had been looking forward to soaking in the bath, but there was no bath!! So we rang reception and requested a different room with a bath, they were accommodating and sent the bell boy with our new room keys. The room was similar in decor but there were little things which let it down. The view was terrible(I get that upgrades are available and the more expensive rooms are to the front but not what you have in mind for the shelbourne) the bathroom was small, the bed was comfortable, but the room had too much furniture in it for the size which made it feel smaller. You had to step over the footstool to get around the end of the bed. The locker handles were also broken and the mirror was offset on the dresser table (little detail I know but when you sit down and want to do your makeup/dry your hair and you can’t even see the mirror because it’s too high on the wall- I’m not small either 5’6) 
Our package included a dinner in the saddle room which didn’t have available dining until 9.30. This was too late to be eating so we requested to eat in the bar & lounge instead. The food was GORGEOUS. Honestly couldn’t fault it, flavours were lovely. However, it became apparent that they were significantly short staffed. We were seated at 7 and by the time someone came to take out order it was 7.30, the starters arrived but the bread for the soup was forgotten and we had to get up to get someone’s attention. They apologised and brought it over. The mains came out about 40mims later. Which was fine we were happy to soak up the atmosphere, the plates took a long time to be cleared (a pet peeve of mine) we finally got the waitress attention and she gave us the dessert menu and we ordered and waited and waited and waited, after 30 mins it was apparent that it had been forgotten about , so we called the waitress over after battling trying to get her attention. She apologised and said someone called In sick and I felt for her as she was managing about 16 tables by herself, but they needed back up and it just let the evening down. 
The Spa treatments were amazing and so relaxing with lovely therapists. Would definitely return for salon treatments. 
The breakfast the next morning was gorgeous. Totally worth it and the buffet and cooked food were all excellent. The staff were good also. 
Overall the food and spa were all excellent, but it would not be somewhere I would recommend for a “luxury” getaway. Unless you have the big bucks to fork out for a suite!
I feel other Dublin hotels may have more to offer in the deluxe rooms. 
The total cost of our one night stay was €399.

207,Wonderful location and building ,"Stayed for one night in a deluxe king room and we had dinner, bed and breakfast.  The room was beautifully decorated and luxurious but as others have said not that big and the bathroom was quite small.  The service at dinner was outstanding and the food very well presented and tasty.  Breakfast was very busy and the area where the continental was said out was quite cramped.  The food was very good quality and there was lots of choice.  As it was busy we were seated in the bar which was more relaxing than the restaurant.  staff overall were exceptional but I felt that compared to other times when I have visited that they seemed to be under more pressure than on previous visits this was maybe due to the bank holiday weekend.  overall a very pleasant stay.

207,Five star hotel that deserves six stars!,"What a magnificent hotel! Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated, the bathroom as large and attractive as some hotel rooms.

207,Elegant Historical Hotel in a Perfect Location,"Everything about this hotel is perfection.  The rooms are spacious, well decorated and very comfortable.  The hotel staff are all professional, friendly and very helpful.  Breakfast was delicious and the hotel bars are a great place to relax and have a delicious drink.  Try the Restoration drink, not only is it pretty, it is really delicious! Last, the location is great! We will definitely choose to stay at The Shelbourne our next visit to Dublin!",5,2017,10,29
207,Above Expectations,"On arrival you are greeted and welcomed like you live there.  The location, service and hospitality are at the highest level.  This was recommended by our travel agent and was well worth it.  The room was what we expected, smaller but very nice with all the comforts.  Not much else except we really enjoyed our days and hated to leave.",5,2017,10,29
207,Excellent in every way,"This is without a doubt one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The room was luxurious, the breakfast was superb, the bars were ideal for a late whiskey. Above all the staff were incredibly helpful and simply first class.",5,2017,10,28
207,Excellent stay at The Shelbourne,"We spent a Friday night at The Shelbourne and were treated to a 5 star service all the way. The room that we stayed in was beautiful with excellent facilities. We enjoyed lunch, spa services and dinner - all really top quality. A special mention to Sean McGoldrick, the bar manager who was exceptionally helpful and friendly to us. Sean's welcoming and warm manner created a lovely atmosphere in the bar. A true professional!",5,2017,10,28
207,Five Star all the Way,"Spent three nights here and it was all wonderful.  The room was large, with an excellent size bath and the location was wonderful.  We walked everywhere.  The horseshoe bar is quaint and was fairly quiet the few nights we popped in.  If you can splurge - go for it.  It's a real classic hotel with excellent service.",5,2017,10,27
207,Thee place to stay in Dublin!,"We had a lovely room, decorated with thought and relaxation in mind. There is a comfortable lounging chair, a desk chair and a long upholstered bench at the end of the bed. The bedding and pillows are luxurious and I must offer kudos to Housekeeping as they did a superlative tidying up job. We were quite close to the spa elevator making it simple to hop downstairs for a swim. The team of people working in this hotel are well trained dealing with guests and their needs. We loved the location of the hotel. Dublin is a walkable city and much is at your fingertips from this very charming, old world, yet modern hotel. Do stay here if you want to experience the best of Dublin, restaurants and comfort, and peace and quiet.",5,2017,10,27
207,Excellent Marriott property in the heart of Dublin (but you wouldn't know it),"Great room, felt like an older 'classic' hotel but has been updated.  The flowers in the lobby are nicely done and change daily.  Rooms were not huge, but not small either.  Nice location on the park. Staff was very friendly and accommodating!",5,2017,10,26
207,Transported to Downton Abbey,"My wife and I just returned from Ireland where we spent 5 nights at the Shelbourne.  We were treated like royalty - hence the Downton Abbey reference.  In any event, it is a much updated version.  Our junior suite was perfect, the food at the Saddle Room was excellent, and the No. 27 Bar was an exciting experience.  Great location for site-seeing.  Overall terrific experience - my wife wants to move in permanently.",5,2017,10,26
207,Wonderful hotel.,"We began a 10 day visit to Ireland with 3 nights at the Shelbourne in Dublin. It was fabulous. The hotel is lovely, excellently maintained and historic. The location could not be any better. The staff were all welcoming, friendly and highly competent. Can't wait to return.",5,2017,10,24
207,I highly recommend the Shelbourne,"A month before leaving on a trip to Dublin with my parents (in their mid-eighties) my mother's knee went out and I knew we would need to rely heavily on the staff at the hotel for help. The Shelbourne arranged for a wheelchair and was helpful on all aspects of our stay in Dublin. They were able to arrange a last minute driver to take us around the city on a Sunday and made sure that we were able to get in the Book of Kells with a wheelchair. Hurricane Ophelia hit while we were staying there and the city as well as the country was shutdown. They took excellent care of the guests, kept all of us updated on the storm via a letter delivered to each room as well as postings in the lobby, and provided two dining options for dinner.  The concierge (Dennis, Paul, and Keith) were helpful at all times as was the front desk staff. I cannot say enough great things!",5,2017,10,23
207,Old School Charm in a Perfect Location,"We started our Ireland vacation on a high note by staying at the Shelbourne.  This beautiful, historic hotel is perfectly located. We walked from here to Saint Stephen’s Green, Grafton St., Temple bar, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, and Saint Patrick’s Cathedral.  We also walked to the National Archaeology Museum and the National Art Gallery, both of which are right next door.  My husband says the Shelbourne’s No. 27 Bar & Lounge served the best fish & chips on our trip. Solid breakfast included with our room.",5,2017,10,22
207,Beautiful Hotel in Heart of Dublin,"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of small group tour. Wish we could have stayed longer - such a wonderful hotel! The room had a king bed with a great mattress. The bathroom was large with a big wide counter and large shower. The rain shower head made you not want to get out of the shower. Bath had all amenities and big fluffy towels. There were lots of shelf space and drawers and a safe in the room. The desk had excellent lighting. Refrigerator in room and complimentary water. Hotel staff so attentive and helpful. Lobby area, lounge for tea and restaurant just lovely - had excellent breakfasts there. Concierge provided good recomendations for dinner. Can walk outside hotel to many eating places and beautiful park across the street. Walking or taxis can take you to the sites.",5,2017,10,22
207,Historic Hotel in Dublin,"Beautiful hotel with excellent service. The rooms are spacious we had a room with 2 queen beds,nice bath and robes.Turn down service everynight with chocolate's. Afternoon tea,amazing breakfast.The bar area is very nice had lunch which was good. The location is perfect for central Dublin right across from St.Stephens Green. ",5,2017,10,22
207,"Immaculate, world-class luxury from a bygone era","I should mention straight off that we were upgraded to a junior suite. I’m getting that out of the way before I gush. The Shelbourne was everything an upmarket hotel should be. The staff were helpful and solicitous. The lounge offered afternoon tea but insisted on a dress code, which is absolutely right in order to instill the sense of occasion.

Our room was immaculate, overlooking St Stephen’s Green, totally quiet (admittedly I had to reposition the crystal wine and water glasses to stop them from chinking), two gloriously comfortable queen sized beds, supplied with plenty of power sockets and cabinet space. The Shelbourne felt luxurious, and more than lived up to its storied history and name. Exemplary.

We finished our evening in the hotel’s elegant Horseshoe Bar, where Matthew the barman educated us on the many new varieties of Irish gin. His martinis were executed perfectly (and on this, we have some form). The prices were fairly eyewatering, but not unexpected in such a place. We met three delightful folk from LA and their local companion, and it was only the knowledge of an early wake up call that stopped us enjoying the craic later into the night.",5,2017,10,21
207,Dublin Refined,"My niece and I stayed at the Shelbourne one night capping off our week in Ireland and what a night it was!  We were met at the door by a distinguished gentleman who brought our bags in for us; we were assisted at check in by Claire (who was a delight!) and on our way to checkin, a young lady assisted us in making reservations for high tea that afternoon.  To say you're pampered from the time you walk in until you leave is an understatement!  

When we went up to our room, we found it very well appointed; the beds comfortable and the bathroom outfitted with luxurious bath amenities. Later in the evening, we ordered room service and again, were not disappointed with a thing!!

If you do stay at the Shelbourne do indulge in their high tea, we were advised that we'd be there 90 minutes and in that 90 minutes, we had scrumptious finger sandwiches, topped of with delicious deserts and the tea, well, the variety was amazing, the service impeccable and the people very friendly! 
 
In many high end hotels there is a tendency at times to make one feel as if they don't belong but at this property, as a guest, you are treated with the utmost respect and welcomed with open arms; there is no ""status checking"" with the people who take care of their guests!  So, if you're in Dublin and you want to treat yourself to pure luxury, stay at the Shelbourne, it is worth every penny!!",5,2017,10,21
207,Best Service in Dublin!,"This hotel has great amenities. The restaurants and bars are fantastic and the hotel has a lot of charm. However, what makes this hotel stand out in my opinion is the service. I stay often at many 5 star hotels globally so I am very familiar with high service standards and can confidently say that The Shelbourne sets the bar high. I have had great interactions with much of the staff and it is obvious management here trains people well and that the staff genuinely like what they do. Several people were so great I need to mention them by name. I have been at this hotel for a week and the third day of my stay the hurricane hit. Due to the heavy winds outside exhaust smoke was blowing back toward the building and made my room smell like smoke. The assistant front office manager David Murphy helped me temporarily move rooms that night and then the following day helped me get back to a better room. Obviously the hotel can't control weather but David was fantastic at making a frustrating situation manageable. He really went above and beyond to help me and it was very appreciated. Another person that stood out was Shannon Cullen from Guest Relations. She went above and beyond to genuinely make sure my stay was perfect. The third person that stuck out was a lady named Eimear who worked in the Lord Mayor's Lounge. She had great drink recommendations and gave some fascinating info on some of the artwork. What really impressed us was seeing her go to each table and spend time chatting with everyone, including a little girl at one table that she sat and interacted with for a while. It looked to have made that girls day.  I rotate between several of the best hotels when I come to Dublin for business but from now on I will only book here. Cant wait for my return visit in November. Keep up the great work Shelbourne!",5,2017,10,20
207,LOVED IT!,"Our family of four loved the Shelbourne Hotel!  We thought it was stately, beautiful and so grand.  Our room was a bit small for a family of four, but very nice.  We loved the location, so close to Trinity College and Grafton St.  The food was delicious and the service was impeccable!  I had a massage at the spa and it was heavenly after traveling such a long way!  The kids had the best time for hours in their pool and it was just a wonderful way to kick off our trip in Ireland!  I recommend it for a night, do a bit of sight seeing and then get out of Dublin!  Go to the country and see the beauty of this amazing Emerald Isle!  Highly recommend this property!",5,2017,10,20

We were able to walk from here to almost every place we wanted to go - and a hop-on hop-off bus was located just actors the street. Our room was smallish but well-appointed.

We spent three luscious nights here and never wanted to leave.  First class service, first class rooms, first class everything.

207,Irish Charm,"My husband and I stayed for 5 wonderful days. Our bed was incredibly comfortable and entire staff especially housekeeping were always friendly and I adored the woman who did the evening turndown service. She knew I loved chocolate and always left me extra chocolate. It’s the little things that go a long way and it all added up to 5 stars. I rarely give 5 stars. But the final reason for 5 stars is that on our departure date I was ill. Checkout time was 11:00. When I inquired if I could extend it not only did they happily say yes but offered to call me a doctor. It meant a lot. When finally checking out I expected to be charged extra for the extended time in the room as it clearly states in hotel information book that 10€ per hour is charged for extension, but they didn’t charge us. Blew me away as I know my staying longer impacted cleaning the room for next guest and the hotel was booked up.

Looking forward to returning. ",5,2017,10,17
207,Beautiful hotel and fantastic service,"What a beautiful and historic hotel! I absolutely loved my stay, the hotel rooms are classic and the staff is amazing.

207,First class in every way ,"We were caught here in a hurricane. The hotel staff were thoroughly prepared and could not have been more thoughtful! Buffet meals saw us through.

This hotel is not looking out for their customers and their safety, only interested in making money.

207,Top Hotel with lots of history ,"This is an iconic hotel with a central role in the history of Dublin. The Irish constitution was signed here and the British Army used the hotel as a base during the 1916 Easter uprising. It’s expensive but exclusive. There’s a small museum in reception which is worth a visit.

207,Excellent Servies,"We stayed at the Shelbourne on Oct 14-16 2017 during our trip to Europe. We arrived early in the morning from Chicago and get to hotel about noon.  Our girls were super tired from the flight and the jet lag but the room was not quite ready yet.  However, the manager Kris saw the situation and quickly found an upgrade for us. We are the platinum member and was given a gorgeous room.  The girls get settled in and not cranky any more.  We had an excellent start for this Europe trip. ALL thanks to KRIS! 

The room is clean and charming with a lot of character. The bed is large enough to accommodate our family of four.  The bed is firm and very comfortable. We had breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner at the hotel at different days and found the food quality is excellent. 

We are very pleased with our stay here and booked another night here for our return trip. We highly recommend this hotel for others.",5,2017,10,15
207,"Excellent hotel, with extraordinary service","We stayed at the Shelbourne on Sept 5th & 6th 2017. The room was very nice, very clean, with an extremely comfortable bed.  All employees we encountered were very friendly, and absolutely dedicated to customer service.  The concierge was very helpful with finding an excellent local restaurant.  The really key thing for us was the excellent customer service we received concerning an item left in the room.  I left an IPOD and very nice Bose headphones in the room, which fortunately the guest that followed us turned in to security.  By the time I realized it was absent from my luggage, we were on the other side of Ireland.  The Shelbourne's security chief could not immediately find them when I called. However, he located them within 5 minutes, and called me back.  As we were not in a position to return to the hotel, he shipped to my house.  What really sets this hotel and the folks they employ apart from most is there absolute willingness to followup, and willingness to ship it to me.",5,2017,10,14
207,Afternoon Tea ,"I went for afternoon tea with my family, we had a brilliant experience! Our waitress Roisin was so friendly and helpful and also so patient and kind to my elderly grandmother. The food was delicious and music was beautiful!! I will definitely be returning soon. ",5,2017,10,14
207,STILL THE BEST IN MY MIND,"Apparently I mixed up my ratings in a previous post.  I marked low when I meant high.

We have been going to the Shelbourne Hotel for years.  After a long flight from the west coast [US], we use this hotel to relax for a few days to get over jet lag on our European vacations.

I have been waiting and anticipating the service to decline.  It never does.  I do not know how they do it.",5,2017,10,13
207,Drinks And Food at a nice place,Wonderful Stay. The staff is very friendly.The bar is a very nice place to have drinks. The bar area is a little crowded but worth it. Such a nice and classy lounge. The drinks were prepared the way i wanted.,5,2017,10,13
207,Slightly dissapointed. ,"I stayed here on business recently and I was disappointed with the experience. The reception staff were very friendly and certainly made you feel welcome. However when I got to my room it was very dissapointing. The decor was old , the view from the window was a wall about two foot away and there was constant noise in the room.  The bed was very comfortable and the TV had great reception. I booked it thru Booking.Com and perhaps that was why I got such a room but it certainly wasn't going to encourage me to return. The food was good but I didn't find the bar staff at all friendly. The ambience was very dark and again I'd say quite dated. Overall I didn't find it a very pleasant experience and it certainly wasnt value for money at all. ",3,2017,10,13
207,Fabulous Service and Great Location,"We stayed here as part of a group. Rooms were marvelously comfortable and decorated. Service in the restaurant, bar and check-in was perfect. Breakfast was outstanding offering a generous buffet as well as a menu. Lunch in the restaurant was also excellent. Everyone who works in this hotel goes above and behind. Located across from St. Stephen's Green enables easy walks to tourist attractions. Highly recommended.",5,2017,10,12
207,It’s all in the detail!,"Quite simply the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in, again. From Lauren at reception who gave us the warmest and most genuine welcome to every other member of staff, be it at the bar or breakfast. Amazing room, and the whole place just oozes class. Good value considering the service",5,2017,10,10
207,Did not want to leave,"This is a hotel that has a lot to live up to and it does. Every member of staff was professional and polite, especially the front desk.  Checked in smoothly and as a platinum member I was treated to an upgrade.  I travel a lot and never take photographs of my room, but this was very special so I had to make my wife envious. However it has now cost me another trip this time accompanied and looking forward to it. ",5,2017,10,09
207,Afternoon tea perfection 🥂,"I was given a voucher for 'Afternoon Tea for 2' by my brother for my birthday. Unfortunately we hadn't the chance to use it so we asked could the expired date be extended. We were delighted that they could extend it by 3 months. 
Our booking was for 4:15. We got dressed up for the occasion as this is a special venue and place. We were not disappointed and loved our experience from start to finish. A lovey helpful girl guided us through the menu and offered to take a photo of us. We were seated in the centre of the room which was perfect. It was a full seating but felt really intimate. We had flagged the restaurant beforehand that I have an allergy to tomatoes. The food was glorious which was set off by the grandeur of the room. The whole experience is about 2 hours long and the live piano music the corner was the icing on the cake. Takeaway boxes are provided if you can't finish your food. 
Highly recommend as a gift idea for Xmas or any special occasion. Hope I get the opportunity to return on more regular occasions 😊",5,2017,10,09
207,disappointing,"This was very disappointing - was expecting more. The location is very good, right close to the center, but not too close to be noisy, the rooms were fine, albeit a little tired and small, but service was shocking, room service a nightmare, very poor, and the bars and foyer area always seemed to be packed. the best bit is the breakfast - this was well done, however overall not a nice experience for the considerable prices",3,2017,10,09
207,lovely evening at the shelborne hotel,"great food great fun and a good night at the shelborne hotel on Thursday night for the Alexandra schools send. there was great band that all the young people were at. We had lovely smoked salmon followed by delious fillet steak and four tastes of different deserts. 

great service and very tasty good very high quality for a large group of people.

nothing was too much trouble.

thanks",4,2017,10,08
207,Excellent (except front desk experiences),"We enjoyed a superlative two-night stay at The Shelburne Dublin Hotel.  Probably Dublin's most excellent 4/5-star hotel, we were treated well, enjoyed a large, luxurious King room, and experienced excellent food and beverage.

Platinum status garnered us the room upgrade - larger room but not a good view - and a couple of complimentary breakfasts.  I've never seen a hotel with so many junior managers scurrying around the lobby.  Not sure whether that's good or not good; just seemed manager-heavy with no noticeable effect.

We enjoyed excellent cocktail service in #27 Bar and Lounge both evenings, and an equally fine breakfast experience in The Saddle Room both mornings.  Bellman, Concierge and Doorman services were also exemplary.

Our only complaint, not insignificant, was with undertrained and underwhelming front desk staff and services.  The check-in process was an abomination.  Training and truthfulness would both go a long way to correct the deficiencies.  Staff is also woefully inept at converting currency.

Front desk aside, the experience was very good overall, we would definitely return, and we comfortably recommend The Shelburne to all discriminating travelers.",4,2017,10,08
207,Room fit for a leprechaun!,Well the excitement of returning to the Shelbourne was quickly extinguished. Our third visit in 18 months a birthday treat for my wife & first wedding anniversary treat also. Room not ready til gone 3pm & then the size. Was asked for our phone number & was told would ring when room ready but received no call collected keys gone 3.30. Would describe as a single & will never book a queen room at the Shelbourne again. Too tight for 2 cases decent shower but toilet & sink farcical. Sink was a small bowl & wouldn't drain so had to take plug out whenever we used it. Not for someone who is slightly claustrophobic or asthmatic or has had heart trouble & im afraid that's me having suffered 4 major heart attacks recently. Ordered 2 rums in the saddle bar & was offered drinks in 2 half pint tumblers - no whiskey glasses. Will add however that Conor the bar manager was very apologetic & handled situation well & gave us a glass of champagne on the house & his conduct restored some sanity. We did point out when we booked in that we were celebrating our first wedding anniversary- having spent our life's savings entertaining 150 guests at their sister hotel in Powerscourt only a year ago. Three measly chocolates were sent to the room with the words congratulations??? Have now gone off the Marriott group & wont book again. Would strongly advise against anyone booking a queen room too. Have praised this hotel previously on this site but feel the policy is now just to squeeze as many people in as they can. And forgot to mention only one shower gel & one shampoo between two people & I do like to shower twice a day & like to walk & exercise. Not the majestic Shelbourne of old that my grandfather (a Dubliner) use to talk about when we were kids. Times are changing! ,3,2017,10,08
207,Historic Hotel in Great Location,"Very clean, quiet, upscale, and well located hotel. Easy walk to many attractions including Grafton St, Trinity College, National Art Gallery, and on and on.
Staff very friendly and professional.
Excellent restaurants and bar on hotel property. Easy walk to an endless number of local restaurants and pubs too.

Bed and bedding very comfortable.
Large bathroom and nice bath products.
Flat screen TV, safe, hair dryer..... all the conveniences.
Excellent maid service and turn down service at night.

I liked the mini museum in the hotel with letters and documents from notables from the past. I believe the Irish constitution was signed in this hotel (please feel free to fact check me on this one.

I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2017,10,07
207,Great start; disappointing end,"I'd rate the hotel excellent except that it fell short on having a taxi waiting to take us to the airport. To the hotel's credit, a manger was in contact to apologize for the taxi issue, however that doesn't diminish that we went down expecting to find a taxi at 5:45 AM (confirmed separate by two different persons at the Concierge station the afternoon before) and not only did not find a taxi but also found that there are no hotel staff in the hotel at that time except the lone person at the front desk. He did what he could, but that was not how we expected our stay at The Shelbourne to end. Unfortunately, I see from other reviews that our experience is not an anomaly.

Aside from this, our welcome to the hotel was wonderful, the room comfortable and well maintained (nice amenities) , and the staff welcoming most times we returned to the hotel. The breakfast buffet was more than adequate (I was happy because I favour fresh fruits and tend to avoid carbs, and there was plenty for me to choose from). All in all, it met our needs and our expectations. 

The only oddity is that turndown service runs as late as 10PM. We are often ready to turn in before that, but we also appreciate the amenity of a bottle of water and chocolate. On a future stay I will request this service for a time that is more convenient to my schedule. And I will arrange my own taxi for an early morning flight.

In sum, we would return if for no other reason than the location. It is perfect! But other features also make it ideal for our needs.",4,2017,10,07
207,Luxury comfort in Dublin on St. Stephen's Green,"The Shelbourne is an iconic and historic hotel where the Irish constitution was drafted.  It is now part of the Marriott Group.  The warmth and hospitality is legendary.  Staff remember your name and treat you as part of their family.  

I was there for a business offsite.  The hotel does get busy as the guests are both business and high end tourist and vacationers. 

The rooms are well appointed and comfortable.  I enjoyed the Lord Mayor's Lounge which is reserves only for hotel residents.  The Pub on the main floor is cozy and the second best place to get a pint of Guinness. The best place is at the Guinness factory.  The Horseshoe Bar is even cozier and serves all drinks of choice.  Try a Black Velvet: champagne and Guinness.  

The main dining room is The Saddle Room. I enjoyed a breakfast buffet. Nice but restaurant was very crowded with business people and family with small children. 

The location of The Shelbourne is highly convenient to Grafton Street and Trinity 
College. St. Stephen's Green is a wonderful park for a busy work or shopping respite.  

In the lobby of the hotel, there is a small museum dedicated to the famous people that stayed and events hosted at The Shelbourne.  If you are really into the history, a book is available for purchase.  Most interesting service offered is the Genealogy Concierge. This service help people with Irish descent to trace their family line in Ireland.  

Enjoy your stay at this iconic hotel. A good choice for work or holiday.  ",5,2017,10,06
207,Beautiful wedding Venue,"Great location and fabulous breakfasts .  My ""complaints"" would be the following:-

* Room with no view - very disappointing
* Cardigan left in breakfast room for no more that 3 minutes - gone! 
* Very little places for residents to sit and relax as all bars and lounges are open to the public.  That can be frustrating on a rainy Saturday afternoon....",4,2017,10,06
207,Dublin ,"What a very special place to stay in Dublin. Very nicely done with good service. The location is easy access to all parts of the city. 
One drawback was when we preordered our car to be ready for the airport and they didn't have it ready. The extra 25 minutes wait added a little stress to the airport hassle and we weren't able to buy anything at the airport as we got to the gate as they were boarding. 

If I take the time to request my car well in advance I would have liked it to be there when I came downstairs. For the price of the hotel I would expect that level of service. ",4,2017,10,06
207,"Lovely hotel, stellar location","This hotel is a classic!  Our room was gorgeous, overlooking St Stephen's Green. The staff was professional and kind.
I loved our stay, but felt the price could not justify ever staying again.  Very expensive with no complimentary breakfast or perks.
But, if you can afford it, go for it.  Truly lovely.  
We also had the high tea, dee-lish!",4,2017,10,06
207,True 5-Star Hotel!,We have stayed at The Shelbourne several times and have always been impressed with the amazing level of service and extraordinary facilities.  The location--across the street from Saint Stephen's Green--could not be better.  We love The Shelbourne and recommend it highly.,5,2017,10,04
207,Standards have fallen,"I stayed in this hotel once a few years ago and I have also stayed here recently, im.sorry to say that the standards are not what the use to be, the sevice in the lounge area was very slow and I found management never had a smile on their faces and did not interact with us at any point of the stay .",2,2017,10,03
207,Location and Food excellent.,"Location, Location, Location, this is excellent city centre hotel, close to grafton street for shopping, restaurants, bars and most tourist attractions.  We ate at the Saddle room restaurant, food and service were excellent.  Queen rooms are very small, comfortable and clean but both room and bathroom are box tiny.  Horseshoe bar had nice atmosphere but closes on sun. at 11pm sharp even for residents.  Pay parking is expensive and breakfast is also expensive.",4,2017,10,03
207,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel-real old world glamour feel. Staff could not be more helpful. Room was immaculate and had everything we needed. Dafydd at check in gave us complimentary vouchers for free drinks as it was my birthday! Excellent location-close to everything. Pool was nice and clean.,5,2017,10,03
207,Amazing Experience,"Everyone should try and experience this.  From the start everything was fantastic.  The valet parking, check in, the room, the delivery of bags etc.  The attention to detail was second to none.  Dinner in the Saddle room was exceptional - our waitress was fantastic.  The food was out of this world, expensive, but well worth it.  The pool was a little gem.  Hard to believe you on St Stephen's Green, in a swimming pool!!  The breakfast - super.  I cannot find fault at all with the whole experience.  Never to be forgotten.",5,2017,10,03
207,Cold & Not worth the money,"This was not such a great trip, I requested early check in and my stay began with a four-hour wait before my room was ready. In such a busy hotel could they not hire someone for an early shift to clean the rooms of early departures so incoming guests don't have to wait so long???
 
I took a table in the lobby bar and when I explained I was waiting for a room the manager told me to wait in the lobby which has 2 seats.  When I finally entered my room the people in the large building just a few feet across from my windows waved it was small and I have stayed in larger. There was no view, curtains always had to be pulled shut. 

I became very well acquainted with the engineers. My AC/heater did not work. When I came back to dress for dinner the temperature was in the 90s. I opened windows and door while the engineer worked for more than an hour. I was informed I could have heat or AC, but only on high. Or off. I chose cold.  
Forget about dinner. I asked the desk if they had another room. Brusque, ""No, sorry, booked up."" When I returned from dinner the room was freezing, and I put on a jacket, turned off the AC and decided to watch TV while the room warmed up. Of course, the curtains had to remain closed. But wait, TV didn't work. The following day I checked out and moved to another hotel. I have decided to write this review because my emails and call have not been responded to and I do not believe that the hotel should be permitted to treat me this way when I have paid more than £400 for a sleepless night.",1,2017,10,02
207,Fantastic,"Just arrived home after a two night stay. Absolutely flawless. No complaints whatsoever. Pure pleasure from start to finish. The room was immaculate, not a thing out of place. Nice bonus of a nespresso machine. 
",5,2017,10,01
207,Great Location and Hotel,"I honestly don't know where to begin but enough to say a massive Thank You to all the staff at the Hotel. 
We had a 50th Wedding Anniversary and we all stayed and dined in the Hotel.
Luxury and relaxed atmosphere.
This really made our stay worth while.
The Hotel is luxurious ok and a Great Treat for most from my humble background but it did not make me feel out of place thank you for that.
Try get there some day and Enjoy the Offerings of this Amazing hotel with amazing staff...",5,2017,10,01
207,Great Hotel,A first class hotel in the center of Dublin. Everything is so easy to walk to from here. The staff is great as you would expect. The rooms are spacious and modern. The bathrooms are modern as well providing plenty of space unlike some older European hotels. Enjoy this hotel. ,5,2017,10,01
207,Location couldn't be better.,"We stayed for one night. A perfect location, great ambience and very helpful staff. Not a cheap hotel but probably worth it for the location. A great buzz and a lot of interesting people watching. Parking 35 Euros overnight.",5,2017,09,30
207,Staff were top drawer,Just spent a night here with my daughter and I can't say enough good things about their staff. Every single one of them was absolutely brilliant. They were so friendly and chatty to my 3 year old daughter. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite and it was beautiful. Lovely decor and loads of space. Best thing was actually the high number of electrical sockets available in the room. I find it irritating when I have to unplug lamps to plug in a phone charger! Pool was excellent too but possibly a small bit on the chilly side. Food at dinner and breakfast was excellent too. Not cheap but worth it. ,5,2017,09,30
207,One of Many,"Arriving at the front doors of The Shelbourne was a bit of a challenge since there was limited parking space in front of the building. Entering what I was anticipating being a luxurious hotel, I was immediately engulfed in a sea of people in the entry way milling around and meeting for lunch in one of the three restaurants on the premise; feeling more like a food court than a hotel. The room was a nice size and the accommodations were comfortable and surprising quiet. The view from the room overlooked a park across the street which was very pleasant. However, the house keeping services could use improvement. After returning from outing to see the city for most of the day, the room had not yet been made up and we had to request this service. The breakfast buffet was enjoyable and the staff was attentive. However, I am afraid that I am one of the small 6% that would not recommend this hotel, as I felt like I was just one of many.",3,2017,09,28
207,High Tea,"While visiting Dublin with another couple, our husbands toured the Jameson Distillery and we took in tea at The Shelbourne.  It was sumptuous and plentiful.  The live piano music was soothing and especially relaxing after two fast paced weeks of road-tripping through Ireland. Our reservation of 2 hours slipped by and we felt like we could have easily stayed longer.",4,2017,09,28
207,Afternnon Tea to die for,"Had afternoon tea which was just 5 star. A group of us from University met up for afternoon tea in the luxury of the Lord Mayor's lounge. We had intended just meeting for the afternoon as we had all returned to Dublin for the weekend. As our own company and the pleasant service of the staff got us in a great mood we decided to retire to the bar for a bottle of champagne. The paintings on the walls were stunning too. The highlight for me was quality , friendly service by the team. Keep up the good work.",5,2017,09,26
207,Luxury,"Stayed here for one night after a catastrophe with an Airbnb. Being warmly welcomed after that was hugely appreciated. Really, all of the staff was great - hotel & restaurant alike. The room was lovely and clean, no issues with it or the bathroom. I didn't have any problems with our power adapters, and the Wifi worked well.
We had room service for dinner, and it was absolutely delicious. The next day, we had lunch at the restaurant and it was great too. The hotel is conveniently located to the best part of Dublin! If you can afford it, I think this is the best hotel in the city.",5,2017,09,24
207,Fabulous afternoon tea,"Hadn't been here before. It is probably the most iconic of Dublin's hotels and it is definitely the most steeped in history. I was afraid that it's 5 star status and it's reputation would make it pretentious and uncomfortable. I was wrong. It was fantastic, as were the staff, they were all very warm and welcoming. The food was lovely and the Lord Mayors lounge was beautiful. It was made all the better by the lady playing the set of wonderful tunes on the piano",5,2017,09,23
207,Good hotel and great location,"Good sized deluxe king room. Bathroom stylish and well equipped.Staff helpful and friendly. Breakfast room very smart,table service excellent and food competently prepared.Hotel kindly gave us a free late check out.
Both bars looked lovely but difficult to get seat or service. Lobby has limited seating so a problem if waiting for a flight. We had problems with the heating/air con.",4,2017,09,22
207,Old World Elegance,"Stayed here 9/1-2. Very nice hotel overall, but not worth the money, to us at least. “Old world elegance” just means small - small room, small bathroom, small shower, etc. Staff was very nice, and the bar (expensive) was good. Seating/tea area was good, too.",4,2017,09,22
207,Good but could be even better,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights.  Lovely building in a nice area of town.  Professional, friendly and responsive staff.  We reserved a junior suite and were upgraded to the Peter O-Toole suite.  Limited seating in lobby as we waited for our room to be ready--maybe 6 chairs and they all were taken.  Suite was attractive and spacious.  Electrical outlets--quite a few options in the alcove that served as a sort of office area.  Had to use adapters elsewhere--near bed for our iphones/clocks and my husband's BIPAP machine and near mirror to blow dry and style hair.  Adapters we had didn't fit the sockets.  Hotel sell them for 10 Euro.  We ended up purchasing two.purchased.  Two couches in the living area were fashionable but not comfortable--shallow seats and curved backs and sides--nice to look at but not good for chatting, reading or napping.  Tired after an all-night flight so snacked at downstairs casual restaurant before our room was ready and also used room service.  Food was just okay.  If we travel to Dublin again, we wouldn't rule out Shelbourne but would almost certainly at least research other options.",4,2017,09,21
207,Perfection,"After a day in town decided to pop in to this very well known hotel. Amazing inside staff very friendly and food top notch 
In a great location in Dublin especially for tourists as they can do a bit of shopping and pop in for a special treat to this amazing classy hotel.
Perfect for a special day out 
Location great as it's surrounded by many famous land marks
Trinity college not to far
Stephen green and plenty of restaurants and shops
Definitely will return",5,2017,09,21
207,Disappointment ,A beautiful hotel in a great location. Excellent staff and all very helpful. Our issue was our toilet had issues. We were told it was fixed and it wasn't. Since we were there only 2 nights we led it slide. But for as much as we paid they should have offered us a discount. ,3,2017,09,20
207,Incredible experience,"We stayed at the Shelbourne during the tail end of our honeymoon.  Our experience from check-in to walking out the doors was nothing short of incredible.  Mind you I travel for a living and stay in hotels some 200 nights a year, so to master this takes quite a lot.  Every employee we interacted with seemed to genuinely care about us.  The bars, lounge and restaurant were great.  Housekeeping does a great job as evident by the spotless rooms.  Please be sure to share this with everyone at the hotel...our stay was a well orchestrated delight on part of the staff at the Shelbourne.  We'll be sure to return!",5,2017,09,18
207,High Tea,"I have always wanted to have high tea in the Shelbourne given its classical & elegant interior. I finally did last week & I suppose I went loaded with expectation. I hate to admit it but the food wasn't hugely memorable. While the cake slices looked amazing with their floral trimmings, they lacked in taste...just creamy. The sandwich fingers weren't anything to write home about either...plain egg on a roll & salmon on brown bread. The piano player was great & the staff were attentive. They have a good selection of tea and you can taste as many as you wish.",3,2017,09,18
207,"Lovely traditional hotel, central location","This is a luxury hotel, excellent for business or personal use.  I stayed on business participation in a large meeting held at the hotel, but would return privately for a sight seeing visit.  I was lucky to be upgraded, so my room was very large and well equipped, with a fabulous bathroom.  I used the gym and pool, both of which were good.  Service was really excellent throughout my stay.",5,2017,09,17
207,Lunch and cocktails,The other half took me here for the day for lunch and cocktails because we were having dramas in the hotel we were staying in. Gorgeous hotel spotless clean great atmosphere.. Seen a couple of famous people as you do. Lovely staff didn't want to leave ,5,2017,09,17
207,Amazing presence but missing key elements to be truly special ,"If not for their great PR person, Barry, I'd write this place off totally.  We arranged for private transfer from the airport which the concierge forgot to book evidently.  We had a confirmation from Paul, but alas no driver was there to assist with our large caravan of luggage. 

Sleeping through the airport is not how we enjoy traveling.  The taxi driver was kind and informative.  Barry paid our cab fare so we quickly moved past the issue of the forgotten booking.  

The hotel is centrally located and is elegant.  Food and bar service are also very good.  It's a must to eat in the main restaurant and you must make reservations.  If you want to try the Dover Sole I'd also recommend ordering it before you arrive for your dinner.  The wine list is good and not overpriced.  

Our last night we ate at a Fodor's recommendation (2 star Michelin).  Fallon and Byrne.  The car valet had no idea where it was nor did the cabby.  The valet said it was the Temple Bar area so off we went.  My wife was dressed to the nines, me in coat and tie.  The Temple Bar area is nasty, overcrowded and full of panhandling junkies.  We were harassed every step of the way.  Forgot to mention the restaurant was a half mile walk from where the cabby dropped us. The manager was sympathetic to our misguided arrival so he gave us a fantastic table.  The food and service were exceptional.  

Overall we'd likely not return to Dublin. It's a nice city and the people are very friendly but it's not our cup of tea and the Irish countryside is too beautiful to waste any of your trip in Dublin as far a we are concerned.  

",3,2017,09,17
207,Nice Hotel in a Good Central Location,"Having just arrived from Canada, we stayed here the first two days to recover from the long flight and begin our three week self driving tour of Ireland.  It was very centrally located, near shopping and restaurants.  It was also near the Hop On Hop Off bus stop which we took our second day.  The room we had was nice with a view of St Stephen's Green.  We did not do much in the hotel other than have drinks in the lounge and one dinner at the restaurant.",5,2017,09,16
207,Wonderful,"I am from Dublin, but now live in Co Meath. On Check-In i was thrilled to hear a couple from the USA ask questions about Dublin to a young lady behind the counter. (Laura) This young lady was not Irish. When asked by this ""Older"" Couple as to where they should go and where was Temple Bar, Laura answered all the questions, gave the directions and politly pointed out that Temple Bar area can be a bit rough late at night with party revellers. She gave them brouchers and vouchers for trips and sights around Dublin. Laura was a credit not only to the Hotel but also to Dublin.",5,2017,09,16
207,Lovely and impressive...but a tiny room,"Our stay was only for one night, but the staff was super - to the person.  We really appreciated the kindness and professionalism.  It was one of those days when you fly all night from the US to Europe, and you arrive excited, but clearly very, very tired.  We stumbled into the reception area in our own fog, but everyone helped us and welcomed us beautifully.",4,2017,09,15
207,Outstanding,"This is a wonderful hotel to stay out. Customer service is excellent, everyone goes out of their way to help you. We were here for a conference and were very well taken care of. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We had a lovey stay here.",5,2017,09,14
207,Food poisoning beware,"I was on a business trip , so stayed at this luxurious hotel . Not only I got food poising and was rushed to the hospital after having a fresh juice . They charged me arm and leg for room service , washed their hands off any fault or inconvenience. I had to loose my flight , extend stay , pay expensive medical treatment. The management was inconsiderate and harsh . I would not recommend any one to go there . It should be shut down",1,2017,09,14
207,Loved it!,"The Shelbourne and The Brooks hotel had both been recommended to us for our recent trip to Ireland.  We stayed at the Shelbourne for our first two nights of our trip and the Brooks on our final night in Ireland after returning from a trip south, with many stops, to Galway.  The Shelbourne exceeded our expectations-beautiful lobby, helpful staff, nice rooms, terrific location, unfortunately, the Brooks hotel did not live up to our expectations, the location is nice, but the rooms and lobby are just average.  The price for both hotels is similar!  We will hope to return soon to Ireland and will definitely stay at the Shelbourne.",5,2017,09,13
207,"""Special""","I was blessed to celebrate my son's graduation with family and friends in the Shelbourne last week.  We celebrated with Afternoon Tea in the Lord Mayor's Room and stayed for two nights.  

The service before we arrived was fabulous, so I thought there was no way it could be topped, but once we got there, it went over and beyond, what I had encountered before we got there and that took some beating.

Everything was perfect from our room to breakfast to Room Service to the Horse Shoe bar (and the Afternoon Tea in the Lord Mayor's Room was stunning (I could continue to sing its praises).  We were made to feel like there was no one else in the hotel only us.  it was amazing from start to finish.  I have never come across such attention to detail.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Each and every single staff member were pleasant, smiley.  Even the lure of shopping in Grafton Street, could not draw us out of the hotel.

Thank you to each and every staff member we encountered.  Thank you to the Shelbourne for making our special occasion one we will never forget.  

Congratulations Stephen Hanley what a fabulous hotel you run.  Well done to you, you must be very proud.",5,2017,09,13
207,Best hotel in Ireland ,"And for a reason.. the place is full of history and proud of it. Staff are appropriate - friendly and welcoming, but not pushy. Gorgeous breakfast in gorgeous surroundings. Children made a list of all the things they liked that went on for a loooooong time. And the bathrobes..! Amazing ",5,2017,09,11
207,Best hotel in Dublin,Stayed recently for a random night away and loved it. The hotel itself is absolutely stunning. Truly a 5 star hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. The worst part of it all was having to leave!! ,5,2017,09,11

207,Very nice hotel ,"This is a nice hotel in a good location near shopping and dining. Was nice to walk across to st Stephens park.

Overall the staff was nice and accommodating. Can't say much about the dining options as we ate at other places in Dublin.

Heads up the rooms are a little small but nice. ",5,2017,09,10
207,5-star all to way!!,"As soon as the taxi pulled up to the hotel, we were greeted by handsomely attired staff with smiles from ear to ear. Check in was fast and efficient and our room was fabulous. If there was any downside at all, it would be that the view from the room looked the the building across the street. It is difficult to point out a specific service that excelled because, in our experience, all were top notch.The concierge responded to any question and the front staff hailed us a cab quickly and were only too happy to assist with any need. Breakfast was a treat, but pricey at 29 EUROS each. Try for a package. Room prices were are also on the high side, but received full value. I would highly recommend this hotel and, for that matter, encourage all to look to Marriott brands wherever you travel.",5,2017,09,10
207,Excellent service,"I am really enjoyed  with my stay , i am so happy about them service and everything  , so i will highly recommend them ..... hope fully i will be there soon again ,,, thanks again for your great service ,,,",5,2017,09,10
207,Favorite hotel,"We just had our second stay at the Shelbourne and this is our favorite hotel. We tend to stick with Marriott properties and the Shelbourne always stands out with its exceptional service, location, breakfast, and comfort. It's a short walk to many different types of things to do in Dublin (Trinity College, pubs, shopping). Definitely consider the Shelbourne when you're visiting Dublin!",5,2017,09,09
207,For the love of history ,"We stayed here for one night before going back home. The service is good but not great.  We also stayed at another hotel, the Spencer during this trip and the service at The Spencer is slight better than the Shelbourne. The staffs need to smile often. They seem to be cold and unapproachable. The room we received was large since I specified which room I would love to stay. Yes I had made sure them to give me the square footage of the room I booked. The bed is very comfortable. The location is great and the central location for everything as in walking distance. We booked this hotel because of the the history of the hotel. I would love the Shelbourne to be a great hotel but not a good hotel. ",4,2017,09,09
207,Historic Hotel in Dublin ,"This is an exquisite hotel, beautifully appointed. It is centrally located, walkable to galleries, museums, and shopping. It is home to the Horseshoe Bar, the Saddle Room Restaurant , The Lord Mayor's lounge, beautiful tea salon and Number 27 Bar and Lounge. Staff are friendly and very helpful. ",5,2017,09,09
207,"Beautifully restored, great location ","Whether business or pleasure, the Shelbourne Dublin takes you down a wonderful journey of history and hospitality.  From the history museum to ongoing greetings across the property, a wonderful experience in Dublin.  

The lobby restaurants and lounges provide different environments to align with your personality.   Take advantage of the afternoon tea service!

Hotel rooms nicely equipped, bathrooms upgraded well and furniture represents time period with comfort.   

Fitness center is well equipped, but only opens at 6 am for those with jet lag.   

",4,2017,09,09
207,Lovely hotel great location,"I really enjoyed my 3 night stay here. Check in was easy, rooms were big, bathrooms a good size. I had room service once, which was presented beautifully. It is on the pricey side and the corridors to get to the rooms are a bit of a maze but I would definitely look to stay here again if I returned.",4,2017,09,09
207,Excelent Service and fine food. Great Hotel,Rooms with a view over St Stephens Green are special and not a sound to be heard. Location for visiting anywhere around the city centre. Restaurant was fine dining at its best for dinner and we were so well looked after. Breakfast was also great with a huge selection - something for everyone. We also has a Spa Treatment while we were there and the full body massage was just the thing after a long day walking around the  city.,5,2017,09,09
207,Did not stay but had a few great visits to the fantastic Lounge Bar.,"The Lounge Bar in this hotel is Super. It has a wonderful atmosphere. The service is excellent, especially for as busy as it was. The Shelbourne Hotel is a famous classical old hotel and well worth a visit. My friends that was staying there was very impressed with everything from the rooms to the breakfast and of course the Lounge.",5,2017,09,06
207,Comfy,"Really enjoyed the peaceful area. Not in hectic center.  Clean and comfy, great staff. I would stay there agaun.easu across to public transportation and freeways.  Had no trouble leaving for airport. Fun place to hang out and have a pint.",4,2017,09,06
207,Grand!,"Inexpensive compared to other luxury hotels in NYC: ""Jamie"" (Jameson Irish Whisky) at E6.50, hamburger E14. Bar service absolutely charming. Elegant surroundings. Good place to ""chat up"" the ""carriage trade."" Highly recommend.",5,2017,09,06
207,Loved it,"Stayed 2 nights at this hotel Aug 24-26 2017. Our stay was sooo nice.  The staff was very pleasant, the room was small but decorated nicely and the beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom has nice toiletries and very clean. The hotel has so much history and I enjoyed the photos of the many famous people who had stayed there. It is close to St. Stephens Park and other attractions.  I would stay there again. ",5,2017,09,05
207,ONLY ONE NIGHT,Had a long layover in Dublin(24 hours) so decided to check into The Shelbourne and make the most of it.   We had stayed here previously about 3 years ago and knew what to expect.  This visit was even better than the last.  Granted we were using points but were upgraded to a suite over looking St Stephens Green. Staying here is more than just laying your head on the pillow.  It is an experience and level of tradition and splendid service from the moment you arrive.  The suite was beautiful in old English style with modern touches and upgrades in the bath etc.  We walked to a close by pub for a quick dinner based on a recommendation from Barry at the concierge desk.  Afterward we had a restful night followed by a beautifully presented breakfast before heading off to the airport for an early afternoon flight.  What a wonderful way to end a 10 day trip from Italy with a quick but enjoyable layover at The Shelbourne.,5,2017,09,05
207,A magical experience,"This property is a crown jewel in the Marriott system, and certainly the best in Dublin.  We spent three days and enjoyed every minute.  Dublin is a very fun city, but we almost did not want to leave the property.  Our suite room was amazing, the restaurant was fantastic, and the bar has a very cool vibe.  The property has a classical Ireland feel to it without feeling stuffy.  Staff was amazing.",5,2017,09,05
207,Old World Charm with Modern Luxuries,"The attention to detail from the staff and also in the renovations is excellent, from the time you get to the front steps until you leave back down the same steps you are so well looked after and appreciated as a customer. Check in could not be smoother, rooms are fabulous and the peace and quiet in a city center hotel is a bonus. Only disappointment would be the breakfast as it is a buffet and food wasn't as hot as we would like, and when it returned after being sent back it still wasn't fresh just over heated in an oven with a scalding plate, but in the bigger scheme of things it didn't detract from our very relaxing and enjoyable stay in a gorgeous hotel.",5,2017,09,04
207,Think twice,"If traveling to Dublin for any kind of stay, think twice before booking at the Shelbourne Renaissance. We reserved a queen room for €350 per night and just checked in. Our room has no drawer storage space in the room or bathroom, and space to hang maybe 8 items.  Wifi access requires creating an account with a third party, and is painfully slow. No room for luggage either. We are very seasoned int'l travelers but this is not anywhere close to Marriott standards.  I'll move my biz travel elsewhere when we return. So much for Marriott status.",2,2017,09,02
207,"Aaahhhhhhh, this hotel is fabulous!","This hotel is truly exceptional.  From the beauty of the traditional decor to the splendid service.  My accommodations were wonderful.  I ended up with a 2 level suite style room, with a small set of stairs to the large dressing area that led into my bathroom.  Just gorgeous!  Plus the bed and linens were divine.  Room service was also outstanding and pretty quick to arrive.  I spent 3 days at this hotel, and it was delightful in all aspects.  I'm a picky traveler, and this tops any hotel I've stayed at in Europe.  Plus one can't beat the location, since the Shelbourne is walking distance to all the shops and nightlife.  I will definitely stay at this hotel if I go to Dublin again. ",5,2017,09,02
207,Five Star All the Way,"The Shelbourne has undergone a major and costly renovation and the millions of euro invested in the facility have paid off. We are so pleased we were able to spend several nights at the Shelbourne. 

From the moment our taxi arrived and the hotel crew took our luggage, to a flawless check-in where we were made very welcome, to the beautiful flower-filled lobby, to entering our flawlessly decorated room, we knew this stay was going to be wonderful.

Our room was beautiful with great furniture and appointments and a good sized flat screen TV. The bed was firm and very comfortable. There were plenty of electrical hook-ups for all our electronic gear including a 110v plug for travelling Americans. The room and bath were spotlessly clean and refreshed with the nightly turn down service. Wi-Fi signal was strong. The bathroom was totally new, well lighted, beautiful inlaid granite floor, and stocked with a variety of first class amenities. Although our room was relatively near the elevator, we found the hotel to be very quiet and restful.

We did spend time in the Horseshoe Bar to watch Gaelic football and appreciated the wide variety of craft cocktails available and the skill of the bartenders and the ready availability of a major Irish sporting event within the hotel.

The location on St. Stephen's Green is one of the best in all of Dublin. We had reservations a several of Dublin's finest restaurants -- all were in walking distance of the Shelbourne.  

Staying at the Shelbourne was one of our best decisions on this visit to Ireland.",5,2017,09,01
207,The best,We have stayed here before…we are lifetime platinum elite members I did not receive an upgraded room that we had requested some time in advance. Our room was not ready even though we did mobile check-in the day before. So process with this crowd is not so hot. But the hotel is excellent… Excellent breakfast provided. We will of course stay here again but…,5,2017,08,31
207," Full of history","Typical of these old buildings ,they look grand enough in the main lobby but the building is tired, I guess nearly 150 yeas as a hotel things wear out. The dilemma is always the old buildings were never designed to accommodate modern services. The plumbing struggled, the air conditioned didn't work, the corridors had uneven floors. We had to change rooms after the first night because nothing worked. The second room was better but I was annoyed because the first room should never have been offered to us in the first place. The food seemed good where we ate and generally the staff were very helpful in sorting issues out.
In my view the building should be gutted completely and rebuilt from the inside. A bit like the Langham in London. It's not a hotel I'd rush back to.

",3,2017,08,31
207,"Great location, but needs to be updated. ","I'm currently stay at the Shelbourne for the second time. Two years ago it was looking worn, but now the wallpaper in the halls are starting to peel. Coming here from a place like Gleneagle, it's a bit disappointing. ",3,2017,08,30
207,Once again exceeded expectations,"I've stayed a year ago and lucky enough to stay again for business for a week and I honestly cannot fault this hotel. From arrival the door men, check in, porters, room service, breakfast, bar and function space and service is 10 out of 10. I wouldn't consider another hotel if you're after 5 star in the city centre.",5,2017,08,30
207,One of the best Marriott properties I have visited,"I booked a couple of nights in Dublin through the Marriott website. The hotel is fantastic. It gives a historical feel once you enter. However, the amenities in the room are really modern. As a Marriott platinum member, I got a free upgrade to a deluxe room which was huge. Loved the check in gifts that they provide (wine and a cheese plate). 

The breakfast spread is outstanding. In total I think I have around 1000 nights at Marriott properties and by far this is the best breakfast spread I Have seen. They have so many options and you can order your eggs the way you want as well. 

The swimming pool and steam/sauna are great as well. I will definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,29
207,What a fantastic hotel,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for two nights last week with our 3 kids and my husband's Mum, I must say this is an impeccable hotel.  Staff are wonderful, service is excellent, rooms are very comfortable and spacious. No faults whatsoever. We dined two nights in the Saddle Room, food is delicious and service is fantastic - a young lady in particular called Criona who, on the second night, came to our table despite not being in charge of us for the night just to say hello. Wonderful. It's the little things that make the Shelbourne a great establishment. Lovely breakfast too and great drinks in the smaller bar, the bigger one was a tad too noisy for us, but full of lovely people.  Spa and pool also fantastic. Hope to be back soon.",5,2017,08,29
207,Top hotel list rooms and customer service,"Thus us supposedly a top hotel in Dublin, we've stayed at the Brooks Hotel before and it was very good, but wanted to try the top hotel.  As a Marriott club member , we booked two deluxe king rooms at $480 US per night. When we arrived we were seviced fast and shown to the room. The bag were to come up right away. And the lobby was not at all busy. Well waiting 30 minutes and calling to the desk, they said they were very busy and would get to the bags shortly. And after 15 minutes more I went to the lobby and got the bags, in the meantime, the bath sink overflowed due to a stoppage in the plumbing, there was large dead fly squished on the see thru curtain, and practically no closet space for two people... We not lost an hour and upset with supposedly top hotel. We got a call and the front desk said they were changing rooms as the plumbing could not be fixed.  One wonders who cleaned the room from the last guest and did not see that the dink was inoperative! Off to new room... Which was free upgraded, nice. Now lost 2 hours! The second room checked in and it was right next to the elevator . When asked to move to a quite room, perhaps they gave this room to them as they were a young couple? But the hotel was not busy... Both situations left us with a bad taste on checking. Then there was the kids running back and forth up and down our hall way... Between the two Roms their parents occupied... Now I wished I'd gone back to the Brooks Hotel a few blocks away... Word to those considering this hotel the deluxe king is too small for a couple and be sure to check all plumbing and hygiene (dead fly).

",2,2017,08,28
207,Still first-rate with lovely location,"We stayed here many years ago, so decided to repeat the experience for the one night end of our cruise before flying home.  Check-in is an unbelievably thorough, pleasant, extremely friendly, and professional event.  Everything, especially staff, about the Shelbourne is 5-star.  Right across from St. Stephen's Green, a lovely spot, and within walking distance of restaurants, pubs, tourist destinations -- it will always be our Dublin go-to hotel.",5,2017,08,28
207,Girlies late Birthday Treat,"Well if you want to feel important this is the place to go. We were booked in for our lunch at 2.15 on Saturday 26th August. From the warm greeting we got at the door to the minute we entered the beautiful Shelbourne it was so special. Then we were brought to our table for 4 and given our Menus.  This is a fixed price lunch for 32.00 but veggies and potatoes are extra, ranging from 5.00 to 7.00. I am not sure if you are a big eater, if you would be full but we were all satisfied. Everyone was thrilled with their choices and all tasted excellent, nothing was left on the plates. Desserts were just as nice and the services was excellent.  If you really want a special treat or to say you have been here, well I would recommend this magnificent Hotel.  Loved it and felt so important and the little treat you came out with for our friend's Birthday was perfect.  So well done to all the Staff in the Shelbourne, we will be back.",5,2017,08,28
207,mixed bag,"the hotel is lovely and on st stephens square and park. the rooms are not large but well outfitted.  the lobby is often crowded. breakfast is a strong suit.
the staff tried hard to please but couldn't get out of their own way. a series of miscues were almost comic. our airport pickup  service didn't materialize  despite several notes and acknowledgments. we were offered free breakfast asa consolation but that had previously been offered when we upgraded one of our rooms. to wit, our room rate on our final bill was screwed up. finally the concierge made dinner reservations on the wrong night. multiple apologies and genuine concern but all in all a bit of a debacle. ",3,2017,08,26
207,Classic comfort in the heart of Dublin,"Superb location for strolling the city:  walk to Grafton Street shopping area, restaurants along Dawson Street, the Riverdance show at the Gaiety theatre, Trinity College, and the Temple Bar theater, restaurant and bar area.   You can also visit the Little Museum of Dublin just down the street, or catch the Hop-on, Hop-off bus tour across the street.   Service is prompt and courteous; breakfast offers a broad selection for every taste; fruit (especially the yummy pineapple) is of a good quality.   

We stayed in a Heritage Park View Room on the sixth floor with a king-sized bed.  It was decorated in a cozy way with a small table with two chairs.  It was obviously a newly refurbished room with generous storage: soft close drawers in a massive wardrobe. Lap-top size safe in room. Mini-bar stuffed too full to allow any storage of additional purchases, but complimentary water delivered each day.  Turn-down service each evening with slippers laid out, bottled water positioned at the bed side and hotel slippers laid out. The large bathroom in this room was its best feature:  a separate toilet room, separate shower, and separate soaking tub.  Large vanity with ample storage and a large magnifying make-up/shaving mirror.

A couple of clarifying comments here: unless one is over 6 ft tall or willing to stand on the chair, you won't see much of the park.  Secondly, if you do happen to be over 6 ft. tall,  you might be disappointed with the size of the bed. While it is generously sized, it isn't as large as a king bed in the US would be.   

This hotel room was also the most expensive we've ever stayed in (and that includes high end hotels in NYC and Scandinavia. But if your budget allows, you'll enjoy your stay and be pampered in a superbly located, historic hotel that has hosted the rich and famous (see the exhibit off the lobby).  ",5,2017,08,26
207,Excellent,"Love the upgraded rooms, the view to ST green park and details in the rooms. Cleaning is done to perfection and beds are soooo comfortable;) 
Staff going over and beyond to please customers.
Loved the breakfast and dinner and the cocktails and wines at the bar...
",5,2017,08,25
207,A lovely stay,We enjoyed a really nice evening at the Shelbourne despite the terrible rain outside. We had drinks in the bar & enjoyed them as it was a Sunday it was very busy but were served with efficiency. The room was nice & the bathroom very spacious. As it was our Anniversary we were given strawberries with chocolate sent to our room which was a lovely touch. Dinner was great & the service perfect.. all the staff were nice and the breakfast was also good. We often have lunch here but never stayed before. We love the history also of the hotel. Looking forward to another visit. ,4,2017,08,24
207,Great location and family friendly,"The Shelbourne is a lovely property, extremely centrally located and with decent service. We stayed in a junior suite (myself, my wife and our 7 year old son) with two beds which was well accommodating to our needs. 

The bar (No. 27) has great cocktails, and the food overall is quite good. The other bar (The Horseshoe) is quite small and so we were never able to really get in. 

The lounge at the front of the hotel is lovely and we spent many an evening there having a late drink while our son watched his iPad. ",4,2017,08,23
207,One of the best in the City and the best in my opinion.,"Perfect location, everywhere is within walking distance, great old building that has been refurbished a few years ago,  Full 5 Star levels of service and the rooms are great, the better rooms and suites are wonderful. The indoor pool is a great plus as is valet parking.
The perfect hotel to base yourself for a few days in Dublin either for business or pleasure. The two bars are great and the breakfast is top notch. The hotel is busy as are the bars and lounge which is great but perhaps not to everybody's taste.
Afternoon tea and lunch were very good, highly recommend this hotel, been staying here for over 30 years and it is still my favorite hotel in Dublin.",5,2017,08,22
207,BEST:. Classy and comfortable in heart of Dublin,"Old world style, first class service and unique.   The Shelbourne is rich in history and elegance, but it maintains the hallmark of a great hotel property.  Fabulous location, updated rooms with all the features you need/expect (robes, slippers, wall safe, high end shampoo/soap products, luxurious linens, chocolates with turndown service).   The breakfast is hearty with an elegant buffet to please anyone.  Even valet parking (while 35 Eur per day) was convenient for our purposes.  You can walk to just about anything and the Staff can answer all questions.   Service is friendly and knowledgeable. Example.  I had a glass of whiskey in our room that I hadn't finished.  We left for the day.  It wasn't labeled and fully expected the cleaning staff to take it.  But they are savvy and this is Ireland. They covered the regular hotel glass and left it with some chocolate do that I could finish my whiskey that next evening.  Truly World class service.  We will stay at the Shelbourne in all future trips to Dublin.   ",5,2017,08,22
207,wow,"We arrived by taxi to the entrance of the hotel.  Immediately doors were opened by a very smartly dressed hotel doorman and our luggage was despatched to the reception area. From then on we had a wonderful two day stay.  The buffet breakfast was all we could ask for.  WE had one problem which was remedied.  A noisy bedroom which when we reported it someone was sent to sort it, this was around 11.00pm.  It didn't completely stop the noise which was next door's air condition unit.  However we were moved the next night into a very spacious room, the Peter O'toole suite. Amazing. The concierge, Alan was extremely helpful, curteous and friendly as were all the staff.",5,2017,08,22
207,Dream stay in a beautiful hotel,We stayed on the night of our wedding as it was a hotel we have always wanted to visit. The staff were incredible from start to finish and went out of their way to make it an extra special night. Everything about the hotel is 5 star and we just could not fault it.,5,2017,08,21
207,Living in former glory,"After queuing for my room on a Friday evening, we were shunted to the lift to get out of the way as fast as possible,  Deeply impersonal check in, which had a lobby full of pictures from the old days of the hotel.  We went for a drink in the bar, but we were surprised as guests, that the stag party at the bar was more important to serve.  The bar was loud and mostly full of drunken locals, and not hotel guests. The breakfast service was more like a factory than a relaxing weekend experience.  We found the service overall in the hotel to be very poor indeed.  It was over priced and we found management to be full of self importance.  I would avoid when in Dublin.",1,2017,08,20
207,Still Excellent!,Two-night stay in my favourite Dublin hotel. Excellent check-in experience. Large bathroom in a nicely decorated room in the 'older' area of the hotel (Room 252). I'd also note that the indoor swimming pool is excellent. :Look forward to staying again in the future.,5,2017,08,20
207,Dublin,"Third time at the Shelbourne. A bit disappointed this trip. I found the concierges to be poor at best. On Saturday I wanted a gastro pub. Enroute to the restaurant I get an email from the restaurant confirming my reservation for the next week. I booked a cab thru them to return to airport and I was told the price was 25 Euro since they work with this cab company on arrival at airport the price was 36 Euro the driver said we have no hotel deal. 

The room was great and the housekeeping staff is superior. 

The breakfast buffet was wonderful as were the servers. 

Overall a great hotel but let's improve the concierge services ",4,2017,08,20
207,Extraordinary hotel!,"From check in to checkout, we couldn't have asked for a better hotel. The service was top notch, the room was fabulous and unbelievably spacious, the lounge in the lobby was terrific for a pint and good conversation with the bartenders, and the afternoon tea was exceptional. If I had a negative it was that the Shelbourne didn't have a concierge level - but they replaces it with a full breakfast, so that worked out wonderfully.",5,2017,08,17
207,"Wonderful - Luxurious but with the Irish (friendly, comfortable) touch!","We stayed at the Shelbourne at the end of August in 2016.  Overall, it is a great place - luxurious without being stuffy, elegant without being snobby.  We were initially given a good sized room, but it was on a lower floor and looked at the interior, and was dark and loud.  Since we were there for several nights, I called the front desk and Renata was wonderful and moved us to a smaller room, but on a higher floor, so we had a little view and some natural light.  The two rooms were quite different, but both were lovely (except for the location of the first one).  The rooms and bathrooms are large, and well appointed and were spotless.  The hotel has plenty of places to hang out, and the front desk and door staff are excellent.  The Concierge was also amazing - gave us great tips about what to do, when to do it and what was necessary to be booked in advance.  Very helpful. 
We only ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of times because it was more than we wanted and a bit pricey, but the food and service were excellent.  We had lunch in the bar one day - the NO.27, and it was ok, but not great  There are plenty of places around though that are quite good and better priced.
The location of the Shelbourne cannot be beat - it is close to everything and we walked everywhere.  
The one real complaint I had was that the Horseshoe Bar staff were not particularly helpful or friendly.  We went for drinks and were ignored for a while and then I left a bag in the bar and went back the next day and they were adamant that nothing had been found so I had to check out without my bag, but called again and of course it had been found, so they mailed it to me.  
All in all, a lovely, luxurious hotel and I will definitely be back!",5,2017,08,16
207,Above and beyond,"Stayed here for a night with my wife for our anniversary. A bit of a mix up meant my wife's bag went missing. Normally that sort of stuff is like red rag to a bull with me but the whole episode was dealt with very efficiently  friendly and quickly. A truly memorable night in probably Dublins finest hotel. Room was superb, staff amazing and location top class. We'll most definitely will be back!",5,2017,08,16
207,"Classic, but beware it is busy.","I enjoyed my recent stay at the Shelbourne... at least once I got to my room.  Knocking the place for checking me in and forgetting about me in the bar until almost 6 pm - it isn't terribly hard to know that you sent a guest somewhere, especially when you said please wait there and we'll come get you.  It was a busy afternoon when I arrived, and I am always fine being flexible, but this stretched my tolerance.

Room itself was great - well appointed and comfortable.  Breakfast was also terrific in the hotel restaurant.

Worth noting that the hotel is well-trafficked by everybody, from guests to tourists to locals - so expect a busy lobby at a ""famous"" place.  It can be hard getting a table to eat at lunchtime, so plan accordingly.  The horseshoe bar is a must.

I look forward to coming back again for the location, room, and facilities, and expect I that the abandonment was a one-off event.",4,2017,08,14
207,Great hotel,"We had our wedding here 30 years ago and returned for 24 hours. The staff were so kind and every member of staff we met was so pleasant and helpful, our stay couldn't have been better. 
Our room was amazing and the food and ambience in the Saddle Room was superb. A great experience and centrally located in Dublin with so much to do. The Spa and salon were wonderful too.",5,2017,08,14
207,Beautiful Hotel with lots of history,"This hotel is top shelf! In addition to the exquisite rooms the staff are extremely helpful and over-deliver on service. Wonderfully located in the city center, this seemed the perfect place from which to explore Dublin.",5,2017,08,14
207,Great location,"Great location on the main park square and near all the key attractions.  Busy hotel that appeared to have a lot of tour groups, so be patient when checking in.  Wide range of restaurants and bars on site and a short walk to so much.",4,2017,08,12
207,Classic Irish Hospitality ,"Just back from another excellent holiday break at The Shelbourne with friends, this is classic Irish hospitality at its very best - from the moment you pull up outside the front door in the heart of Dublin at St. Stephens Green until check-out this hotel has the ultimate service and most luxurious surroundings to offer in Ireland, nothing is too much bother for the staff, the food and drinks are just exceptional, from afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors lounge to champagne cocktails in No. 27 Bar, this is simply one of the best hotels we regularly stay in during our travels - will always return to The Shelbourne.
",5,2017,08,12
207,What a hotel!,"Top class hotel, great location. Highly recommend it for a special occasion, although very expensive. Bit you get what you pay for and this has the location. Bang in the city centre, walking distance from everything.",5,2017,08,10
207,Every visit is a joy!,"Simply put, The Shelbourne is perfect,  The staff are exemplary.  The rooms are extremely well appointed.  The breakfast is superb.  The bar is first class.  I have yet to find anything even slightly objectionable.  The concierge knows Dublin like his own garden.  St. Stephens Green is directly across the street; Bank of Ireland is very nearby, as are excellent pubs and restaurants.  It is home in Dublin.",5,2017,08,10
207,Great Location but you pay it,"Good hotel but not great.Rooms a little small but location can't be beat.Everything at hotel was fine but nothing really memorable.It you don't mind paying for the location then I would stay here.Service was very friendly.
",4,2017,08,10
207,Way too expensive!,"I have no problem paying top dollar for an amazing experience, but there was absolutely no reason at the Shelbourne.  Our room was tiny and we faced directly into an office window, even though we had a ""balcony"".  The room service is just OK, but the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I would have to imagine that your money is better spent at another hotel.",3,2017,08,09
207,Wonderful stay,"Stayed multiple nights here, check-in staff was very friendly, rooms was nice.  Had breakfast twice and was always greeted with smiles.   Concierge staff was also friendly with tips and directions. Would have no problem staying here next time in Dublin.",4,2017,08,09
207,Their motto should be one night wonder!,"We have always wanted to stay at the Shelbourne because of it's great history.  A few weeks ago we had our chance to do it.  We had a Queen size room for part of the stay and then we were in a Heritage room for the other part of the stay.  I want to preface this review by saying that we were paying over $800 a night for a small room which is the most that we have ever paid for a hotel.  It's extremely expensive so that is part of why we had very high expectations.

What we liked about the hotel is that the location is wonderful and very convenient for sight seeing.  The hotel has a wonderful history and a small museum that you can go in.  We liked the fact that they have a nice fitness room with good options for working out.  The onsite restaurant is very good.  They have a fun bar area to have a pre-dinner cocktail.

We checked in early coming from an overnight flight but they didn't have our room ready.  The person who checked us in assured us that we might be able to check into the higher quality room with our status so that we would not have to re-pack during our stay and change rooms.  We left for the day after taking a shower at the spa facilities and then came back later.  When we came back they said that there was only the lower grade room available and it was a very busy weekend so the person should not have said that there ware really any possibility.  It was frustrating.  

The queen rooms are very small.  I believe that others have talked about them.  They are small and there are no amenities.  No nespresso machine, just a hot pot.  No bath tub, just a shower, etc.  They eventually were to move us to a deluxe but they upgraded us to a heritage room.  I believe that it was a much nicer room and they had nice amenities.  It had a beautiful large bathroom and nespresso machine, etc.  However, they gave us the room over the bar.  I believe that it is #152.  First we had to listed to horrible techno music until later hours, they did turn it down when I called them but also, in the early hours of the morning they move all  of the furniture probably to clean the floor.  So we would get woken up with the scratching of furniture being dragged across the floor.  It's also on the street so there is a lot of road noise.  

We have stayed at the Conrad and other hotels in Dublin.  It's fun to stay at the Shelbourne but I think personally at those rates it's worth one night for the experience and then I would move to another hotel on St. Stephen's Green.  

We do highly recommend their restaurant for dinner.  We had breakfast included which they never change so again, one night and breakfast the next morning would cover the experience.  

Who wants to pay $800 a night to hear trucks, techno music and some furniture being dragged around!?",3,2017,08,08
207,Historically significant and impeccably designed but a bit stuffy,A beautiful hotel in an ideal part of the city but very pricey and a bit snooty.  This hotel is Centrally located in the historic district and directly across the street from the park.  Trinity University is in walking distance.  The lobby is small and uncomfortable -and so was our room.  Located in the second floor and priced at a bit over 400 euros a night there was no space to lounge and the bathroom was uncomfortably small.  High tea was perfect. For us the ROI was not there!,3,2017,08,08
207,A Shell of its Former Self (truly a 3 star experience),"My wife and I stayed at the Shelbourne, Dublin in August 2017. Unlike many of the reviews mentioned earlier this is specific to the hotel for staying guests and not its F&B business.

The hotels generally frequented by wife and I are the Raffles, the Ritz, Langham, Oberoi, Peninsula, so this is relevant to customers who are accustomed to similar levels of quality and service which I also understand the peer group that the Shelbourne projects itself.

I would also confirm this as an original review being posted post our stay and not crowd sourced.

The Good: Location, without doubt and a grand history: the Irish constitution indeed drafted at the Shelbourne and there is small one room museum to its history next to the reception area. Cannot recommend enough the excellent afternoon tea (though with hourly seating and in high demand). Staff on the ground floor are quite polite and helpful. 

The Demerits (and there are a few):

1.	Room sizes are really small. The Queen Rooms are tiny. There is basically one to 2 feet of space to move around the bed which barely could fit my frame (at 6 feet). Bathrooms are the size of an aircraft toilet with a cubicle attached. Window on 5th floor looks into the adjoining’s room window (90 degree angle) and while lying down our bed we could see the bed in the other room. In effect, ensuring there is no privacy for us or frankly for the other chaps in the other room. We had made the booking through booking.com and without doubt the pictures of the queen room and bathroom are not at all representative. On a more detailed search on booking.com, the given size is 195 sq ft for the queen room and 250 sq ft for the deluxe rooms (which is why also we did not go for an upgrade) which are certainly on the other lower end for hotel rooms sizes especially for 5 stars. Indeed, the rooms were so small that we never even ended up calling for room service as we were not even sure where one would be able to comfortably enjoy a meal in the room. 

2.	Be prepared for a delayed check in (and hourly charges for a late check out). Arriving from India, on check in we were asked to wait for an hour as room were not ready and housekeeping was on the job. After the one hour (and I must say delightful lunch at the Saddle), we were told that the time estimate was wrong. Would have appreciated at least if we were told so earlier or informed directly so we could spend more time at the Saddle restaurant. Eventually, it was hours later that we received our room and after multiple follow ups as were told housekeeping was moving slowly that day. Conversely, would add that while checking out, since we had late night flight to India we asked for a late checkout. We were told that the hotel was fully booked but yet somehow correspondingly offered one hour complimentary stay with every additional hour charged at a particular rate including till when we were scheduled to leave the hotel. To say the least, especially I never recall a 5 star asking for an hourly charge, it did make me think.
3.	Internet (alert all business travelers and techies). The hotel has outsourced its internet service to a Virgin hotspot. Even beyond the security issues, the speed barely touched (speedtest) 120 kpbs. Coming from India this was a shock as there is national 4G service. Worse, the connections kept dropping. Eventually, could only do with the wifi dongle purchased at Vodafone, Graftston street a few minutes walk way even to get through work mails.

4.	Small, non functioning TV. There is a small TV around 21 inch in the room. Kept flickering throughout stay and was never fixed even till the end of our stay. In effect, we never used the TV during our stay.

5.	Housekeeping. There is definitely a lack of attention to detail. Turndown service was missed on same days. Had to give constant reminders for changing the bathrobes. Tea bags not replenished continuously. Even sheets were not changed on daily basis by default until specifically we had to insist. In this case, no option even given – generally hotels do offer an environment friendly option to leave a message if you do not wish to have the sheets changed, in this case this was not done and it was left to us discover the same.

6.	Concierge is too busy. Was unable to help us either with theater bookings (we went to the box office to purchase them directly). With restaurants: we made the bookings for fine dining ourselves eventually (e.g at Dax). And to give a specific experience of an outbound trip: despite multiple messages to “Delighted to Serve” (auto connected when no one lifted the phone at the concierge) to make a private tour (Mercedes) booking eventually had to go the concierge desk after two hours of waiting as apparently they were in meetings as told over the phone. As it happens, when I arrived at the desk, the concierge mentioned he hand no message as such. Regretfully, had to point out the large handwritten note to call my room no which was next to the keyboard. Enough said. The only good point was that at the time of check out they did get an extra hour of charge knocked off which was billed extra to us from the afore mentioned tour.

7.	Overbooked Spa. Despite boasting Dublin’s “largest spa”, there was no availability for a massage beyond 25 mins for the next 48 hours (and this on weekdays) and that too only in a particular afternoon timeslot. We checked on two different days in fact. The hotel aggressively markets its spa to non-guests with a special entrance and offerings. We had the feeling that in general as consequence availability is limited to guests. In fact it we were specifically asked if we had booked a massage in advance to our arrival in Dublin and if had an email to that effect: obviously not.

8.	Focus on Customer Delight. In fact, for example when we shared that turn down service was missed, the first response are you sure there was not a do not disturb sign (they are welcome to check CCTV logs as far as I am concerned). That’s tells you everything about how the service approach is geared (beyond the excellent but packed restaurants) to deal with customers. Indeed, I uploaded the same comments to Marriott as well. Till date only Marriott UK has (very politely) responded. No response from the hotel side as of date of this posting. 

In retrospect, I would recommend to consider a hotel in the near by area which there are quite a few and try the F&B service especially the afternoon tea as an outside guest.",2,2017,08,07
207,"Exceptional Comfort, Style, and History Rolled into One Superlative Hotel","We love the Shelbourne, and have made it our hotel when in Dublin, for a variety of good reasons. The building itself heralds the Georgian age of architecture that characterizes this corner of Dublin.  The hotel sits across the street from Saint Stephen's green, a lush and well-manicured park.  Most major sites rest 15 - 20 minutes away by foot - from Dublin Castle to Trinity College - everything is near. 

The service must be the very finest in all of Ireland.  The staff, clearly well-trained, crisply and efficiently respond to all requests, and anticipate the customers' needs. The concierge, Paul, arranged a beautiful  birthday dinner for my mother at a restaurant we would have never found without his help.  The front desk checked us in beautifully, and responded to our many requests kindly and quickly.  The doormen are exceptional - friendly, helpful, accommodating.

The rooms offer plenty of space and amenities to make the guests more than comfortable. And the beds must be the most luxurious in the whole country.

In short, stay that Shelbourne and know that every need will be attended with care, and the stay will exceed all expectations. Plus the food is really good. We're fans for life!",5,2017,08,06
207,Sunday Jazz Lunch,"We always go to the Shelbourne even if we don't stay there. Bar 27 is our first port of call when we land. Sunday lunch, we had the roast beef... OMG, I wanted to order another one straight after. It was value for money and absolutely delicious. I'll be back there in October for a roast...no question! Give it a blast ",4,2017,08,06
207,Historically beautiful ,Simply beautiful hotel. Excellent restaurant. Great location.  Thank you for the amazing upgrade.  Centrally located off of St Stephens park and Grafton Street    There is slot of history to the hotel.  Great bar. High tea a must.  ,5,2017,08,06
207,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed here while visiting Dublin and surrounding areas. The hotel's location cannot be beat. We were able to walk to most sites, restaurants, and shopping. Our balcony room on the 7th floor was spacious and comfortable. Breakfasts were very tasty, with many choices. Would definitely recommend!",5,2017,08,05
207,"History and Hospitality, a bit of Glamour, too!","What a lovely hotel, situated close to St Stephen's Green and close to fine dining, and many of the sites a visitor would want to see while in Dublin, including Trinity College, The National Archaeology Museum, The National Gallery and Grafton Street, too.  

Our accommodations were lovely.  My family went to bed and I took the opportunity to spend a luxurious hour plus in our perfectly huge and well appointed bathroom.  I never do that while traveling, never taking the time to really enjoy a room,  Here, at the Shelbourne, I did.  Staff were fabulous and helpful.  Our car was waiting for us as we exiting the hotel.   Highly recommend.",5,2017,08,05
207,"This Grande Dame Has It All:  Elegance, Gorgeous Public Rooms, Great Location.  Gracious and Professional Staff.","I spent a delightful few days in this historic hotel that was completely updated about ten years ago and is now a Marriott Renaissance property.  The public rooms are beautiful and elegant.  The food and service were excellent at the restaurants.  The hotel staff was always gracious and welcoming. 

My spacious 6th floor room had high windows that looked out over St. Stephen’s Green and beyond.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  The beautiful marble bathroom with separate tub, shower and commode, was large and conveniently fitted with lots of shelving.  The room had plenty of lighting, a good work desk and plush, comfortable reading chairs.  Soundproofing was excellent and I never heard anything from other rooms or the hallway.  In-room WIFI was fast and reliable.  There is nightly turn-down service.  The hotel has a great location two blocks from the Natural History Museum and the National Gallery of Ireland and is surrounded by tons of restaurants and shops.

I was disappointed when I had to leave the Shelbourne to join a tour group at another excellent, five-star Dublin hotel, the Westbury, a 20th century property that does not have the same level of elegance, warmth or beauty.  The combination of history, comfort and grace makes the Shelbourne an extraordinary place.  They clearly value their guests and make them feel special.  It was a wonderful introduction to Dublin and really deserves six stars!",5,2017,08,05
207,"Charming, old school hotel in a great location","The Queen rooms are small (as in New York hotel room-size) but comfortable.  If you can handle the size of the room, this hotel has an ideal location - across from St. Stephen's Green and within walking distance to many sights, shops, museums, Grafton and Temple Bar.  Unlike other reviewers, we had a good experience with the staff and the concierge desk - we found them to be knowledgeable and helpful, and the concierge provided great suggestions regarding an excursion to Howth that we were considering (a trip that we made after the concierge enthusiastically endorsed the idea and gave us some tips), and for non-tourist pubs and restaurants in central Dublin.  The gym is small but it has enough equipment to allow for a solid workout.",4,2017,08,04
207,Fantastic,"Thanks again to all the staff who took great care of us at The Shelbourne Hotel, my wife and I had a wonderful stay. Chris at the front desk was extremely helpful in ensuring we were taken care of before our room was ready and this was much appreciated after a long flight. Also, I'd like to recognize Pawel in the saddle room for his phenomenal customer service and recommendations on within the city. 
The room was clean and comfortable with many amenities.  
I've stayed at many hotels and a few 5 star hotels through Europe and the states and by far you all are number one in my book.",5,2017,08,04
207,Minuscule rooms poor service,"Poor housekeeping. Missed turndown service, poor concierge, tea is not replaced, no views to speak of. Wifi is miserable and not secured. I would not come here again.
Only the restaurants are decent. The spa has no availability for hotel guests so don't come here if you like a good spa. For two days they could not give me a slot.",2,2017,08,03
207,Stephens creations ,"Best gin cocktail's ""The Lavish lady"" and "" The Restoration "" ever get down and try them you won't regret it !! Stephen was great company as I was traveling alone. Sam and Niamh were great as well! Overall a lovely night! Can't wait to come back! ",5,2017,08,03
207,Fabulous Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel whilst on a short business trip. I was immediately wowed by its grandeur and without the stuffy formalities that sometimes come with hotels of this type.  I was greeted with a warm and friendly welcome - this friendly 'can do' attitude was consistent by the staff throughout my stay. Room amenities were first class, spacious and very comfortable. Sadly, I only had time to use the lobby bar (No 27 Bar) - it was a bit busy and service was not particularly great but none the less, a hugely popular venue for an evening drink. This hotel is also in a great location for the best shopping, restaurants and bars a in short walk. It's now the place to stay for my next visit to Dublin.",5,2017,08,01
207,Luxury at its best,If you want attentive first class service then try the Shelbourne. The staff were excellent. The surroundings luxurious and the location perfect. I have stayed in numerous 5 star hotels all around the world but have to say that the staff here have been superior to any other .......,5,2017,08,01
207,Still The Best,"I really love the Shelbourne and stay here every time I visit Dublin. Every time I visit it gets better and better.

As usual, the excellent service starts the second you drive up to the front door. Bags and car are taken care of with ease, allowing you to seamlessly check in. My wife and I arrived with a hire car, having driven around Ireland that week and it needed to be back with Avis a couple of hours after our arrival. Rather than parking the car for us and charging a parking fee, the doorman simply offered to leave the car out front for me to pick up later. No dramas and made my life easier. Check-in was easy and they recognised and arranged all of the appropriate Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts Group extras. We were upgraded to a larger room on a higher floor which was great. Beds are super comfortable and room amenities are excellent.

Despite staying at the Shelbourne a number of times, I had never eaten in the Saddle Room restaurant. The experience was fantastic and I would highly recommend (separate review). The Number 27 Bar has become exceptionally busy all day long and so I would recommend getting in there early to avoid disappointment. However, my favourite has to be the Horseshoe Bar, which is a buzzing secluded bar serving up great beers and cocktails.

The Lord Mayor's Lounge is always a highlight and my wife and I had a lovely afternoon tea before we had to head off to the airport. Booking for tea is absolutely essential and can be done online. Request one of the two tables with the wing back chairs, as they are more comfortable and offer a great view of the lounge.

The level of luxury and service is top-notch and I can't think of anywhere else I would like to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,08,01
207,Weekend break.,"Beautiful hotel which has retained all its prestigious elegance, excellent staff and very clean in all areas , outstanding location!!

Would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who seeks perfection 🇮🇪🇮🇪👍👍",5,2017,07,31
207,Great Staff and Amazing location,"Everything about our stay was top notch. We arrived early morning off of a red-eye flight, and the front desk, recognizing that my elderly companion needed rest, offered us a temporary room until our room was ready.   Additionally, the hotel lent us a wheelchair to help get around the city (apparently this could be reserved with the hotel, so we got lucky it was available).

Location was great as it is right across street from the park, and a few blocks from Grafton street.  Also super close to the national gallery, which was great.",5,2017,07,31
207,wonderful service,"we stayed in december 2016 but unfortunately we weren't happy with the room, on our return home i wrote an email, it was answered by Mr.Aidan Dempsey, the manager, from that point on things just got better, not only were our complaints listened too, the situation was rectified, we stayed again in the hotel in March 2017 as we were attending a wedding and true to his word Mr Dempsey made us feel like valued guests, our room was beautiful, the complimentary touches and service made us feel so special, I'm glad to report that ""The grande Dame"" that is The Shelbourne may have changed hands, had a facelift and some botox in places but the heart of the hotel - the staff and customer service still shines through, well done, one very happy customer, planning on returning to you.",5,2017,07,29
207,Delightful and great location,What a wonderful hotel and staff!  We had a very comfortable and welcome stay at the Shelbourne and were very happy with everything from the comfort and spaciousness of our rooms to the attentiveness of the staff and the location of the hotel.  Every detail was thought of in our rooms as it they were very well appointed.  We were on vacation from the USA with another couple and thoroughly enjoyed our time here.  The breakfast buffet was delicious.  We enjoyed two evenings before dinner in the Horseshoe Bar which is tucked away near the entrance.  The concierge was great at helping us select restaurants for dinner and getting us reservations.  We had wonderful views of the beautiful St. Stephens Green from our rooms.  The location allowed us easy access to everything.  Hopefully we will be back again.,5,2017,07,29
207,Simply Wonderful~,"There was no part of the hotel we didn't like.  The hotel was easily within walking distance of the major tourist attractions.   Again, while this hotel will not disappoint, we especially enjoyed the casual bar conversing with a couple local Irishmen -- warm, friendly, and outgoing people -- we never felt ignored.",5,2017,07,26
207,Excellent hotel,"We originally booked a two double-bed room, but we got upgraded to a suite upon arrival. The hotel was beautiful and it was in a great location, right across the street from St. Stephens green, close to the buses, within walking distance to the train station, and 
a bus from the airport drops you around the corner from the hotel at a fee. We arrived before check in time. We were able to leave our bags at the front, a helpful doorman pointed out places we could go to kill time until the room was ready, and the concierge called when the room was ready. The room was ready before the estimated time. 

They contact you before you arrive to see if you have any special requests. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The room was nice, clean, and with a great view. It had a tv, small living room, two beds, bathroom with a shower and tub and toilet in a separate room with door. The pool was nice. There was a musician at the entrance. All around this was a great place to stay.",4,2017,07,25
207,Perfect in Every Way,"Had a 3 night getaway stay with my wife at the Shelbourne and it might be the best hotel stay we have had (and we have stayed at many similar class great, iconic hotels in Europe and the US). The service was super friendly, prompt and overall excellent... from front desk to restaurants to housekeeping. We never felt like we had to wait for anything and the staff came across as genuinely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was wonderful. The public areas were elegant and perfectly maintained, but not stuffy or ostentatious. A pass to the very affiliated nice health club to freshen up after long overnight flight was much appreciated (we arrived early morning so room wasn't yet ready). Even though we booked one of the lowest category rooms (It think it was called a ""small queen"") because unfortunately that was all that was available, the room was a nice size, pristine in terms of cleanliness and maintenance and nicely updated, and it had all the little touches one might expect in a 5 star European hotel (twice daily service with turn down, slippers beside bed, bottled water, etc., etc.). We got back to the hotel late after seeing U2 at Croke Park and we were starving... they seated us and served us some great pub food in the same beautiful restaurant area they have high tea facing St Stephen's Green (great fish and chips, club sandwich, Guinness, etc.), and they were still seating people at 2 am! I got the impression that maybe they stayed open later due to the concert, but either way it was much appreciated as it was almost impossible to get food anywhere else at that hour! The hotel's location is wonderful. I was recognized as a Gold level Marriott Rewards member and they provided a complimentary full daily buffet breakfast and two free drinks from the bar in recognition, which is much better than I have experienced in other locations, especially given this is a historic landmark hotel. I just can't heap enough praise on the Shelbourne. I hope they keep up the good work, because when we get back to Dublin again we look forward to seeing them again!",5,2017,07,25
207,Best Burger in Dublin!,Recently I took my Mom to Dublin for a day of sightseeing and tracing our family roots at the National Library.  We stopped into to Shelbourne for lunch and were pleased beyond belief! The service was outstanding and the food was incredible!!! The signature burger was all it promised and more.  The wine selection was fabulous and the atmosphere made the experience complete!!! ,5,2017,07,25
207,"Didn't stay here, but the walk-thru was great!","My wife and I decided to walk into the Selbourne prior to going to St. Stephen's Green. We were very glad that we did because 1) the re-modeled interior is super nice and historical looking, 2) they have a small ""museum"" on the first floor with pictures, memorabilia, and old guest books dating back to the early 1900's (lots of Easter Rising stuff too), and 3) the Constitution Room is here! The Constitution Room is where Michael Collins and others signed the Irish Constitution, and the condition they've been able to keep it in is really nice. We were lucky enough to have a hotel employee show us the room after we asked him some general questions about it, but I would bet you could see it if you just meander up to the 2nd floor and head right (it's a couple doors down on your left)",5,2017,07,24
207,High Tea,"Had high tea at the Shelbourne Hotel our first day in Dublin. It was well worth the price. Everything was first class - the service, the pastries were scrumptious, and the tea and coffee first rate. Even though it is a very classy hotel, you don't have to dress up to attend, I had on a polo shirt and slacks and my wife was similarly dressed. Definitely recommended.",5,2017,07,23
207,The amazing Shelbourne hotel,"We had a fantastic stay at the Shelbourne hotel. This hotel is superb! It is a beautiful building steeped in irish history. Room 112 was where the irish constitution was drafted in 1922 under the leadership of Michael Collins. Many famous people such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, James Cagney, The kennedys and Elizabeth Taylor to name a few stayed in the Shelbourne right from its very humble beginnings. The hotel is a short walk to all the major attractions, shops and pubs while also overlooking the tranquillity of St Stephens green directly opposite. The Saddle room boasts some top notch beautifully presented food and a buffet breakfast with loads of food to choose from and if that wasn't enough You also have the options of relaxing in the bar area or Lord Mayors lounge for some afternoon tea. You really and truely feel special from the moment you walk in the door. Best hotel iv stayed in by far! ",5,2017,07,23
207,A Lovely Stay,"Having lived in Ireland previously I wanted to stay at this iconic hotel when I visited with my son. We stayed in the renovated front part of the hotel and the rooms were lovely. It is the little things that make it luxurious like the bottled sparkling and still water, the very soft slippers and the incredibly soft bath robes and fine linens. The rooms was very spacious and well appointed. My only gripe is that accommodation services could pay a little more attention to things like wiping off fingerprints on the ceiling in the bathroom into the maintenance access, and ensuring the toiletries are actually inside the cardboard packets (mine were not). Easy to miss but still it is the small things that can taint a reputation. We had dinner in the restaurant which was nice and the service was great. Breakfast was ok, but to be fair I expected a little more class, it was your average breakfast foods and the bacon was tough. But the service was good and the chefs friendly. The view from our twin room was particularly ugly and disappointing . A great hotel, and I would definitely recommend it.",5,2017,07,22
207,Very nice but a tad stuffy,"This is a lovely hotel and I enjoyed a large heritage room on a recent trip to Dublin. While the property is well located and clearly a ""fine""hotel , more than a few staff parade around with a sense that they are tolerating the great unwashed who are also customers. Mind you on balance, there are far too many traveller who seem to confuse casual dressing with sloppy. This snobbish behaviour amongst staff was most apparent with the method they use to seat people in the bar or restaurants. Very few of these service staff sport a smile and carry the mood of one making funeral arrangements. I did not encounter anyone on staff but the concierge desk who was a native Irish person . Good this be a EU cultural issue ? Hard to say but it was notable. Despite being a gold level Marriott customer, for a fine hotel alternative I would opt for the Merrion or Westbury on my next visit .",4,2017,07,21
207,Overnight treat ,"Always, wanted to stay in the Sherbourne but always seemed to expensive and out of a normal persons reach. But had a opportunity to stay at the iconic hotel and what can I say. When you walk into the entrance it's beautiful.  Reception was efficient and friendly.  Decor in the room was very nice, bathroom was also a generous size. Ended up in the residence bar later on and had a coffee and glass of wine, they certainly know how to charge for wine, 10.90euro. Bed was super and had a good night sleep. Breakfast the next morning while the choice was excellent,  the quality was poor, rashers and pudding were as tough as old boots, coffee and toast was cold. They should ask you would you like your coffee and toast immediately or in a few minutes after you have had cereals.  Otherwise this is one item off my bucket list.",3,2017,07,21
207,Return visitors,"We stayed at The Shelbourne, again, because we love the historical old place and it's location! Our suite overlooked St. Stephen's Green, a more lovely view would be hard to find. The staff is always friendly and the No. 27 Lounge is a very popular place for drinks.",5,2017,07,19
207,"Refined luxury and elegance, without stuffiness!","Beautifully maintained, historic hotel with professional, helpful, friendly staff.  We were lucky enough to spend 4 nights here and our stay was impeccable.  The rooms are large and beautifully decorated.  The fitness room is spectacular, the setting perfect--right across the street from St Stephens Green, along with great bar/lounges and restaurants--and a lovely afternoon tea.  Fabulous concierge staff that helped us purchase concert tickets as well as arrange for a drop off of a rental car when we left.  
5 star property for sure!",5,2017,07,19
207,Raises the Bar,"I stayed at the Shelbourne Dublin this July 2017, and it is a fantastic hotel!  The hotel has great history and the location in Dublin is excellent.  I had a suite and everything in the room was perfect and the bathroom was very spacious.  The breakfast was incredible from the options, the seating rooms, the staff and the quality of the food.  The best part was the staff I met at all points during my stay.  They appear to enjoy working at the Shelbourne and it comes across in how they greet you and take care of the hotel and guests.  I would like to have stayed longer.  The Shelbourne should be your first choice for Dublin, even if you are not a member of the Marriott loyalty program.",5,2017,07,18
207,Beautiful,"Beautiful hotel with a great location. Great staff.. 
Bar, Tea Saloon and Restaurant are very popular.. Always packed..
Some rooms are small and don't have a good view.. But still a very good choice..
Breakfast Buffet can be richer, eapeciallt the cold buffet.

",5,2017,07,17
207,Amazing as always ,"The Shelbourne can never disappoint. A 10 out of 10 on all points - service, standard, hygiene, food & location. Recommend getting a refurbished room as the old ones are tired and need updating. Wonderful wonderful ",5,2017,07,16
207,Best hotel in Dublin,"This is a wonderful hotel to stay in - great historical atmosphere in a grand setting.  We stayed here with our elderly aunt and uncle for a few nights and spent the time visiting the local sights as well as meeting up with other family members for dinner in a local restaurant.  We were all very satisfied with our bedrooms (we have always had good rooms when we have stayed).  We ate in the restaurant on the Friday night when we arrived - this is the first time I have eaten dinner in the hotel and it was of an exceptionally high standard!  Hotel restaurants are not always the best place for fine dining but this was exceptionally good!  The hotel was very accommodating when asked to find somewhere for our family group to relax after dinner on the Saturday evening (fourteen of us!) - and on the Sunday evening, we relaxed with a swim and sauna.  Good sized pool with everything kept at a high standard",5,2017,07,15
207,A special splurge ,"After a long flight from San Francisco and jet lag that was making it hard to function, we splurged on a lovely tea so we could rest and eat. The staff is so lovely. They allowed my children to make substitutions for their children's tea. You can also get a milkshake for the children, or hot chocolate instead of tea. 

The room is beautiful, the hotel is beautifully appointed and as travelers, it was an added bonus that the public bathrooms are great. 

We loved our sandwiches, and enjoyed eating mascarpone and jam on the scones. Even though the setting is very sophisticated, the staff is down to earth and accommodating. We loved it. It's expensive but was a fun and delicious splurge. It is right by St.Stephen's green so we enjoyed a walk through the park after our tea. ",5,2017,07,14
207,Lovely break,"Arrived at the Shelbourne after staying in Ardmore cliff hotel. Spacious entrance with a lovely bar and 
Foyer and well appointed bedrooms. Staff were accomodating and the service is outstanding. Rooms are refurbished but i thrink not all and bed is comfy with generous share of toiletries for bathroom. Clean and comfortable and yes was a good experience. My only issue is the way to the spa is like labyrinth and we just lost interest to go there. The bar is beautiful and lively, good place to spend time after dinner .All in all it was a lovely city break being in a confortable place in a historical building. Yes would not mind staying there again when in Dublin.",4,2017,07,13
207,Wonderful staff and experience,Colin at the front desk offered the most amazing service checking us in after a long flight.  I wish all front desk agents were as professional and kind.   Our room was absolutely gorgeous for a two night stay.  Stay here if you have the opportunity.   I still dream about that breakfast.,5,2017,07,12
207,Bar visit ,"I visited the bar for a few drinks. Cocktails are excellent, as is the wine. 

The staff were very attentive and friendly. 

A great place to sit and relax, the interior is stunning and it's only 5 minutes walk to the pubs. ",5,2017,07,12
207,Total pampering!,"I booked the hotel for one night as we began our 12 day journey to Ireland.  I really only booked it because I had Marriott points and was not paying attention to the hotel.  Probably should have - very classy, luxurious, old hotel, priding itself on its service.  When we arrived, the desk clerk thought he had a room open but when we arrived at the door (luggage in the hands of the bellman), and used the key, the room was occupied.  Much embarrassment led to our enjoying a complimentary breakfast.  I used the word breakfast but again, I am understating as there were two rooms of beautifully prepared foods at buffet and a waiter who stood by the tables ready to provide any drink or food and complete service.   

The hotel is nice, rooms are nice, pool is beautiful and long enough for laps, exercise room very nice.  Location?  Cannot be beat.",5,2017,07,11
207,Historic and Great Location Front Desk Hurting,Recently stayed two nights with my family so we had two rooms.  Had tried to make MANY coordinations prior to arrival but NOTHING was done as planned.  Arrived early in the morning on a Sat so they were busy.  Although I had used the app and done an early check in it was still discovery learning and the woman checking me in could have cared less.  I stay over 100 nights a year in Marriott's so I have some expectation of what right looks like and this was not it. I was thanked for my loyalty and Gold Status although I am lifetime Platinum and currently Platinum Premier seemed odd.  A manager came over and quickly tried to make things right and apologized for the lack of internal coordination.  We eventually got two rooms but not without effort.  My guess is like stated before with an over 90% occupancy they do not have to work hard to get people to come and it is clear.  No issues with the rooms or breakfast all were very good.  Cannot beat the location. Overall we enjoyed our stay but never once felt appreciated for being there almost like we owed them for allowing us to come in. Seldom acknowledged by staff or doormen everyone way too busy looking busy. . Stayed at several other hotels in Ireland and most tried much harder to earn our repeat business and went out of their way to make us feel appreciated.,4,2017,07,11
207,Beautiful Hotel,"We only got to stay at this beautiful hotel for 1 night as we had a quick overnight visit to meet up with friends. The location is great a 2 minute walk from Grafton street. We got the airport bus which stops just round the corner, and over the road for the return journey which is very handy. The room was lovely and thought the turndown service was a nice touch, would highly recommend this hotel if you want a little luxury.",5,2017,07,11
207,Not 100% certain,"We stayed here one night last year and I reviewed that stay 5 stars. This year, I am uncertain. At one point during this most recent 6-day stay, they were pushing for 3. 

We checked in early on a Friday, around 10:30-11 AM, not expecting our room to be ready but happy to leave luggage and grab a drink at the bar or lunch somewhere. 

We booked 5 nights on Marriott points and one night we paid $450 for a room. 
We were not expecting an upgrade to a quite like last time. That stay was only one night and it must have been available. 

My husband is platinum elite and the woman at check-in was trying to find us a room available immediately, as the hotel was fully booked. 
She found a room for us after speaking with a supervisor. It was on the first floor with a view facing a wall. Or a roof of some sort. So no view, but no exterior noise either. 
Except that we ended up being on what sounded like a superhighway of a service hallway. I think we were near meeting rooms and definitely by a service room. The constant comings and goings and doors banging precluded any good sleep. The aircon was loud and I'm not sure what was above us but it sounded like elephants marching. I could hear water draining from above (?) and it was freaky.  The room was also dark.

My husband can sleep through anything and never complains about anything, but I am the lightest sleeper ever. 

One night they missed turndown, not such a big deal but just one of the inconsistencies we encountered. 
The lady who checked us in did not offer us a daily paper, which is fine, we could have asked for one. But she also did not offer my husband his complimentary amenity, which I think was drinks (which we would have gladly taken) or extra points. We did not want to ask about a gift, that’s awkward.  It was a very odd check-in experience. We were not given a map of the city. And it's unusual not to be acknowledged for the 175 nights my husband spends annually at a Marriott. (business travel and sad, really, to consider.) She never smiled and a few days later we noticed it was not just us, she's that way with everyone. When we waited at the desk a few days later, two other associates were asking about papers and offering maps. 

There was a huge wedding in the hotel so if we had been part of that, I assume our service might have been better? We would often leave or enter the hotel without acknowledgement by the many suits standing around. I felt like a second-class guest at times. The manager never left a message or a note for us, which is unusual. We typically get a phone call or a note of introduction and to ask how things are. I presumed management was busy with the wedding. 

Finally, after three nights of poor sleep (for me, my husband slept just fine) we spoke to Fatima, as we still had 3 nights left and I was exhausted. She did a great job in listening to our concerns and moving us to an alternative room.She was very helpful and professional. We packed our stuff, left it in our old room, and when we returned, we were on the 6th floor on the other side. (I think it is the Heritage side, to the right of the check in desk.) 

This room was much brighter, and after the first night, we realized the double paned window was open and closed it, it was MUCH MUCH quieter. The room was a little bigger as well. After that, I slept very well and the noise was much less. Very little traffic in the hallway. I was very grateful for the switch. I loved the dimming lights in the bathroom in both rooms, what a nice touch. Also the very nice bath rug on the cold tile floor. 

Breakfast was inconsistent. Somedays we would get toast, somedays no. We would ask and sometimes it would arrive, other times no. The bread and butter was, of course, very good, so depending on our schedule we would wait for it. One day we had to ask for everything, the next day, it was all there. The buffet itself is very large and varied so anyone can find something good and they had at least 6 juices available. You can also order off the menu, which was a nice treat. Their scrambled eggs were great, as was the French Toast. They have a huge selection of pastries.  Breakfast was a highlight here. 

Keith the concierge helped us change our Skyline Tour tickets, which we appreciated. He was very helpful and also printed an email for me when I could not remember my login to use the business center. 
I'm not sure we would spend what they're asking for a room. It's a great use of points. 
The location is stellar, close to everything. 
My husband mentioned in passing that he thought they were resting on their laurels somewhat. 
I loved all of the fresh flowers. Their florist is incredible and it added to the atmosphere. 
The wifi worked well and was not difficult to access. 
The beds were extremely comfortable with nice crisp linens. 
The room was very clean, housekeeping did a great job. 
When we asked for ice it was brought promptly. 
We had some room engineering issues and they were dealt with promptly and professionally. 
I did think it strange they do not offer in-room recycling or the option to reuse towels to better help the environment. 
I give it 4 stars because we used points, otherwise it would be 3.5.",4,2017,07,09
207,Old hotel with many positives,"The service here is impeccable--wonderful housekeeping staff and excellent amenities.  I enjoyed my stay.  Yes, the front part of the hotel where I stayed is very very old.  The floors are uneven and the doors don't fit the frames (so light floods into the room from the hall) but it is quiet and comfortable.  Well located and worth the steep price if you want a bit of historic luxury.",4,2017,07,09
207,A little piece of heaven on earth,"Just finished a two night break in the shelbourne, what can I say it just gets better with every visit.  We had an early check into  a recently refurbished room.  This room was fab, everything you could wish for. Comfy beds, lovely linen. The room and bathroom were spotless. Beautiful toiletries. Plenty of water etc.  The breakfast was fab.  Both bars great had drinks in both.  Also had a great massage from Eva. Thanks to everyone at the Shelbourne for making this hotel a place we just love to return to.  I highly recommend it. Can't wait for our next visit.",5,2017,07,07
207,Catch up,"Excellent food, wine and service. The General Manager should be proud of the staff in The Saddleroom. Very good wheelchair access and a toilet with very good turning space, excellent grab rails and toilet height all in pristine condition ",5,2017,07,07
207,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Customer Service, Wonderful restaurants","The Shelbourne lived up to the allure that it has always had.  The grand entrance to the wonderful people that work there make staying at the Shelbourne a fantastic experience.  When I arrived early on a Sunday morning, my room wasn't ready but they let me go down to the gym and shower and freshen up while I waited - what a difference that made after flying in from Newark overnight.  The location of this hotel is great and walkable to everything in Downtown Dublin - and if you are dying for  a Starbucks fix, there is one right down the street.  The wonderful park right out front was a great place to spend a few hours waiting for my room to be ready!!",5,2017,07,07
207,Historic hotel really delivers!,"Luxurious way to end our Irish vacation in Dublin! Our room overlooked the park and was stunning. Newly refurbished and tastefully decorated throughout the entry, bedroom and beautiful marble bathroom. Rooms are spacious, quiet and immaculate though the floors are a bit squeaky. Excellent service and staff attend to your needs. The Shelbourne is well located near Dublin restaurants, pubs and other highlights including the The National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology right around the corner on Kildare Street. Trinity College, Dublin Castle and shopping including Temple Bar are all within walking distance.",5,2017,07,07
207,Visit to lounge. ,"I always enjoy a visit to the Shelbourne, whether to the lounge for pre_ dinner drinks or Afternoon tea. This time was no exception. We spent a lovely relaxing couple of hours here before dinner. The bar staff were friendly and efficient. ",5,2017,07,06
207,A great end to a week in Ireland,What an absolutely beautiful hotel. As a Marriott member we were given a complementary upgrade with free wifi. Check in was a breeze. So fast. Rooms were so well appointed. There is a small area near check in that describes the history of the hotel. Beds were so comfy. AC worked fine. So glad we asked for a wake up call--might have missed our flight. Only criticism was it took 20 minutes for our car to be brought to the front of the hotel. Other than that we enjoyed our stay. Great location to all the sites too.,5,2017,07,06
207,An AMAZING hotel!,"The Shelbourne is such a wonderful place! It's located right next to St. Stephen's Green, a beautiful park to walk around in. All around the hotel are side streets and shops, again very nice to walk around and view Dublin. The staff at the Shelbourne are very helpful and kind, and the rooms are quite comfortable. Absolutely would recommend!",5,2017,07,06
207,Most iconic hotel in Dublin,"This is an amazing hotel and I highly recommend it to anyone who don't mind getting a rather small room as a tradeoff. The hotel common areas are so beautiful that I didn't really mind getting a small room, and I mean very tiny room and bathroom. Breakfast is also amazing and the whole decor is very classic and impressive. I get to stay at great hotels all the time and The Shelbourne is a memorable one!",4,2017,07,06
207,Classic elegance in Dublin,"We stayed at the Shelbourne Rennaissance for 3 nights in June. I am a platinum Marriott member, and I chose this hotel because it is a member of the Marriott family (the only one in Dublin proper). And being a Renaissance, I knew what to expect from previous stays at Marriott Renaissance properties.

I was not dispapointed. The check in was smooth and we were treated like royalty. Having status at Marriott has its rewards; we received a room upgrade, free wi-fi and restaurant/lounge privledges. There is no concierge lounge at this property.

Every amenity in the hotel was first class and the hotel is steeped in history (There is a little ""museum"" displaying some historic artifacts from the hotel's long history.) It is conveniently located on St. Stephen's Green, within easy walking distance to all of Dublin. 

The Saddle Room restaurant is very good, although we just ate breakfast there. The Horseshoe Bar was closed for most of our stay, but we did visit the first night there.

If you want some Irish luxury, go no further than the Shelbourne Rennaisance hotel.",5,2017,07,05
207,Classic Dublin Hotel,"Stayed here for a conference. The Shelbourne is a historic hotel. I think for Dublin it is classic and known. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Dublin is very temperate, but the heat and AC system for old hotels is hard to control. The hotel tries to make everything else very comfortable. The restaurant at the hotel is fine dining. Breakfast is a buffet, but lunch and dinner end up being a multi-course meal.",5,2017,07,04
207,Great classic hotel with great amenities,"This hotel is so classic and beautiful, with lots of amenities including a robe and slippers. The layout of the room is quite sophisticated and service is impeccable. Great bar and restaurant also. Beautiful place for a wedding. The park across the street is also ideal for an evening stroll. The staff was always pleasant and helpful.",5,2017,07,04
207,Underwhelmed,"Have wondered for years what it would be like to stay here having visited many times for lunch/drinks. 
Special occasion with the better half resulted in a treat night away. 
Despite the €400 per night price tag, the service on reception was perfunctory; the handle on the bathroom door in the bedroom fell off; a vacuum cleaner was left in the hall outside the door all night; and the soundproofing was such that we could hear the EXACT moment the lady next door reached her climax! 
Have had more comfortable nights in a Premier Inn (for less than a quarter of the price)!",3,2017,07,02
207,worth a mention!,"I would not usually be inclined to write reviews on the internet however, I stayed at The Shelbourne with my wife recently and it is worth a special mention.The hotel is centrally located within walking distance from all the main tourist attractions the room was modern with historic charm and the staff are a credit to the hotel, In particular the reception staff, we dealt with a very sweet girl from Galway who's name has slipped our minds however the young lady was the epitome of customer service. We will most definitely be making a trip back to Dublin and The Shelbourne in the near future.",5,2017,07,02
207,Get a Reservation for Afternoon Tea!,"We had a great stay at the Shelbourne.  Beautiful, historic, convenient to most of Dublin, spectacular in all regards.  We were lucky enough to be in one of the nice rooms in the historic part overlooking the Green.  The room was really spacious and delightfully appointed.  Service was excellent.  I had gotten reservations for the ""Alice in Wonderland"" themed afternoon tea as a surprise for my wife, and it couldn't have gone over any better.  Just wonderful in every respect.  If you're only going to be in Dublin once or twice in your life, you owe it to yourself to stay here.",5,2017,06,30
207,Not worth the price,"I used Marriott points to stay here, and I'm very glad I did not pay the going rate for this hotel. The property has a great deal going for it, primarily location and a rich history. The historical aspects of this hotel are wonderful and they even have a small museum with historical artifacts in it. We stayed in a king deluxe room and the room was huge, and the bed comfortable. However, there was a leak from the HVAC Unit--we reported it so they could fix it the next ay, and they did offer to send someone up but it was late at night and we had to get up at 3:30 am to catch a flight. The frustrating thing is that it was clear from the stains on the ceiling and carpet the leak has been going on a while with nobody fixing it. There was also a missing knob on a light and a weird slope in the room floor which could cause someone to trip. The computer in the business centre did not work. It was ridiculous. If you are going to have a business centre, at least have a computer that it not so old it can't run Windows 7 (and the internet was super slow). The staff seemed quite stuffy to me, the concierge indifferent, and the bartenders inattentive. I reported all the problems with the room and the business centre, and I it is not clear if anything was done to fix these problems. I love the history of this hotel and am glad I did not pay anything for the room or I would have been very annoyed.",3,2017,06,28
207,"Mostly good, some flaws when their should be zero for the price","Stayed in the Shelbourne as a special treat to my girlfriend to celebrate a milestone. Overall our experience was good but I should be saying excellent given we paid 220 euro for a night. 

I understand accessible rooms are needed and are a requirement but lets be honest, they are typically not as nice as the standard rooms, in particular the bathrooms. So was disappointing to be given a room with an accessible bathroom when I had paid so much for the room. We should of been given a choice on this.",3,2017,06,26
207,Pre Dinner Cocktails,"A must trip for anyone entertaining anyone visiting the city 
I brought my guest here for pre dinner cocktails , a highly impressive menu & service to match.
The staff at the Shelbourne didn't disappoint 
 ",4,2017,06,25
207,Great place ,"My associate and I were in Dublin the other day for a business related engagement at Trinity College. We were booked into the Shelbourne by our hosts. I have stayed in Dublin many times before but never here. Normally I stay at the Merrion just around the corner. 

I was impressed by the Shelbourne not only by the excellent and efficient reception staff but also by the overall feel and location of the hotel. 

Being situated on the Green it is within easy access to everything including the shopping area of Grafton Street and the lovely Peploes restaurant. 

The room was bright and airy. Everything was clean and in good condition. 

One thing that really impressed me was the super easy to use aircon. Just two big, easy to read knobs on the wall. I travel a lot and am fed up with super clever systems that I have to search the internet to find out how to set. 

Great stay. Great staff. Will go again.  ",4,2017,06,25
207,Magical Introduction to Dublin,"I expected a lot from The Shelbourne and so not disappointed! All the reviews I had read pre trip rated this hotel and now I have the pleasure to add mine!u
From the moment you arrive and are greeted by the doorman a little bit of Irish magic begins! The foyer is a floral fantasy and it just gets better and better. The check in is efficient and warm, the room delights and so it continues. The busy ground floor bars, gracious tea room and fine dining experience all superb. Apparently Princess Grace of Monaco loved this hotel and I can see why- I felt like a bit of a princess myself! The location is great and everything close and accessible. The Concierge aka ""The Navigator"" is a a most charming man who sent us on our way each day with maps, directions and suggestions to maximise our time in this fabulous city. Life is richer for having been to Dublin and even more so for staying at The Shelbourne! Loved it all!",5,2017,06,25
207,Fabulous Luxury Experience in the Heart of Dublin,"This was our first hotel of five on a two week tour of Ireland and what a way to start the tour!!  We arrived at the Shelbourne around noon, quite tired after an overnight flight from the states, expecting to wait for a 3 pm check-in.  Much to our surprise and delight, we were able to check in immediately, allowing us some time to refresh before the evening's welcoming reception.

The Shelbourne is located in the city center and faces St. Stephen's Green, a lovely park in which to take a lazy stroll and admire the beauty of the gardens.   Within easy walking distance are many attractions, including the National Museum of Ireland, National Library of Ireland, National Gallery of Ireland as well as Merrion Square, another lovely park.

Entering the hotel, we felt as though we'd stepped back in time to one that was more elegant and opulent.  The lobby was spacious, grandly decorated, though not ostentatious, and the staff quite attentive and friendly.  Our room was large, nicely furnished, quiet, clean and extremely comfortable.  For being in the city center, there was no street noise to disrupt sleeping, which we greatly appreciated..  What struck me was how the hotel interior, including guest rooms, common areas and restaurants, looked as though they'd been recently renovated without the hotel losing its charm and character.  I expected to find a bit of peeling wallpaper here or some aspect of the room that either worked poorly or not at all.  There were none to be found.  The hotel is a gem in the heart of the city and its staff as shining as the hotel itself.

We had breakfast every morning in the hotel as part of the tour package.  Breakfast choices were quite extensive - from a self-service breakfast bar of fruits, cereals, breads, pastries and juices to ordering from a menu.  Coffee, tea and toast was brought to the table and was well brewed and piping hot.  With a selection as extensive as it was, each guest had a variety from which to choose every morning. 

Lunch and dinner were available in one of several in-hotel restaurants.  Again, within easy walking distance are a variety of bars, cafes and restaurants to sample.

The hotel also has a spa and extensive fitness center, which, sadly, we hadn't time to experience.

In summary, The Shelbourne was a delightful experience on all fronts and definitely a tough act to follow.  Should we return to Dublin, the Shelbourne would be our hotel of choice.",5,2017,06,21
207,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is beautiful as advertised large clean rooms. Comfortable beds , oversized bathrooms with all the bells & whistles.  This is a very expensive hotel with a charming history .  I would never stay here again.  We arrived at 5:30 am and were greeted by 2 very nice Gents who made us coffee and explained (as expected) our room was being readied and we should go for a walk or relax and return in an hour .
We did this and they had gone off duty & were replaced by a very Smug young man who explained 
We should not expect s room on a Sunday at this hour ,  we attempted to explain that we were surprised the other agents had told us a room was being prepared.
He chuckled and said we were never told that.  He had a manner of Snobbery and spoke to us in a most condescending way,  I was furious and I would 
Left if we had not reserved for several days.
This young man set the tone for our stay ,  I canceled our reservation for Tea because after the treatment we were subject to I was not spending another $ or Euro at this hotel.  
The Bell man and luggage hauler were the only people with good customer service skills at this hotel.
Send your agents back for training,  as they need some ""people skills"".
Or send them to a B&B to see how customers
Should be treated at half the price.",3,2017,06,21
207,Beautiful start to our Ireland vacation,"Stunning hotel in the heart of Dublin.  The hotel was very accommodating by allowing us to get into our room whe we arrived from the states.  This touch made the start of our vacation so much nicer since we were able to get cleaned up before heading out for the day.  Rooms were beautiful, very clean.  Staff was outstanding!  We can hardly wait to come back.  Thank you!",5,2017,06,21
207,Very good hotel,"Stayed one night at the Shelbourne last week on one of my recurrent business trips to Dublin.  All in all a good experience. Nice room, good size, clean, well equipped, good bed with good sleep quality. I used the room service for lunch one day and service was good, on time, and good food quality.  It is a very good hotel and after The Merrion, my preferred alternative in Dublin.

The only slight negative, and reason why I don´t give the hotel the highest rating, is due to the air conditioning.  I was in Dublin on a very hot day, and the AC,besides being extremely noisy, it was not very effective and room was not cool at all.  I suggest the hotel to review the AC system.",4,2017,06,21
207,Nice but not worth the price,"To be fair we landed early in the day and attempted to check in early. The room was not ready so we checked our luggage at the hotel and left our number so we could be notified when the room was ready. 
We returned several hours later, checked in to a very small room after waiting for a painfully slow elevator. Two hours after we were the room we were notified our room was ready.
The location is ideal and centrally located for seeing the city however it sounds like they are living off their reputation. The room and amenities just don't warrant the high price. ",3,2017,06,21
207,The most comfortable hotel in Dublin,"The Shelbourne is the place to stay in central Dublin. The rooms are very comfortable despite not being very large. The people are very friendly and helpful though occasionally a little slow. The concierges are knowledgeable and follow up efficiently. The location is convenient. Prices are rather high though not outrageously so. My family and I have stayed hete happily on several occasions so if you are willing to pay, this is the place to head for.",4,2017,06,21
207,Best Hotel in the City,"I've stayed here twice in the past 2 years and have never been disappointed by this historic hotel where the Irish Constitution was worked on. It's a 10 minuet walk to Trinity College, the waterfront, the main stopping street and the bar district. The service is excellent, the food is good, the facilities are beautiful, the rooms large, and well maintained and clean. I did have reservations at the Westin but switched at the last second to the Shelbourne, although are both associated with Marriott now. We stopped by the Westin and it was quite disappointing in the public areas compared to the Shelbourne.",5,2017,06,21
207,Best in Dublin!,"Amazing hotel in a great location.  High end hotel that does everything well. Rooms are great and lobby bars, restaurants and washrooms are all top notch. I'd recommend this to anyone visiting Dublin who like the ""best"".",5,2017,06,19
207,Delightful Hotel In The Center Of The Action,"We enjoyed our two night stay at the Shelboune.  Our room was spacious with a wonderful walk in Shower!!  The walk in closet included a safe and plenty of room.
Bed was very comfortable!!

The staff was friendly and quite helpful!! 

Dining Facilities are exceptional!!  Take the time to learn the history of this place!!  Have a drink in the historic bar!!

Enjoy the sitting room and gorgeous flower arrangements!!  See if you can find the Elvis painting!!

This hotel is close to the university and Book of Kells - several museums - and across the street from the park St Stevens!!!!",5,2017,06,19
207,Grand Hotel in Every Sense,"Spectacular hotel in the center of Dublin. Location on the park and easy walk to major shopping streets, such as Grafton. Excellent food - Afternoon Tea a delight. Took Irish cousins for tea and they were thrilled and, frankly, awed. Service was wonderful and thoughtful. Accommodations were first-rate. Cannot recommend more highly. However, do not make Dublin your only Ireland stop. Ireland is NOT about big cities - it is about the country-side, particularly the West. But if in Dublin, highly recommend the Shelbourne.",5,2017,06,19
207,really lovely,"we stayed here for a night over the weekend 
purely for the ambiance and the prestige that is the shelbourne hotel  and to cross off the bucket list.
check in staff were very nice and very professional and efficient 
the room was fantastic mind you we did have an issue with the AC which was leaking water on to the carpet and smelled pretty bad 
but never the less it would not put me off staying here again 
we had some food in the bar and it was top class really liked it 
all in all this is a very fine hotel and would certainly go back",5,2017,06,19
207,Not what it used be!,"Staying here every time we visit Ireland. This year it's noticeably different. Previously we were greeted with a 'welcome back' and a lovely Irish smile. Gone is that personal touch that made it an enjoyable stay. Now it's an impersonal robotic experience. Despite our near annual visit they felt obliged to put us in a room the size of a shoebox. Lost is its charm because the simple things like a genuine greeting a welcome and a good morning are forgotten. We walked past 4 staff to go for our morning walk and no response. The difference is clearly in personnel but failure is as always with management. 

Anyway given the price and what you get for it we will not be staying again. ",2,2017,06,19
207,Absolutely Perfect,"My sisters and I came for afternoon tea for my birthday and it was fantastic.

From start to finish the service, food and attention to detail was immaculate. The set up of the hotel is fabulous and very comfortable and relaxing. A lovely ambience and each table has its own staff member attending to them - they are trained very well in accommodating their guests!!

The food was delicious and I would be back tomorrow to eat it all!

Highly recommend this superb hotel for an afternoon out!",5,2017,06,19
207,Dublin can be heaven,"""Dublin can be heaven
With coffee at eleven
And a stroll in Stephens Green""
No where epitomises the spirit of this song more than the Shelbourne , if you fancy treating yourself to a little bit of heaven , in Dublin, it's the place to go. We stayed overnight for the Robbie Williams concert and my friend was upgraded to a suite, which consisted of a sitting room , large bedroom with king and double beds and a large bathroom with double sinks bath and shower and luxurious elemis toiletries. The beds were incredibly comfortable piled high with pillows and crisp white linens. Breakfast was delicious including full irish and continental options as well as omelette or eggs benediction made to order as well as pancakes and a special juice  bar. Although on a busy Street the room was quiet due to soundproofing on the windows, although I did hear a horse Clop by around 10 in the morning, by no means an unpleasant sound, it reminded me of the rich history of the hotel and how that's what guests would've heard 100 years ago. Our suite faced the park which was very pleasant. Staff were friendly and helpful. There was some confusion at checkout over our room upgrade but that was resolved quickly enough, just be careful and double check if booking using marriott club points as there seems to be an  going issue. Overall a delightful experience. ",5,2017,06,18
207,Simply perfect,"After a week driving around Ireland we concluded the trip in Dublin at the Shelbourne.
Although very busy and check-in not possible much earlier than 4pm this hotel is perfect in any ways.

We got a room on 8th floor of the new part. Great air comdition, great bed. Typical Marriott standard.

Nice public rooms, great drinks at the bar.

But the best, at our last dring I forgot a shopping bag in the bar. At 11:30pm a know at the room door and the nice bar man asking if we forgot this. I would not have realized that I lost it.

The best hotel of our trip. We will come back!",5,2017,06,17
207,another world,"traveling with a couple of friends to go to a wedding in Cork we decided to stop and take in the sights of Dublin for a day or two and decided to treat are selfs with a stay in a 5-star hotel.
 when you walk into this hotel that seems to be from a bygone era of opulence and grandeur that is breathtaking to behold. Think the roaring 20s mixed in with royalty. That may not make sense but it's the words that come to mind just when you walk in the door.",5,2017,06,15
207,Christmas perfect!,"There is no where in Dublin I enjoy more on Christmas eve than in the bar of the Shelbourne. When you walk through the beautiful wooden and brass doors and into the long with the magnificent tree and the place a flutter with people, it feels so festive. The large train set beside the check in desk for the hotel is well worth a peek! The staff are always welcoming no matter how busy the day might be and although in Grande settings, there is a very relaxed atmosphere.",5,2017,06,14
207,Absolutely lovely hotel!,"We stayed for 4 nights last week and it we absolutely loved it!  From the moment you walk in and see the beautiful flowers in the lobby you will be impressed. Our room was quite spacious and very quiet. Your housekeeping does a wonderful job. Your location is perfect...you can walk to restaurants, shopping and pubs in minutes. Thank you for such a lovely stay.",5,2017,06,12
207,Best hotel in dublin,"We have stayed here many times and it is a very special place. The atmosphere, location for shopping and bar for people watching are second to none. We always stay in a heritage park view room which is very luxurious and spacious. Treated so well by the staff during our most recent 2 night stay and will be returning again soon.",5,2017,06,12
207,Wonderful Way to Start our 11 day Journey,"As Marriott Reward members we selected the Shelbourne for our first 2 nights in Ireland.  The reviews were spot on.  This is a fabulous property.  The breakfast was outstanding and the cocktail bar the great way to end a busy day exploring Dublin.

The location simply cannot be beat!  Right across the street from St Stephen's Green - a must see garden. 

The service was impeccable!  Accommodated our early check in request as we arrived at 1030 am from International Flight. 

Highly recommend a stay.",5,2017,06,12
207,"Great hotel, wonderful staff and had a pleasant stay.","The hotel was in a great location; the room and amenities were great.  Stayed for 5 nights and the staff was excellent. Being a Gold Elite member, the hotel provided early check in.  The breakfast was excellent and the bar and restaurants were excellent.  I would go back to this hotel on my next visit to Dublin as well.",5,2017,06,11
207,Magnificent,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for a family wedding at the nearby Catholic Church.  It was a family event with family members from Ireland and the majority from Manchester.  The staff at this hotel are the best we have ever experienced, nothing was too much trouble for them. Whatever small request we made it was attended to with smiles, humour and graciousness by staff from all parts of the world.  On arrival in a heatwave we were offered delicious freshly made lemonade at check- in followed by courtesy drinks in the beautiful bar as our room was not quite ready.  With so many family members present we had a wonderful time, complimented by the stunning Georgian decor, cleanliness and superb staff.  Breakfast was terrific, no queues, high quality food and wonderfully kind staff waiting on.  A problem with our room on one night resulted in an upgrade, abject apology and credit for the night.  This was far and above what was necessary but it was very much appreciated.  The young lady manager who dealt with us was so caring and thoughtful. I would like to thank the staff for all their hard work at the wedding reception as well.  We had a fabulous time filled with laughter and love, we will remember it for many years to come.  Thanks to all staff at the Shelbourne.",5,2017,06,10
207,Outstanding service!!!,"Everything about my experience at The Shelbourne far surpassed my expectations, but the one thing that stands out was the outstanding service of each of its employees. They were friendly, knowledgeable, efficient, while not being overbearing. 

The hotel itself is beautifully maintained. Although it is a large hotel, its design keeps it feeling cozy & inviting. And each of the bars & restaurants had fantastic cocktails & the food was inventive & delicious!! Looking forward to my next stay at The Shelbourne!",5,2017,06,09
207,"Good Location, Decent Rooms, Terrible Service in No. 27 Bar","I will start with the good aspects of this hotel: location, decent rooms (though not quiet rooms), and a historic hotel. The front desk reception is good, breakfast is decent. 

The service in the No. 27 Bar is terrible.  I provided this feedback to the hotel while I was there, but they were dismissive.  Multiple times I, and other patrons, flagged down servers to ask for beverages or food.  Sometimes the servers would say they'd be over, but they would never come over.  Often times they would help someone next to us, but refuse to make eye contact with us as they walked past our table after helping others.  We even got up from the table to ask for service, to no avail.  Yes, it was busy but there were servers standing around.  The entire experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  I travel extensively and frequently throughout the world and have never experienced such abysmal service.",3,2017,06,09
207,A World Class Choice and the best hotel in Dublin,"This Glamorous Luxury Hotel provides truly high quality end-to-end experience. The Hotel is a Renaissance Brand Hotel of the Marriott Family, but somehow it felt a little bit more like JW Marriott Hotel as it was not as young and trendy as Renaissance Hotels usually are. Moreover, the hotel was located right next to the St Stephen's Green Park. 

The room was very spacious with a great bed and bathroom. Service Level at the hotel whether it was at the front desk, restaurants or sports facilities was very good. There are multiple restaurants and bars, which are all lively and offer great opportunities to enjoy and relax with good food and drinks. One of the restaurants also serves a legendary Afternoon Tea Service. 

I really enjoyed the spa, pool, gym and steam room, which were all top quality. The Spa's relax room was overlooking St Stephen's Green Park, which was a very nice surprise.",5,2017,06,08
207,Beautiful place ,The Shelbourne Bar is fantastic but pricy for food. Portion sizes average. Food nice. Atmosphere is great. Hotel rooms at the back of the hotel have only views over offices which are not pretty so get a room facing St.Stephens Green or second best onto the side street. ,4,2017,06,08
207,Afternoon Tea at the Shelbourne...a splendid occasion,"Went as a treat for Afternoon Tea in the Shelbourne with wife and 2 kids (aged 7 and 9). Were a bit anxious as didn't know how welcoming they would be to kids for such an occasion but our anxiousness was totally misplaced. From the really welcoming phone call the day before to our arrival it was fab. The attention to detail is incredible...down to the fact that our boys menu was blue whilst our girls menu was pink. It was all framed around Alice in Wonderland and our waitress (Lauren I think) did a great job in explaining it all. The afternoon tea for both kids and adults was impeccably presented. There is a great variety in the sweet selection and, whilst not all to our taste, was exactly as you would expect for a high end afternoon tea.
This is a definite treat occasion, not something to do every week but a really special thing to look forward to. Would not hesitate to recommend it",5,2017,06,07
207,A Gem in Marriott's Profile,"I cannot explain how wonderful this hotel is, all Marriott's should be measured compared to this one. The hotel is beautiful, the historic building and the beautiful interior. The location is wonderful near St. Stephens Green and walking distance to almost everywhere. The room was beautifully appointed and had everything you needed. Including one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever stayed in. The real star of this property is the staff, they were so kind and helpful at every juncture. They were so kind and helpful in figuring out our daily activities. We also had a child staying with us, they went above and beyond to accommodate her. One staff member even brought her a Shelbourne teddy bear to remember her trip. It was truly a special property, I hope I get the opportunity to return.",5,2017,06,04
207,Pitiful,"There are two good things about this hotel... the location and the beautiful lobby. Other than that, I would stay elsewhere. The rooms per the website are proclaimed as ""sound proof"" and I am hear to tell you they are not. When I checked into the hotel, I requested a quiet room. The following morning I was awoken with loud banging from the house keeping service area and rattling glasses (who knew rattling glasses could be so loud). I called downstairs to complain and asked for the staff to be conscientious of sleeping patrons ( the noise started approximately 6 am) and when that didn't work I went into the hall and with exacerbation requested quietness which i'm sure alarmed the house keeper- it became much more quiet after this..... so it is possible...then, in the late afternoon, because I hadn't slept well the night before, I decided to take a nap, only to be awoken a short time later because of the same issue. Before retiring that evening, I spoke with the front desk, asking them to please relay a message to the house keeping ( now that I was aware they could actually pipe down when they wanted) to please be aware of the noise associated with their work and how it affects sleeping people, the front desk attendant said he would relay the info to house keeping. Do you think this helped?? Absolutely not! Again I called the front desk and asked for them to quiet down the next morning .... do you think this helped?? Absolutely not!! I chose this hotel because it said the rooms were quiet- over many other hotels that were 1/2 the price. There are MANY hotels in Dublin, and I paid a large amount of money to avoid being disturbed in my sleep. My advice is, don't stay here. Not only is it noisy, but the service is terrible- waited 45 minutes for a bowl of soup ( I can't imagine it taking 45 mins to ladle anything) and 45 mins to get a refill on my drink- evidently 45 mins is the magic time. The oysters we ordered were horribly fishy as well- again - my recommendation- stay elsewhere. ",1,2017,06,04
207,Espresso martini heaven,"We went to the bar on the left and got stools at the bar. Even though it was packed the staff were so friendly and efficient. The espresso martini was amazing with a little mint leaf to top it off. They give you little nibbles with your drinks too, which is always a nice touch!",5,2017,06,03
207,Luxury in Dublin City Centre,"Great location, brilliant service, delicious food and excellent spa. One qualm is that the room was on the small side with a view of the bins. The Sunday night spa package is excellent value and saved us a lot of money",4,2017,06,02
207,"History, location and quality","This hotel is steeped in Irish history and sits right on St. Stephen's Green in the heart of Dublin. They could easily skate by on their pedigree and location, but they don't. They provide superb service and very comfortable and well-appointed rooms. I booked using airline miles, so my ""view"" was a couple of walls and a rooftop, but that truly didn't detract from my stay much. Dublin is wonderfully walk-able and this hotel makes a great central hub. The concierges are incredibly knowledgeable and eager to help. It's a first-class experience.",5,2017,06,02
207,Sensational supper! ,"My mum and I booked in for a meal at the Shelbourne as it looked quite nice. When we got there it definitely exceeded all expectations! The food, service and atmosphere were absolutely outstanding! Easily one of the best meals I've had. A must do! ",5,2017,06,02
207,The Saddle Room,"Its my favourite hotel in Dublin and its hard to beat the Shelbourne for location, atmosphere and service.  We had a fabulous meal in the Saddle Room restaurant.  The food was absolutely exquisite!  If you want to treat someone you love or celebrate a special occasion you really couldn't fail to impress.  Service is excellent and staff are so friendly and helpful.  I'll be back!",5,2017,06,02
207,Top Notch !,"We had flown a red-eye to Dublin and wanted a Nice place to land that first night.  Luckily, my husband was able to use points, as the price is steep.  We were thrilled.  We were upgraded to a room with a patio!  Not a great view, but rooftops and  a church steeple, but a table, two chairs and an ash tray for his cigar!  Just right for relaxing late night.  It is directly across from St Stephens green and it was an easy to walk to the Temple Bar area, Trinity College and Cathedrals.  The service was fantastic!  If you asked for something to be delivered to the room (ice for instance), it was there in about a minute! The lobby is elegant and so is the bar.  Just a beautiful facility. The bellman even wore a top hat!  Class all the way around.  We saw the pool and fitness center and they looked great, but we just did not have time.  The breakfast was included for us (29E) and again:  elegant.  China and white tablecloths, a hot buffet and fruit, pastries, meats& cheese.  There must have been ten toppings for the oatmeal.  If you have a chance, stay here to feel pampered.",5,2017,06,01
207,Great hotel with great history,"I reckon the best hotel in Dublin.
Professional business like service

Fairly full in summer months.
Paid for room upgrade for twin beds amd ended up with a room with no view. Disappointing. Front desk should have warned that this ""upgraded"" room has a lousy view of a unkempt airwell. Having stayed in this hotel a few years ago i had expected a more caring front desk.

View of airwell attached.",3,2017,06,01
207,one of the classic grand style hotels,"set in a great location in the centre of the city. Excellent front of house service. Restaurant and bar serves excellent food but the service was inconsistent sometimes great and sometimes a little indifferent

rooms great. Expensive hotel but that's what you expect for 5*",4,2017,05,31
207,Great Location - small rooms,"We were so looking forward to ending our trip with a 3 night stay here at this well known iconic hotel.

We were shown to our Queen size room and there was barely enough room to walk around the bed!

Locating a spot for our luggage so that the door was not blocked took a bit of maneuvering.

The small ventless bathroom was another drawback. A receding door and not much space for toiletries - no bath tub.

On the plus side, the bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, housekeeping were early so our room was cleaned when we returned from breakfast. It is a great location.

The staff (hundreds of them) were polite, efficient and friendly.

The Horseshoe Bar and The Saddle Room were both great for a cocktail.
Breakfast at the Shelbourne seems to be a bit of a rip off - we ventured out the hotel for 2 of our 3 day visit.

All in all, just not as spacious as we expected - especially for the price!",3,2017,05,30
207,Perfect,"We stayed here 5 nights, couldnt have asked for better. Location was great, walking distance to almost everything. Staff was helpful with directions, arranging cabs, purchasing tickets for tours etc.The unexpected add in of included breakfast (Marriott gold perk) was great. The afternoon tea was the highlight of our stay at the Shelbourne",5,2017,05,30
207,Beautiful hotel ,"We stayed at the Shelbourne in Dublin for three nights. Everything was great except for the checkout.
Prior to our arrival I received an email from a guest service coordinator who told me that breakfast is 19 euros per person and there is no charge for my 7 year old. This was also confirmed upon check in.
However upon check out I got charged for my son as well. Manager got called who seemed to be unaware of the no charge for children. He was actually kind of rude and said to me: ""who told you that?"" 
I showed him the email I received but he still went to the kitchen to double check. 
I think for such a large and fency hotel this is kind of a petty thing to do. 
Otherwise we had no other problems. Room was slightly on the small side but clean, quiet and comfortable. ",4,2017,05,30
207,Truly the Grande Dame of Dublin hotels,I've stayed here several times.  This hotel is elegant and comfortable in a great location across from St. Stephen's Green and an easy walk to Grafton St. etc.  Service is wonderful and the breakfast a well appointed delight.  I look forward to another stay.,5,2017,05,29
207,"History, beauty and convenience!","I have stayed in this beautiful hotel twice. I love the history of it, the beauty of it and the convenience. I first stayed here because I knew it was a hotel I could trust and it was part of the Marriott Rewards program. I had no idea of how perfect it would be and returned to it again for the same reasons. The views are spectacular and it is located across from St. Stephen's Square. The tour buses stop across the street and a wonderful mall and Nassau Street are only a couple of blocks away! Interesting fact: most taxi's honor a ""no more than"" amount to take you to and from the airport to the hotel.",5,2017,05,29
207,Excellent in every way,"We spent 3 nights at The Shelbourne and many people told us that we were staying at the best hotel in Dublin, and I was inclined to agree.  It was opulent, tasteful, incredibly comfortable and luxurious enough to rival any hotel in the world.  The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient and there were plenty of food and drink options in the three restaurants/bars.  

I'd definitely stay there again.",5,2017,05,29
207,"Five Star Luxury, Amazing Service","The Shelborne is a beautiful luxury hotel set on St. Stephen's Green in Dublin, well-located to nearby sites, dining and shopping. The hotel rivals any Ritz Carlton that I've visited. The restaurant serves a wonderful breakfast buffet and the bar is an elegant place for a drink.",5,2017,05,26
207,The best of the best,"The absolute best hotel in Dublin.  This is the choice hotel for celebrities and other well known people.  Beautiful hotel with an amazingly friendly staff.  This has all the best things going for it; great bar, great restaurant and also tea time.  If you want a fantastic hotel close to Dublin, this is the one.",5,2017,05,25
207,A jewel ...,"This is a superb hotel 😀
Truly deserving of all its stars.
I have never stayed as it is way out of my price bracket.

But afternoon tea in the lobby...
A drink in the Horse shoe bar ...

Truly delightful reminder of an elegant Dublin.

Don't like their trendy and modern bar ....",5,2017,05,25
207,"Luxury, comfort and service in a great location","We stayed three nights and enjoyed our stay. 

The greeters and valets were friendly and helpful.  Our original room was a discomfort because of blaring outside neon lights and a view of only the trash area, but they gladly moved us to a better location. The room is spacious enough for two, with a comfortable bed, mattress and pillows. (One more sitting chair would ne nice but might crowd the room) 

We enjoyed the main bar for drinks and for people watching (not so much for the food) and the Saddle Room for breakfast all three days and dinner twice.  Their breakfast buffet has everything and it was well prepared. At 29 Euro per person, I'm glad it was included in the room fee.  The Saddle Room had very nice dinners - we partook of the ""pre-theatre"" menu and were very happy with the offerings.  The starters and entrees all had a good variety of flavors and were perfectly prepared although portions were on the small side. Desserts were excellent.

The location is perfect - we could walk to the National Museum and the Little Museum, as well as to the shops on Grafton Street or for a stroll through St. Stephens Green.  If you're prepared to pay five-star prices for a five-star product, you will be pleased.",5,2017,05,25
207,Poor customer service,"This hotel has a wonderful history in Dublin.
We had a lovely recently renovated room,no complaints there.
But service left a lot to be desired.
Hotel guests are treated as second class citizens, well behind outsiders who fill up the bar and lounge eating and drinking.
The lounge is not available to guests until 8.30pm because it is used for afternoon teas. Staff were rude and uncompromising.
Pity it is not Irish owned,would be a different story I suspect(it is a Marriott hotel!!)",3,2017,05,23
207,Top Notch in every way,"This is an unbelievably beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin, sporting top hatted doormen and gleaming marble.  Fresh flowers adorn the lobby.  The rooms are superb and the beds beyond comfortable.  Service impeccable.  Being a vegan, I requested a vegan meal in their restaurant.Now, vegans, Ireland is very tough for us and most places, as I want on with my tour, served almost inedible food.  But this place, awed me with the meal they prepared for me.  Gourmet, delicious and creative!  I hated to leave this hotel.",5,2017,05,23
207,Great hotel!,"We stayed at the Shelbourne on our first night in Ireland, to avoid driving after a long flight.  It was such a wonderful experience that we have booked another stay on our return. An old style hotel with modern amenities.  Very friendly, helpful staff, especially the Navigator (Concierge) who gave us us excellent restaurant recommendations.  Great location- you can walk to almost anywhere in Dublin.  Looking forward to our return visit.",5,2017,05,22
207,Great hotel,"Great hotel in great location.  Park across the street for afternoon walks and to view the swans; best shopping streets in Dublin within blocks and lots of restaurants within walking distance.  The hotel is beautifully appointed and very comfortable.  Also, do take the hop-on, hop-off bus to Guiness, etc",5,2017,05,22
207,Always an excellent experience... even for a quick lunch.,"Every time we are in Dublin it feels compulsory to nip into the shelbourne bar to experienced first class service and Guinness. Polite and efficient staff, whatever age, were there to greet us. The tempura batter on my fish and chips was divine.",4,2017,05,21
207,Wonderful pub lunch ,"After a long day of walking on a historical tour, I had a late lunch here. It was a beautiful historic bar with lovely panted murals on the wall. The fish and chips and the sticky toffee pudding were excellent. The tea was great and came with tiny cookies. The chairs were comfortable and the service was great. I used the free internet on my lap top while waiting for my food and had a delicious peaceful midday respite. I loved the restaurant atmosphere and food and though not inexpensive was worth it!",5,2017,05,20
207,A Perfect Way to Spend Your Last Day in Dublin,"I made a reservation online for lunch at the famous Shelbourne Hotel across from St. Stephen's Green. While waiting for the restaurant to open, I looked at their little museum which contained a drafts of the first Irish Constitution written at the Shelbourne in 1922. What a delightful find! The lunch and service were absolutely first-class!  It is not a place for people to ask how much the wine is!  Sit back and enjoy the atmosphere and experience of dining in this gracious hotel from another era.",5,2017,05,19
207,Home Town stay,"Stayed in the Shelbourne for two nights.  I'm from Dublin originally but a long time away.  We were in town for a family birthday celebration and wanted to stay centrally. One thing to note, Central Dublin is a shambles with the works for the Luas link (tram system).   Choose wisely or ask the hotel how close the ""works"" are to the property.   The Shelbourne hotel was excellent (not near construction).  Quite traditional décor in the US style (owned by a US Corp) but nice enough.  Service was excellent.  Nice pool, didn't use gym but Spa staff also excellent.  Organised family birthday celebration in the Saddle Room which was also excellent.",5,2017,05,19
207,One of my top choices,Stayed there for a business trip and had a great experience! Everything was exceptional. The only comment is that the continental breakfast selection was exactly the same every day and would have like a bit of variety. If you have Marriott status you need to know that there is no concierge/executive lounge. They try to make up for it with free breakfast and a couple free drink coupons. ,5,2017,05,18
207,Disappointed,"Having watched the programme on t.v, about the Shelbourne maybe I was expecting too much. We reserved two rooms as we were a family of five.  Having arrived at 5pm one of our rooms was not ready, this was not acceptable at 5 O Clock in the evening, the receptionist was unfriendly and no apology on why our room was not ready. We only  got enough towels for four people each morning??? Breakfast was good, please learn how to cook bacon and not cremate it, this is basic cooking not acceptable for a five star hotel. 

The only friendly staff we encountered were the doormen, they were great, friendly, happy and willing to help. So a big thank you to them. The rest of the hotel staff looked to the ground rather than say ""Hello"".

I must go back again and check was it really a t.v. programme about the Shelbourne or did I get the wrong programme !!!!",3,2017,05,18
207,Excelent location,"The location is perfect, the hotel is very beautiful and the service very good.
We arrived early morning and the check in was great, they help us with storing our luggage till the room was ready. The rooms are tastefully designed with loads of charm. The internet is fast and stable. The customer service was outstanding in all areas. Breakfast is very good!",5,2017,05,17
207,Excellent,We had a wonderful experience when we stayed  at the Shelbourne in April  We were staying in Dublin for a girls weekend.Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful especially at reception .Dinner was top class as was the wine.We had  treatments   at the heavenly Spa .Going back again very soon and looking forward  to  staying a little longer,5,2017,05,17
207,Dublin Delight!,The hotel was old style elegance. The service impeccable. Location perfect. Easy walk to all major attractions in Dublin. The St. Stephens Green is directly across the street from the hotel and was in full spring bloom just gorgeous.  Food excellent. Would stay there again without hesitation!,5,2017,05,17
207,Wonderful Stay,"Great experience at this beautiful hotel in great location.  The staff was friendly, the place was clean and very well maintained.  Would definitely stay again.  The breakfast spread was nice and the Saddle Room bar met all our expectations.  Loved the location across from St. Stephens Green.  Accessibility from here to the places in the city was easy.  We didn't have dinner there any of the 3 nights we stayed so can't comment on that.",5,2017,05,16
207,Weekend in Dublin,"Friends (Dublin locals) highly recommended The Shelbourne for a long weekend getaway from Chicago. We arrived tired from our overnight flight. The check in at reception was as expected, smooth with no problems. Our room wasn't quite ready so we hit the Number 27 lobby bar to grab coffees. The bar is beautiful and the lattes were delicious. The first of many beverages at Number 27.  After drinks we were escorted to our newly renovated upgraded room. The rooms are tastefully designed with loads of charm. 
We ordered morning coffee and juice everyday. The fresh juice menu is fantastic. The first green drink listed is so good I never tried another. We had heard the brunch is one of the best in Dublin but with our jet lag and late nights we sadly never made it to brunch. 
We were perfectly pleased with our stay although likely didn't fully experience the hotel amenities. Of those we experienced, Number 27 Bar & Lounge (several times) and room service we had only good experiences. 
I plan to return in less than a month for a bit of a longer stay. The Shelbourne is class, comfort and style. ",5,2017,05,16
207,Gorgeous property with excellent customer service,"I stayed two nights recently at the end of a week in Ireland.  It was a great way to finish off an amazing trip.  The Shelbourne is a gorgeous property with lots of history.  Make sure you take a few minutes to explore their small but detailed museum located near the front desk.  The customer service was outstanding in all areas.  The location is excellent as well.  It was easy and quick to get to all the places we were trying to see before we had to leave.  The room was small, but beautifully decorated.  Although it was a bit difficult to get to the spa and fitness center because it is a little labyrinthine, it was worth the effort as both places, too, have great customer service and are well appointed.  Even if you don't stay, make an effort to go have afternoon tea or a drink at the Horseshoe Bar, where Irish history was made.",5,2017,05,16
207,Five star hotel,This is a true five star hotel. It's an old building but well maintained and the service and staff is top notch. Literally there to solve a problem before you can even ask. I would stay here every time in Dublin. The rooms were gorgeous and clean. We were upgraded to a room which had a balcony and was great for getting some fresh air.  The drinks we had from the bar were as good as the get for cocktails and breakfast was a really good thorough buffet. Don't hesitate to stay here  ,5,2017,05,15
207,Love this hotel across the street from St. Stephen's Green,"The outside is impressive. Then the door man smiles and you step in to a classy place. The room was beautiful and very clean. The saddle room restaurant was very good. They also have a great buffet in the mornings. The bar called no. 27 lounge is a hopping place. The oyster bar was most tempting. The staff through out the hotel were very friendly, it' a 5 star hotel so you need to bring the purse!  👍",5,2017,05,15
207,Amazing Amazing Amazing!,"Top notch, cannot fault The Shelbourne, expensive but definitely worth the extra €'s. €450 for a 1 night stay but my god the place is stunning, I couldn't fault a thing, the rooms were spotless, bathroom spotless, the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! Elemis shampoo, conditioner & body lotion. Gorgeous scented bath salts. I had forgotten my eyeliner but the salon downstairs gave me a loan of some. Great deal on early morning blowdry only €30. Lauren in the salon was brilliant. I only ate in the bar that evening but my god the food is also amazing! In my opinion their Strawberry & Rhubarb Crumble with ice cream is THE BEST dessert I've ever tasted! Amazing!!! The breakfast was amazing! A choice of literally anything you wanted! I wish I had a big fat bank account as I'd be staying here a lot if I did! Just incredible!",5,2017,05,13
207,Impeccable Service,"We visited the Shelbourne Easter Weekend.  This historic hotel is beautiful. The overall property is in great condition. I found that there wasn't much 'lobby space' to sit if needed.  This is a very old building, so it is understandable.  The rooms are tiny.  For a family of 3, we found ourselves on top of each other. There is no concierge lounge, and with the lobby space being so minimal, we felt we had no where to go to spread out. I also wasn't surprised for no upgrade (as a Platinum Premier). Upgrades are far-and-few these days.  Our room view was overlooking the top of the lower portion of the building.  It was terrible.  The property is beautiful, but the comfort for a family of 3 was not great.  The rooms are too small for families.  

There are a few restaurants onsite.  Breakfast is served in the Saddle Room. The service was amazing. The food was one of the best breakfast buffets we've experienced.  If you want to eat onsite, there is the Saddle Room, however, it is a very pricey stakehouse.  There is also Lord Mayor's Lounge. The menu was okay, but the seating and ambiance is perfect for conversations.  We asked if we could order from the 'No. 27 Bar & Lounge' menu in the Lord Mayor's Lounge (and they let us).  The No. 27 Bar & Lounge is no place for a kid.  It is loud and they hotel staff will not even let you bring your child in there after 8 or 9 p.m. (which was fine).  The No. 27 Bar & Lounge MENU is the most diverse and most reasonably priced. It suited us for our stay.

We did utilize the valet parking.  Know that if you are going to valet park, it is 25-30 minutes to get your car out every single time.  Is what it is, just plan for it.

We did have a glitch in our service one evening at dinner.  I was amazed at how serious the Guest Relations team takes these incidents.  We did not make a big deal of it during our dinner. We paid and moved on.  I did mention it to a restaurant manager as we were leaving. They next day, the Guest Relations team reached out to us and wanted more detail so they could correct.  THIS is how you strive for the best guest experience.  I was impressed with their attentiveness and desire to really address what happened.  We had a brand new server make multiple errors with our dinner order and then go missing for long periods of time. We were understanding to him, but after the third mistake, we just wanted to leave.  The Guest Relations team was apologetic and assured us they were going to address the training.

Overall, we loved the Shelbourne. The location is great and within walking distance to many restaurants, shops and bars.  The service exceeded the level of service compared to many hotels.  We would definitely stay again.",4,2017,05,13
207,Great Staff and Service,"We requested an early check-in, and we ended up arriving even earlier than planned.  Our room was ready and that was a great relief.  The staff was quite friendly and helpful, including a knowledgable concierge and some helpful desk staff.
If you're in the lobby, check out the little mini-museum room they have in the lobby, with a history of the hotel.   We didn't eat at the restaurants, so I cannot comment on those.   The location is good, right next to St Stephen's Green, where you can take a stroll and relax in the park.   Walking distance to sites like Dublin Castle and Trinity Castle.   I suggest taking a walk to nearby Grafton Street, where you can check out lots of wonderful stores and food places.
The only drawback was that the Shelbourne is in a high-traffic area.  On foot, it's not bad, but if you need a taxi to or from the Airport or from Heuston Station, it can be very congested.   Lots of road construction going on as well.    Room was on the small side and the pricey side, but we had a comfortable say.",4,2017,05,12
207,Lovely staff!,"My 9 year old daughter and I spent one night at the historic Shelbourne enroute to San Francisco through Dublin.  We arrived late at night due to a flight delay.  The hospitality and kindness shown to us by the staff we still remember months later.  Understanding we had been through a rough airport experience, we were each offered a beverage from the bar, despite closing down for the night, which we gratefully accepted. A simple gesture, but spot on!  In the morning, prior to our long flight back to SF, we enjoyed a swim in the lovely pool and wished we could have stayed longer!  The Shelbourne is a beautiful luxurious Dublin hotel but the staff elevate the hotel to the next level of wonderful.",5,2017,05,10
207,High Tea,"Sadly, the hotel was fully booked, and we couldn't stay this trip. HOWEVER, I was able to treat my Mother-in-law, daughter, and new daughter-in-law to a fabulous afternoon sharing tea at the Shelbourne.  Bookings must be made far in advance-- you wont be disappointed!  For 90 minutes you will be pampered by very pleasant staff, and devour fabulous sweet and savory treats, while you sip your tea.  Live piano music, and beautifully appointed room complete the experience.  I understand why this is an institution!  Glad we were able to experience it for ourselves!",5,2017,05,10
207,Not the hotel you dreamed it'd be...,"First, let me say, our issues were resolved. But... 3 hours AFTER Check-in and 6 hours after arriving. From overseas. We had phoned ahead and received assurances that our rooms would be ready. Instead, we were told that there were no rooms until 3pm. Then 3 pm turned into 6 pm. All restaurants were booked. No food service. We ended up having to move rooms because the rooms at the back of the hotel have poor fitting windows and the HVAC systems are SO loud you can't sleep! Housekeeping was rude. Turn down service showed up at 10pm one evening. 
We left feeling that we weren't important enough. But, there were excellent employees at this hotel! Excellent service by the doorman and concierge. Obviously, there are really serious issues between housekeeping and the front desk. Please fix! The hotel is beautiful!",2,2017,05,09
207,Wonderful stay,"We chose this hotel because of the great reviews and the close proximity to popular restaurants, shopping and tourist attractions. We stayed at The Shelbourne for 7 nights. We arrived to Dublin early morning (many hours before check-in) but the front desk staff was very kind and had a room ready for us if we would like to go ahead and check-in. The view faced the office building next to the hotel but we didn't mind. We were excited that we were able to check in early and get a quick nap in before starting our Irish adventure! Our room was very nice and quiet. We ordered room service twice and it was top-notch. The No.27 Bar & Lounge has a great atmosphere and was a fun place to grab a few pints and some good food.",5,2017,05,09
207,"High scale hotel, with some issues","You can't deny that the Shelbourne is a really nice hotel, and right in the center of Dublin. 
But I won't give more than a rating of 3 to a hotel that charges 15 euros for a small salad at the bar, and doesn't have a 24 hours gym, something that almost every business hotel does, certainly under the Marriott brand. ",3,2017,05,09
207,Afternoon Tea,"Visited here for Afternoon Tea to celebrate my Grandmother's 80th birthday recently.
Yes it's a tad expensive, but completely worth it for the experience for a special occasion.
The staff were simply impeccable. Extremely attentive but in a non-intrusive way.
Best afternoon tea in Dublin by a mile.",5,2017,05,09
207,Elegant,"Very elegant hotel the staff are very welcoming and the food is absolutely stunning, staff are very friendly and helpful. The spa was completely relaxing I would love to book here again it was a great spot to spend in Dublin",5,2017,05,09
207,Special birthday,"I celebrated a special birthday with my mother, sister & close friends, with a champagne afternoon tea in the Constitution Room in the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin. It was all so perfect. The room was magnificent & Michael Collins' chair was brought from the museum for my use. Service & food was excellent & the whole afternoon was better than perfect.
My mother, sisters & I stayed over, and again, the experience was exceptional.",5,2017,05,08
207,Great historic Dublin hotel.,"Hotel is in a perfect location in Dublin centre. Right opposite the green and a short walk from all the main shopping and historic places to visit.
Checkin was really easy, the rooms are nice and the service is good.
Breakfast was plentiful, with buffet and non-buffet opions (e.g. eggs benedict). Buffet is for a full Irish breakfast (including black and white pudding) or continental style offering as well as yoghurts, fruit etc.
Breakfast area was busy however,
Seemed a little odd that the bar would close so early on a Friday night (well actually around 1am on Saturday morning) when there's still so many people in it. We were recommended to use the lounge for a drink, where there is no bar and only a finite number of chairs and waiters to take your drinks order. This didnt work for us, so we went out where there were stilll plenty of bars open for those burning the midnight oil! 
My room was on the side of the hotel and overlooked a barbed-wire protected bins area - so not much of a view. I'd recommend getting a front facing room as the view from the window will be so much better!

Would certainly stay again on my next visit to Dublin...
",4,2017,05,08
207,30th Birthday weekend,"As I write this I am finishing off my lovely 30th birthday weekend at The Shelbourne hotel Dublin, about to eat lunch for the final time in their No 27 bar & lounge.......
I cannot fault this wonderful hotel, the staff are friendly & accommodating, they are in short superb. 
And the customer service is second to none.
The food whether your eating breakfast, lunch or dinner or like me returning at 3am in the morning after a few drinks to eat a mouth watering traditional club with a pot of tea, all the food is delicious!! 
Wow I certainly will be returning to this fabulously stylish and comfortable hotel. 
The beds are comfortable, the bedrooms have all the amenities including my favourite Elemis products, shout out to two fabulous waiters at the No 27 bar & lounge Tony & Stephen who really looked after us on Sunday for lunch! 
Thank you to the manager for my complimentary breakfasts, I have really enjoyed my 30th birthday and so have my family!! Thanks again the shelbourne Dublin, I will return x",5,2017,05,08
207,Fantastic,Beautiful hotel and superb staff. Location is terrific as well. Easy walk to restaurants and area sites. Staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable. We flew in early morning and arrived exhausted after an overnight flight from the US. We were allowed to check in early and were quite grateful.,5,2017,05,07
207,"A truly outstanding hotel, with impeccable service.","We stayed two nights at the Shelbourne Dublin, and we were pleased with our stay in every way. Our room was very nicely appointed, very comfortable, and quiet. The linens were very high quality, and the bedding made sleep a pleasure. Our room had comfortable furniture, came with robes and slippers, and even had a 110-volt U.S. power outlet at the work desk.

There was really nothing that our room was lacking other than a view. My only minor complaint is that the bathroom could really use an exhaust fan, getting so steamy after a shower that it is actually difficult to dry oneself. There is a non-functional knob to some sort of former audio control in the bathroom. It would have been really nice if that controlled a functional exhaust fan instead.

We had breakfast at the hotel each morning. Although the full breakfast buffet may seem a bit pricey at 29 Euros, it offers an extensive selection of really high quality food. We also used the hotel’s valet parking and concierge services, each of which was highly professional and efficient. From our check-in to our check-out, every employee at the hotel was courteous, cordial, and highly capable. A complimentary copy of the Irish Times was delivered to our door each morning.

The Shelbourne Hotel is in a very convenient location, with close proximity to many fine dining options and leading attractions, several of which are within easy walking distance. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to other discriminating travelers.",5,2017,05,04
207,Warm Irish Hospitality at a Great Location,"My wife and I were lucky to have booked this wonderful property for our 3-day Labor Day mini holiday. We'd highlight its location just in front of St Stephens Green (a gorgeous park), its well appointed rooms, and its attentive and cordial staff.
We recommend not skipping breakfast at the Saddle Room. The restaurant offers an amazingly complete buffet with typical Irish delicacies like black or white pudding!
If you can, try also the seafood platter served at the lounge--simply outstanding dish with an amazing variety of very fresh seafood.",5,2017,05,04
207,Afternoon tea,"What an amazing place for afternoon tea, the best yet to date. Well worth the visit. There is a lovely selection of sandwiches, I asked for gluten free and had more or less the same type of food as my friends, which meant I didn't feel different",5,2017,05,03
207,Traditionally the Top Hotel in Dublin,"In Dublin for the Ireland-England rugby International, I swung by the Shelborne to drown my sorrows in a pint of Guinness after England blew their record-breaking chance (and because, on the day, Ireland were the better team).
It is still the class act of Dublin hotels. Great location, timeless elegance, classic F&B, buzzy vibe - mind you it was St Patrick's day on the Friday, so the city was packed with revellers. Bumped into John Spencer, Manager of the British Lions, in the Lobby, so the Shelborne still favoured by the Establishment.",5,2017,05,03
207,Bar Lounge,My colleague took me for a drink to bar lounge. I was an awe at the entrance itself when I saw this magnificent chandelier. The bar was crowded with diversified people from every age group. Very different concept of the bar which was interesting and fascinating to me.,5,2017,05,03
207,One of my global favorites!,"I always look forward to visits to Dublin for the chance to stay at the Shelbourne. It's a gorgeous historic hotel inside and out (the recent renovation was a definite success.)   Plush carpets, soft linens, and quality furniture, plus all the special touches and amenities.  The rooms can be a bit small, but the bed is so comfortable you're likely not to notice :)

The main bar is a great place for a drink before dinner, and the Saddle Room is absolutely delicious for the price point.  The breakfast is pretty significant with a lot to choose from. Fitness center and spa are included for guests, and I highly suggest you visit to relax in the sauna and steam room if nothing else.

My favorite part however is the staff. The service here is impeccable - they are friendly and always available to offer whatever you need, from the doorman to the concierge to the cleaning personnel.  I even got a bit lost finding the spa one day (the halls can be maze-like) and had a lovely gentlemen escort me through a few back rooms to the correct elevator so I didn't get lost again.  Love the team here - thanks everyone!",5,2017,05,02
207,Soaking in the atmosphere ,"Timeless elegance in the bar lounge. Multicultural energy and atmosphere at this popular meeting place. Impeccable service and some unique tastes which emphasize a local specialty- Guinness!!

Try the treacle and G bread made on premise,....., consider a dozen oysters with G

When in Rome,...",5,2017,05,02
207,Dreadful Experience ,"I recently stayed at the Shelbourne for four nights while attending a conference at Trinity College. When I first called to make the reservation I was told the special conference rate was not available and the price would be close to $400 per night. Because of its reputation and proximity to the conference I booked the room anyway. The temperature in Dublin was high 30-to low forties especially at night. My room was freezing even though I turned the thermostat as high as it would go. Cold air blasted through the ceiling vents. When I notified the front desk they sent two technicians up to the room and they found the heating system was broken and would take a couple of days to fix. Rather than offer me a different room, I was sent an extra blanket and a floor heater that kept turning on and off. They also gave me a voucher for a free drink. When I returned from the conference the next day the heating system had not been fixed. After vehemently complaining, finally, I was moved to a different room for the last night of my stay after freezing for three nights. 
I would never stay at the Shelbourne again and would warn others to find a different hotel. ",2,2017,05,02
207,"Nice Hotel, but...","Spent two nights here. 

A lot of praise has been showered on this so briefly:
- good staff, except for one of the concierge who was very snotty!
- great buffet breakfast included for Marriott Platinum members 
- the corridors are a bit of a maze with steps, so have someone carry your heavy bags
- keep the curtains closed as the view is pathetic
- bring a U.K. electrical plug, the European ones don't work
- Use cabs not Uber
- Turndown service can sometimes be very very late at night
",4,2017,05,01
207,Victim of its success,"What is likeable about this hotel: its very central location, the charm of tradition, great breakfast service. What I liked less: the small room, the inner courtyard room with ugly view and the live band until 2am on Saturday night, no way to sleep. ",3,2017,04,30
207,Worth the value,"A beautiful building, the Shelbourne was a definite splurge for us one our Ireland trip - but it was well worth it. The rooms were wonderful - a bit small, but not prohibitively so.  The brunch (and dining room) were great - we were not rushed, and the food was deliciously prepared.  Only had a quick drink at the bar downstairs, but I can see this being a great place to wait out the rain.",5,2017,04,29
207,"Fabulous hotel, great service","We traveled 7 days in Ireland and intentionally ended our trip at the Shelbourne!  It was wonderful and luxurious from the towels, to the bedding to the bar.  We loved the hotel the location was central to everything we wanted to do.",5,2017,04,28
207,Can't say enough about this hotel - fantastic place to spend our 30th.,"The hotel deserves the high reputation it has.  The facility, lobby, check-in, museum, elevators, bars and restaurants are all well maintained and staffed.

The room was very nice with quality furniture, bedding and amenities.

We had the opportunity to use the concierge service and get help from the staff during our 4 night stay.  Every thing was done well.

The breakfast is pretty significant with a lot to choose from and all very tasty.   We also ate at the restaurants and were very pleased.  

It is too bad this was the first hotel on our European adventure because nothing else matched up.

We hope to return!",5,2017,04,28
207,I now understand why people live in hotels😍,Just back from a wonderful 10 days in Ireland our first stop was Dublin where we spent 3 nights at The Shelbourne. The bed was so comfortable and the room was lovely. What really set the hotel apart was the staff. Everyone was so positive snd helpful.  A special shout out however to Barry Deegan.  After meeting us during check in he recalled our names the following day and provided the perfect amount of support and warmth to make us feel so welcome and appreciated.  I have stayed at a number of 5 star properties but the staff at this special place really set them apart.  Upon our departure I told my husband that if I were Eloise I would live at The Shelbourne!,5,2017,04,27
207,"Excellent staff, great location!","I stayed here with my daughter using some of my Marriott points. Nice room, well-appointed. Location is right on St. Stephen's Green, close to many of Dublin's famous attractions, wonderful restaurants (including the one in the hotel), and sightseeing walks galore. I was particularly impressed with Iain and Dafyyd at the front desk who helpfully answered my questions and efficiently solved my problems. We enjoyed many an evening in the No. 27 Bar & Lounge where we were served by Conor and Tony who brought us great food, strong tea, and lively conversation. It was a memorable stay for all the right reasons.",5,2017,04,26
207,Superb stay,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for three nights on a business trip in Dublin, and loved it. Very friendly front desk staff who go the extra mile. The location is located in the centre of town with lots of local restaurants and pubs nearby, including temple pub which is within a very close walking distance. The deluxe room and bathroom itself was perfect. Unfortunately, I didn't  have time to enjoy the in-house spa- better luck next time. I look forward to staying here again.",5,2017,04,25
207,Great Location!,We stayed at The Shelbourne for three nights and had two rooms which were connecting.  Check in was very easy and our rooms were in the back of the hotel which were quiet for the most  part.  You could hear music from the several weddings that were going on over the weekend we were there.  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.  I forgot to ask for a room with a view of St. Stephen's when we checked in and we ended up overlooking trash dumpsters.  We only ate at the one lounge and it was a limited menu.  The location is wonderful.  Right across from St. Stephens Park and only a couple of blocks from Grafton Street shopping.  There was a KC Peaches close by which is where we ate breakfast.  The employees we came in contact with were all very nice.,4,2017,04,21
207,Special treat,"Had afternoon tea at the Shelbourne   recently with daughters and granddaughters. Since it was the Easter school holidays be brought the children as a special treat. The kids tea is called The Wonderland tea and it's based on Alice in wonderland. It was so cute and well done, the girls each had an individual tiered plate. The bottom tier had sandwiches shaped in hearts with assorted filings  which the girls polished off quickly the top two tiers were assorted delights including a toadstool made of meringue . It also included a choice of fabulous milkshakes or hot chocolate with marshmallows . It was so well thought out and I was just thinking of when I was a child myself that I would have loved to have done this. The adult tea was just as good and served beautifully by the staff who were very attentive  to us and made a fuss of the children.
We had a lovely day to add to our memory box!",5,2017,04,21
207,The classiest in Dublin,A great hotel with masses of history and charm.. Heads of State stay in this hotel.. Not a hotel I could normally afford but was paid for by my client. The room was huge and very well decorated with amazing house keeping and room service. The staff in the restaurant and bar were extremely courteous and efficient. Expensive restaurant but worth at least one meal thee before trying many of the nearby Dublin bars and restaurants. Very close to St Stephen's Green and some of the best shopping in Dublin. Make sure you walk dow Grafton Street and pop into Bewley's Tea house for an afternoon tea.,5,2017,04,20
207,Fab stay,"Fab nite in Shelbourn. Dream come through. Beautiful room, great food (dinner) great service. Lovely night. Only positive things to say. Did not have breakfast decided to make the most of the lovely room. Got a good deal by going directly to the hotel. ",5,2017,04,19
207,Luxury overnight stay,"It was a lovely experience to stay overnight again in this historic hotel , which is ideally located in Dublin overlook Saint Stephen's Green.

Staff and interiors could not have been more pleasing, staff in all areas of the hotel were constantly asking if I required any information or assistance in sight seeing or help !!",5,2017,04,19
207,"Superb hotel, great location, excellent service","I had an event at this hotel so stayed a couple of nights whilst in Ireland. This is a beautiful, traditional yet glamorous hotel. I really liked the decor and style.
Bell man, front desk staff and concierge were all excellent. Room was huge and beautiful. Only hiccup on the room is that it was not feather free and I am highly allergic. I had called the week prior and the day before (as I always do if you read my reviews, its my routine as I am highly allergic!) yet the room was still heavily decked out with feather bedding and pillows. however, I only had to wait 15 mins for them to switch it out - great turnaround and excellent house keeping staff. Good job!
Food and drink was lovely here. Bar service was slow despite not being that busy,  we did ask for our bill 6 times before we had it - a 25min wait. I think the waiter may have been new so we tried to be patient but we had to get firm in the end to get our bill. 
Location is perfect and a good stroll to the shops, Stephens green etc. 
Everything else was top notch and I would definitely stay again.",4,2017,04,19
207,Expected More,"Our first trip to Ireland and this was our first of many stops in the country, ending at Ashford Castle. We tried to check in at 1:45 and was told our room wasn't ready, which is fine since check in isn't until 3. Walked around the beautiful St Stephens Green and came back at check in time, were told our room wouldn't be ready until 3:20. After a 12 hour flight we were exhausted and just needed a shower and a nap. We waited in the lobby and the lady greeting everybody kept looking at us with distain. Again, after a 12 hour flight and not having slept in over 24 hours of course we were disheveled. Requested the Irish Times the following morning and nothing showed up, requested a view and ended up looking at a building. This was probably a great hotel in its hay day but this day in age the staff need to work a little harder at being customer friendly, after all it's us who pay your salary. There are nicer hotels in Dublin for your money. Keep looking, the Grafton Street hotels were nice and central.

207,One day and One Night in Dublin,"Family of 4 (kids 11 and 7).  Arrived in the AM, and spending a day and a night in Dublin before driving off at noon next day to Ashford Castle.  David who handled our check-in is naturally gifted at the art of customer service.  His manner, style and attention to detail were among the best I've encountered at various 5 star hotels around the world.   We were very early but he still got us checked in which was a big boost since we just got off a 7 hour flight.  

Room:  big disappointment when we opened the door.   Not the hotel's fault but somehow my booking was done in error.  I booked online from the hotel website and thought I booked the Heritage park view room with 2 double beds.   My confirmation email said that I have a room with 2 double beds but nothing about the park view.   I didn't notice that detail on the email as I just presumed that by clicking on the room type, it will all be sorted.   Not having a view of St Stephen's Green was not the big issue.  The issue is that the room I ended up getting was overlooking a side alley, and straight into the office building next door where it was so close that I felt I could leap from my window into that office building.    Very little natural light and with office windows so close, you'd never open the curtains anyway.  This room was terrible.  I went down to speak with David.   He explained that there are only 2 rooms in the entire hotel that are standard rooms with double beds facing the park, and both of those were occupied.  The only option was to upgrade.   He gave us what I thought was a very good price to upgrade to the Earl of Shelbourne suite, a one bedroom suite over-looking the park.   I won't give numbers since that changes depending on time of year, but will say that in my opinion, the price that I paid for the Earl of Shebourne suite was well worth it; the price that I would have paid for that standard room with zero view would not at all have been worth it.   It wasn't cheap, and I would have been happier in a lesser hotel with better views.   I think Shelbourne should drastically drop the rate for that first room, as anyone would be upset at paying such a rate for a room where you won't open the curtains.

Service by staff: overall good.  The concierge desk was always helpful and the reception staff were always pleasant, as were the front door guys.   David is a cut above the rest, but every encounter with staff was pleasant. 

Didn't explore any of the hotel's facilities or restaurants, as we were out and about to take in as much of Dublin as possible before driving off.   I would have used the gym, but their hours are 8AM to 8PM so didn’t open early enough.  I  hope this is their week-end hours and not M-F.   Business travelers will hit the gym before going about their meetings, and if your first meeting is at 9AM, starting a work out at 8Am is too tight.   Their pool is open to kids only from 3 to 5PM, so again missed on this as I would have only taken my kids at around 6PM to play for an hour before dinner.   The hotel's location is excellent, easy to get to all the main attractions.  Depending on how much walking you like to do, you won't need a taxi except maybe to the Guiness factory.   We walked to it, and then took taxi back.",4,2017,04,17
207,Lovely and convenient location,"The hotel is located in a prime spot on St. Stephen's Green. Location is an easy walk to bars, restaurants, shops, hop on/hop off bus and many attractions.  Every staff member we interacted with was wonderful, most especially Cristina in reception. As gold members, we were greeted warmly and our complimentary breakfast was explained, without our having to ask. Our room was attractive, immaculate and well-organized. We had a tub/shower combination, which required a step up. This might be be a bit uncomfortable for someone very tall. The breakfast buffet was generous and delicious. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy. A great end to our trip to Ireland. Would definitely stay again.",5,2017,04,16
207,Outstanding Old World Charm,"We totally enjoyed our stay at the Shelbourne Hotel. Our room was comfortable and quiet. The staff was gracious from housekeeping to the concierge, to the front desk staff, and dining service staff. The breakfasts were delicious and plentiful, casual dining was lovely, and dinner in the formal dining room, converted from the breakfast room, was outstanding. Not only were the menu choices excellent, but also the service was impeccable. I would recommend this hotel highly. ",5,2017,04,16
207,retro dublin,"the hotel has lots of history including being a stronghold of the Brits during the Easter Rising. It is furnished in a traditional style but hasn't rested on the laurels. Room was lovely, staff very helpful, and dinner was excellent - the beef was fantastic. The complimentary bottle of wine in the room was very unexpected but very welcome. Breakfast had a huge selection. Sadly out room overlooked a wall but no matter. Clearly the most desirable rooms will be those overlooking the green. Strongly advice staying here at least once.",5,2017,04,16
207,Elegance with a touch of history!,"My husband and I stayed at the beautiful Shelbourne Hotel in late March as the first leg of a broader vacation in Ireland and the UK.  It was a great base of operations for exploring Dublin and the service was simply top notch. From its location on St. Stephen's Green, we were able to walk to most everywhere of note (with the exception of Kilmainham Gaol).  Some specifics that might be helpful to others considering staying: 

-Breakfast at the hotel's main restaurant is included for Marriott Gold members and above (they give you the options of taking complimentary points if you aren't a breakfast person). It was easily the best complimentary breakfast I have had at a Marriott property outside of Asia. On top of the buffet there are several menu items that are included free of charge.  They were even able to whip up vegan porridge for me.

-The gym has somewhat limited hours especially on the weekends, so if you are an early riser or have jet lag be sure to check before heading down to the fitness center.  You might opt instead for a jog in St. Stephen's Green which is directly in front of the hotel.

-We were upgraded into a deluxe room...it wasn't huge, but was comfortable and elegant. The bathroom were recently renovated with a modern, largish shower and toilet.  

-The hotel restaurant and bars (two) are popular with locals on Fridays and Saturdays, so get down early if you want a good spot.  

-The concierge was extremely helpful and booked a day trip out to Wicklow on his suggestion. The company he pointed us toward was great, too!  Don't hesitate to approach him if you have a question!

-This place oozes history...it was an important landmark during the Easter Rising as the Republicans pushed to hold St. Stephen's Green and was the location of the signing of the Irish Constitution.  The hotel has a small museum on the first floor that honors this history.

If you are looking for a more traditional and elegant experience, the Shelbourne is the place for you.  We definitely hope to be back in the future!",5,2017,04,16
207,Fabulous Afternon Tea,"Wow! Such a lovely afternoon at The Shelbourne. Afternoon tea with family and friends, and it certainly lived up to my expectations. Amazing building, ambience and service. Great selection of treats, sandwiches, scones etc etc....and pink fizz. Just all delicious, and all you would expect of course, but very beautifully done. By far the best afternoon tea I have experienced. Definitely on my list the next time I visit Dublin.",5,2017,04,15
207,Absolutely wonderful! ,The staff were very accommodating and the rooms were beautiful! Not to mention the value of price of the rooms. Very reasonable and feels luxurious! The location is perfect. We couldn't of been happier with our stay. ,5,2017,04,14
207,gorgeous property,"amazing property in amazing location in the heart of Dublin.  Super staff who try to do whatever it takes to make your visit really pleasant.  Breakfast is also fabulous, with lots of variety and choices.  No concierge lounge",5,2017,04,14
207,Perfect way to end our trip,"Spent almost 2 weeks in Ireland.  Mostly Airbnb's but I decided to surprise my wife with 3 nights at this hotel.  The staff was gracious, efficient and wonderful.  We had drinks in the bar so relaxing and fun to engage the staff and listen to their recommendations.  This is a luxury hotel, however, the value of what is offered makes it worth it.  Right across from the park, easy access to transportation and walking distance to some of the best places in Dublin make this a excellent hub to explore the city.",5,2017,04,14
207,Ed Sheeran Concert!,"We travelled down to Dublin to attend the Ed Sheeran concert on 12.04.17, and were very excited to be staying in the Shelbourne. We've travelled all around the world and we knew the prestige of this hotel, so we're looking forward to measure it up! 

The splendour of the hotel is perfect, we were greeted by valet doormen on arrival and the car was taken to the car park. Our check in went smoothly enough, we were offered an upgrade for €30 and we upgraded. I had called ahead and requested a quiet room, as I knew there were extensive roadworks going on around the hotel. We got a high up room but the trade off was the view - it was offices looking into the room. Therefore the privacy of the room wasn't excellent. 

The room was styled beautifully, and very clean. The bathroom was old fashioned but grand for the stay. We left our bags in the room to do some exploring before the concert that night, we had a few drinks in the bar downstairs in the Shelbourne. The cocktails were beautiful, but the decor was even better. I can't even explain how beautiful the hotel is!! The barman seemed nice, but was distracted a fair bit by two wealthy business people beside us. We left after 2 drinks and went into Dublin for a while.

We came back to the bar for a night cap, the bar was so busy and even more beautiful lit up. We paid for late check out in  the morning. 

The room was very warm, we tried to fix the temperature but it seemed to not make much of a difference. We got a cleaner to the room at 1:30 (when we were checking out at 2pm which was a bit annoying, as we felt rushed to leave the room then!). 

We decided to go to the pool before we left, we had a swim around but there were AC on and the whole pool area was freezing. After a few laps we went to the sauna which was ok. When we went to get back into the pool we noticed the steps and pool floor was filthy with dirt. There was also grime and dirt in the tiles and dirty plasters laying in the ground. This was completely unacceptable as a standard of this hotel. I spoke to someone at reception when I was checking out and the woman couldn't have cared less. 

The hotel also tried to charge us for taking things from the mini bar which was rubbish, and when I challenged the same woman on reception about it she was very sceptical about us telling the truth!!

The grandeur of the hotel was very impressive, we could imagine getting married here but after the pool incident it would make me reconsider paying to stay again. This is not a standard you would expect of this hotel; and the apathetic response from reception irritated me. The staff were generally good, the younger ones in the bar especially - but there needs to be an improvement on training staff to treat guests properly!

All in all a beautiful hotel, that needs a bit of work to improve it further",4,2017,04,14
207,Lives up to its reputation,"As a Marriott Rewards Gold Elite member, I was upgraded to a deluxe room with a fantastic bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast choices were excellent and the staff were all 5 star. The location is ideal in the middle of everything. Well worth the price!",5,2017,04,12
207,Superior property ,"This was a lovely, centrally located hotel for our recent stay.  Rooms were well appointed, sizable, and very quiet.  Staff was professional and attentive.  We ate at restaurant for breakfast in the morning that had something for our party of 4.  Valet parking was excellent as well. Highly recommended property. ",5,2017,04,11
207,Wedding,"Attended a family wedding here in April . We stayed two nights , our room was fabulous , large bedroom/ sitting room , big bright bathroom ( bath and shower ) separate we . plenty of wardrobe space . Complimentary morning paper .

The wedding reception was wonderful, amazing food beautifully presented by lovely staff . This hotel is close to some great Dublin amenities, Grafton St for shopping , Trinity College , Museums etc and lovely St. Stephens Green. It's not cheap but what really makes this hotel great is the attention to detail and the truly wonderful staff from housekeeping, catering/bar staff to front of house - no request was too small or trivial .
We hope to return to this magical place .

Try the afternoon tea in the Lord Mayor's lounge , you won't forget it!",5,2017,04,11
207,Amazing,"We booked this hotel last minute after realizing we did not want the b&b experience while being in the city. My husband has stayed at the property for work and spoke highly of the location.

It surpassed my expectations. We pulled up to the property and were immediately greeted by the doorman and helped to get our bags out of the car and escorted to the check in area. My husband was offered a glass of lemonade, which he gave to me while he checked us in. The kids and I looked around the bustling lobby and all the beautiful decor and seating areas. Very well done! 

We were upgraded to a junior suite and escorted to our room on the 6th floor. Everyone we came into contact with at this property was friendly and helpful. Always ready to go above and beyond.

We had breakfast in our room two mornings and everything arrived quickly and at the right temperatures. It also was very tasty and with two picky kids, they were happy. 

We also had dinner in The Saddle Room and again were blown away by the food, the service and the decor. 

And finally, the location. You could not ask for a better location to be in to see the sights and sounds of Dublin. Top notch from check in to check out! We can not wait to return.",5,2017,04,10
207,Great historic luxury hotel in the middle of the city.,"Being located at St. Stephen's Green, you're in walking distance of all the restaurants, the Temple Bar area, the shopping streets, all you need. Though because it's in the center of the city, you'd probably don't want to drive there.

I arrived there very early flying in from the US, my room wasn't ready and they said they were going to call me. I waited for five hours in the lounge, still no call. Then I went to the check-in desk and apparently there was another room available but they didn't bother calling me for that. I was too tired from not having slept on the plane and then the lounge, so I just went straight to the room.

If you're comparing five star hotels around St. Stephen's Green, you might want to know the difference between this place and a hotel like the Conrad on the other side of the park. While the Conrad is a more modern premium business hotel, that recently got renovated, the Shelbourne focuses on its luxury and heritage. You'll notice that immediately by the giant welcome hall and everything in your room will be colored golden. It even has a little museum where they exhibit important documents signed at that very spot.

I don't know how these building developed historically, but the place is a maze, it took me about 4 different hallways with all intersections to get to my room from the elevator. Luckily, they offered to bring my luggage to me.

The fitness areas are okay. It's not one big gym like in other hotels, but several small rooms next to the swimming pool, which confused me at first cause you might have to move from room to room to do an entire workout. Again, the layout of the hotel is very confusing.

I didn't have dinner there, but the extensive breakfast is what you would expect: eggs, bacon, sausages, pudding, muffins, fruit,... I did have a few drinks in the three different venues they have setup there: a convential cocktail bar, a tea room, and a more fancy reception room.

To summarize: great hotel at an ideal location in Dublin. Depending on whether you prefer the historic luxury or a modern place to stay with a cleaner look, this might be your thing.",5,2017,04,09
207,Awesome stay,"We had the pleasure of staying here, along with another couple, to start a 2 week journey celebrating my husband's 50th birthday. We had contacted the hotel prior to arrival to notify them of our early arrival as well as to request champagne and treats in our room to kick off the fun! Everything was in place and they were able to get us into our rooms early. Our room was very clean, well appointed and had a huge bathroom. The bed was comfortable and we had absolutely no complaints. Everyone from the front desk, bellmen, servers in the bars and restaurants provided excellent and very friendly service. Extra kudos to the concierge staff who assisted with printing our boarding passes to Glasgow and offered numerous tips and assistance during our stay. We dream of returning! You cannot go wrong by choosing to stay at the Shelbourne while exploring all that Dublin has to offer. It was the PERFECT start to an amazing getaway and celebration for us!",5,2017,04,09
207,A family get together in a perfect setting,We four had the most delicious lunch in the Saddle Room. It was a family reunion and a celebration of 3 birthdays. The room itself is just beautiful as is the hotel. Our food was truly delicious. We were so well looked after by Pavel who has the best manner and is the perfect waiter. He looked after us royally. One of our best lunches ever. Great Irish hospitality. Thank you very much.,5,2017,04,08
207,Elegant and Comfortable,"Stayed here recently for 2 nights , having just arrived from Vancouver. Check in was easy with friendly staff. Room was a decent size and very comfortable and very clean. 
Café was nice in the morning with excellent professional staff. Great location for sightseeing.",5,2017,04,06
207,Luxurious Hotel in Dublin City Center,"Stayed here for a trip to Dublin. It has been around for quite awhile. You would never know it is as old as it is. They have done an excellent job of upkeep and modernization, while still keeping the ambience of a special hotel.
From a warm welcome at check-in, to the room, to having a few drinks at Bar 27. great experience and the people who work there couldn't have been friendlier. We had breakfast in The Saddle Room. What a great breakfast, I didn't need to eat anything again until dinner.
My only opportunity was that I am still waiting on the ice I requested and the comb the Concierge said he would have sent up. I did have to call a couple of times to get things brought to the room. 
I would love the opportunity to stay here again and I would highly recommend this hotel for your next stay in Dublin.",4,2017,04,05
207," Great stay! ","Very nice with a great breakfast spread,  attentive service,  a clean room, and location,  location,  location. No question the price reflects all of this. 
Room was typical European size,  but did include a sizeable walk-in shower which had good temps and pressure.  
Room also included instant coffee and tea which is a nice benefit. ",4,2017,04,03
207,Luxury in Dublin ,"The best hotel in Dublin. Perfect location. The staff is attentive, the rooms clean and the restaurants, including fur breakfast, are top notch.  Try the breakfast buffet. the whiskey drinks need to be more generous. ",5,2017,03,31
207," Very classy central Dublin 5x hotel","Really grand hotel with great style but not too stuffy. Eating spaces are busy but full of traditional atmosphere. The food quality is excellent. Service throughout the hotel is formal but friendly. Uniformed doormen etc
Checking in and out can be slow. Taxis are easy to get at front. good selection of meeting rooms for those with business needs. Would be excellent, but pricey, for a  weekend break, but not sure if there are any deals. A great city centre hotel",5,2017,03,30
207,Good Quality hotel,"Staying at the Shelbourne for 2 nights on a business trip.

Location: Right on St.Stephens Green the facade is stunning and assume views from front of house are lovely. Though that said it's a busy thoroughfare so maybe noisy as there are lots of pubs in area.

Rooms: I have double it's standard European room size plenty of storage etc. Slightly disappointing outlook onto a flat roof with building materials on it.

Spa/Fitness: The gym is pretty decent for a hotel with good equipment and a nice indoor pool area.

Room Service: for a weary traveller vital. Chicken club the acid test was excellent and the fries came crunchy and hot!!! Passed with flying colours!

Overall: I give it 4 stars. Why not 5 I guess I have stayed at the Merrion round the corner and found that to be more intimate and pleasing and the Marker which reflects the growing youth and tech feel to Dublin. I would recommend the Shelbourne as it is a very good hotel. It's only my personal preference for the other two.",4,2017,03,28
207,"Enjoyable visit, some reservations","I was delighted to finally stay in the Shelbourne Hotel as its such an essential element in Dublin city centre. We normally stay in a nice little 4 star hotel that we like on our semi-regular visits to Dublin but this time for my birthday we decided to treat ourselves to a 5 star stay. Luckily my husband travels a lot for work so we could put some of his credit towards the cost of the room. Being honest if I'd paid the full price, I think I would have felt it was not quite worth it. Here's my summary of our stay:
You can't beat the location. (road works are about at the moment with the Luas works but they didn't impinge on us). Just a short stroll to great shopping on Grafton St and there's loads of good restaurants and bars in the area. 
The entrance is lovely. The entrance doorway is a bit busy but inside is all flowers, comfy sofas and you really feel you're in a special place. 
The staff are excellent. Welcoming and attentive. Can't fault them at all. 
The Horseshoe Bar is lovely to visit. The barmen are very friendly and professional. It is the sort of bar to peruse the drinks menu and to choose an interesting gin or wine. Little nibbles are provided. Drinks are expensive but I personally think they were worth it for the presentation, attention to detail and for being in such an iconic place in Dublin.
Room was comfortable. Bed was comfortable. 
Room is on the small side (knew this was going to be as had read other reveiews so no biggy) but nicely decorated.
Disappointed to see some fraying on carpet edges. 
We were given an adjoining room which should not have been an issue except we could very clearly hear the people next door. 
The iron was broken but quickly fixed. 
Lastly, and I can't verify this as I didn't stoop to look. Was that chewing gum I felt under the bar in the horseshoe bar? I hope not.
So all in all a very enjoyable stay. However it is quite expensive.",4,2017,03,27
207,A 5 Star Hotel...,"With beautiful renovated rooms, a perfect location, and a delicious breakfast, the Shelbourne deserves their 5 star rating. The rooms are clean and modern and the hotel staff is extremely helpful and friendly. We would highly recommend! ",5,2017,03,26
207,Amazing........luxury hotel in the city centre,"Stayed here with some friends. We booked 2 twin rooms with interconnecting doors. It is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location. It lives up to its 5 stars. Staff very friendly and helpful. Bedrooms spotlessly clean and beds were very comfy. 
Breakfast in the morning was great. 
It is expensive but worth it. 
",5,2017,03,25
207,Luxury at Its Best,"This hotel is the utmost in luxury. The staff were attentive to all details. The rooms were large and luxurious. The bars are very upscale and enjoyable, especially with the piano players. The restaurant was also top notch dining.",5,2017,03,24
207,Wonderful hotel,"Although we didn't stay at this hotel this time, we certainly would like to one day! We used both bars and tried the restaurant and Oyster bar which were all serviced by very helpful, friendly and efficient staff. The food was excellent and a very good choice on the menu. The decor and ambience of the hotel is great and everything is clean and beautifully presented. We were very impressed and will definitely return when back in Dublin.",5,2017,03,22
207,Drinks by the piano,"Had a lovely couple of drinks in the lounge while listening to the piano music during the evening. Pianist was Andrew Boylan, very talented guy who plays a mix of classical, jazz and popular airs. Great professionalism from the staff also who catered us well throughout the night and was always willing to attend our needs. Beautiful place!",5,2017,03,22
207,Pre-St. Patrick's Day,"We stayed at the Shelborne up till St. Patrick's Day craziness and headed out
I have stayed here before and never been disappointed in the staff ,service ,spa etc.
St. Patrick's Day puts stress on everyone and you can only do so much with so many people in town to celebrate. 
I can't quite give them five stars but a solid 4 1/2 is being honest
 ",5,2017,03,21
207,Some disappointment when you pay for luxury,"I lived in Dublin for several years, so I knew the hotel had a great location -- which I took full advantage of during the day with my daughters -- and was beautiful and so forth. Here's where it fell short during the actual time we spent in the hotel over three nights (paying for two rooms every night which was less expensive then paying for one large suite). First, no matter where you travel, kids love hotel pools. So I found the the restricted swimming hours for (accompanied!) children a pain to work around. I was told ""there is not enough staff."" What? All the staff did was sign us in to an empty pool. Second, for the cost of afternoon high tea, I would have expected warm, melt in your mouth scones. To me, it is all about the scones and finger sandwiches -- not so much the chocolate desserts which received much more attention. Although I will say my daughters in enjoyed their tea choices. Third, not that I watch much TV, but still, my room TV was funky -- the word ""Loading..."" was stuck on the screen, for instance. But I didn't opt to ruin my evenings having repairmen in the room for that or for the air conditioning which quit working. Although in my daughters' room it did work (which was further evidence that mine was not.) I think for the hoards of North American visitors that must come through this establishment down pillows, check-in ice service and at least one clearly complimentary water bottle would be appreciated. On a better note, given that it was the week of Paddy's Day, I chose ""quiet"" over ""room-with-a-view"" and our rooms were quiet on the fourth floor and relatively close to each other.",3,2017,03,20
207,Good,"Enjoyed my stay at the city centre hotel. Food and service was very good. Hotel is always very busy. Really liked dining in the saddle room restaurant, breakfast buffet was amazing. One thing that let the hotel down was they overcharged my card by 481e and it took 3 e mails to get this sorted with no explanation on why this happened. Not what you would expect from a 5 Star hotel.",4,2017,03,20
207,"Beautiful, historic hotel with a great location","A friendly hello and beautiful surroundings greet you as you walk in the door!  Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and a great location.  We recently stayed here with our two young adult children and it was wonderful.  Location offered a lot of places to visit within walking distance.  Lovely indoor pool, perfect for swimming a few laps or just relaxing. Delicious breakfast buffet (menu items available and also delicious).  Turndown service was so thoughtful and very much appreciated after a long day of sightseeing.  Rooms were beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  Lots to see and do in Dublin but try not to miss The Little Museum of Dublin a few doors down; a tour guide leads you through the decades of Irish History (takes about an hour or so depending on how much time you spend afterwards looking around).",5,2017,03,19
207,Excellent hotel!,"Really loved this hotel. The staff was wonderful, the breakfast and the afternoon tea is extraordinary, so all in all, I would recommend it highly! While there are more inexpensive options readily available in Dublin, it is definitely worth the hefty price tag.",5,2017,03,18
207,Luxury combined with sheer Irish friendliness!,"This exquisite hotel is in the ideal spot in Dublin, right at Stephen's Green.  It's not only luxurious, but the staff is friendly and helpful - and it's always busy due to the stellar 5-star reputation it justly deserves. The Saddle Room menu is seasonal and with locally sourced ingredients, and the No.27 bar and lounge is the perfect spot to meet and greet the loquacious locals!   Would return in a heartbeat to this historic hotel.",5,2017,03,18
207,Birthday Present,"Been visiting the Shelbourne for a number of years and booked my wife and son in for a night. Exceeded all the expectations. Staff fantastic on reception , in Saddle restaurant and the Spa. Special thanks to IWONA MROCZEK | Guest Relations Executive- simply brilliant. Off for lunch this Saturday again as enjoy the Shelbourne so much - definitely visit this hotel",5,2017,03,16
207,A lovely place to stay and service is excellent!,"On arrival we had a warm welcome from the door man who made sure the car was unloaded and went and parked the car for us. The receptionist was very helpful and polite. The room was lovely and appeared to be quiet, however, that night we found out it was a very noisy room. The following morning the receptionist arranged, without any problems, a new room. I always judge a place by how they deal with a problem and they dealt with it very well.
Had sandwiches in the bar which were excellent but had breakfast each morning which was ok but not excellent! It all looked ok but limited if you are a vegetarian. Worth a stay but is expensive.",4,2017,03,13
207,First class,"A weekend break with family, we enjoyed afternoon tea, evening meal and use of spa facilities
All first class - all staff were excellent, a privilege to enjoy a great hotel

Full of character, well situated

A true 5 star experience 
",5,2017,03,13
207,A shame not to give it 5 stars as it does try...,"Having spent two nights in The Shelbourne it is hard to explain how this hotel sees itself as 5 star luxury...  though it does try...

To explain...  Arriving after our wedding day to the hotel, there was a full flung fist fight happening at the entrance with the steps blocked by people throwing fists at each other and security trying to break it up...   When it appeared to subside we made our way to the door to be stopped by security to check if we were guests...  we were left standing while some attempt was made to use a walkie talkie...which ultimately didn't appear to work...  eventually and reluctantly we were allowed in... and reception sorted out our room key etc...  

We had delivered our luggage the previous day. It was in our room.  Normally in a 5 star luxury hotel it would be unpacked but our bags were simply put in the hall of our room.   The room was very comfortable overlooking St Stephen's Green which made waking up special... Free mineral water was available... but once again... in other 5 star hotels we have stayed in we have found complimentary mini-bars... not so in The Shelbourne... they instead have gone for the very old-fashioned mini-bar where a Diet Coke that would cost no more than 1.50 Euro a few doors down was priced at 4.50...  I thought that this over pricing had become a thing of the past...

The bathroom was spacious, well thought out... with nice touches such as bath salts as well as the usual accessories and a thoughtful fresh flower...  The bathrobes were a good size... though they did feel as if they had been laundered quite a few times ...

Breakfast was a buffet option...  there are many areas with tables which gave a nice feel... rather than one featureless room... But, the buffet area was very small and pokey...  The flow meant that people were literally elbowing people as the space was too tight...  Freshly cut fruit was quite basic...  fruit salad, melon etc... nothing that one wouldn't expect... and the hot counter next to it meant that the usual cooked Irish breakfast smells permeated the entire area...  There was a small continental option but this was sparse when I got there.

Tea and Coffee was served at the table. I asked for almond milk as I cannot have dairy... This was not available, which in other hotels and clubs I have found staff very obliging as they send out for some rather than have a guest left with only the option of black tea...   soya milk was offered, but as any tea drinker will vouch...  it doesn't work in tea...

The hotel was busy all day...  after a welcome refreshing walk on a sunny day wandering the city we came back for well earned Bloody Marys in the Horseshoe Bar...  These were some of the best that I have ever had...  the bar staff were pleasant though there was zero banter until a change over and Oscar arrived... He and one of the reception staff Dafydd were the two that made The Shelbourne special... the rest appeared more interested in looking professional rather than understanding the humanity of customer care...

We tried for a table for dinner but it was booked out for the time that we requested...  so we went for room service...  Once again compared to other hotels... the menu was very limited...  so we opted to keep it simple with some rather good burgers and chips...   overpriced but delicious enough, though it was very much what it said on the menu - ie no extra touches that make hotels stand out...  The room service person who delivered the food was pleasant but arrived with half the order...  it came 30 mins later... so we were forced to dine separately...  once again an example that the luxury bit is missing in the detail at The Shelbourne...

One other detail is that nowhere that I could find was it advertised that there is construction work in the hotel...  This didn't interfere until this morning when jack hammers and hammering woke us from a lie in...  so rather than a lazy morning we left early. My husband had breakfast and did say that the waiter from the previous morning did say that he would try for almond milk, but came back without any ""as the supplier hadn't delivered yet""... 

Would I stay in The Shelbourne again?  Most definitely... but with lowered expectations... the big gestures are there... but the small detail is seriously missing.",4,2017,03,13
207,Amazing ,"Wonderful hotel. Nothing is too much trouble for staff.  Had an amazing stay. Opposite st Stephens green, near grafton Street and temple bar.  Fab cocktails in horseshoe bar.  Tapas bar named House approx 8 min walk away. Lively bar and great food ",5,2017,03,12
207,Calmly and quietly the best.,"We me friends in the Horseshoe Bar in the hotel on a Saturday night in March and have never been before. I wonder why because the whole place is run really well and was a pleasure to visit. We got a great table in the Bar and had a few drinks before dinner at another restaurant. Service was very attentive and the staff made you feel welcome and valued.
Some well known faces around too having a quiet pint and being undisturbed.
First class. ",5,2017,03,12
207,Amazing-Dream come through!,"Had a park view, executive room. Huge bed, huge bathroom, high quality robes & slippers. 
Got engaged on arrival then went for dinner, manager congratulated us and offered us a bottle of champagne while at dinner.
They done a turn down service to our room but also decorated our room with petals & left chocolate covered strawberries (none of which my partner arranged).
They left a note stated a late check out (1pm) was allowed. 
Staff, food, drinks in the bars all amazing. We go back & will continue to go back each year as an engagement anniversary",5,2017,03,12
207,Afternoon Tea at the Shelbourne - Number 2,"As I spent this years' birthday in Dublin, what could be better than having afternoon tea at the Shelbourne! This is such a great place. The food offered was not only eye-catching, but also most delicious!",5,2017,03,11

207,More than just staying in a hotel room,"A fantastic stay, made so by not just the staff but the beautiful surroundings, the location and the history of the hotel.  I went with my husband and it was romantic, to be in the heart of the city, staying in hotel with so much history.  One of the lifts is still 'old' with a little rattle along the way - to think Michael Collins took that same lift! and not to mention many more.  Anyway, we want to go back for sure! 

There were one or two blips along the way in the hotel, but they were dealt by the staff very  professionally - nothing was too much !",5,2017,03,08
207,"Brilliant stay, can't fault it","Treated my boyfriend to a night in Dublin for part of his Christmas present.  The staff were very friendly, attentive and professional throughout. We were upgraded on arrival and our room was lovely and spacious with everything we could possibly need and the bed was so comfortable! The location is brilliant. We had a cocktail each before heading out for dinner, which were some of the nicest cocktails we've ever had. We both loved this hotel, it's the best we've stayed in in Dublin and we will definitely be back.",5,2017,03,06
207,Historic hotel,"Prestigious hotel with a great location. Pros: beautifully maintained, clean rooms, top class service. Cons: small room, high prices. We didn't eat in the hotel, but we did enjoy a drink at the Horseshoe Bar and also liked the tiny museum showing the history of the hotel.",4,2017,03,06
207,An extremely friendly doorman !,"Wednesday evening, 1 March, was miserable in Dublin weather-wise but the day was made all the brighter thanks to a very hospitable and welcoming doorman named Luke ! 

Little acts of kindness go a long way - doormen are often the first points of contact for hotel goers and give visitors their first impression of a place. Thanks to Luke my impressions of The Shelbourne were extremely positive !!",5,2017,03,04
207,Amazing History and beautiful rooms,This is a wonderful Hotel. We visited a few years ago and booked 2 nights with 2 rooms. The rooms were huge and amazing. The staff was great and very friendly. The entire hotel is very posh and classy but not snobby. Everything was spotless clean and the beds were comfortable and cozy. I have no complaints at all. After a long day of walking and sight seeing it is the perfect place to relax. There is a bar and restaurant that is also beautiful.,5,2017,03,04
207,Overnight stay,"Booked in just after the New Years break , upgrade on the room for the wife . Shelbourne  always keeps an eye out for returning guests as we had our wedding reception there in 2016 , Saddle room was booked for evening meal and as ever the food and service is always lovely , we have had the pleasure of two trips to the restaurant before and not been let down .Its funny as a Dubliner and a Northsider  visiting and eating in the Shelbourne would not have been  a regular occurrence . However we have been converted over the last two years as feel right at home when we stay , and the use of the pool in the morning is a treat .
It's nice to have this historic hotel on our doorstep and if you listen very carefully to the sound of the horse and carriage going by from time to time it all just falls into place  with echoes of the past , well worth a visit and a stay for any true blue , it's not for tourists , go and enjoy it !!! Try the restaurant for Sunday lunch specials , well worth it",5,2017,03,03
207,A spectacular treat!,"As a treat we booked for the first time to stay in the Shelbourne...valet parking, unbelievable room styling, comfort and cleanliness. The staff were super helpful and friendly. We had breakfast and dinner in the bar. The breakfast was just out of this world with every want and need catered for! The best pancakes I have ever tasted! The only downside was the service in the bar for evening food...very slow and we felt the portions of food were very small. The delay in service actually meant we were almost late for our show that night. It didn't mar our stay however. Watch out that parking charges are not included in your stay! The couple of days stay were just magical....",5,2017,03,01
207,Yet again superb!,"Thank you so much for yet another wonderful weekend and a huge thank you to you for our upgrade. We didn't expect that at all (especially as you were sooooo busy)! Iain, on front of house, is a credit to you. James and Steven in the bars looked after us superbly! My facial with Sudaporn was sublime! Thank you so much again. Our Shelbourne Bubble is the highlight of our year! Each year you guys get better and better!! 💚💚💚 xxxxxxxxx",5,2017,03,01
207,Perfect,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights and it was just amazing. The staff are so lovely. Our room was beautiful, the breakfast was so nice. The history of the hotel is fascinating. I can't wait to go back.",5,2017,03,01
207,Luxury interlude,"I visited the ShelbourneHotel Dublin  recently and alone as a luxury treat to myself.
I had a delightful king delux room in a high floor as requested.
I spent most of my visit in the hotel. I used the gym and the swimming pool twice. I had drinks and food in both the Saddle Room and No27.
I visited tbe Salon for a blowdry.
I can only speak highly of the whole experience. All the staff were delghtful- polite charming and helpful. The hotel in all areas is warm comfortable and total luxury.
My checkin and checkout experiences wete excellent.
Overall I had a wonderful treat and I am returning again soon to repeat thw whole experience",5,2017,03,01
207,staff were so welcoming and helpful.,The room was lovely and the breakfast was superb. What really stood out for me was the friendliness and helpfulness. Big call out to the engineer who came to check the aircon in our room - he was extremely helpful.,5,2017,02,28
207,High Tea Valentines Day,"A truly classy experience. One simply enjoys a classic venue, soft live music and a most tasty series of options for the High Tea. I have been here before years ago and the standard has remained the same throughout time. 

Staff are attentive to needs and the venue itself, just off the main entry foyer is relatively intimate seating only a small number of clients for this enjoyable event. Having said that it would be advisable to book ahead.",5,2017,02,28
207,Wonderful Hotel,"Amazing Hotel  friendly staff  wonderful food, easy parking and great relaxing atmosphere. Rooms are comfortable and spacious. Dublin is great city and you are in heart of it in this hotel would recommend it for families and couples.",5,2017,02,28
207,Never fails!!,"Never fail to fall in love with The Shelbourne every time I visit. Third time we've treated ourselves to staying overnight and it could not have been more enjoyable. From the moment we arrived each and every staff member treated us like the only guests there, so friendly and helpful, especially the barmen and concierge. The whole hotel is always buzzing, we hardly left it the whole weekend. Breakfast in bed was absolutely beautiful, as the food and drink always is. Can't wait to return ",5,2017,02,27
207,Amazing Afternoon Tea Experience book it now,"We went for afternoon Tea in the Shelbourne hotel with a few work collegues. I have to say the service, attention and experience was amazing. Totally worth the price, food was amazing loved the sandwich choice, amazing scones and the mini deserts to die for and so pretty i didn't want to eat. Really great day out for a special event. Tea always topped up, staff so attentive. Was so full i was given a take away box to bring left overs home to my mum really nice touch. Would love to come back. Well done guys!",5,2017,02,27
207,"A centrally located, high quality hotel with excellent amenities.","Overlooking St Stephens Green, the hotel is close to the shopping centres of Grafton Street and its surrounds. Trinity College and other major tourist attractions are within walking distance.

Amenities are to the expected high standards : two elegant fine dining restaurants;  lively bars; a pool, fitness centre and a spa. The bedrooms are clean and with adequate storage space, although the bathrooms are somewhat small. The staff are superb . . . attentive, responsive, knowledgeable . . . a true differentiator in our weekend experience.",5,2017,02,26
207,Fantastic hotel and wonderful staff,"We just spent 9 days at this beautiful hotel and it was a truly wonderful experience. The staff are amazing and I have to say especially the concierge desk. Everything that we asked of them, they did in a most expert way - from dinner reservations to printing boarding pass to getting us fantastic seats for the Ireland v France Rugby match. The hotel was very busy but we never had to wait very long for any service. I would stay there again without hesitation. Fantastic!!",5,2017,02,26
207,Wonderful surprise birthday weekend,"We stayed here for a long weekend for a surprise 30th weekend away. From the moment we arrived the service was impecible. Florin was fantastic. He showed us to reception and we were given homemade lemonade whilst checking in. We were then showed to our room (small double) which was lovely and cosy. The rooms were well equipped with everything we needed for our weekend away. We were provided with a turn down service each night which was delightful and the chocolates were a lovely touch. The location was perfect, right on St Stephens Green and close to transport links to and from the airport. Walking distance to Grafton Street and Dawson Street. Temple Bar wasn't too far either. All in all the location and quality of the hotel was fantastic and would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,02,26
207,Luxuriously comfortable,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two-night break in the Shelbourne. It is so luxurious and is a real escape. Our room had been recently renovated and it was very tastefully decorated. We loved looking out onto Stephen's Green. The bathroom was beautiful, with plenty of toiletries provided. But the bed was the real star! Best mattress ever, unbelievably comfortable. One small issue though was the coffee machine, we feel a small instruction card would help those of us not blessed with such luxuries in our homes!
We found the staff everywhere very friendly, whether at the desk or in the bars or restaurant. Our meals were delicious, and they have a good selection of reasonably priced wines, which are really nice and served in very generous glasses, that's always a plus. Breakfast is a stunning display of tempting fruits, pastries, all sorts of cooked goods, juices, and a particular favourite, pancakes with bacon and maple syrup. 
The hotel's location is perfect. Easy walking distance to Grafton St for shopping, while cultural points like the National Gallery and Oscar Wilde's house are also close by. 
",4,2017,02,26
207,Family visit,"What a fabulous experience for my wife and I, absolutely the best hotel we have ever had the privilege to stay in. The suite was just fantastic, every member of staff so helpful, kind and considerate. The restaurant was lovely, the staff brilliant and all meals were perfectly cooked and tasty.The location of the hotel near the centre of the city was perfect for the shops and all within walking distance.
A special mention for the breakfast staff and Cesar who looked after us perfectly, thank you so much.",5,2017,02,26
207,Pure luxury,"Wow wow wow, we stayed here for the end of my birthday trip to Ireland, this hotel did not let us down. It's staff are second to none, they make the place what it is, the rooms are beautiful, the breakfast was Devine. I could retire and live my days out in this stunning hotel and I would be a happy man. Don't bother booking anywhere else when you are staying in Dublin, life is is too short to be disappointed. Credit to the Marriott chain",5,2017,02,26
207,Highly Spoken of and very reputable ,"I enjoyed my two night business trip. Lacks an executive lounge but the breakfast more than made up for it. 

The Shelbourne Eggs Benedict on Fillet Steak was awesome. 

Did not realize the Horseshoe Bar was closed on Monday nights until it was Monday night. So one of the things I was looking forward to seeing I missed. Maybe next time. 

Looks like historically the South African Rugby team had some wild parties here. ",4,2017,02,25
207,Very Nice Hotel,"The hotel is very nice. It is centrally located to everything in Dublin. The hotel staff was great and very accommodating. Several bus stops are right down the street of the hotel. We used a hop on hop off tour bus that takes you around to all of the spots in Dublin, a good way to get around town. If we come back to Dublin we will stay there again. ",4,2017,02,24
207,Beautiful hotel with lackluster customer service,"The hotel is beautiful and within walking distance to shops and pubs. The rooms are pretty, but the daily cleaning could be better with the wiping down of bathroom surface areas. The restaurants within the hotel are adequate, but service is slow and not very friendly. The front desk staff needs work, it took almost a half hour to check-in and after a long flight, one just wants to get bags to the room. Additionally, a heads up on how to turn the lights on would have been appreciated. Overall, pretty hotel in good location, but lacked 5 star customer service. This is the first time I've written a review and I travel extensively for work and pleasure, so found this to be just an ok hotel experience. Ireland and its people, however, get 5 stars!! ",3,2017,02,23
207,Magic,"I am passionate about eighteenth century cities and my wife is from Mexico City and a huge fan of hurling Dublin we thought would be ideal for a break.  Arrived early from East coast and were thrilled to be met by the sprightly General manager - a kerryman with a twinkle in his eye. He insisted we join him for a tequila in the horseshoe bar even though it was only 10am as he regaled us with his stories of working in Tijuana.
The Irish constitution was written on site in 1922. Bram Stoker was a regular. 
Graham Green wrote the end it the affair here
Ask for the salmon of knowledge afternoon tea where you get a scone shaped like new grange.",5,2017,02,22
207,Top class hotel ,"We were treated like royalty from the moment we stepped out of our car. The friendliness we encountered throughout the hotel was superb. 

The room was freshly renovated and so classy & luxourious. 

 The staff in the shelbourne are the best we have ever encountered in a hotel, we have stayed in many Irish 5 star hotels but none have compared to our experience here. 

The friendly, efficient & top class service ensured we had such a special & memorable first wedding anniversary. They really went above and beyond to ensure that our  stay was extra special especially for that special occasion. 

It lived up to our expectations and so much more. Little touches like the friendly smiles & greetings from All staff,  the efficient bar staff. We could not speak more highly of our waiter in the saddle room. We had the most perfect romantic booth, it was the most cosy, private meal we have ever had. He really made our anniversary meal so special by his friendly manner. 

The sweet celebratory gift sent to our room was the sweetest gesture. We really had the most perfect first anniversary thanks to the Shelbourne.

The hotel is so charming. You won't be disaapointed. ",5,2017,02,22
207,The Shelbourne Hotel,This was my 6th stay at The Shelbourne Hotel and it was perfect as usual.   The service was impeccable.   I hosted a family lunch in the Saddle Room and the service was 10 out of 10.  I would definitely do this again and can recommend The Shelbourne events service to everyone.   My relatives were impressed and so was I.   Looking forward to the next time.,5,2017,02,21
207,Birthday visit ,I visited the hotel to celebrate my birthday and we had a great time. The element of care by the staff is fantastic. The only problem we had was the air conditioning was not working in our room which made the room too hot so it was difficult to sleep. All in all it is a great hotel!,4,2017,02,21
207,Historic Hotel,"The Location of the Hotel is one of the best in the city,
the decor is very beautiful,opulent and well maintained.
The Room is spacious and comfortable and the Staff is friendly.
The Only things i did not like in the hotel : as the hotel is a historic one
it is full of tourists, and outsiders that go there for a coffee or something only for
the picture, but it is not like 5 or 10 people it is a lot of them.
And you have to pay for Sparkling water in the breakfast... shame on you Renassaince.",4,2017,02,20
207,Lovely one night stay,"Beautiful hotel inside and out, staff were so nice from start to finish!! The only downside was they tried to overcharge for our room which we settled on a price, we were being charged for our dinner which was included, that was sorted, next morning we were being charged again for our dinner, this really annoyed us!! But over all a lovely hote",4,2017,02,20
207,Fabulous Old Hotel,"What a wonderful experience to stay at this hotel! It was absolutely wonderful, we spent a lot of our time here because we loved the loved the lobby resturatant and the lobby bars.It was old and completely in sync with the feel of Dublin. Rooms were lovely, great beds and sheets. Great bathroom. Close to all the sights. Great views of the park across the steet!",5,2017,02,20
207,Beautiful Hotel,"Lovely inside out. Ideal location. Very central. Food excellent. Staff superb. Room was perfect. The bedding was crisp and cozy. Bathroom spotless and great tub. Perfect after long flight. Quiet. Great room service. Nice to take walk across street at St Stephens Green. Will definitely be back to stay in this historic hotel. 
",5,2017,02,18
207,Valentines Day,My wife and I visited the hotel for a few drinks before dinner. We had a very pleasant evening. We were very well looked after and my wife enjoyed the expertly prepared cocktails. A nice comfortable ambience,5,2017,02,17
207,FAB U LOUS!!!,"Went to Dublin for a weekend with my fiancé. All I can say is that it was amazing. A faultless hotel. The beds are humongous and so comfortable. The bathroom was amazing really lovely shower and the bath was nice and big. 
Slippers and robes in the wardrobes still and sparking water in the rooms. 
The bar was lively loads of people had a really nice bar staff that served with a smile. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel for a couple that is visiting Dublin. 

",5,2017,02,17
207,Lunch,"I visited this iconic hotel for lunch.
The dining room was very impressive 
as were the serving staff, who were very full of information regarding
The long history of this famous hotel.

Food was of first clsss quality, my local steak was excellent as was the vegtables cooked to perfection,
House wine was of good quality but expensive for a house wine.

A really good lunch, highly recommended
",5,2017,02,17
207,The most overrated hotel I have staid in Dublin,"I was super excited to stay at the Shelbourne given its reputation. After my 3 days there I still wonder why such a reputation. The rooms are average, beds ok-ish and bathrooms unimpressive and small. 
Many of the staff I encounter have an arrogant attitude, looking down on clients. 
Breakfast was one of the worst I have tried ( In competition with Conrad breakfast). Staff serving breakfast don't know the serving etiquette, nor their products.  

The up part is the location, room service was fast and ""being seen"" at a top place if you are into that.  

I will not return here. Money spent only for reputation.",3,2017,02,16
207,Perfect Valentines Weekend,"We have just returned from a two night stay at the Shelbourne, and it did not disappoint. This was our visit to Dublin; the hotel is located centrally and is in a beautiful heritage building. We booked a Deluxe room which was spacious & comfortable, with great amenities. 

The staff really look after you, and provide a first class service. My boyfriend had booked a surprise valentines breakfast in the room & bouquet of flowers which were delivered at the time requested and to a very high standard! Housekeeping are fantastic, the room is always immaculate each day, and they turn down your bed each night & leave water/chocolates which is a nice touch. 

My only criticism, is that its known to be a Spa hotel! I personally found the Sauna & Steam rooms very dated & small. The pool & gym are large, but it doesn't have that spa look & feel you get with other places, there is also no jacuzzi. We didn't have any treatments, but the Spa reception team were lovely. 

However, if we visit Dublin again, we will certainly be returning to this hotel.",5,2017,02,15
207,Fabulous hotel,"The rooms are beautiful and immaculate! Housekeeping does an amazing job....if you call down for something, they are at your door within minutes! Front desk personnel are great. We had 3 rooms for 7 nights ( travelled with our adult kids ) and we all loved our stay at the Shelbourne.",5,2017,02,14
207,Very comfortable,"Although we were here for a Conference and the hotel was exceptionally busy, they looked after us very well.  The service was very good, the food was delicious, the bar service was efficient and nothing seemed too much trouble.  Our room was adequate and the bed was comfortable and everything worked.  Well done!",5,2017,02,14
207,Great Hotel,excellent hotel in a great location with excellent friendly staff. Lovely rooms with all amenities and public areas beautifully decorated. Great bars and a gorgeous room for afternoon tea. The best display of flowers I have seen in any hotel in Ireland.,5,2017,02,14
207,Business trip to Dublin,"We recently stayed at the Shelbourne for three night whilst on a business trip to Dublin. The hotel has a good location opposite the Park, within a 7 minute walk from Grafton Street and around 15 minutes from Temple Bar. Although turning left out of hotel you will find a few great old Irish pubs, these are within 3 minute walk and are just excellent also several very good restaurants within this district. 
The hotel staff could not be more attentive, nothing is to much trouble when you ask! That's why 4 star rather than 5 , as we found a light bulb not working, shaver point did not work ( but as soon as I mentioned it it was fixed) one morning the teabags were not replenished (again as soon as we mentioned it we had more delivered along with chocolates) but the main issue was the toilet flush!!! This only seemed to work when it wanted and could catch you out !! Not over hygienic! These perhaps only small issues but housekeeping should be onto it before being prompted! 
Apart from that the room was large, well laid out, huge king size bed which was very comfortable , large flat screen TV and free WIFI thank goodness ( some other 5 star hotels should take note!!) WIFI worked really well throughout the hotel.
We had breakfast included and found this to be excellent, the only issue the serving area was somewhat cramped ! Guests end up shuffling around each other! I also found wrong spoons in sauces (to short) or no spoon at all, 
If your having breakfast try to avoid peak times ! We had to wait in another room until a table became available! Again not good if your heading out in a hurry, 
The quality of the food could not be faulted, eggs cooked to order but be prepared to wait service is not over fast!
If you do not have breakfast included Starbucks is literally 2 minutes away, turn right out of hotel.

In summary an excellent hotel good location and very attentive staff.
They just need to be more proactive rather than the excellent reactive. Spot the issues before guests do.

Would we stay again? YES for sure.",4,2017,02,13
207,A working heritage hotel with real friendlinness.,"I couldn't even dream about staying in these places when i was younger but thankfully times have changed even in terms of snobbery. This has to be one of the most welcoming hotels I have ever stayed in and all the staff are genuine....it was a nice touch that we checked in with Chris and it was he who also checked us out. 
The breakfast had to be the best I have ever com across...especially as you can see the theatre of the chef cooking the fried eggs individually in mini-frying pans.",5,2017,02,13
207,Heritage property,"Lovely heritage hotel. Been there a few times now and have enjoyed each stay there.

Full of characters, good for fine dining, break fast selection is good, Spa ad Swimming pool are a great add on.

Rooms are spacious and very quiet.",5,2017,02,11
207,5* Afternoon Tea,"We had the Michael Flatley inspired afternoon tea which had numerous options including sandwiches, scones and a selection of artworked desserts. The atmosphere at the Shelbourne Hotel was lovely with a pianist playing in the background. The food was delicious and the staff were very helpful and accommodating for our dietary requirements. I would definitely recommend the Shelbourne for anyone wanting afternoon tea in the centre of Dublin.",5,2017,02,11
207,Excellent stay,"As always an top class experience at the Shelbourne.  We dined in the saddle room as it was part of our package, however, it is great value for dinner even if one were to pay the usual rate.  The food was fantastic.  I always get tempted to stay in one of the other 5 star Dublin hotels but the Shelbourne keeps bringing me back!",5,2017,02,11
207,Top quality,Incredible hotel with the best location in Dublin. The staff are so kind. Rooms are immaculate. I don't think i have ever had a better breakfast in a hotel before.. 5* My room had a view over Stephens Green which was just beautiful,5,2017,02,11
207,The saddle room @shelbourne hotel,"It was my daughters birthday and we decided to go to the saddle room restaurant in the shelbourne hotel it's a nice walk up grafton st turn left at the top and it's on your right.
We met in the bar had a drink no problem adding the bill to the table staff very helpful it's a very nice open bar with plenty of seating and if you sit by the window you can see the world go by 
The restaurant has an open kitchen you can see the chefs at work nice seating and I felt very comfortable at our table 
Full marks to all the staff very attentive and very helpful with any queries on the menu
The food was excellent no complaints there was no delay or long gaps between courses
The menu for Sunday lunch is priced at 26.50 euro for 2 course and 31.50 euro for 3 course well worth the money
The wine list maybe a little on the pricey side from 30 euro a bottle but you had a good selection in the 30/40 euro bracket .
All in all a very enjoyable lunch highly recommend 
Maybe I'm a bit biased been a Dubliner",5,2017,02,08
207,3rd visit in 13 months ,"Usually love the shelbourne but a bit disappointed this time around - restaurants and bars as good as always - good atmosphere good service good food and drinks . Location is just great both for shopping and sight seeing . Surrounded by bars and restaurants - nightlife is certainly not lacking . And of course, Dublin is a great city . 
However , The first room , small queen ( which we've never booked before ) was substandard - ok, we knew it wasn't going to be big but it was not a 5 star room  in our view . We asked to change and did so at a charge of €30 per night which we paid . The point is we shouldn't have been asked to accept the first room, especially as this was our 3rd stay in 13 months . 
",3,2017,02,07
207,Location location location,"I stayed here with my wife for one night. Hotel is right beside grafton street and has plenty of local restaurants very close to choose from. Hotel staff were friendly and rooms were good. Breakfast was good and plenty of variety. 

I'd definitely recommend for a couples stay.",4,2017,02,07
207,Wonderful Christmas Treat,"Booked a night in here as a treat before Christmas and it didn't disappoint. On arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite, the Michael Collins Suite. It was beautiful. We even had our own Christmas tree in the living room!! All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. We didn't have a meal in the hotel but the concierge was happy to offer advice on where to dine. The only down side was the bar was very busy later that night with the residents lounge full when we returned after dinner. I suppose Christmas is their busiest time of year. The location is perfect for strolling around and soaking up the atmosphere of the city centre.",5,2017,02,06
207,"gorgeous hotel, excellent location","This hotel was booked on our behalf since we were on a tour so we didn't know exactly what to expect - we were just going with the flow and didn't do much research since we didn't book this ourselves.  Beautiful hotel inside with fresh flowers throughout - you can tell that every detail has been attended to, to make this is a high end experience.  It's definitely a luxury hotel.  The breakfast each day was impressive in terms of selection and service.  The beds were incredibly comfortable.  The hotel is very, very close to all of the main shopping areas of Dublin.  Highly recommend.  We would stay there again.",5,2017,02,05
207,Excellent location!,"We stayed here for 2 nights after Christmas. The Shelbourne is a beautiful hotel and speaks to old-world luxury and elegance. We arrived by Aircoach, which drops you off about a block from the hotel and was very convenient (however, in the future, we would probably spring for a taxi--the Aircoach kept us waiting a little longer than expected). Our room was at the back of the hotel. What we sacrificed in views of St. Stephen's Green, was made up for in quiet. The room was on the small side, but well-appointed and comfortable. The bathroom was lovely, with Elemis products and an oversized bath. 

What really makes the Shelbourne special is its fantastic location. Located right across from St. Stephen's Green, it's in close proximity to museums, shopping, restaurants, and Trinity College. It was also a pick-up spot on the Newgrange tour by Mary Gibbons, which we reserved at concierge and highly recommend! 

The afternoon tea was a must-do on our chilly first afternoon. Reservations well in advance are a must.

We'll certainly look to stay at the Shelbourne for our next visit to Dublin!",5,2017,02,04
207,Excellent location good atmosphere,Very well located. A taxi cost Euro 12 from Heuston station. Got an excellent and large room with an equally large bathroom. WiFi was good and breakfast was expensive but excellent. Had some nice drinks in the bar. Went for a jog out to the end of Dun Laoighre pier which was around 15 miles return but with nice views out over the sea and little opportunity to get lost. Given the already high room prices in Dublin even for a cheap hotel it is worth paying a relatively small bit more to stay here.,5,2017,02,03
207,lovely hotel,"Very nice, very comfortable hotel.  Walking distance to many shops and restaurants.
First class rooms and service. Go out the door,turn left, go to the end of the block. Reilly's pub. No pub like an Irish pub.",5,2017,02,03
207,Slightly disappointing,"Stayed here for one night and was slightly disappointed as I expected it to be more impressive. It's a great location obviously  and bedroom was nice with comfortable bed. The walls must be pretty thin as I could very clearly hear the TV from the room beside me when I went to bed. 
The hotel was too warm everywhere.
I found staff to be friendly and attentive in general. Had dinner in the Saddle Room and it was good although i would expect this standard for the price. 
Decent breakfast too although it seemed like there weren't enough staff serving and had to call them for attention.
I enjoyed my stay but unfortunately I just don't feel like it lived up to its 5 star status.",4,2017,01,31
207,Holiday in Ireland,"We were late driving back late from County Cork and needed a place to eat nearby our hotel.

We found this gem that was open for last orders.  By the time we settled our selves into our seats,  the waiters were getting pretty anxious with us.

However they never showed an iota of displeasure.   They served us with a smile and grace that probably only an aged old establishment like this can carry off.

We were ravenous after the long drive and had very options on the menu for us.  So we ordered what we could eat. Unfortunately the portions of our meals were so small and delicate.  

But again the kind waiters fed us with lots of delicious hot toasted bread and lashings of butter.  

I must say the food here was good but not great however the service offered to us on that cold night was the best we had received on our entire trip in Dublin. 

",4,2017,01,31
207,Afternoon Tea,"I had Afternoon Tea with my parents last Friday, which was a wonderful experience. I had bought my mother a voucher for Afternoon tea for two for her birthday, so my Dad and I joined her. We got a lovely table by the window in the Lounge and we were very well looked after by Imelda & Lauren throughout. The food offering was great, you can really see the work that goes in to each piece. The tea and coffee selection is extensive, there is something for everyone. Obviously this is not something that you would do very often but it is a great way to treat someone special. We had a thoroughly enjoyable Afternoon Tea experience!",5,2017,01,31
207,Excellent,"I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. I stayed here with my mum and my sister as a birthday treat organised by my sister. She had booked it through a third party and when we arrived, the third party had made a mistake and booked us for the following night! However, the staff could not have been more helpful. . They had a room available and took us straight up (ahead of check-in time). When we first arrived in our taxi, the concierge appeared out of nowhere and wheeled in our cases; another lovely member of staff brought them up to our room for us. The room was very comfortable and spacious, the bathroom was very clean and luxurious. The hotel itself is in a great location - overlooking St Stephen's Green, about a 4 minute walk from the shopping centre and about 10 minutes from Grafton Street / Temple Bar. 
We headed down to the bar for something to eat at about 9pm but there weren't any tables free; however, another member of staff appeared and had one sorted for us in under 2 minutes. The food was absolutely gorgeous. The following morning we had breakfast and again the food was beautiful. The staff really couldn't do enough to help us and really made the weekend very special. Hopefully we will be back soon for another visit.",5,2017,01,30
207,Unforgettable stay!,Me and my boyfriend had a truly amazing stay at the Shelbourne! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel very special and welcome. I couldn't have asked for a better experience! We will definitely come again! Thank you to the whole staff who made this weekend so unforgettable for us! ,5,2017,01,29
207,Afternoon tea,"Was here recently for Afternoon tea. This wasn't my first time doing afternoon tea bit was still as special as the first.

The afternoon tea usually has a theme, so this time it was Michael Flatley, pervious times I was there it was summer fruits & Christmas. This theme will depend what small dessert's are given.

The whole thing is very enjoyable & worth the €49 without champagne for  a special treat. ",4,2017,01,28
207,A touch of class in Dublin,"My wife and I have just returned from a simply wonderful stay at The Shelbourne.
 
I do appreciate that you pay a fair price for the hotel but you get what you pay for and we were well looked after and I would highly recommend pushing the boat out and staying here.
 
Great Hotel in a very central location.",5,2017,01,27
207,The best hotel in Dublin!,"This hotel is in the perfect location! Just a quick walk from St. Stephens Green and Grafton Street shopping. The breakfast is the best breakfast I've ever had! Staff was lovely, turn down service is a treat. Overall an amazing stay, much better than my stay in Jurys Inn the previous year. The bar is a very nice atmosphere as well.",5,2017,01,27
207,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"For my wife's fortieth we decided to live it up a little and stay in Shelbourne for the weekend(20th to 22nd January).
I had booked over the phone and specifically requested breakfast to be included but was informed at check-in by the very unhelpful receptionist that this was not the case and breakfast would be an extra.
On the 21st we left our room 11.30/12noon and returned approximately 6.30pm only to find the room was not attended to, no dry towels and no toiletries to use to get ready to go out that evening. As we were tight on time for our dinner reservation we did not mention it until the following morning when we were checking out. The young lady at reception apologised on behalf of the hotel and gave us a number to call for the next time we were staying and we would be looked after but this very much felt like a brush off just to get us out the door.
We expected much much more from the Shelbourne......maybe our expectations were just too high",2,2017,01,27
207,The Best of Dublin proven once again,"Over the last 4 years I have had the opportunity to travel to Dublin with my wife and family each time  staying at the Shelbourne .  From the elegance and grandeur of the lobby, restaurant and residence bar to the personal touch that each staff member adds to the highest level of customer service - this hotel stands above the rest.

This past week, I was able to get another perspective.  Unfortunately traveling on business, I was not able to stay at the Shelbourne.  After speaking so highly about the hotel, my two collegues wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I told them how my wife and I would always finish the evening in the Shelbourne residence bar with a Shelbourne burger and fries.

After a few hours at the Olver St. John's Gogarty to immerse them in some traditional Irish music and a few pints, it was time to show them what I was talking about.  Unfortunately when we arrived it was ""after hours"".  The Marriott team member (Steven) who greeted us at the Shelbourne Residence bar inquired if we were guests of the Shelbourne.  Informing him that we were not, he politely but firmly told us that the bar was only for guest staying in the hotel.  I told him that I had stayed here numerous times and wanted to showcase the Shelbourne to my colleagues.  He once again explained the policy politely and then suggested that if I would like to speak to the manager.

I introduced myself to the night manager,  explained the situation and also provided him with my Marriott platinum rewards number.  After a few minutes on the computer verifying my story he welcomed me back to the Shelbourne thanked me for being a loyal Marriott rewards member and said he would be happy to accommodate me and my two colleagues in the bar.

According to my traveling companions, the atmosphere, service and food was actually better than what I had tried to convey to them.  If it was not for the Marriott's care and concern toward member loyalty, this night could have ended much differently.  Instead the Marriott Shelbourne has gained two new fans who will also share this story.",5,2017,01,27
207,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,Located very close to St Stephen's Green. The service is top class and there is always a good buzz in the bar. Enjoyed the high tea and access to great shopping. The hotel has been well renovated and brought the place back to life.,5,2017,01,26
207,Lovely staff......,"Wow not what we expected. All the staff to a person were charming and friendly and helpful. But...little OK room with cramped bathroom and no bath, far too hot and we couldn't turn the temperature down and no view but the cost was discounted but still overpriced. 58 Euros for two nights car accommodation on top, no internet available that we could find without paying more and 29 Euros each for breakfast too. And then the Saddle room diner. Cannot recommend the fixed price menu that we chose from. Beaujolais served warm(improperly spelt on list) crab and lettuce (? Iceberg) salad served much too cold and Brill dry and dry. 
Needs a renaissance!",2,2017,01,26
207,Shelbourne could do better!,"My wife and I stayed at the Shelbourne Friday 20th January and had two family members join us for dinner, so it was also a double January birthday celebration, which we did not mention. We have stayed at the Shelbourne for an overnight in January on a number of occasions for my wife’s birthday and always enjoyed it, it’s one of our favourite hotels in the world.

We were greeted warmly by Sarah on arrival at registration and upgraded to a Heritage room as usual together with a complimentary breakfast and a couple cocktails due to my Gold card status. The bedroom was a very nice corner room with an exceptional nice and spacious bedroom.

Late afternoon we had cocktails in the 27 lounge which was bustling with Friday after work and hotel guests. We met our guests in the Horseshoe Bar and shared a bottle of wine pre-dinner. I checked earlier to make sure our 8.30pm booking for our party of four was in order, which it was. On being seated we were informed that we could choose from the set menu or A ’la Carte, but all guest must choose the same menu, which didn’t really suite but we agreed on a choice. For starters three of us had the crab, which was fully lacking in taste. For mains there was one cod and one braised short rib, which were fine. Two opted for the breast of Thornhill duck, which the waiter stated was served pink. 

Service was painfully slow and the mains arrived c.10pm having been seated at 8.20pm although there were still a few vacant tables. Both duck servings were described as being tepid or lukewarm and the broccoli vegetable was cold. We soldiered on as were all hungry and when enquires were made as to our dinner we reported that the two ducks, although served pink as promised, both were disappointedly on the cold side. A manager appeared and offered to replace the two dishes, but we declined as we were already too long waiting. Both main courses were removed from the check, but we were charged the full a ‘la cart price for the starters and deserts! We had dined a number of times in the Saddle Room previously and had always been impressed to the point that we had a private family dinner for c.20 there and both the service and food were par excellence. Sadly on the occasion of this visit the service was tardy and food disappointing. I subsequently received a rambling apology via email from the restaurant manager, Mr. Cahill ….. when you’re explaining you are losing!

Breakfast the following morning was up to its usual excellent standard.  

On returning to our room that evening, the door to our room was open. I called reception, who said they would have security check it out. As the room had a turndown service, we concluded that housekeeping did not close the door correctly. On checking out the following morning when asked how our stay was I mentioned our concern regarding security and why there was no follow up. A manager was sent for and she said she would bring this to the attention of management. I subsequently received an email from a manager confirming that the door issue was down to housekeeping.

On arrival home, my wife discovered she left some belongings in her bedside draw including her favourite Tiffany spectacle holder. She called and spoke with someone in security who said nothing had been handed in, but they would check it out. I also followed up with an email Ms. Mroczek from reception which was not responded to. 

Overall we like to stay in the Shelbourne and likely return, but we will definitely not be staying for dinner.",4,2017,01,26
207,Very Average,"Not the hotel experience I expected. More like a budget tourist hotel than the expected excellence. Service was well below acceptable levels.

King size bed down graded to twin queens. Tiny room, lots of noise from the adjoining/party room and hallway. Low water pressure in the shower, and dangerous bath/shower design causing me to feel very unsafe after nearing falling.

Total confusion about what was included or not in the rate. Officious staff, especially at breakfast. Every day was a new adventure in unfriendliness. Not at all welcoming or engaging. Staff seemed more focused on themselves rather than their guests.

Not a good advert for Marriott.",3,2017,01,26
207,A Very Disappointing Stay at a Renowned Dublin Hotel,"My husband and I booked to stay in the Shelbourne hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary but there was not much to celebrate about our experience there. 
We attempted to check-in at around 1.30 but our room was not available, we were informed by the receptionist that we would get a call within an hour to check in as we had massages booked in the spa for 3.00pm, we went back to reception after an hour and the room was ready but we had not received the promised call.  Our room was quite small with a very inadequate  window looking out over a narrow laneway with a dark grey concrete building opposite making the room very dark (a bit cell like) we did ask for different room but were informed this was only possible by way of a paying a supplement which we declined.  We then made our way to the spa for our massages to be met with a less than enthusiastic receptionist is being kind!! I have never experienced anything like it in my life, if you have ever been made feel like an inconvenience to someone than you will know what I mean!! We went to separate rooms with our allocated therapists, I was very pleased with my treatment but there was noisy music coming through into the room which was very disturbing and certainly not relaxing, when I asked my therapist where the music was coming from she informed me there was a children’s party on in the hotel and it was from here, so the combination of  therapeutic music being played in the room and the party music from outside did not make for the de-stressing remedy that would normally be associated with a relaxing massage!! After our treatment we met back in the relaxing room, my husband’s therapist said she would bring a complimentary plate (of what I am not sure) as it never arrived.  After a stroll around the city we went into the bar (No.27) for a pre dinner drink where the service certainly did not equate to five star service, our waitress appeared to be a bit put out when we asked for some nibbles with our drinks!! We later went for dinner in the Saddle room restaurant where we were seated at the very first table (we had made this reservation many weeks before) beside the door and in front of the kitchen service area (we did ask for a different table but were told none were available) which also serves the bar so between restaurant clientele and service staff from the bar it did not make for the romantic dinner we were hoping for with people constantly trucking in and out!! The food was mostly very good, we had fish which was very salty we did mention this to our waitress and she said she would tell the Chef and that was it.  The breakfast the next morning was very good.  We were asked on three occasions was our stay at the hotel for a particular occasion (which was our anniversary) but not one of these staff members thought to mark this occasion in way, shape or form which I think confirms the total disconnection and disinterest in the guests by the staff. 
The check out was extraordinary,  from a very brash young lady who was demanding to know if we were checking  out before we even reached the receptions desk, at this stage is was almost comical......... All in all the service in the hotel is lacking in all aspects, there is very limited interaction with the guests, most of the staff I encountered did not as much as bid me hello, especially the concierge which in my opinion is normally the friendliest most outgoing department, never once raised their heads or passed any pleasantries on the numerous occasions I passed their desk.   As a Dubliner myself and one that is very aware of the reputation of the Shelbourne hotel to say this was an unfortunate experience is an understatement.  The hotel is really beautiful but it is only skin deep, there is no substance behind the luxurious surroundings which is a real shame.
It has taken me some time to publish this review simply because it took me a while to get over my disappointment of this hotel, I did contact the hotel to convey my disappointment I spoke to a very nice lady in guest relations who was very understanding, we were offered to return for afternoon tea but we declined.  I also received an email from another person in guest relations after filling in the hotel questionnaire (which I felt was the usual response ’’apologies but everything is normally wonderful’’  kind of thing).  Both guest relation’s personnel suggested if we should ever return to the hotel to contact them directly and they would assure we would have a wonderful stay which is the one thing that made me laugh about our experience, we paid for a service we certainly did not receive and in order for the hotel to put right we should go back, pay them again so they can prove they are capable of providing the service the did not in the first place................
There is a lot of focus and attention paid to the celebrity guests past and present so maybe regular guests just aren’t good enough!!",3,2017,01,24
207,Great location if a bit pricey for rooms & in the bar,"We had pre-booked several months ago a Heritage Premium room for our return weekend visit to the Shelbourne. As it transpired we ended up at the far end of the hotel, on the sixth floor overlooking Kildare Street, although there was a reasonably good skyline view of the setting sun on both evenings.

The room was spacious enough with reasonable natural light in both the main room and the adjoining bathroom and windows which open for a welcome bit of fresh air. The bed was extremely comfortable & we both slept well each evening. There is a turn down service and the rooms were well serviced both days. Wifi was reliable and had solid signal strength.

On our last visit we took breakfast in the dining room, though there were lengthy and unwelcome queues. So this time we decided to pay the extra €6 for 'breakfast in bed' and to lounge a tad longer in the scratcher. Breakfast was delivered on time & exactly as ordered. Unfortunately the cooked breakfast was on the cool side, perhaps partly a function of the distance from the kitchen, but still the trolly hold should have been much hotter to begin.

On returning to the hotel after dinner on the second night our initial trip to the sixth floor was in vain as the key card did not operate. On returning to reception we found it empty - no one at all at the desk or in the reception area! When someone did appear they somewhat casually recoded the key card & my other half took the long trek to the sixth floor only to find that they key again did not work! The second return visit to reception again found it completely unmanned - surely there should be a constant presence in this area? We were told there were some problems with 'the system' which was meant to explain the inconvenience caused!

Valet parking at the hotel is €29 per day - still cheaper than any of the nearby car parks and it was very convenient and efficient.

Express check out is available & you can review the bill online through the TV. I still don't understand why more people don't use this facility - amazing the number of people queuing up at reception to manually check out!

Overall we enjoyed our stay, the hotel is very warm & comfortable, it has it's own charm but drinks in the lounge can be expensive and the rooms are always in demand. Happy to recommend for any occasion.",4,2017,01,23
207,"Historic, Hip Downtown Dublin Luxury hotel","Historic building, lavishly updated. On the St Andrews Green. Wonderful combination of classic architecture, with beautiful comfortable public areas. Just the opposite of stuffy, the In Crowd is here every evening. Can't say enough about the level of friendly service we received.",5,2017,01,22
207,Quick visit ,"Haven't been to Dublin for years so looked for a hotel in good location, we booked this hotel and wasn't disappointed, the hotel was fab, the room was very clean and nice, the free wifi, up to date TV, bathroom was nice size with all lovely free shampoos etc,
We didn't eat at the hotel but had cocktails in the very busy buzzy bar, I thought the cocktails were very expensive but very delicious!
Yesterday morning we came down to join hotel for breakfast but again felt 30 euros each was too much . 
Yesterday afternoon we attended a private venue at the hotel and it was fabulous and service was fab and the food was great x ",5,2017,01,22
207,Very average stay,"Having stayed in numerous 'prestigious' hotels before I found that the Shelbourne falls below par. This was actually our 3rd stay there and I feel that it has gone down in standards a little.
Firstly one of the men who greeted us at the door was rather sourly. Check in was efficient. However, the 'deluxe room' was still very small. Room was very clean as one would expect. Disappointed with the tea and coffee facilities. Many other hotels of this class now have coffee machines. There was a very limited supply of tea and coffee, 4 little tubs of milk and no biscuits! We stayed at a 4 star hotel the next night and were provided with so much more and paid a third of the price!
Breakfast was not included in our rate but it was very good the last time we had it. Overall a very mediocre experience and I feel that the hotel has to improve standards to justify the rate it charges.",3,2017,01,21
207,Great location but had a few issue especially the bed.,"Stayed 684 and 682 19-21st January with adjoining rooms.  The Deluxe room was great, the adjoining room was great, however the bed was extremely hard.  I prefer hard beds but this was way too hard.  Did not sleep the first night asked reception to do something with the bed, got back after a late night event, only to find bed was still hard.  Would have rated 4 or 5 stars because don't get me wrong this is a great hotel and well located with in the main good staff.  However in the end the hotel is a place to sleep and myself and my wife slept very little over the two day stay.  ",2,2017,01,21
207,Not a 5 star hotel by any means,"We have stayed at the Shelbourne a few times and it has been getting worse. On our last visit we were given a small room that you couldn't swing a cat in. 
However we accepted this. But breakfast really took the biscuit. 
We had to queue for over 35 minutes for the breakfast room while their two bars remained empty. I do not understand why they don't allow for this space to be used for the excess guests eating breakfast.
It was not the first time we have had to queue for breakfast here but it is certainly our last. 
Eventually, when we did sit down, we found out that they had run out of sausages. This is a joke for a 5 star luxury hotel. I have stayed in better 3 stars.
In the evening the service for two drinks in the residents bar was incredibly slow although the area was practically empty.
On the 2nd morning we got up, saw the queue again and decided to go out and down the road for breakfast to a lovely cafe next to the hotel where I even recognized some fellow guests! 
Not good enough at all.",1,2017,01,19
207,Great Place but be prepared,"So, great hotel when you are getting with free points.  Now because of the history of it , good bar and friendly front counter people we will rate it a four. 

The bad part beyond the price is the bartenders are a little rude and the room is not so fancy for the price.  But for Ireland it is a nice place when you take in the history of the hotel.  

So 4 stars try it once and decide.  We moved over after three days to Temple Bar Hotel.   Night and day.  Some good some not.     Now if you want to wear a suit and look like you have lots of money probably you will like Shelbourne.   We had money dressed casually and different treatment. 

But try once ",4,2017,01,18
207,Lovely stay,"I love this hotel, it is luxury that is warm and open with no snobbery from the staff. Hotel's location is just perfect for seeing Dublin. The staff are very polite, friendly and helpful. The room was clean, and nicely decorated, beds are very comfy, shower really nice too. Toiletries are Elemis (lovely!), and the robes & turn down service are nice touches. We booked in for our wedding anniversary - our wedding was in the hotel the previous year - but we found the little touches were just not up to the standard the hotel had set itself the previous year. E.g. my mum and sister had left gifts, as did my husband, with the hotel, but they were not in the room when we arrived! Just a minor thing, but still my husband was disappointed the flowers weren't waiting for me, as was my sister that her gift wasn't!
The staff in the bars (Bar 27 & Horseshoe) are friendly & professional, when you can get one though as Bar 27 particularly gets uncomfortably full sometimes. We stayed in Nov 2016, and nearly passed out from the heat although it was cold outside such were the crowds of people. We left and went somewhere else because it really was unbearable! I think that the hotel should limit numbers into this bar after a certain hour or when a certain number of patrons is reached. Also, even though we were residents, we were not allowed into the hotel entrance that night, and had to walk around the corner to access the hotel through the bar's side door. Only a short walk, but I was slightly miffed by this to be honest as we were going to our room!
Breakfast is plentiful, tasty and, again, the staff are brilliant, it is worth getting the B&B rate as you really won't need to eat again until dinner! My tip is the pancakes, I nearly went into a food coma, but they were worth it haha
I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2017,01,18
207,Afternoon Tea Delights!,"Afternoon Tea at The Grand old Lady of St Stephen's Green! 

When we arrived we were quickly shown to our seats in the lovely Lord Mayor's lounge and the menu was explained to us. We then selected which tea we would like from the extensive list, and of course, if the one we chose wasn't to our taste we could try another. This was then followed by delicious finger sandwiches and then a delightful array of Alice in Wonderland themed cakes and scones! It was a lovely experience that I hope to have again.

Upon leaving the hotel we walked straight across the road into St Stephen's Park and had a lovely stroll through the gardens.",5,2017,01,18
207,Very pleasant but ended on sour note,"As Marriott rewards members, my dear  husband and I stayed for 3 nights and had both great and not so great experiences with establishment. Knowing we had early morning arrival, after overnight flight, we had prearranged with hotel management by phone for an early checkin. That message did not make it to the front desk. Reality: Upon arrival, we were told by the non-Irish, but cute young man at desk, that our room was not available. Ugh. After some polite pressing, it became available. Lovely, yet smallish room, very nice bed and linens, but only one night out of three, did we receive turn-down service. Also, tub drain was clogged, yet DH didn't want a bunch of plumbers visiting room during our stay so we silently dealt with that. Breakfast, and front bar service food and drink very nice. Navigators quirky, and knowledgeable. Bad was we prearranged night before departure with desk, for early morn taxi to airport, that would accept credit card. Confirmed 25 euro. Reality: taxi (#13568) was there on time, but once at airport he insisted we pay cash and that it was 35 euro. We felt flimflammed.",4,2017,01,16
207,An exquisite refuge in the heart of Dublin,"We return like lemmings to this grand dame of a hotel every January because it offers beauty, old fashioned grace and elegance. Entering the warm and expansive entranceway, we breathe a sigh of thanks and relief. The relaxation we experience at the pool or salon is like no other. The food offerings are varied in both type and setting. We always feel welcomed and pampered. I sleep very well and soundly in the amazingly comfortable bed and room. The reception, waitstaff and concierge gentlemen are excellent; hats off to management for setting such high standards and cultivating these professionals. I can only hope for another visit next January.",5,2017,01,15
207,Overpriced & Pretentious,"Stayed here for two nights over Christmas and to be honest we were expecting a whole lot more. This would be an average hotel at half the price. We didn't receive the warmest welcome on arrival because we probably didn't appear posh enough. After a long day shopping we looked forward to getting back to the room for a shower - but it wasn't to be - as there was no running water in the room for 4 hours! This led to us missing a dinner reservation. For a €350+ per night hotel, the least you expect is running water. The fitness suite was also a let down. There are much better 4 star hotels in the city centre - where we will be staying in future..",1,2017,01,14
207,Easter treat,"Stayed over Easter can't fault this hotel love the hotel bar often frequent it when in Dublin. Have to say it was even better being able to retire to your room at the end of the night highly recommend,",5,2017,01,13

Staff - exceptional service

Breakfast - brilliant

Bar - we had one evening meal here and drinks both early evening and very late in the evening. Staff were helpful, food was delicious and the vibe was great

Concierge and doormen - great service, polite and very helpful. Nothing was too much trouble

As Arnie would say - I'll be back!!

207,Fairytale in Dublin,"The Shelbourne was the first experience I had in Dublin at the start of my first Ireland trip. I choose to stay there because I wanted old world charm with luxury amenities. 

The hotel was beautifully decorated. The staff all very professional. Our room was small but comfortable and full of special design details. Our bed and the linens were wonderful, the lighting system was quite intricate, and the shower was awesome. 

The two bars we fun, festive, and crowded...probably due to the great atmosphere and libations. 

My bf and I enjoyed high tea. It's pricey, but worth the experience. If you're going to stay at the Shelbourne, than do it right and have some tea!  

There is a restaurant onsite, I'm sure it's also delicious but we didn't eat there. Oh well, next time. We will be back. ",5,2017,01,09
207,Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Shelbourne is the best hotel in Dublin.  Not only is the location great, the service is outstanding, plus the hotel has a lot of history.

The hotel is across the street from St. Stephen's Square, and it's a very nice and popular park in the center of Dublin.  Also Grafton Street is a 5-10 minute walk.

Check in to the hotel was very easy, and the front desk staff was extremely friendly.  We got in early because of the flight from the United States, and one of our rooms was ready.  They were nice enough to let us check into this room until the second room was ready.

Our room was at the end of the hall in a corner, and was a very good size.  The beds were super comfortable, and the restroom was very pretty with all the marble.  We had a separate tub and shower, so it was nice to have both options.  The products in the hotel were very nice as well.  We were lucky to have a nice bottle of wine as a surprise, and different chocolates each night before bed.

One night, we stayed out late and wanted drinks at the hotel bar.  Fortunately they served us because we were staying in the hotel.  The drinks were great, and the bartender was very friendly.  

The place is decorated beautifully, the staff is very professional, the rooms are gorgeous, and the location is perfect.  This is really a great place to stay while visiting Dublin.",5,2017,01,09
207,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I have always wanted to stay a night in the world famous Shelbourne Hotel,so on the 7th of January my daughter booked tickets for a musical and a room for the night in the Shelbourne Hotel for us both as a special birthday surprise for me,I wish she had spent her hard earned money somewhere else ,from the time we arrived to the time we left our stay at the Shelbourne Hotel was one big disappointment. When we arrived at hotel we were not sure where the reception area was as its not obvious from the main door its down the hall ,we did not  see any obvious signs to indicate this either ,so we waited in the hall inside the door in the hope a member of staff would come and ask if they could help us ,no such luck they passed us by time and time again and we were just ignored eventually I had to go find someone myself to show us to the reception area .At reception area checked in by not particularly friendly staff. A little bit of polite conversation seemed too much trouble .Couple of positive notes On our way up to our room which was spotlessly clean but small met two of the maids that were cleaning the rooms who were the first to greet us with a good evening and had a little polite conversation with us ,also the staff at the desk in both swimming pool and spa were very polite and helpful. Unfortunately that's where the positive notes end ,decided to go down town to eat instead of staying in hotel. In the evening we decided to have a drink in The Lord Mayor's Lounge again to be served by unfriendly staff that diddent seem to notice when customers wanted to be served, it took us ages to catch their eye everytime we wanted to to order anything , it wasn't worth the trouble  ,we were beginning to wonder if we were invisible at this stage so we decided to go to bed early. Checked out early next morning diddent bother to stay for breakfast. Next time I'm going up to Dublin and am looking for a hotel to stay in I will be going back to either Clayton Hotel or Grand Canal Hotel where the staff are friendly polite and helpful and can't do enough for their customers. Definitely not the Shelbourne Hotel.",1,2017,01,09
207,Wonderful night away from it all...,"Booked for date night. Outstanding service, from the friendly doorman who took the car and the bags to the friendly receptionis through to the 'navigator' who booked us dinner. Offered a room upgrade for a small fee. Well worth worth it. Hubby loved the history room which chronicles famous guests including those who created the Irish constitution. Beautiful hotel steeped in history with exceptional service.",5,2017,01,09
207,"Historical hotel, great public areas, rooms a little old.","Stayed for two nights. The room size was small for a 5 star hotel. The facilities in the room were OK - but no coffee!. Bathrooms funactional with hard to use water valve. AC not up to sctratch. Was noisy.
Staff were very helpful.",4,2017,01,09
207,"Excellent people, great classic hotel","We stayed at the Shelbourne prior to our wedding and received great treatment when we showed up a few hours before check-in time, minus our checked luggage which hadn't made it on the plane to Dublin. The front desk personnel were empathetic and were able to get us a room right away rather than having us cool our heels until check-in time. (We agreed to accept 2 queen beds for the king room we'd reserved; we just wanted a shower and a rest prior to going out shopping for something to wear!) The room was very quiet and tidy, comfortable beds and fantastic dressing gowns which were much prized considering our luggage predicament. Luckily we got our bags the next day, but in the moment we were very grateful the hotel was able to work with us! We also enjoyed a drink at the hotel after we returned from dinner - the bar was very nice and the cocktails were great. This is an older hotel so anyone seeking a mod boutique hotel experience will not find what they are looking for, but lovers of grand old properties will find this beauty to their liking.",4,2017,01,09
207,5 star service ,"Myself and my husband stayed in the shelbourne this weekend. It was a massive treat for us and we were well treated. Staff were amazing, so friendly and helpful. The Extra little touches really did make our stay even more special.
I got a package in the salon and felt a million dollars. Food in the saddle room was absolutely delicious and again service was amazing.
We'll definitely be back in the future!",5,2017,01,09
207,"Lovely room, confusing hotel","I will start with the best part of the hotel, which was our room.  We loved the beautiful details, including the high ceilings, crown molding, and gorgeous bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable, as was the other furniture in the room.  The turn-down service was very nice, and the staff was all very friendly.  What we did not like was our arrival at the hotel.  When we walked in the door, we were surrounded by people but the check-in desk was nowhere in sight.  You have to twist and turn to get to the lobby, which might have been confusing any time but it was especially confusing after an overnight flight and more than an hour of driving around Dublin.  Some guidance from the valet staff would have been nice, though they made up for it later in the evening and when we departed the next morning.  We had a similar experience when we went for breakfast, and no staff was anywhere in sight for quite some time.  While the staff was all very friendly, they also seemed very busy and left some gaps in their service.  But otherwise, we had a nice one-night stay.",4,2017,01,08
207,Topclass a must visit,What can I say from the moment you pull up you are treated so well. We stayed here for one night and could not find fault in anything. Top class location along with terrific staff make it a must stay for all.I was blown away but the customer service throughout the hotel and nothing was ever too much trouble.Swimming pool is lovely and very clean perfect for a early morning swim!!! I would safely say the breakfast is the best I have ever had.We are already planning a second trip but certainly lived up to expectation!!,5,2017,01,08
207,Grandeur and style,"Oh what a beautiful hotel and historic setting. If you love tradition and a classic ambiance, the this is the place to go. Excellent lounges, breakfast and afternoon tea, classy bar with excellent service throughout.",5,2017,01,08
207,Night cap,The Shelbourne Hotel feels like a top notch hotel and it lives up to how it feels. My only disappointment on this trip was the difficultly on getting a night cap in the bar but I still love staying here.,4,2017,01,07
207,Enjoyable but not memorable,"The Shelbourne Hotel has an international reputation and it was a pleasure to have the experience. We stayed for two nights in a richly-furnished room on the top floor which certainly created the ambiance expected of this hotel. We were a little disappointed with the lack-lustre reception received at check in. No problem, except that the welcome was neither Irish nor engaging. The only other criticism was the bright light cast by the radio/alarm device placed beside our bed which necessitated covering for proper sleep. The security safe had run out of battery power but this was put right immediately, following a phone call, by a most engaging technician. Other international hotels instruct their staff to say ""Good morning"" or similar when meeting guests in public areas but this was missing here. Checkout was painless, except for the extra charge for a meal we did not have, but this was rectified promptly. All in all, we had a pleasant stay but we consider that the Shelbourne did not reach the lofty standards experienced in similar luxury hotels in capital cities.",4,2017,01,07
207,So Sad to see: The Grand Old Lady' Decline,"It is terribly sad to witness how this piece of Dublin history has been chained to uniformity even if, in ways, this allows for some reliability amongst variables. 

The visit was not a complete disaster, in that in both our bedrooms, the beds were comfortable; the toiletries good quality; the bedroom/turndown staff were pleasant. Bellboy and reception staff were pleasant. 

This hotel wins a lot of custom over for its  location being so good; the public and private areas are well maintained. The spa was pleasant and well run.

However, much is amiss. Some behind the scenes. Some in full view. 

Being scrutinised by staff at the entry to every part of the public spaces; main bar, saddleroom restaurant; lord mayor's lounge is very tiresome and very unpleasant. It's just endless. One does not feel welcome as a resident. It's more of an expensive bar/cafe club downstairs. Don't expect any more than that. 

There is no library room or upstairs space for residents away from the maddening crowds, that have placed this grand old lady of Dublin under intolerable pressure. Absolutely of a kind I have never seen in other hotels at home and abroad. There's simply not enough space. It's intolerable. 

The hairdresser had no idea what she was doing, when we used that service. 

The air conditioning in both rooms was noisy for such a newly refurbished hotel. Very inferior. It had to be turned off to sleep. 

The handle came off the inside of one of our bedroom doors, which was scary (thankfully it was quickly fixed). 
 
Some of the staff made a real effort to be pleasant and professional; but others more than made up for that during our three day/night stay. By that, I mean by their cavalier and insensitive attitude, in case the reader wonders about ambiguity. 

Dinner: main course was excellent; starter was fairly good; dessert was very average and the so-called pavlova looked mass produced. Wine was fine. Service was good. But I would question that any of it matched the price €85/person plus wine. 

The breakfast buffet certainly never managed hot food on any of the three mornings; only warm at best. Not worth €21-29/person even if the overall Selection was quite good. 

But some items, like the cheese and salami, looked like they were on their second or third display day. 

The ladies 'on sentry duty' outside the restaurant would need changing about. They should take up duties with the CIA interrogation squad. ",2,2017,01,06
207,Staying at this hotel makes you hope your flight is canceled - so you have to stay another day :),"I booked this hotel with my Marriott points - so I don't even know what the standard room rate is (I probably don't want to know). This is true luxury and elegance in accommodations. The bathroom has a walk-in shower and a very large tub. They even go so far as to provide bath salts, which are very welcome after spending hours on the road! At the risk of stereotyping, I will say it is everything an American lady could want in a hotel: hair dryer, king size bed, iron and ironing board, standard tea / coffee set, Nespresso machine, lighted mirror, easily adjustable heat / cooling...so many conveniences not always found together. :) I was sad I had only booked one night there. The Shelbourne Dublin will definitely be on my list for future visits!",5,2017,01,06
207,Fantastic place in the heart of the city,"Comfortable rooms, lovely coffee and food and fantastic staff. one can visit it for drinks with friends on a weekend and still feel like a guest of the hotel. Its location beats most Dublin hotels and the ambiance is lovely.",5,2017,01,05
207,A little bit of heaven for our last day in Ireland!,Luxury all the way! If you have an American Express card do the luxury hotel package. Worth every penny! Food was amazing. Beds were so comfy we didn't want to get up. Have a Spa service. Thai massage was wonderful!!!,5,2017,01,04
207,Great Hotel and location - plus great breakfast,We stayed at this hotel on Marriott points. The hotel look amazing from the outside and entry area in the hotel. All of the restaurants are what you would expect from Marriott related property. The rooms are standard size and are above average based on other trips outside the US. The service was excellent from the front desk to a late night in the bar. The breakfast offers plenty of choices even for a picky eater. I would stay here again on my next trip.,5,2017,01,04
207,Excellent ,I actually visited the Shelbourne for my birthday last January (January 22nd). Throughout 2016 I have visited over 30 hotels but can say that the Shelbourne was by far my favourite. It really lived up to its impeccable reputation. The room we were given was excellent. It was luxurious and comfortable. All the staff of the Shelbourne were true professionals and made my visit to this prestigious hotel one to remember. I will definitely be back again as I  have planned to return for this years birthday and am really looking forward to it. ,5,2017,01,04
207,A must for your bucket list ,"Overnight stay in this iconic hotel and you will not be disappointed.. the hotel can only be described as sheer luxury and full of character.. from the moment we set foot on the tiled floors inside this opulent hotel we were caught up in the ambience and huddle bustle of people mingling and making their way to and from the many bars and restaurants contained in this beautiful hotel. I cannot compliment the staff, the bedroom suite (which were were upgraded to)or the fine dining enough. Every thing we wanted or needed was attended too. I cannot fault anything during our visit.This hotel must be on your bucket list and most certainly is worthy of at least one overnight stay. 
We most certainly we be returning to relive the experience. ",5,2017,01,02
207,Maria nolan,Stayed with two kids over christmas and they loved it! The pastry house and decorations were brilliant and they even gave them bread to feed the ducks in the park across the street! The bars were a little too busy for us but we had a beautiful meal in the room instead. Beautiful stay.,5,2016,12,31
207,Great seafood platter in Saddle Room,"Very enjoyable seafood platter for  lunch which I can recommend - in particular the oysters and crab. All the staff were very helpful, efficient and attentive on a very busy day. 
Loved the atmosphere and the decor. I will definitely be back. ",5,2016,12,31
207,Exceptional Standard & Service,"My partner and I stayed here as a pre Xmas treat, while doing some shopping in Dublin City Centre. Although the hotel was busy, the staff could not have been more helpful. The atmosphere is amazing and the service is truly 5 star.
Would recommend this to all my friends as its not just a hotel, its an experience.",5,2016,12,29
207,Thanksgiving in Ireland,"My sister and I stayed here the first night in Ireland.  We stumbled off an overnight flight and walked into the lobby before 6 AM.  They immediately accommodated us and ensured we were not want of anything.  The room was large, well appointed and lovely.  The location was even better.  Since we had a short stay and much to see, we were pleased to find out that there was an Airport Shuttle and Hop On Hop Off bus stop within a few minutes of the hotel.  Stephen's Green was across the street and there were many high end restaurants and pubs nearby.  If you are a Starbucks fan, there is even one of those just on the next block.  We are so glad to have stayed here and would certainly do so again, on our next trip.",5,2016,12,28
207,The wonderful Mayors tea room,"You have arrived by taxi, the top hat wearing concierge greets you warmly. Through the swing door you go, take a right and you find yourself in the most opulent tea room in the world. Sit back and soak up the atmosphere. Thanks to my wife for organising this wonderful experience, actually everything on this trip! And I'm the Dub!",4,2016,12,27
207,Fantastic ,"I spent a night here at the start of Dec with a friend of mine as a Christmas treat. Let's just say we will now be making it a Christmas tradition, we loved every single thing about it from check in to check out. ",5,2016,12,22
207,Dublin to Belfast trip!,"Great hotel right on the bus route. Wonderful service, great food in the restaurant, I definitely would recommend staying here. Out of the central part of the city so it was much quieter and much more relaxing..",5,2016,12,21
207,Eoghan & Roisin made our trip exceptional!!,"We stayed for a magical night there last Saturday and I have to say that Eoghan McCague and Roisin just went above and beyond the levels of service that the Shelbourne prides itself in. Can someone please tell them both that we spoke at length about how they really made our stay magical. 

Congratulations to whomever trained these this dynamic duo - shining stars of Dublin's finest hotel. 

Happy Christmas to you all.

207,Stunning property with great service/,"We loved the proximity to st stephens green, shops and restaurants. The character of the property set is aside from all others. The bar was great, service was a little slow but it was crowded.I would highly recommend this property compared to others!",5,2016,12,19
207,Lovely Pre Christmas break,"A real pre Christmas treat with an overnight stay and dinner at the Shelbourne. A lovely festive atmosphere in the hotel made it special. Staff were very helpful and friendly, food at dinner was delicious and our room lovely. However breakfast was a bit disappointing. The buffet selection was fairly average and the display area very small with one lady  guest have difficulty getting around in her wheelchair. ",4,2016,12,19

207,Busy saturday in September,Stayed saturday 10th of Dec.  Very busy - xmas party season and Dublin city centre was thronged.  Great festive feel around town.  Stayed in one of the refurbished rooms on 1st floor.  Very nice but not big.  Staff very friendly.  Lovely historic hotel - superb location for downtown and shopping.,4,2016,12,15
207,Amazing. No complaints!!!!,"I am a tough Marriott critic. Having been platinum nearly 10 years, I've seen a lot. This is by far the best experience at any Marriott to date. The kindness of every single employee to my family and I was incredible. The food was impeccable. The rooms amazing. The coffee...yum! Thank you for making our first trip to Ireland the best.

207,A nice hotel in Dublin,"Recently I travelled to Dublin for a conference and stayed at The Shelbourne for one night.
It was my first time in a Renaissance hotel and I was glad that I chose the hotel.

I arrived one hour earlier than expected - and two hours earlier than the official check-in but still they did everything to make the room ready. A maid even came after I went to the room and asked whether I needed something from her.
The hotel does not have an Executive Lounge, thus I got complimentary breakfast and two coupons for drinks as a Platinum Elite member.
I used my coupons in the bar, which was really crowded - but the waiter asked some people whether I could join them. So, I even got in contact with some Dubliners.
I had some nice craft beers and oysters - the oysters were really delicious and bigger than oysters in Germany.
After that I went to my room and had some cheese and crackers as a Welcome amenity.

The next day I went for the breakfast - and this was also perfect. It was the first time that I had Egg Benedict with steak for breakfast.

The hotels also features a nice big pool and it is situated close to St. Stephen's Green a nice park in Dublin.

There was just one issue - at 6 am my phone was called - and I ""stood"" in my bed. To stop it I",4,2016,12,14
207,Xmas Overnight Stay,My wife and I stayed in thois hotel in early Dec 2016. We were very pleased with the level of service and the room was beautiful. Breakfast next morning was also excellent. This hotel is also very well located near lots of cool bars and restaurants,5,2016,12,14

A can't miss in Dublin.",5,2016,12,14
207,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed 2 nights at the Shelbourne.  What a wonderful experience.  Our stay couldn't have been nicer. It was one of the highlights of our trip. Our rooms were spotless. The beds were very comfortable.  The room darkening drapes were a welcome convenience after an overnight flight from the United States. Nightly turn down service with bedside slippers was a welcoming touch.
The hotel was festively decorated for Christmas with a large tree in the lobby.  We had afternoon tea in the Mayor's lounge which was delightful.
The hotel is one of the few in Dublin with an indoor pool which was large enough to swim laps. The locker rooms were clean and well stocked with towels and toiletries.
We had the breakfast buffet which was bountiful and delicious. We had 3 rooms booked at this hotel and we were not disappointed. We would stay there again. Hotel is conveniently located to Dublin's attractions. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful.",5,2016,12,13
207,Leisurely late lunch,A really lovely atmosphere. We had lunch in the bar restaurant. Very attentive staff. The food was delicious. I had the fish pie it was really tasty. Odd combination of serving it with a tomato salad.  The Christmas tree in the lobby was gorgeous and the Christmas decorations were beautiful. ,5,2016,12,12
207,"Was disappointed, lacked 5 star touch","Had a 2 night stay this weekend, while there was not anything specific to complain about we both felt it lacked the 5 star touch, it seemed to be a bit of a mad house, we enjoyed bar food upstairs Saturday night but the decor caught our eye, wall paper/paint in roof peeling, v hard to get a drink in the bar & as for breakfast we enjoyed our Sunday morning next door in hatches in a much nicer atmosphere & divine food at fraction of price
Nice take away coffee at reception, asked for milk for empty jug, gave up waiting in end.
Think we will try somewhere next Xmas for a change",3,2016,12,12
207,Afternoon Tea,"Had the best Afternoon Tea ever in The Shelbourne Hotel today. Last Christmas our three daughters bought us a voucher for Afternoon Tea in The Shelbourne. It was fabulous, the quality of the sandwiches, scones and pastries was amazing. The staff are unbelievable, service is just incredible and the staff dress code is just perfect for Hotel. I don't think you will find anywhere better in the World. I was unable to find a single fault. 
A must for your ""bucket list"" Enjoy, it's guaranteed.",5,2016,12,11
207,Not a well oiled machine,"Stayed here recently with my husband, had high expectations due to its perceived reputation but come morning time I was sure the dream is not reality. We stayed in a standard queen room, very small box room with an even smaller excuse for an en suite. On the bed there was the breakfast card from the previous guests and that night my husband had a restless night due to the constant buzz from mini fridge which had to be unplugged, air-conditioning in the room even in off position intermittently comes on and air conditioning units could be heard from outside. Breakfast was a let down , overpriced buffet, was not feeling the 5 star service while I plated my own meal.. 450 euro later I can safely say I won't be back and would not recommend. ",3,2016,12,11
207,Perfection.  Wonderful room. Great food and AMAZING Genealogy Service onsite!,"The Shelbourne Dublin is 5 star travel all the way.  I stayed during December, the holiday season and the hotel was beautifully decorated with Christmas decorations and a stunning tree.  The hotel room was very comfortable with a larger bed and huge bathroom.  Products from ELEMIS were provided from the hotel's spa, which were very pampering. I enjoyed a nice hot bath in the deep tub after an exhausting day of travel.

Breakfast in the Saddle Room restaurant was included and very delicious!  In addition to the traditional Irish breakfast and Irish tea, they offer fresh juices and healthy smoothies.

One very unique feature that the hotel offers is a Genealogy package.  For Americans (or anyone with Irish relatives) seeking to research their Irish ancestors this service is a wonderful way to start.  Guest can make an appointment with the amazing Helen Kelly, who is the resident Shelbourne Hotel ""Genealogy Butler."" Ms. Kelly helps you start your search and tells you where to go online and in person to get the details.   Ms. Kelly is truly a wealth of information and I had a wonderful visit with her learning about my Irish family.   I don't know of any other hotel that offers this service and it's so convenient, as your meet with Ms. Kelly at the Shelbourne.

I can't stay enough good things about the staff and facilities at the Shelbourne. I will definitely stay there again when I visit Dublin.  It's a special treat to visit this historic hotel.  Next time I hope to visit their gorgeous spa!",5,2016,12,11
207,Cocktails ,"Didn't stay here but we popped in for a few drinks. Highly recommend their cocktails. The bar give off such a chilled out yet classy vibe. Definitely going back. The location is ideal, across from St. Stephens Green and round the corner from Grafton Street for shopping. ",5,2016,12,11
207,Won't accept their own gift voucher,"I'm absolutely gobsmacked that the shelbourne hotel will not honour my voucher from last year. It is seldom you come across an establishment of their 'calibre' that do not accept a voucher bought in their own hotel that is only 6 months out of the 12 month period.
Buyer beware if you are thinking of gifting this for Christmas.",1,2016,12,11
207,Afternoon tea a must!,"Had the pleasure of afternoon tea here in the summer and boy it didn't disappoint, wonderful attention to detail and the Alice in wonderland theme was just so fitting! Cakes to die for and a variety of tea delivered promptly and often to the table, defo a lovely treat for a special occasion",5,2016,12,10
207,Lunch and Drinks,"Really enjoyed our lunch in the Saddle Room yesterday delicious food in a very elegant setting. Then we headed into the large busy bar at the front of the hotel, we were enjoying the service and the atmosphere and then this awful dance music came on - I felt like I was in some tacky bar in the mediterranean or Copper Face Jacks. Why would a busy beautiful bar in one of the most beautiful locations in Dublin need such head wrecking music. My parents are staying here in a few weeks time now I am worried that they will have no rest listening to this music all night - very disappointed especially when there is no need for it.",3,2016,12,10
207,A simple example of the level of service.,"When I was in Dublin last summer I bought a bet ticket at paddy power for the Chicago Cubs to win the world series, I bet 50E and won. When I inquired about cashing it in online, I was told I had to actually go into a paddy power location in Ireland. I was stumped but then sent it to Denis, the head concierge at the Shelbourne, he cashed it and sent me the money, 200E, right away. Such a great guy at a great hotel.",5,2016,12,09

207,Honest review ,"Visited 2nd wk oct . Amazing location across the road from st Stephens green,2mins walk to graftons st . Hotel is beautiful in every way check in excellent room average size but excellent really comfortable bed. Dinner was delicious I had lobster my wife had steak. We went to saddle bar in the hotel hard to get a seat on Friday night. Cocktails 💯 . Drinks are expensive!! All in all 5 stars for a city hotel. Have stayed in other 5 star hotels in the city this is the best. Did not use leisure facilities or spa. Taxi from Heuston train station €10. Tips go to Stephens green have a cosmopolitan 👍",5,2016,12,07
207,unbelievable place staff amazing food unreal !!!!,"Never ever stayed at this hotel before always stayed at the Westbury anytime we had to come to Dublin which was quite a few times a year.

Brian & Thomas  met us at the front door and just were so friendly and so helpfull 

We checked in the process was so quick and lovely. Our room was just amazing it really was we felt like royality. We had a meal on the first night in the restaurant well what can I say the nicest food we have ever had. We were going to go out to a different  restaurant the second night but we loved the food so much we decided to stay in the Hotel. Breakfast was just an experience and we met Mr Dempsey the manager the next morning who just was so lovely and could not do enough for us.

They have won us over trust me we are returning for two nights on the 30th December. To the manager and all the staff best hotel in Ireland thank you",5,2016,12,07

Initially we had a small problem with the booking and Pamela promptly took care of us in a impeccable manner. From the moment we arrived the service was superior. We found all the staff incredible, very friendly and helpful. The food was amazing with lots of choice. We would absolutely return and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.",5,2016,12,05
207,Excellent Stay.,"I stayed at the Shelbourne when I first arrived for a night and the night before I left Dublin to come home. Prior to my arrival, I emailed them to ask for an early check in. Aer Lingus - Great Airline by the way, had an early arrival and my wife and I arrived in Dublin just before 830 am. Once we got through customs we were off to the Shelbourne. When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly team of employees looking to assist in our every need. They gave us our early check in and off we went to our room. The hotel is considered a major attraction for the people that check in. They include current and former dignitaries as well as Rugby and Football teams. The Shelbourne is glamour and sits right across the street from St. Stephens Green. Furthermore they are within walking distance of Grafton Street (3 short blocks), Trinity College (6 blocks) and a hosts of pubs and restaurants. I highly recommend The Shelbourne as I enjoyed both visits, the comfort of their rooms, the breakfast in the morning and the fact they are so close to everything in Dublin. Please note that the airport is about 9 miles from the hotel and it costs about 35 Euros for a taxi. The Bus line from the Airport does make a stop near the hotel (2 or 3 blocks) -7Euros, and the hotel does offer Valet parking for 29 euros for the day. The valet is open 24hours a day and they will have your car waiting. Thank you Shelbourne!",5,2016,12,04
207,Absolute Class,"Just back from the Shelbourne,  can't say enough about the place. Staff are fantastic,  accommodation although small is beautifully presented, breakfast was magnificent, the whole experience was really really pleasant and worthwhile,  I'll definitely be back!",5,2016,12,04
207,Afternoon Tea,"Myself and my partner went to Afternoon Tea recently and the hotel is stunning; beautiful Christmas trees and wreaths, lots of staff, the atmosphere was amazing. We had the festive afternoon tea and the staff did everything perfectly and were lovely, especially Teodora. We enjoyed everything from the teas, the rose champagne, the piano being played beautifully in the corner and the food. No one rushed us and I had a lovely Amaretto sour in the bar afterwards, I will definitely be back, great relaxing day. Thank you.",5,2016,12,02
207,Classy,"What a great hotel as service and accommodations were on point. The stand out was Eimear during afternoon tea. She assisted us the day prior as we needed to cancel our reservation as we would run late for a tour the following day. She worked it out and was able to accommodate us the next day. She was our server and was just fantastic. Professional, 5-diamond, but still extremely personable. It's a hard combination to pull off as at times, associates can become too stuffy but she did it so well. Fantastic asset to your hotel! Thank you, Eimear!!",5,2016,11,29
207,Classic Elegance!,"My wife and I stayed at the Shelbourne for a night upon arriving in Dublin from Chicago.  After a long and sleepless night on the plane, it was just what we needed.  The Shelbourne is simply beautiful.  We loved its pub and restaurant.  The Shelbourne is easy walking distance to all of the main points of interest in Dublin.  Be sure not to miss the fascinating small museum within the hotel!  When we return to Dublin, we'll stay again.  ",5,2016,11,28
207,Wonderful 2 nights stay ,"This is the nicest place I have ever stayed in and was perfect for a very special occasion. Everything is amazing, but the staff are the best part: friendly without ever be familiar, they make you feel special and welcome as if you were a VIP. 
I would recommend anyone staying there to have the breakfast in the bedroom, it's beautiful and there is so much to eat it does work out to be great value! 
I would absolutely love to return for another special occasion because  it just makes for great memories. ",5,2016,11,27
207,Superb ,"Had another wonderful stay at The Sherbourne, this hotel will truly exceed all your expectations. Had a fantastic lunch in Bar 27. Staff are absolutely amazing and go above and beyond to make your stay as memorable as possible, nothing is too much trouble for them. Rooms are decorated to the highest standards and have every amenity you could possibly need. High praise indeed to all management and staff you all do an amazing job. Breakfast in the saddle room was excellent, cant wait for our next visit.",5,2016,11,27
207,Expensive and poor value,"We did not enjoy our stay.  For what we paid for a two night stay - The room was small and our view was of a flat roof. Due to the bedroom size we were not comfortable to relax in our bedroom, the hotel did not have any available areas to relax. 

The restaurant was ""fully booked"" and the bar was standing room only. We went for drinks and dinner at the Westbury which was perfect. 

Two nights came to over £600 to sleep in a small cluttered bedroom and did not include breakfast.",1,2016,11,26
207,Amazing Hotel,"We spent two nights at the Shelbourne.  This hotel is amazing!  Presidents, and movie stars often stay here. The staff is excellent and they think of everything, including umbrellas at the front door.  The location is very nice, directly across from St. Stephens Green, and a few blocks walk from St. Stephens  Shopping center.  The Front lobby has a wood burning fireplace to warm the chilly November days.  The Horseshoe bar is a must see with excellent mixed drinks and cozy seating areas.",5,2016,11,26
207,No. 27 bar,We went to the no 27 bar having just got engaged at st Stephens green across the road. The staff made us feel incredibly special and gave us a glass of bubbly and macaroons even though we were not staying in the hotel. Tomislav in particular was incredibly kind and made our day even better. Thank you so much! ,5,2016,11,22
207,Afternoon tea. Perfect.,"Didn't stay here. Came for afternoon tea on Sunday. Absolutely first class from start to finish. Had a lovely table by the fire. The service was fantastic - attentive, unobtrusive, unhurried. Food was wonderful - both savoury and sweet. Price was incredibly reasonable when compared to same experience in London at €49 pp. Can't recommend highly enough.",5,2016,11,21
207,We'll go back to Dublin just to stay at The Shellbourne,"The Shellbourne was perfect!  The rooms are beautiful with large, marble bathrooms, and the breakfast was amazing.  The service was impeccable from the front desk to concierge to the wait staff.  One of the waiters would make sure to come by each morning to talk with us even when he wasn't our specific waiter.   The fitness facilities were great and the location is ideal too, a few steps to Grafton St., 10 minutes to Dublin Castle and a lovely walk to Guinness.  We will absolutely be back!",5,2016,11,20
207,Disappointing view,"This is a classic hotel with an elegant ambiance and good service from most of the staff. However, in order to spare others the disappointment I felt with the view from the balcony room that I booked, please note that you'll have a very good view of a very unattractive office building. After seeing my room, I asked for an upgrade (as Marriott Gold), which was not available.  I did not find the front desk staff manager friendly or accommodating. I enjoyed the food in the bar and the bartenders were friendly. The concierge, Paul, was also realLy nice and helpful. Overall above average setting and service, but just below average from the front desk. I stayed at 4 other Marriott properties during my recent trip to Europe, and my room here was my least favorite. ",4,2016,11,20
207,Afternoon tea,We were there for afternoon tea and what a lovely treat. The food was delicious and the staff very attentive but in obtrusive. I look forward to returning to enjoy the experience again. We availed of the valet parking as the weather was awful and the public carpark a bit of a walk away. It was expensive but worth it.,5,2016,11,18
207,Favorite Destination,"I was not excited about the Scotland/Ireland trip. What a mistake I made. Dublin was just about perfect - since we stayed at the Shelbourne! The front desk enrolled us in the Witness Protection Program. And at no extra charge.

Our first room was flooded. Every room was booked so they put us in a tiny substandard room for the night. Then an employee came to our room the next morning and escorted us to our new room. Big, spacious and lovely. So, in less than 24 hours we were in 3 rooms. I know it was the Witness Protection Program because I had no idea what my room number was. 

Our assigned helper was magnificent. She made the inconvenience of being in 3 rooms seem like nothing. I can hardly wait to visit the Shelbourne again.

Grafton Street is pedestrian only and sports a variety of street musicians. Just down and to the left is Murphy's - best ice cream ever.

Dohney & Nesbitt was the perfect place for a pint (or 2) of Guinness with Bangers and Mash. I had no idea what Bangers and Mash consisted of but I had heard the term on some television show from England. Was a good choice.

Leaving Dublin we were able to upgrade to Business Class for only $500 each. That made the 7.5 hour trip to Philadelphia,PA easy.

Save some room for me at the Shelbourne and forget the Witness Protection Program this time. We are coming back to Ireland!",5,2016,11,17
207,Great place to see,"Went in for coffee the hotel is very impressive and the people are warm theres even a museum in the hotel the have all the record of staff who worked there what wss thete jobs how much the got paid then there is the visitors book for when it opened and all the famous people who have stayed there over the years very impressed .
One very special person Michael Collins even stayed there i even got to sit on the chair that was was in Michael room and he used.",4,2016,11,16
207,An old classic and still as good as ever.,"Great location and great guys on the front door, very efficient and yet real Irish. Dinner in the Saddle Room was excellent and it is great to be able to pop out for a few drinks in Merrion Row and just walk back to the hotel. The room was very good, pity we couldn't get the fabulous room we had last year overlooking Stephens Green. Breakfast is everything you could want, very very good. I think we got the last table available as when we came out of the dining room the queue was very long. Drinks are quite expensive but I suppose you would expect that. I would love to have been able to sit and just watch the world go by but it is not easy to get a window seat anytime either in the bar or the lovely afternoon tea area/lobby.",4,2016,11,15
207,Shelbourne luxury,Travelled to Ireland late Sept/early Oct and were fortunate enough to get accommodations at the Shelbourne.....it was truly an experience in pure luxury.  The rooms were comfortable and spacious and the staff were so eager to help make our stay memorable.  We enjoyed Irish coffee in the Horseshoe lounge one afternoon after a busy day in Dublin.  The location was ideal to get around Dublin and enjoy a leisurely stroll through St Stephen's Green directly across the street.  I had several others recommend The Shelbourne and can see why.....I certainly would recommend it to anyone looking to enjoy the old world charm and first class service!,5,2016,11,15
207,A charming Oasis of Luxury ,"   One of Dublin's Historic Hotels that will delight you as beautiful tranquil oasis of luxury located on the beautiful St Stephens Green.  Upon arrival the feel of this hotel is an old world experience of opulence.   Charming doormen who will have your bags on their way to your room and your car off to valet parking in just a few brief moments.   You'll wend you way through this hotel to reception area only to find the most helpful and attentive staff checking you.   Some lovely touches from the personalized service to offering you some refreshing lemonade as you check in.  They are equally as helpful on check out.  If you do t take the online check out option.  

     On this visit our room was a lovely upgrade.  A delightful King en suite with a wonderfully spacious bathroom as well as the bedroom area.  My personal pet peeve, can be the tiny closet spaces provided to in many European hotels, not having enough room for two travelers on the road for a while, and what we travel with us.   Not here, our lovely room had adequate closet space, and the suitcases stored away also neatly out of sight.  

     We had a light dinner the night of our arrival in the Lord Mayer's Lounge.   The food was beautiful prepared and the small wine list did not lack some real gems.  While you could have had a lovely three course meal here of food from locally sourced ingredients we were dinning light but we're delighted my the entrees we selected.  

     The breakfast in the Saddle Room has a great buffet but also an al a cart menu is offered also. This will best be taken early in the day to set you up for lots of walking in the shopping areas around St Stephen green and down to the entertainment area of temple bar. Or a visit to the National Library or maybe Trinity College. 

     A great experience on this return visit.  Never disappointing.   Always a lovely treat.  ",5,2016,11,14
207,Great hotel!,"This hotel was beautiful and the service was stellar. Very classy place and well located. The service was so good it was almost too good. We were approached by no less than 4 waiters within 5 minutes of sitting in the bar!  Room was cleaned in the 30 minutes I was at breakfast.  5 people said hello to me entering the bfast room and I was offered a newspaper, smoothie shot, coffee and toast before I had even sat down!  If ultra service is your jam you will love this place. ",5,2016,11,10
207,Amazing Value with FHR Amex Platinum,"The Shelbourne is an amazing hotel in the perfect location in Dublin City, across from St Stephens Park and walking distance to shops and bars.  Check in was a breeze with the added extras like receiving a chilled lemon water and being personally welcomed by hotel staff.  The FHR from Amex gave us a $85 credit in the hotels restaurant which covered an amazing three course dinner (pre-theater time) which was impeccable and very delicious.  The rate also included free wifi and a breakfast buffet for two in the morning which really is an amazing buffet that has something for everyone!  The staff in the bar were amazing and the Horseshoe Bar itself in a great cozy and intimate spot to have a pre-dinner drink.  We received a great room with a balcony which was amazing to sit and listen to the sounds of the City whilst viewing the rooftops.  I would have zero problems returning to the Shelbourne, although I do love the Merrion which is right around the corner, it would be difficult to pick favorites here as both are excellent.  There are plenty of cabs outside, which the doorman will be happy to hail and I believe that the coach to the airport (Aircoach) also stops right outside, although due to the early time of our flights we went with a taxi.  Do yourself a favor and indulge in the Shelbourne.",5,2016,11,09
207,Fantastic base to visit Dublin City,"An amazing hotel. Rooms are lovely, although our first room we were given, was very small with no bath . For an upgrade fee - we then had a fabulous room with large bathroom and coffee machine. Staff generally couldn't be nicer and the location is perfect for shopping in Grafton Street and great restaurants and bars in walking distance.
Bit on the expensive side but hard to beat.",5,2016,11,09
207,Best in Dublin ,"The Shelbourne Hotel is 5 star from top to bottom. The food and cocktail bars are great with fantastic atmosphere - I recommend the Old Fashioned here . The accommodation is faultless with a traditional plush feel. Art Deco chandeliers in the foyer add jazz era elegance . The real star of the Hotel however is the staff. They are constantly attentive without being fussy and ensure the 5 star experience from the moment you enter the door to the moment you reluctantly leave . The proximity of leafy St Stephens Green ( try & get a room with a view)  , the Georgian squares of Dublin and the shops of Grafton St are a bonus. 
We will be back ",5,2016,11,09
207,Early Supper,"A bustling bar and smart casual dining at the bar experience. Had a fish pie and chicken pie for my lovely lady. Both full of flavour and very tasty. Bit more expensive than normal but a stunning location and a high quality experience.
Defo worth a visit.",5,2016,11,07
207,"Wonderful location, historical granduer and great service","Shelbourne is in a great location making Dublin very walkable. The exterior architecture is beautiful and is lit up in the evening. We were greeted by a very friendly front desk gent who was personable and very helpful. We had a lovely room that was ample in size, well furnished. Bed was very comfortable, towels and linen and amenities were very nice. WiFi was provided, flat screen TV. The view from our room looked onto another building which was not an issue for us, but if it is an important issue you might ask about the view of your room. We were traveling with friends and they requested an upgraded room. The front desk was very clear with them that the only available room was on a floor that was being remodeled. We checked out the room and it was very spacious with a sitting room. When checking in you might want to confirm if remodeling is going to be done. Maid service was wonderful as well. Our stay included a dinner in the Saddle Room. The dinner menu in the Saddle Room allowed for ala cart dining as well as two alternative tasting menus. There is also a reduced price tasting menu (pre theater). The service was attentive and formal. Everything was prepared perfectly. We also had breakfast included which we enjoyed daily. Again service was attentive and food well prepared. We sought the assistance of Paul the Les Clefs d’Or concierge. All of his recommendations were spot on. We had an issue with a lost wallet and he was so helpful. He contacted the bus company where it had been left (we thought). It was found and he made arrangements to get it sent to US. Well beyond the call of duty! When next in Dublin it will be at the Shelbourne!",5,2016,11,07
207,Complacent and couldn't care less,"I had been looking forward to staying at this hotel for some time but a huge disappointment. The reception staff were unwelcoming as was the concierge. Although we enjoyed a big celebration in the bar and the staff were fine, the hotel is not living up to its reputation. Our room was not good enough. I would recommend to others that they save money on the rooms by staying elsewhere but visit the bar or have afternoon tea. We have stayed in many places in Dublin over the years..first time at the Shelbourne and won't be returning.",2,2016,11,07
207,A home away from home,"Booked myself for the weekend - great service, nothing a problem. Friendly staff and very knowledgable about city. Spa and gym fantastic facilities and are second to none. The most comfortable bed. Really hard to fault anything. Lives up to its reputation as the finest in Dublin.",5,2016,11,06
207,Always there,"One of the places that marks The Green
Relaxing environment 
New bar (to me) makes it relevant to the new generations 
Great food 
Place to visit, meet, stay and worth every euro. 
One day the top floor suite ",4,2016,11,06
207,Pleasant stay although pricey for the room,"Stayed for 2 nights on the start of an 8 day trip.  This is a really nice old hotel.  The main bar had tons of character although tricky to get a seat on a Saturday night.  Main restaurant was good. The dinner we had on night 2 was excellent with a good wine selection. Breakfast was good quality even though it was buffet style.

The only reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5 was that the room was disappointing for the price paid. Comfortable and clean but nothing special for the price paid.  We really liked the hotel and would visit again but there are other hotels in the city that would match the experience at a lower price if budget is an issue.",4,2016,11,06
207,Beautiful hotel with history,"We stayed 2 nights at the Shelbourne and were very pleased.  We arrived at the hotel at 6am in the pouring rain.  The staff allowed us to enter the building through a side door which was easier for my wife who was in a wheelchair.  We were fortunate that our room was available at this early hour.  During the check-in process my wife asked where we could get coffee as it was before breakfast was to be served.  Within minutes, coffee and pastries appeared from nowhere and we enjoyed in the lobby as we had traveled from the US overnight.  This was just the start of the excellent service we received. The restaurant offered an excellent breakfast, either buffet or off the menu.  The hotel has a great location and is only a block away from the hop-on buses.  We had a great room and the bed was very comfortable. There is a lift for people with wheel chairs so they can enter the front entrance without using the steps.  ",5,2016,11,05
207,Gift card not valad,"I was given a gift of a Shelbourne Hotel gift card from a lady who I cared for as she recovered from a stay in hospital. She had always wanted to stay at the Shelbourne however with her poor health the trip was never possible. I was delighted to receive the gift of a one night stay with breakfast. I made a reservation and i was really looking forward to a luxury trip to Dublin.

Overall i was disappointed I heard so much about the fantastic hotel.  The hotel was extremely busy , the bar was expensive and uncomfortable. My bedroom was so small and not as luxurious as expected. 

The next morning we went  to breakfast I was told that it was not included and that I would have to pay.  I was charged €62 for breakfast - shocking.

When I went to check out, there was a problem they told me that my gift card could not be accepted as it was expired. It was so embarrassing and I felt as if  I was trying to con the receptionist into accepting the card. I was forced to pay the bill which came to nearly €450 for a night a night away which I had accepted as a gift. 

I am so upset about the whole experience as I really could not have ever afforded to stay in a hotel like this and the only reason i went was to use the gift i had been given by a very kind heated lady.",1,2016,11,05
207,Superb,Stayed for my honeymoon for an evening in our way to the west coast. Everything about our stay was superb. Our room was spotless and very comfortable. We were lucky enough to get the Michael Collins suite. We dined in the restaurant in the evening. Waiters were attentive and the food was top notch with a great wine list. ,5,2016,11,05
207,Meh. Poor value and indifferent staff.,"Very plug-and-play corporate “luxury”- could have been in pretty much any city in a “luxury” hotel as there was no feeling of actually being in Dublin. 

The staff was indifferent, the concierges bordering on surly and at every turn were advertisements for a special offer/something to buy/spa ‘experiences’ from either the hotel, Renaissance or Marriott. Incongruous Christmas decorations heralded celebrating at the hotel. In October. No thank you. 

Bathroom did not have a heated towel bar, nor a hand held shower and the ceiling was so low that standing in the tub was barely head clearance. Towels were thin and sandpaper-soft.

Spa: Price/value sorely lacking, and again, more interest in trying to sell you something: questionnaire asked for detail of skin care regimen and one had to specifically tick a box to request Marriott not barrage you with email offers. Much upping and downing between floors to reach check-in desk, treatment room, locker room prevented relaxation. Mediocre massage from an uncommunicative masseuse. 

No flannels or shower caps in the shower area of the locker room. No phone in the locker room to reach reception, so would have necessitated yet another run up and down the stairs to mention the lack of supplies. When mentioned to the receptionist, response was that cleaner had called in sick but she would see to it that they be brought in. Didn't help me post-shower. 

Should have stayed at the Merrion.",2,2016,11,04
207,So Disappointed,"After many trips to Dublin & always dreaming of staying at The Shelbourne I finally achieved my goal in August 2015 & it has taken me till now to write this review as we have since visited Dublin again recently & had an amazing stay at The Westbury which just emphasised how disappointing the previous trip was.

When we arrived in 2015 there were renovations taking place on the hotel which is understandable as its a historic building which was part of the attraction for me.  The trip was planned with some friends to celebrate special anniversaries, therefore we had booked 2 green view rooms & on checking in we were not informed of any obstructions to this, so we were very shocked to arrive in our room to find scaffolding at the windows with a screening over so no day light & work men actually directly outside our window.
We went directly back to the reception to enquire why we had actually paid extra for this room which obviously had a worse view than a standard room plus the gentleman who checked us in didn't even have the common decency to let us know.
After we were informed by one of the customer services managers they we would be moved the next day when there was a room available we went back to the original room & I decided to close the curtains to get a little privacy from the work men to only discover a selection of clothes that had been left by the previous guests & makes me question the cleaning standards of this 5 star hotel!
Once I had deposited these clothes with the reception staff we spent a bit of time in the Oyster Bar trying to salvage our special break & I must say on checking out the hotel did not charge us for these drinks as goodwill.
My biggest disappointment is the fact that one of the customer service managers, a lady who unfortunately I can't remember her name, assured me that I would receive some follow up correspondence with regard to our stay & even though she took my mobile number & email address, I feel that once we walked out of the door it was all forgotten as I never heard a thing so therefore our next trip meant a stay at The Westbury & the contrast of service etc was just unbelievable.",1,2016,11,03
207,Top Hatted Door~Man is Real ~ and a gracious start to a blissful stay.. ~,"What a great place to stay! Certainly no better place to dine; afternoon coffee there's always a guilty pleasure; your genial doormen..White Gloved Waiting staff at special events add an extra panache to cuisine prepared with every sensory palette engaged and synchronised in fantastic colour&fragrance 
Book the beauty salon ~ Do!!",5,2016,11,03
207,Take care on the slopes!,"We had four rooms overlooking St Stephens Green, all were excellent well appointed, we'll looked after, all the usual amenities you would expect from a world class hotel - oh yes and the slopes? 

With each room came a slope from or to the bathroom (depending if you were coming in or going out), this was a bit disconcerting if you weren't aware of it or had forgotten- like a late night in the dark trip to ""you know where"" . I don't think it was for disabled guest (we weren't) so I can only assume it was to do with the sealing of the bathroom floor and the rooms below, interestingly there are also slopes in the Saddle Room.

That aside the hotel was excellent and the staff most hospitable, helpful and very welcoming, although I must confess I don't understand why it takes so long to check in, especially as it was all booked and paid for well in advance of our arrival- but it is the same the world over.

In summary an excellent hotel, in a central location and well worth staying ther.",5,2016,11,02
207,5 star?? Not really,"This is a very nice hotel. It is decorated nicely and feels upscale, clean, and chic. The tea room and bars are beautiful. Rooms are appointed nicely but our room had no view. But there are some concerns...... The check in process was a disaster. We were sent to three different rooms before one was satisfactory. First we were assigned a handicapped room, which the bathroom is anything but luxurious. But my main concern with this hotel is the staff. The concierges were rude and a bit arrogant, I dealt with 3 different ones. They simply don't list to the requests. I felt like they were just trying to get rid of me. Like helping the guests was a chore! The property my be 5 star, but unfortunately the staff is not. I would never pay this much again for this hotel.",4,2016,11,02
207,Nice notel but over priced for what you get,The hotel and our room was nice but for the price we paid breakfast was not even included nor were we advised in advance of this fact.  For a five star hotel this is poor service and does not reflect on value for money.,3,2016,11,01
207,Nice place,"This hotel is great the service and staff too and the rooms so cozy, and the food at the hotel is great a bit pricey but is worth it the best is the beer, really great place to stay for business or pleasure",5,2016,11,01
207,Afternoon Tea,"Last Thursday we had afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors Lounge at the Shelbourne Hotel. To say it was a wonderful experience would be an understatement . The staff were very attentive , friendly yet very professional. The food was excellent and the tea was great. It was such a treat and I hope to return in the future. Ten out of Ten your staff were the best I have ever seen.",5,2016,10,30
207,Dublin get away,"Just stayed at the Shelbourne in Dublin and can not say enough about how fabulous this hotel is!  The best mix of old world charm and modern updates.  Fantastic bar and common areas and the breakfast table as fantastic, the porridge is a must!  We were upgraded to a suite and couldn't have asked for much more.  I don't think I could stay anywhere else in Dublin, now that I have stayed there.",5,2016,10,28
207,A lovely hotel in Dublin across from St. Stephen's Green,"All in all it was a lovely hotel....the lobby very attractive and our room extremely comfortable and well appointed.  The Bar 27/Tea room gives the feeling of stepping into a gone by era!  Lovely room.  Did not eat at the hotel as we only had one night before flying out early in the morning.  The staff in general was most accommodating but was totally tarnished by the early morning crew that was on duty when we needed to get going quickly and get to the airport at 7:00 a.m.  The afternoon before, we asked for our car to be brought around at 5:30 a.m. sharp!  We called at 4:30 am for the bellman to be at our room at 5:10.....had to call three times and they did not come until 5:30.  I went down to check on the car while my friend went to check out!  Car not there...bags out on sidewalk.....then bellman asked where the car was??  I said....that is your job!  Not mine....so he grabbed bag cart and disappeared....and didn't come back for 5 more minutes...with the car...then had to go get our bags again...!  All in all...did not get on the road until 5:45.",4,2016,10,25
207,5 Star,"This hotel was built in 1824 and has it all - restaurant, bar, lounge, fitness center, complimentary Wi-fi access.  Rooms are large. Bed comfortable. Staff helpful. Turn down service was spotty. Well located so that you can walk to many of the sites. The place to stay on St Stephen's Green.",5,2016,10,24
207,Well below expectations,"I hadn't been to Dublin for nearly 20 years so decided to splash out on the best for this family weekend. Paid UKD 774 for ONE night for 2 rooms without breakfast so expected something special.
The location is great and the staff well trained and pleasant enough.
The rooms are pretty much standard Marriott. A little old fashioned but practical and comfortable - but just a Marriott - usually available elsewhere for less than half the cost of this one
However we were all pretty shocked not to mention disappointed to find that instead of the ""magnificent views"" touted in the marketing,  both my rooms looked out on a back alley dominated by an awful 1970's  concrete building a few feet from my window and towering above us. Even worse all of the hotel wheelie bins for garbage were directly below us and completed the ""magnificent views"" 
To compound the dreadful view, there appears to be an exhaust extractor fan in the alley, which I think is from the laundry, and which roars all day and all night loud enough in the room to disturb your sleep.
BEWARE. there are many rooms overlooking this alley and the staff are well aware of the issues so I guess they get a pretty constant stream of disappointed guests. They certainly seem to be pretty well practiced at fending off these complaints and doing very little about it.
After escalating my complaint to front office manager level (which took about 90 minutes of my weekend) they moved my daughters from the room adjacent to our- to a room on another floor on the other side of the building overlooking a marginally better central roof-space used to store excess equipment, but were ""unable"" to move my wife and I. hardly the family holiday we had planned. 
As compensation the manager offered us 200 pounds which was about half the cost of our one room - so with no other option I accepted - since it was about 6.30 pm and I wanted to go out for the evening.
subsequently they telephoned to say that they were unable to pay us the 200 pounds because we booked with Expedia and instead they would gift me 10,000 Marriott rewards. putting aside the fact that these have a lot less flexibility than the cash, and cost the hotel a lot less than their face value, 10,000 rewards gets you one QUARTER of a room night in the Shelbourne. So they more than halved the compensation that they had offered and I had accepted. Nice trick eh?
My advice is DO NOT stay at this hotel. It is very overpriced and is trading on its past reputation. Stay elsewhere and if you want to see the Shelbourne - just go visit the horseshoe bar for a drink and the old money vibe-  or take tea in its famous lounge.",2,2016,10,24
207,"Very nice, expensive, and well situated hotel!","This is, probably, the best hotel in Dublin. It is placed in a fantastic position, in front a beautiful park, near the shopping area, fantastic night life. Rooms are not big, but very well decorated, very nice bathrooms, very good overall impression.
Breakfast was a disappointment, beautiful place, substandard service and food quality.
This hotel has one of the nicest concierge service I have saw around the world!!!",5,2016,10,23
207,A Very Pleasant Stay,"The Marriott Shelbourne Renaissance  Hotel is a definite 5 Star hotel.  We found the staff to top notch, engaging, and timely.  The two bars, dining room, tea room, and pool are very well maintained and comfortable. The Saddle Room (Lounge) is a small and was not prone to large crowds.  The No. 27 Lounge is a much larger lounge that during peak times was crowded and noisy making conversation difficult at times.  Both lounge staffs are very good at meeting patrons needs.  The dining room also is well maintained and nicely furnished.  The breakfast meal in the  dining room is also well prepared with options of the buffet, ala-cart menu, or combination of the two.  The tea room is very comfortable, well furnished with live piano music played at different times of the day.   We cannot attest to the pool, exercise and spa areas as we did not observe or utilized them.  Our room was very comfortable and well maintained with furniture that was in line with the hotels historical theme.  The hotel  is near many of the cities historical buildings and areas such as St. Patrick's Cathedral,  Canal street, the Gennis Brewer, and the Teeling  Distillery and shopping areas well within walking distance.   There is a sizable and nice park directly across the street from the hotel.  The park is closed at night but during the  day it is a nice place to sit and take short walks.  When booking the Shelbourne we were concerned about some of the negative feedback provided by previous guests.   Of most concern were comments about construction noise impacting the atmosphere at the hotel.  While there is street and rail construction near the hotel, at the time of this feedback,  it has moved about two blocks down from the hotel making its impact a non-issue for us.  It did not impact our sleep or the comport of our stay .  I am glad to say that we did not have any negative experiences during our 3 day stay.  If we ever go back to Ireland the Shelbourne would definitely be on our short list or hotels in which to stay. ",5,2016,10,21
207,Three day stay,"My wife, daughter, and I had the pleasure of experiencing this top notch hotel for three days in mid October. Our spacious room was on the sixth floor. The view was of an office building across the street, but most importantly for us, it was very quiet. Wonderful large bathroom with a tub/shower and plenty of shelf space. Extra towels provided on request. Refrigerator was the type where if you remove something in it you automatically get charged for the item removed. Since we like to buy our own water/juices and refrigerate them, we asked the desk to turn off the automatic charge device so that we could take out some of their cans of soda to make room for our liquids, and they graciously obliged. One of many examples of the level of service provided. 
The gym/pool/spa facilities were beyond those found in most hotels of this caliber. 
Delicious breakfast with an impressive selection - buffet style. 
Would definitely return. ",5,2016,10,21
207,Nice but customer service could be better,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for two nights in September. Check in was easy and my room was a newly renovated one and very nice.  I had a massage at the spa which was overall a good experience. However, there are a few things the hotel could improve upon.

1. The shower in the new rooms is pretty weak.  The shower head is in the ceiling and by the time the water reaches you, there is little water pressure (I'm 5'5""). The water pressure in the spa was a whole lot better.

2. Concierge service isn't very good. I had two disappointing experiences with them.

I did a fair amount of walking and my feet were killing me so I bought some shoe insert cushions. I called down to the concierge twice asking for a pair of scissors so I could trim the inserts.  Both times they told me they would be right up but no one ever came.

On the day I checked out, the very nice manager (at least I presume he was the manager) gave me the option of the hotel arranging my airport taxi for a flat fee of 25 euro or the door man could flag a taxi down and he could not guarantee the price.  I asked for the hotel and he said it would be maybe 10 minutes. He watched him walk over to the concierge and give him my room number and asked to call a taxi. I waited 15 minutes and no taxi (but others came for other guests).  The manager went over again and checked on the taxi and there was some conversation between the two that I could not hear but it looked like the concierge blew off the manager.  Waited another 10 minutes and no taxi.  The manager then went and talked to the doorman and came back to get me and loaded my luggage into a waiting taxi. Turns out the manager flagged a taxi down himself. I didn't make this connection until I got to the airport and my fare was 37 Euro. 

While these are small issues, for the price and quality of the hotel, I expected better service.",4,2016,10,20
207,A beautiful classic ,"The Shelbourne hotel is old style glamour& luxury, whether on business or pleasure I enjoy a visit to the horseshoe bar. The cocktails are pricey but worth it and the food is excellent!
The staff are pleasant and the surroundings offer a relaxed ambience during the day but a lively social atmosphere at night!",4,2016,10,19
207,Average stay for above average price ,"We stayed at The Shelbourne for 2 nights while in Dublin and overall weren't that impressed. The hotel itself was beautiful and the bars were classy but the room itself lacked a bit and we didn't feel overly helped by the staff. Also, the gym had very strange hours which we weren't expecting with a Marriott property.  Luckily we were using Marriott points so we didn't care as much but if we were paying full price for what this goes for, we would have been sorely disappointed. ",3,2016,10,19
207,A classic,"The Shelbourne is definetely a classic. Great location, great atmosphere and a lot of history. I recomend Eggs Benedict for breakfast. The gym is fine, but the pool is amazing. Remember to take your swimming suit.",5,2016,10,18
207,Afternoon Tea at The Shelbourne,"My wife and I had just completed a morning tour of Dublin and found ourselves within a block or two of the Shelbourne.  We really enjoy Afternoon Tea so we walked to the hotel to see if we could be seated.  We arrived 15 minutes after they started serving and they had one table for two available.  Easy decision.  

Their tea is themed after the art of Michael Flatley. His works that are hanging on the walls of the dining room are reflected in the design of the pastries.  It's an unique approach which gives the Afternoon Tea an added element.  We enjoyed our time there immensely.  The tea and accompanying treats hit the mark and the service staff was exceptional.",4,2016,10,18
207,Long Weekend,Lovely quality hotel with great settings for bars and meals. Good history and service top class. The basic rooms however are very small with little room to move and virtually no draw space for clothes and limited wardrobe space. You will probably have to live out of suitcase. If going suggest upgrade to as good a room as can afford to get the extra space. ,3,2016,10,18
207,Amazing Afternoon Tea...,"First time today to The Shelbourne for afternoon tea, sure not to be the last. Was a lovely afternoon, amazing staff, lovely food and amazing venue. Thanks for making it a special afternoon for us all. We also went on Sunday evening for cocktails, we got there just as they where winding down but didn't filled rushed and really helpful bartender, and lovely cocktails.",5,2016,10,17
207,An Incredible Hotel,"First-Class in every respect.  Everything works perfectly here. The buffet breakfast is prepared with such care and the food choices couldn't be better.  Every one of the people working at this hotel is so very helpful.  The location is central to many of the popular places to visit.  You can walk to so many museums, Trinity College, and so many of the restaurants.  Many of the tours pick up either at this hotel or just across the street.  The Health Club is so convenient to use and so well run and clean.",5,2016,10,17
207,Disappointing,"My stay began with a four-hour wait before my room was ready. Surely, such a fancy hotel could hire someone for an early shift to clean the rooms of early departures so incoming guests don't have to wait so long. When I finally entered my room the people in the large office just a few feet across from my windows waved. No view, curtains always had to be pulled shut. I became very well acquainted with the engineers. My AC/heater did not work. When I came back to dress for dinner and the theater, the temperature was in the 90s. I opened windows and door while the engineer worked for more than an hour. I was informed I could have  heat or AC, but only on high. Or off. I chose cold. Forget about dinner. I asked the desk if they had another room. Brusque, ""No, sorry, booked up."" When I returned from the theater (still unbathed) the room was freezing, and I put on a jacket, turned off the AC and decided to watch TV while the room warmed up. Of course, the curtains had to remain closed. But wait, TV didn't  work. Another half hour visit from the friendly engineer, who finally got it working. Next day I asked the desk again if they could move me. ""Sorry, booked."" Sadly, no one cared one little bit about the problems with my room. I became a Marriott booster when the chain always cared and always dealt well with problems. But I have seen that change in recent years.",2,2016,10,17
207,Fabulous hotel all round!,"We stayed in this hotel a few days ago.  It was fantastic, service from staff is fabulous. Amazing rooms, perfect beds, beautiful interior.  Breakfast was excellent!  Central location adds to the experience.",5,2016,10,17
207,Fantastic Hotel,"As a proud Dubliner, shamefully Id had never entered the doors of this beautiful hotel steeped in history, inside and out. 
Everything about the hotel screams class, the beautiful building proudly overlooking St.Stephens Green and once you enter those revolving doors you get that cosy, right at home vibe, beautiful fireplaces and interior in general, selection of some
Fantastic resident bars (albeit a little pricey) €6.30 for a Guinness is criminal from the home of this fine drink but considering the class and high standards flowing through out the hotel, it's expected. The rooms are equally as beautiful as the rest of the hotel, dead centre of the city you cannot go wrong if you're planning a lavish stay in Dublin, staff are super friendly too which adds to its aroma.  ",5,2016,10,16
207,A great place to stay,"Located opposite St Stephens Green this large amazingly decorated hotel provided a great welcome and a great stay.  The staff were helpful and attentive without being intrusive and the whole stay there was a delight.  The room was spacious and well laid out with great facilities and a good wifi system.  The food choices at the throughout the hotel were good and the bar was very busy with a buzzing atmosphere.

One to put at the top end of your list when looking for somewhere to stay in Dublin",5,2016,10,15
207,Beautiful,"Stayed in the Shelbourne hotel, Beautiful grand hotel in the middle of Dublin, a stones throw from Grafton Street.  Very comfortable bedroom with great bar downstairs.
Staff where very nice and could not help enough.",5,2016,10,14
207,Beautiful hotel,The staff were very polite and helpful. The hotel is beautifully decorated and in an ideal location opposite St. Stephen's Green. The hotel has a rich history and features a mini museum. The horseshoe bar makes excellent cocktails,5,2016,10,13
207,One of Dublin's Best,"The room was decorated with firm hold of elegant design of the past with a salute to contemporary style....warm, comfortable relaxing. Be sure to visit the Horseshoe Bar before dinner. For dinner we went to the Saddle Room although we didn't have reservation(highly recommend you do) we sat at the Oyster Bar where their full menu is served. The Bar also gives you a prime seat to watch the ballet of dance as the chef and his team prepare each dish. We had sweet breads with truffle fries, sauce scallops with Au Gratin Cauliflower. The wine list has depth so you can fine one that suits your taste and pocket book!",5,2016,10,12
207,Stunning. A definite 5 stars!,"What can be said about this gorgeous hotel that has not already been said??  It's gorgeously historic, in the center of town, beautifully maintained, and with top notch service. The rooms are really well appointed with all the little extras that you'd wish for - robes and extra pillows and coffee service, heavy pens and notebooks, plush towels, lovely lotions and bath soap.  Plus the fitness center with a sauna and steam room and full length pool push it over the top.   Stay here!",5,2016,10,12
207,"Afternoon tea, wow.....","My niece took me for afternoon tea in the Shelbourne on Tuesday afternoon, I was a little worried that we might stand out alittle as it's far from the shelbourne I was raised, from start to finish we where made feel very comfortable the staff where excellent so friendly. The theme of the afternoon tea was explained in great detail and there was plenty of tea and coffee choices, which you could change at anytime. We got our tea which was always poured for us, followed by the sandwiches, each explained, just melt in your mouth, delicious. Next course 2 small scones with jam and clotted cream, yum yum. The last and final course, the dessert OMG no words, they where melt in your mouth heaven in a mouth full. The big surprise of the afternoon, suddenly I heard the pianist started playing happy birthday I looked around and it was for me, such a lovely gesture, means so much. It was the best afternoon and it was made so special from start to finish. ",5,2016,10,12
207,Nice stay,"Nice Hotel, room left something to be desired.  I was very excited to stay at the Shelbourne as I had heard great things about it, unfortunately my stay wasn't great, wasn't horrible either, but not the level I was expecting.  Previously I have stayed at The Marker and Marrion hotels so I will use these as reference points.

Location: Great location right on St. Stephen's green.  If you are a tourist or work in the area it really can't be beat.  Please note that there is a lot of construction around the green right now - it didn't bother me, but you should be aware of it. 

Decor:  Hotel has a great classic look and feel, lots of history.  Interesting bars and restaurants etc. 

Service:  The service was good, however, it wasn't up to the standards of the Marker or the Merrion.  Check in and turndown were good, doormen were friendly etc., but it could have been a bit better.  It was small stuff really, the service was still very good, but for instance if you need an umbrella you had to ask and they took down your room number and went and got you one.  Not bad at all, but other Hotels in Dublin have them at the ready for you.  

Rooms:  This is where I was really disappointed.  I should note that I booked the cheapest room they had, which certainly impacted this.  My room was very small, just a bed, and a small desk and a tv on the wall.  When I was sitting on my bed I could touch all 4 walls in the room (with a stretch).  The bathroom was also tiny, I left like I was in Paris (where the rooms tend in my experience to be much smaller.   I don't mind a small room, but I was so close to the door that anytime anything happened in the hallway I heard it all as if I were there. If I went back I would not select this type of room (my fault I know). 

If you booked here your stay will be fine, but I recommend you don't book the smaller rooms.  

Enjoy your trip!",4,2016,10,12
207,A beautiful hotel worthy of its 5*,"From the doorman who great you to the fresh cut hydrangeas in the beautiful lobby, this hotel exudes class. The champagne bar was a particular favourite of our large group who were staying and the staff very friendly. The hotel is very central with great bars and restaurants nearby.",5,2016,10,11
207,Great location nice hotel,"I have stayed a couple of times and this is definitely a nice hotel. The best feature is the location which is perfect for the Luas and town. 
Front desk is generally good as is the breakfast. The bar is very nice although the bar and restaurant menus are lacking in options. 
The bar food was average and the service was slow and the waiter seemed clueless. A couple of the drinks were wrong but everything was sorted out in time. 
Twice I have had rooms without baths which is a little disappointing as is the branding. There is a mix of Shelbourne, Renaissance and Marriott branding. 
Having said all that, it is a nice place but the Merrion is streets ahead. Full marks for a great location. ",4,2016,10,10
207,Beautiful Historic Hotel,"The Shelbourne is a historic hotel located within walking distance to many sites, restaurants and shops.  Many consider it to be the most marquee hotel in Dublin.

ROOMS:  As it is an older hotel, the different rooms vary in configuration and price points, so you may want to pay particularly attention when you reserve (we also found prices dropped significantly before arrival and we requested the better rate - rates, as with all hotels, vary so watch that you have flexibility in cancellation policy for your room before you book). I had a double room, which was large and elegantly appointed.  It had very high ceilings and heavy drapes.  Light was abundant.  The desk was next to one of the beds and it had easy to access outlets near enough snooze your phone if necessary.  The WiFI was easy to connect and worked well.  Temperature was easy to control.

BATHROOMS:  The bathroom in our room had a separate tub and shower.  Large fluffy towels were provided and there was a heated rack.  The lighting was excellent.  The toiletries were Elemis.

BREAKFAST: Is downstairs and you may order from a menu or enjoy the buffet, which included a nice assortment of what is standard in a breakfast buffet - nothing unexpected.  Scrambled eggs, meats, fruit, mushrooms, tomatoes, pastries and bread.  They serve you coffee and juice at your table.

Staff everywhere in the hotel were friendly and helpful.

As mentioned the location is excellent.  However, traffic in Dublin can be heavy.  We were here on business and getting a morning taxi was a challenge.  Uber is used heavily here and many of the taxis, though empty, are on their way to an Uber pick up. Leave plenty of time and plan to use Uber.  OR most places are a 30 minute or less walk away if the weather is nice.

Finally, don't miss the small museum near the front desk.  It holds memorabilia from the many historic events which occurred at the hotel and it only takes a fun 5-10 minutes to check out.",5,2016,10,09
207,Exceptional Service,"Stayed three nights in the hotel.  Rooms were well equipped and the hotel service was exceptional.  The Shelbourne is also a socially active hotel so it was never dull in the lobby or bar areas.  The hallways, carpeting and meeting rooms were worn and need updating.",4,2016,10,08
207,Another great stay,"I stared here in 2008 and the most recent trip my husband was able to enjoy it as well.  The rooms are very up to date, clean and decorated tastefully, with no amenities being missed.  The bars and restaurants are all very good.  Staff very helpful.  Our backside room had a deck with two chairs and a table. Convenient for walking to many Dublin venues and restaurants.",5,2016,10,08
207,A visit to the bar,"I went to the bar expressly for an Irish Coffee because it was highly recommended to me.  It was probably the best Irish Coffee I've had.  The ambience in the lavish, elegant bar is wonderful, as is the hotel.",5,2016,10,08
207,Four Fabulous Days of Luxury,"The Shelbourne was our first stop on our recent trip to Ireland. We arrived at 11am. The staff immediately worked as quickly as possible to secure a room for us. Every detail of the hotel is impeccable.  The Concierge was very helpful with restaurant reservations, recommendations on things to see and do, and directions as well. The doormen were friendly and helpful. The food and drinks in the bar and  restaurant were all delicious and service was top notch! You must try the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert! Superb! We did not have a single complaint, The location is also perfect for a visit to Dublin.",5,2016,10,08
207,Historic hotel with very comfortable rooms ,It was a very warm day for Dublin. When I walked into my room the air conditioning was on high. It was just the relief I needed. It immediately put me at such a relaxed state that I fell in love with my bed and room. ,5,2016,10,07
207,Awesome ,"The room, hotel and service is great! Waking distance to most things if staying in Dublin. Enjoyed the stay! Friendly staff that cares. Green hope on bus was not good for. We would have 2 to 3 red and yellow buses come by before one Green.  They blamed it on traffic, nut not sure how the others were lapping them.  30 minutes late on last stop.",5,2016,10,06
207,Afternoon tea at the Shelbourne,"Great service and peaceful ambience. Food beautiful and great choice of teas. Beautiful room. Expensive but worth it. 
Modelled on Claridges in London and this is better and cheaper. 
Hotel itself is beautiful too with amazing artwork and floral arrangements. ",4,2016,10,06
207,"Ms. Bonnie from California, USA","The Shelbourne Hotel is a landmark, in Dublin, Ireland.  It's located on St. Stephen's Green. Built in 1824. Almost 200 years old. 5* Hotel.
We had tea, sandwiches and beautiful dessert
In the lobby they have a museum showing many famous people who have stayed there.",5,2016,10,06
207,Primary a vacation trip,Great location for a first time visit to Ireland. The hospitality of the staff were very accommodating and responded promptly when I advised them of a missing luggage from the airline.  They wasted no time getting it to my room the next morning after the airline dropped it off at the reception desk.  I loved the atmosphere of the place.,5,2016,10,06
207,THE place to stay in Dublin,"The Shelbourne Hotel is saturated with the history of Dublin and Ireland itself.  It is also a luxurious lodging without parallel.  From the friendly, top-hatted doormen, the helpful front desk, the turned-down bedcovers after a night out, a bathtub so deep one can float in it . . . this was a splendid place to stay and from which to base explorations of Dublin.  The Shelbourne is walking distance to all the major attractions, with a splendid view of St. Stephen's Green and, for we who are Americans, the Dublin campus of Boston University!",5,2016,10,05
207,"A Fascinating, Lesser Known, Feature","As visitors to the Shelbourne, we were fascinated to learn of the Museum which is situated on the ground floor. On display are a wide range of letters, photographs and various items relating to the history of the Hotel and the events and guests who have stayed there over the years. Equally interesting are the original guest registers held in the lower racks that make for great reading. If you are staying at the hotel and have time to spare make sure you do not miss this gem.",5,2016,10,04
207,Historic Dublin at its best,"The Shelbourne hotel has a justly earned reputation as one of the finest hotels in the entire city. It certainly has the historic ""chops"" to make such a claim.  It was, after all, the site of the signing of the Irish Constitution in 1916.  Make sure to get a glimpse of the historic Constitution Suite, if you can. 

With its spectacular location (across the street from St. Stephen's Green and just steps from Grafton Street), the hotel is wonderfully situated.

If you are looking for truly spacious rooms, you won't find them here. The rooms are somewhat disappointingly small.  And the hotel has a somewhat choppy layout of public rooms, given the age of the building. The hallways, in particular, are in need of refurbishment as well.  Overall, the rooms are plush, the bathrooms are well appointed.

I did not experience the afternoon tea, but I understand it to be memorable.  I also did not make use of the hotel's Genealogy Concierge who (for a fee) will pre-research your Irish ancestry for you.

If you're looking for a truly Irish luxury experience, stay at the Shelbourne ... at least for one night.",5,2016,10,03
207,Classic old-world hotel,"This is a classic city hotel, with lovely public spaces.  It has been nicely renovated, although some of the hallways and floors in the “heritage” wing are very creaky, not very quiet for sleeping.  Breakfast in the beautiful Saddle Room was very satisfying.  The bars were exceedingly crowded and noisy, especially on the weekend.",4,2016,10,03
207,Special night for a special Mum,"I brought my Mum here for a one night treat to get together and attend a concert in the city. The staff were excellent for our whole stay, from the doorman, checkin, bar and spa. They couldnt have been more friendly which to me personally is the difference between a 5 star and 4 star experience.

Food was good and the room was excellent with all little details thought of, we were even lucky enough to get an early checkin which made a huge difference in how we could shape our day ahead.

I drop a star from the rating as I paid €480 last minute for the night for a double double room and we were facing a very close office block with people looking in so we sat in sombre darkness in the room at all times! You cant help that as a city centre hotel but if I select a similar non holiday time date next month, it is a good 40% less. There should be a concession for sitting in what could effectively have been in the basement with no windows!

Aside from that - we really really enjoyed our stay and have no doubt for a decent rate and room we would consider the Shelbourne again.",4,2016,10,03
207,Weekend break,"Hotel very well situated, there's a great atmosphere in the bars particularly the main one. Staff were excellent, they managed to check me in to my room very early after an early morning flight. Best hotel I've stayed at in Dublin",5,2016,10,03
207,Dublin's finest...,"Spent a wonderful night here in Sep, and as i had mentioned to the reservation team that we were getting engaged - the wonderful Pamela found us a fantastic suite, and even came to share an oyster after check out and see who things went. The whole team were amazing, Doireann and Fatima in the Guest Relations team and the one and only Denis in concierge. i'd book another night just to go back and chat with him. Great service at the bar, its a nice play to grab a bottle of wine. it was hard to leave. Bravo Shelbourne!",5,2016,10,03
207,A most disappointing experience....,"We selected this hotel assuming we would get among the best that Dublin offers in accommodation....unfortunately, so many things went wrong, it was the most disappointing hotel we have stayed in a very long time ( and we do travel a lot )... First, we booked a deluxe room and we were given what has to be one of the worst room in the hotel. Extra small to the point we could not get even one bag open except using the bed and with a view on the garbage bins. When I returned to the reception to ask if they would have another room mentioning his one was much smaller than what was advertised on their website, the reception clerk said ""they always do look larger on the website"". Well, I happen to disagree....all the hotels we stayed in in Ireland during our trip lived up to our expectations and more....we were moved to another room slightly larger. Then we experienced problems with the power, TV not working and no power in any of the outlets....the engineer came and fixed the breaker. 1 hour later same problem again, after waiting almost 30 minutes, I went to the reception to complaint and then only, 5-10 minutes later the engineer showed up again and fixed the breaker one more time. By that time we just went to bed. The following day, we left our room at 9am and when we returned at 4pm, the room had not been cleaned yet (!). When I called the reception to inquire, I was told that the maids ""go in circuits and unless I put the card requesting right away, they may take a long time to get to the room"". Is that the standard of a 5 stars hotel? Not in my opinion. Very disappointing! I will certainly not recommend this hotel to anybody.",2,2016,10,01
207,Anniversary,"We were married here in 2010, and what a day! The staff couldnt have done enough for us from door staff right through to managment every little detail was taken care of we really were made to feel special. So for our wedding anniversary we decided to spend a night in the shelbourn and have a few drinks jn town , upon check in we were instantly upgraded to a suit and had a bottle of champagne with strawberries and a lovely card for our anniversary, its little touches like this that make the shelbourn stand out from the rest.i cant recommend this hotel enough whether its for a big event or just for a good central base with excellent service you wont be disappointed
",5,2016,09,26
207,Great location and service but crowded and voyeuristic view,"I stayed at the Shelbourne Dublin on a business trip. The service was great and the hotel was very clean and comfortable. The bed was fluffy and comfortable. The location could not be beat because it's in the middle of a big shopping district, St. Steven's Green. Lots of restaurants and great walkability.

I'm not sure if it was because I was there mid-December but the lobby was always crowded, often so much so that I had to nearly push my way through. 

My biggest complaint was the view. Right across from my room was a view directly into an office building. I had to keep my curtains closed all of the time and felt like a bit of a voyeur if they were open. 

I'm going back to Dublin soon and will be trying a different hotel.",4,2016,09,26
207,Little bit disappointed!,"Stayed here on Saturday night it was a birthday present that I had been really looking forward to! As it was raining we went to the horseshoe bar for a drink! I ordered a cocktail only up be told that I couldn't have a frozen one As the blender was broke! Dacquiris are just not the same when poured into a little glass I had to go and ask for ice to make it drinkable! Room was lovely and clean, bed was very comfortable, however on Sunday morning we had no running water in the room from 11am so we weren't able to have showers and we had to brush our teeth with the bottled water provided in the room! Tried ringing down to get someone but no answer on either number I tried!! Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel, told the receptionist when we were checking out but he didn't have an explanation for it just said there had been a power cut and it may have been a result of that! Took my mobile number and said he would get someone to call me back I still haven't got talking to anyone about it! Didn't offer us any discount or a complimentary anything! Very disappointing as I had been so looking forward to it! Wouldn't encourage me to go back given how much we had paid for it!",3,2016,09,26
207,Historic and beautiful,"On our trip to,Ireland we stayed the first two nights at the historic Shelbourne on St. Stephens Green. Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful, but I thought the concierge was rather abrupt and seemed to waive us off. 
It wasn't until,after visiting the GPO interpretive commemoration of the Easter Rising did I understand the historic nature of this hotel and that adds to its mystique. 
The food was outstanding and we had an excellent dinner the first night. Wish I had more time to spend there.",4,2016,09,25
207,Unbelievably fabulous...,"We had the pleasure of a wonderful 2 night stay here. Most definitely we would highly recommend. It was beautiful, staff were always always friendly, smiling and greeting us. In the bedroom from the bed, to the bed linen to the turn down service-it was all top class. We thoroughly enjoyed the vast choice and food at the buffet breakfast. The cocktails in the horseshoe bar are also a must - especially the after dinner 1!!! Its location and history and service make this a hotel that will create memories and prove its 5 stars. ",5,2016,09,25
207,Famous hotel on St Stephens  Green ,"We stayed here for two nights last week. We were in a deluxe room, that is quite small and packed with furniture. The bathroom was down a few steps. This is a large hotel with much action going on in its public rooms and bars. The lobby can get packed on weekend nights and for big events. Perfect location. Staff was very helpful and gracious.

Sorry. I feel more at home in the Merrion. More peaceful, restrained, and welcoming.
Each to one's own!",3,2016,09,25
207,Not Worth The Money,I spent two weeks in Ireland traveling around the country staying in  4 and 5 star hotels.   I was so disappointed in this hotel.  They were inflexible and aggravating.   Christina at the front desk smiled while she told me she couldn't help me.  The concierge was annoyed that I asked questions.  There is no doubt that it is well located and has a lot of history but the people who work there need to learn manners and that is not the treatment I received from every other hotel in the country.  Needless to say I moved to a different hotel after 4 nights and had a much better time.  Save your money it's not the only 5 star hotel in the City.,2,2016,09,24
207,Perfect  location ,"The Shelbourne never disappoints, from the moment you drop off your car to the valet parking to breakfast the following morning, it excels in everything and I always enjoy staying there. It's the perfect location for city centre meetings  and emanates classic elegance. ",5,2016,09,24
207,The place to stay!,"When you think of 5 star hotels, you think of places like the Shelbourne! Conveniently located across the street from the park and within walking distance of many of the main attraction you won't be disappointed if you stay here. 

The rooms are huge with a beautiful chandelier hanging over the bed. The beds will give you a great night of sleep. The bathrooms look like your own personal spa. The overall service is as 5 star as the hotel itself. Good breakfast in the morning. They do have valet parking, however the cost is relatively steep. It cost me 27 euros for a one night stay. However, it is easier than looking for your own parking in Dublin city center. 

The only negative was when the heat turned on in the room, a burnt smell migrated throughout the room. When the heat was turned off it went away immediately. Apparently they don't use the heat much!

Will definitely be staying here again!",5,2016,09,23
207,Elegant hotel in a prime location,"The Shelbourne is an elegant, classy hotel.  The staff was very helpful.  The bellman let us know about clearing US customs at Dublin Airport so we were sure to leave a little early for the airport the next morning.

Our room was quiet, spacious and well appointed.  The bathroom was a good size as well.

The location is fantastic - on St Stephens Green, next door to the Archaeological Museum, a few blocks from Trinity College.  

I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2016,09,22
207,A whimsical wedding,"We attended a wedding in the Shelbourne and it really was top class.
The arrival, the treatment, the food , the room....just perfection.
A great experience and one that everyone should experience at least once in their life time.",5,2016,09,22
207,Five Star Digs in Dublin,"We stayed here two night as part of our tour package and this place is top of the line. Professional friendly staff, great accommodations and right in the heart of Dublin. This is a five star hotel and provides five star service. The rooms tend to be small, but that is typical of a building of its age, but all the amenities are up to date.",5,2016,09,22
207,Birthday treat,Myself and my husband spent a night at The Shelbourne in January as a treat for my birthday. The hotel is gorgeous. The service is excellent and the general atmosphere around the hotel is lovely. There is a nice buzz around the place. The breakfast was excellent. We have stayed here several times for special occasions and never been disappointed.Love this place.,5,2016,09,22
207,Irish Luxury,This property is perfectly located in downtown Dublin. The staff is professional and there to assist at all times. The rooms were clean and had all amenities. Two restaurants and a bar with specialty cocktails. Great property.,5,2016,09,21
207,Classic luxury hotel,We enjoyed our stay in the Shelbourne... The hotel itself is perfect.. Gorgeous areas to sit and have a drink. The food and drink was very nice. Staff were very friendly.! Our stay was let down completely by our bedroom view... a view of a grey wall.. Bedroom was nice but very small... ! Loved the breakfast! Nice stay but I wouldn't give it 5 stars due to our bedroom!,4,2016,09,21
207,Champagne and oysters!,We went off the cuff to this high end renowned hotel. Considered by many to be the best in Dublin. Quite snooty to be honest but added to the experience. We had half a dozen oysters and a bottle of bubbles for 100€.  Very good service. Friendly informative staff. Thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. ,4,2016,09,20
207,"Wonderful stay.  Great first impression of Dublin, its history and fine people","Absolutely loved The Shelbourne.  Great location, great staff, very good food.  Stephen at the Horseshoe bar was excellent.  I was extremely impressed with Hannah, a first day employee, was wonderful.  I believe she was working at the front of the Lord Mayor's Lounge.  She made a lasting impression on my wife and I.  Her help and knowledge about Dublin, especially of the All Ireland Football final was amazing.  Very professional and extremely confident young lady working for her first day on the job!!!",5,2016,09,20
207,Another great experience,"Arrived at the hotel before check-in time.  We were exhausted from an overnight flight.  We had breakfast while we waited for a room, and we were pleasantly surprised when we received our room by 11 a.m.  It was a beautiful appointed king-size room.  The concierge, Dennis, was very helpful with dinner reservations.  If I had a complaint it would be the breakfast room where the tables are very small and very close together.  We had drinks and lunch in the bar which was wonderful with super waiters and waitresses and a very lively crowd.",5,2016,09,20
207,Classic hotel located in an excellent part of Dublin,"My family and I recently stayed in the Shelbourne Hotel.  Our visit allowed us to stay in the hotel for two days and we had a wonderful experience.  The hotel itself is known for having accommodated some of the worlds most well recognized and elite people in the world.  There is a reason why it gets high marks from most guest.  It truly is an exemplary hotel, that is well maintained, well staffed and is in an excellent part of the city.  My recommendation is to stay in the back portion of the hotel (away from the park view) if you require a quiet accommodations.  The staff was on point in all aspects and were polite, informed and knowledgeable.  My family looks forward to staying in the hotel again in the near future.",5,2016,09,18
207,The Shelbourn ,"Deluxe is the best word I can give . Absolutely loved it.  Services were exemplary, and the others at the hotel very happy to be there. ☺
I wasn't able to experience ""High Tea"" as we were site seeing daily. But it looked fabulous, delicious and very posh. ",5,2016,09,17
207,There Is A Reason It Gets Great Reviews,The Shellbourne earns its five star rating.  A very historical and wonderful place. The restaurants are great and we stayed in two rooms while there and they both were very nice.  The employees are over the top nice and friendly.  The check in experience was very relaxing and nice.  It is interesting to view all of the famous people that have stayed there.  It is also very convenient for a nice walking tour of Dublin.  The breakfast is wonderful.  The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were luxurious.  If we go back to Dublin rest assured we will stay there.,5,2016,09,16
207,A slice of Heaven,"--An absolutely Wonderful stay at the Shelbourne Hotel Dublin Ireland--staff, accommodations, food all were superb--if treating yourself is the goal while visiting Ireland then the Shelbourne is the place to start--Doiran, Hotel staff at check in was most courtiest, helpful, and welcoming--thank you to all at the Shelbourne--Kevin and Ellen Flynn",5,2016,09,16
207,Excellent hotel.,"Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a Heritage room. Check-in was excellent with lots of help provided. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a separate w/c and the shower area was large. This hotel has quite a history behind it and we both really enjoyed staying in a classic yet modernised environment. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5,2016,09,16
207,Ireland ,"Great hotel! Great room and very helpful staff.  Perfect location next to St Stephens 
Hotel and facilities were immaculate. Would certainly stay here again when I return to Dublin

Very close to attractions and Grafton street. Easy taxi access as well",5,2016,09,14
207,Great Location,"Had a very enjoyable stay at The Shelbourne. The Hotel is conveniently located, across the road from St Stephens Green, 5 mins walk to Grafton St shopping mall and 10 mins walk to Trinity College. The  staff were all very pleasant and helpfull. The rooms were very comfortable. Graet place to stay.",5,2016,09,14
207,Lovely stay,"This is my second stay this year. First in Feb for valentines night with my partner and second in April with my Mum.

On both occasions I was very happy with our room decor wise etc. 

Staff super friendly

Buffet and A la carte menu to die for. 

The main bar gets very very busy on a Friday night with local business people, this didn't put me off as enjoyed the banter!

I can't fault it really. Some say a little pricey, but i'm more than happy to pay for this stunning hotel which is steeped in Irish history. 

Great location for shopping on Grafton St, plenty of restaurants and pubs to choose from.

We took a walk to the Aviva Stadium about 20 mins away for a stadium tour. 

I'll be back for sure!",5,2016,09,13
207,"Good not great, stuffy, not necessarily classy","Make no mistake about it, this property is beautiful, and in a fantastic location in Dublin; just not really my ""cup of tea."" The checkin process was long, a package was delivered to the hotel, but could not be located for more than a week after checkout.  I expect more than what was delivered for the upscale property the Shelbourne is, but definitely would give it another try.",3,2016,09,12
207,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"This hotel is absolutely stunning. While we did not get to stay at this hotel, we did have the pleasure of having afternoon tea. I would definitely make reservations before as our seating was completely full. The tea was just perfect - the scones, sandwiches, desserts - it was a full meal. I highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2016,09,12
207,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"I went along for afternoon tea with my mum and sisters, it was such a wonderful experience from the moment we entered, the staff were friendly and welcoming. The afternoon tea was both delicious and delightful, and we all enjoyed every moment and every morsel of the beautiful cakes and tasty sandwiches. I would highly recommend this experience to anyone looking for a lovely day out and a nice treat. I shall definitely be back! ",5,2016,09,11
207,Wonderful hotel,"We recently celebrated our wedding anniversary here. We could not recommend this hotel highly enough. We had a beautiful room with a complementary bottle of prosecco and macaroons upon arrival. We had a delicious dinner in the saddle room, breakfast the next day was excellent too. All of the staff were extremely pleasant. We will definitely be back!",5,2016,09,10
207,Pleasant Experience,Stopped into the bar for a drink on a night out. The hotel was busy as the American college football was on. Plenty of staff around to tend to everyone's needs. It was a good cocktail in pleasant surrounding. I love when places have the nice hand cream to use in the bathrooms.,5,2016,09,10
207,Poor Customer Service and Follow-Up,"I visited Dublin at the end of June 2016.  The purpose of my trip was both business and personal.  I stayed at The Shelbourne for 4 nights and 5 days,  During my stay I was able to find time to shop.  When I arrived back to the room from a day of shopping, i placed by shopping bag by the desk.  The next morning, the house keeping staff cleaned the room and threw away everything I had purchased. Today is September 9th and the hotel still has not addressed this issue.  I am a Platinum for Life member and i can honestly say I have never had this issue at another property.
The bar staff was not attentive, I sat in the bar on a Monday afternoon and I was only approached 2 times over a 3 hour period and asked if I needed anything.  Every other time I had to go to the bar and place my food and drink order.
Overall I do not believe the experience is worth the price.",3,2016,09,09
207,Everything you expect in a fine hotel,Our tour group was booked into this 5 star hotel. It is located just across the street fromSt Stephens green. The hotel was the site of the writing of the Irish Constitution in 1922. It is now a Marriott hotel. ,5,2016,09,08
207,A lovely hotel,"This is a lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin, convenient to St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, Grafton St, The National Archaeology museum, and many other downtown attractions. The rooms are modern and well furnished, the staff VERY helpful. My only regret that is through odd scheduling arrangements, we were only able to stay one night, as it was sold out for the second night we were to stay in Dublin. I can see why it was.",5,2016,09,06
207,"Great location, great hotel.","We were here for two nights with our 8 month old daughter. The concierge couldn't have been more helpful both prior to and during our stay. The room was a good size and the bathroom was so large we were able to put our daughter's pack n plan inside it. The food at the hotel was great plus they had good recommendations for local restaurants nearby. The location is perfect, we could walk to everything.",4,2016,09,06
207,Lovely Hotel,The shelbourne is a perfect hotel and it has the best walking distance to all the tourist attraction. It was easy to get the on and off bus and walking to restaurants and bars. The hotel staff is amazing. They gave us a upgrade since we are marriott members. a really nice lady came at 2am to give us a roll away and she set up everything. Also they have a tea room for families to enjoy a nice morning or late afternoon. I will most likely go next summer to the Shelbourne,5,2016,09,06
207,Amazing experience,"We got married in the Shelbourne in August 2016. Everything was perfect. We could have not asked for a better experience. Although my husband is from Dublin we do not live in Ireland, so most of the wedding planning had to be done via email. Cathy O'shea was super professional and very supportive of all our ideas and requests and on the day everything went to plan and beyond. All the staff was amazingly kind, responsive and professional. Everyone went beyond the call of duty to make our day a very special one. The Shelbourne truly provides an incredible experience. We will definitely be back",5,2016,09,05
207,Lovely old hotel on St Stephen's Green,We stayed one night at the Shelbourne Hotel at the end of August.  It is a very nice hotel with an exceptionally helpful staff.  Rooms are modern and well kept.  The roads immediately around the hotel are under construction making it a bit confusing to get to if you are driving yourself.  Check out the small hotel museum off the lobby documenting the long history of the hotel - you can look through old guest registers and read about history made there.  It is a bit pricey but the location is hard to beat.,4,2016,09,04
207,AMAZING High Tea,"We had the most lovely tea here on our first day in Dublin. The food was generous in portion, delicious in taste, and the staff were professional and working hard to please and provide. DEFINITE must do on your tour of Dublin...the entire hotel is just beautiful, and a nice walk in St. Stephens Green is the perfect ending to a nice tea party!",5,2016,09,04
207,Perfect location,"wonderful service; great location; right across the street from the park; easy walking to many sites; be sure to make reservations for afternoon tea;  they even accommodate for gluten free! Rooms are clean and quiet, although not huge...",5,2016,09,04
207,Unsurpassed Service in Dublin,"The Shelbourne  hotel Dublin is at the heart of Dublin on St Stephens Green. Have stayed here twice in the month and I am never disappointed by the level of service and attention to detail the staff at this wonderful hotel.

Restaurants and bars are always well staffed even on a busy weekend( Boston College and Georgia Tech Game) there seemed ample room for guests. The oyster bar is very good. A number of restaurants close by are also very good.

Wonderful gym and lap pool if you are feeling energetic. The spa provides great services. ",5,2016,09,04
207,Peerless service...,"One of the highlights of our trip home was our stay here.

Service here is exemplary.

The highlight for us was staff juggling (at late notice) some dinner bookings to get us and our toddler a booth in a quiet part of the Saddle Room restaurant @ 7pm on a Saturday. Wait service was also great, making sure we had time with our sons meal before our main courses. Quickly clearing things on a chaotic table. Simple things done perfectly.

Food itself was amazing.",5,2016,09,03
207,Wonderful,"This being my first visit to the Shelbourne will most definitely not be my last!
So lovely,the Hotel exudes a bygone era that gives their guests luxury ,comfort and style.
The rooms are well equipped,comfortable and meet the needs of their guests.
Breakfast is excellent,lunch and dinner? Well what can one say...FAB!!!
Go on treat yourself to a stay at the Shelbourne.",5,2016,09,03
207,Magnificent Dublin hotel,Hotel is centrally located with very comfortable rooms and attentive staff.  The breakfast buffet was very tasty and varied (though a bit expensive). Walking distance to just about everything.  Rooms are well appointed and modern.,5,2016,09,02
207,Excellent,"Situated in a monumental building this hotel is in THE prime location in Dublin. Both bars, restaurant and breakfast were brilliant. Pancakes for breakfast anyone? 

Enjoyed it every time I stayed here for business purposes. Some sections in the hotel might need some small upgrades but I suppose its adds to the charm. I once stayed in a standard room which was just too small. My advise is to dig a little bit deeper and getting oneself a more spacious expensive room because the price/quality ratio for some of the standerd rooms is just not up to par. 

I red they have pool. Lol I never found it.",4,2016,09,02
207,Revisit didn't disappoint.,Had an enjoyable three day visit. This hotel is central to shopping areas and fabulous restaurants. Lovely room which was spacious and had its own separate dressing room. Staff were always helpful. On one occasion we returned to find our room not made up. However a delightful gesture by the hotel soon found us enjoying a complimentary cup of tea while we waited! Thank you Shelbourne! ,5,2016,09,01
207,"Very good, almost excellent.","Prime location, grand, classic property with comfortable, well appointed rooms. Excellent service, terrific breakfast buffet, and cosy well stocked bar. Pool was great. Only thing that stops me giving a 5th star is the need for updating. Although classic and charming in decor, the common areas could do with a refresh.",4,2016,08,31
207,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed with this hotel, treated myself and a friend to a night here, on arrival we were ignored until I managed to get someone's attention, the room we booked was a twin, we were given a double, we couldn't open the window for some fresh air as we don't like to use the air conditioning as my friend is asthmatic and it affects it. Room was small, as was the bathroom, I understand it is a city center location, however what we paid was not worth what we received.",2,2016,08,31
207,Birthday trip for my wifes 50th,I have stayed in Dublin many times but never at the Shelbourne for some reason. I have stayed in many hotels in the world and this is one of the best. The atmosphere is what makes it. It got a typical laid back calm relaxing Irish feel to it. Staff were excellent. Breakfast is highly recommended.,5,2016,08,31
207,"Great place for afternoon tea, lite lunch or dinner aperitif..",I love this hotel its a very old fixture in Dublin that most folks know about because its a first class hotel. I haven't stayed here only visited for food/cocktails and lunch.  The food is excellent so is the service.  The bar is fantastic and  definitely a lovely place to go for pre dinner/theatre cocktails. The hotel is situation just off grafton street at the top end towards Stephens Green so its an ideal location to stay for a weekend break. ,5,2016,08,30
207,Totally  Superb!,"We stayed 2 nights at the Shelbourne last min decision and wow it's memorable, our room was small but extremely luxurious which made all the difference, staff were friendly and  courteous, we dined in the bar both evenings as we had a five year old with us and it was perfect , difficult to find seats but eventually we always did. Breakfast is king! It was the best I've experienced world wide, the menu is full of traditional's with a twist , totally unforgettable , seating , atmosphere , service amazing (I'm coming back just to experience scotch eggs again!)
Valet staff are super well trained courteous and happy!
Cannot wait to return

",5,2016,08,30
207,Good location,"This hotel was arguably much better before Marriott took over, but it's worth the stay for it's location and good rooms. Skip the breakfast at the hotel, it's expensive and sparse. There are MUCH better options within 1-2 blocks of the hotel. The hotel bar is ok, but again, there are much better options down the street. Afternoon tea is worth the experience.",4,2016,08,30
207,Expensive but great service!,"I've stayed here a number of times when I found lower rates. They have absolutely wonderful customer service and luxurious common areas. The beds and pillows are very comfortable. If you arrive too early to check into your room, but want to freshen up, they have a spa facility where you can do so.",5,2016,08,30
207,Great place of luxury,This is the most elegant hotel i have ever stayed in. The lovely staff and atmosphere really livens my stay in Dublin. It is in a great area near this beautiful city. It is very busy but is still a great place i would recommend it for anyone who would like style,5,2016,08,30
207,Elegant and perfectly situated,"I stayed here for four nights as part of a business trip traveling with several colleagues. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff were very attentive. One colleague did say her room was located over the receiving dock and she heard deliveries late in the evening one night but that was the only complaint. We were well looked after by the staff and there are many amenities including a spa. I ate dinner in the Saddle Room restaurant and the food was fresh and delicious.  At the end of the evening, when we got back to the hotel after dinner and sightseeing, it was so wonderful to find my bed turned down with slippers laid out and chocolates and sparkling water by the bed!  In the morning, there was bottled water for the electric kettle and a choice of teas or coffee. One really nice extra was that the room had an American power outlet so I didn't need my converter.",5,2016,08,29
207,Loved it,"Stayed here for the Dublin horse show weekend. The only issue we had was the ques checking in and out it was extremely busy. Apart from that the hotel is amazing, level of service is second to none. This was such a real treat for us and we enjoyed every moment of the luxury. I stay in a lot in hotels but I can't explain it you have to experience it. It's like home from home in Dublin centre but with pure luxury. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,08,29
207,Character & Luxury,"Stayed here for 1 night on business with several colleagues. As we were here for less than 24 hours it was difficult to get a detailed look or experience of the place eg the only meal I had was breakfast which was very good ( albeit typically expensive ) and we spent less than an hour in the bar and didnt use any other facilities , just my room.

The bedroom was comfortable and luxurious and despite the central location I thought it was very quiet overnight , unlike many European cities. The hotel's central location was great for our walk into the city centre in the evening for dinner and a drink at the Temple Bar.

Would definitely stay here again if I'm lucky enough to be able to.",5,2016,08,29
207,Great location! Great building! Good service. ,"Perfect spot for visiting Dublin located in downtown, near temple area, and all the attractions of this beautiful city. 
Good restaurants and good bar. 
The breakfast gets crowded sometimes but the service in general is good! 
Try to get rooms with outer view.",4,2016,08,29
207,Regrettably disappointed with service,"Our last two nights of our almost two week trip to Scotland and Ireland was capped off with a stay at the Shelbourne.  Unfortunately I don't think the over 500 euros per night per heritage park room was worth what we received.  We went to check into our two rooms at 2pm.  One of the two rooms was ready, and upgraded to a junior suite.  The second room was next door, as requested, and was to be ""ready shortly"".  My mother stayed behind to wait for her room as we returned our rental car.  Upon our return around 3:30, she was still in the lobby waiting.  She was then informed that there was a late checkout, and hadn't been cleaned yet.  Another room or junior suite on another floor was offered, but they were on different floors, which doesn't work when you need the rooms to be next to each other.  Close to 4pm the initial room was ready, and the initial check-in agent apologized, but there was no additional services/refund/anything offered.  The first night there was a water leak from the ceiling that turned out to be condensation into the junior suite.  The second night, the handle fell off the bathroom door.  Our first morning was at the Saddle Room, where the plates piled up on the table during the buffet breakfast as they were not cleared quickly.  Our second evening was at the Oyster Bar, where my husband ordered a chicken and mushroom pie, and was served a fish pie instead.  Two positive experiences were from the bellman/concierge desk, where they directed us to the local gas station before returning rental car, and for their organizing a taxi to the airport.  The hotel is in an excellent location, and has amazing history and beautiful public rooms, but we were very disappointed with the service rendered for the cost incurred.",3,2016,08,28
207,Never ever again! Should not be allowed to keep 5 star rating,"My husband and I stayed at Shelbourne a few weeks ago (5th and 6th August) along with our friends. Never again! We had treatments booked in the spa at 1600. Had requested an early check in. Arrived at 1300- our friends could check in, but we could not which was acceptable as it couldn't be guaranteed. We left our bags in their room, which looked nice. But we were after all paying €550 per night. We were guaranteed check in for 1500 so we returned at that time but room wasn't ready. We had to stand for 20 minutes in the lobby (no seats). Manager eventually came over and asked if she could help. A few of them then scrambled behind the desk in front of one of the screens. It was obvious they had made a mistake but instead of being honest, they said they needed to move something and just wanted everything to be perfect in the room when in fact, the room (446) we were eventually given was awful. Shoved at the end of the corridor, it was an interconnecting room, carpet was filthy, the musty smell was strong and the room was obviously far inferior to our friends. There was a slope from the bathroom which was a hazard- carpet was so worn it was shiny which made it extremely slippy and we both nearly fell. By this time, we were in a rush to get to the spa (not that it should be called that- a cold swimming pool, a sauna and steam room with a couple of cheap seats all overlooked by a gym on 3 sides is it what I would class as 5 star- they should check out Galgorm Hotel in Ballymena to see what a proper spa is!). There was only one robe,so I needed to get dressed again and then we rushed down to the spa in time for our treatments. As we were stuck at the very end of the corridor, we had a bit of a walk, past some threadbare carpet, then the lift was broken so we had to go down and back up the 6 floors via the stairs changing rooms and spa were on 2nd floor basement).  Because we had a quick turnaround to get to dinner (FX Buckley on Crow Street- can't recommend it highly enough), we decided not to complain as we had no time to move. Same for the next day as we decided to spend as much time away from the hotel as possible. When it came to check out, I noticed the manager who dealt with us the first day left the lobby when she seen us, and we weren't asked if we enjoyed our stay (yet it was the first asked of the person before an after us). It was only when the doorman asked did I tell him how disappointing the visit had been and I'd never be back. We had book this for 7 months and had been looking forward to it so much. It obviously relying on the name and the hotel it once was.  My husband who is a Marriott gold member complained on our return and there was a feasible attempt to give us some Marriott reward points. To be honest, I'm not sure either of us would be keen to ever use Marriott again.",1,2016,08,28
207,Absolutely Fabulous ,"Spent three nights in this very swanky hotel and was very impressed by every aspect of it.  All staff - front of house, reception, restaurant, bar, housekeeping - were courteous & helpful, the decor was extremely tasteful and our room was very comfortable, with everything we could possibly need and more besides. Highly recommended.",5,2016,08,27
207,Shelbourne,A dublin institution the Shelbourne after its refurbishment is the the majestic hotel it was  ... the horseshoe bar is intimate and classy ...the seafood platter in the restaurant is sublime . The large front bar is buzzing ..!,5,2016,08,25
207,Afternoon Tea,"We recently went here for afternoon tea for our wedding anniversary. I was unsure if this was something I was going to enjoy or not as we would normally go for a meal and wanted something different. 
I have to say from the moment we were seated to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. The staff could not have done enough for us. 
As for the afternoon tea it's self it was delightful. I would highly recommend it. We could not finish this t as it was so sweet and filling. They packed up our leftovers for us to bring home. 
There is 26 different types of tea to choose from and our waitress asked my husband a couple of questions about what he likes and then came back with a cherry tea for him to try and he loved it. 
She went on to recommend another couple based on what he liked and each one was better than the last. 
I would highly recommend it for any occasion.",5,2016,08,25
207,A Great Hotel,"My wife and I celebrated our 45th wedding anniversary at the Shelbourne for four days and enjoyed every minute. The room was very comfortable, the service was great and the restaurant and bar were very professionally run. The Shelbourne is in a great location for a number of attractions. There is an abundance of good shopping and restaurants. The Shelbourne is on our list for a return visit.",5,2016,08,24
207,A Luxury Experience,"What a class hotel. Staff attentive and accommodating. Very classy. Comfortable room and well appointed. Great sleeping bed. Food superb. Had afternoon tea. Great experience. Centrally located across from St Stephens Park, right near Trinity college, great pubs and bistros as well as shopping all within walking distance. If you want a luxury experience, this is it.",5,2016,08,24
207,"Afternoon tea a delight, however, the staff needs a little more instruction.","We booked afternoon tea at the Shelbourne.  You really need to book ahead as this is a very popular place for tea.

The hotel itself is lovely and well maintained.  We inquired about the art, but the concierge did not have the information and told us to look online for ourselves.

The theme for the afternoon on the menu was Alice in Wonderland so the desserts were named appropriately and decorated to match the theme.  The tea came first, and our cups were never half empty before they poured more.  The sandwiches were good:  salmon, ham salad, egg salad, and tomato with cream cheese.  We did not have the traditional cucumber sandwiches.  Next came the scones with strawberry jam, clotted cream, and butter on the side along with the desserts.  We could not eat all of the food, and the desserts were really rich and sweet so we could only eat part of them.

The piano was playing in the background, which was lovely, and the music was mostly from Phantom of the Opera.

We were a little surprised to see the staff changing a table in the center of the room after some people left while tea was still taking place for many of us. They even brought an iron out and were pressing the tablecloth during tea!  They should be instructed to do that in the back or in between settings...never during tea.

The doormen should also greet  all of the guests entering the hotel and hold the door instead of chatting with each other or watching their cell phones.  We noticed them doing this a number of times as we were entering the hotel.

Still a lovely hotel and nice tea, but the staff needs a little more polishing.",4,2016,08,24
207,Home from Home,"What a great welcome we received from Maggie at reception. She was so warm and inviting, & explained all the hotels facilities. 
We were staying 7 nights in a suite, but the first one wasn't up to the standard we expected. We went back to reception and this time we saw Dermot & again fantastic customer service recovery. 
Our second suite was as expected very luxurious, & inviting. 
The General Manager Mr Dempsey heard of what happened and was most apologetic about this, and sent a lovely bottle of champagne to our room. 
On our last night in Ireland we returned to the Shelbourne Hotel, and again the warm reception we received from Maggie was lovely. 
To our surprise we were upgraded from our Suite,  to the Princess Grace Suite.  Wow it was stunning. It was such a lovely gesture from Mr Dempsey for this upgrade which also came with a stunning afternoon Tea & a bottle of champagne.
Our stay at this hotel was simply fabulous & cannot recommend this hotel high enough. 
The decor, chandeliers, restaurants, Door Man ( in his top hat & tails ) to the porters, housekeeping staff, everyone of them make you feel very special. 
If your ever in Dublin then you must let the Shelbourne Hotel be your first point of call. You will not be disappointed.",5,2016,08,23
207,Fabulous afternoon,Pure indulgence on a week day playing catchup with friends. Fabulous food & presentation. Needless to say service was marvellous. Great location and such a great asset to the capital. One could while away the hours very easily and a glass of champagne is a real indulgence ,5,2016,08,23
207,Last minute indulgence,"We have been traveling around Europe for 6 weeks.
We have been busy and have seen much. 
We were also fatigued - staying on many different accommodation, comfort was variable.
As a last minute indulgence to test, recover and regenerate, we booked into the Shelbourne.
We enjoyed our stay very much and the level of comfort was very highly valued.",4,2016,08,22
207,Love the Shelbourne,"Now this is something because we arrived after like endless hours of travel and I was pretty cranky. The front desk processed us quickly and efficiently and staff were the most consistently welcoming across the boards of any of the accommodations we experienced on this trip. The rooms are a bit small (by American standards) which was anticipated but everything is beautifully appointed and bath was quite generous (I should mention the room was what they call a suite). This hotel is beautiful with a capital ""B"" and despite having stayed in castles along the way, may have been my favorite lodging.Perfect location in the city and right on St. Stephens... I might also mention hands down the best breakfast experience of my entire trip. Love this hotel and would book again in a nano second.",5,2016,08,22
207,Great location,"nice hotel, very elegant.  The service here is excellent.  The room we had was a little small and the air conditioning was virtually non existent, but nicely furnished.  I would stay again as the location and the service made up for any shortfalls.",4,2016,08,22
207,Fantastic Stay!,"I stayed at The Shelbourne Dublin for 3 nights with my family and I could not be more impressed how they run the hotel.

The suite was classic, clean and had a specific charm that made it unique.

Breakfast each morning was so good and we all looked forward to starting our day in the hotel restaurant. The service was cheery and there is always someone near, eager to please.

We had cocktails each evening in the beautiful, expansive bar. The place was packed but there always seemed to be a place to sit.
Once again the service was top notch.

We did not have tea, but the room looked like a turn of the century classic tea room.
I was told that it's going to be completely renovated, and I'm sure it will be spectacular like the other newly designed spaces.

Great job Shelbourne Dublin!

",5,2016,08,22
207,Afternoon Tea ☺,I have to start by saying absolutely everyone at some point in their life should experience afternoon tea here at the Shelbourne. Came here for afternoon tea to celebrate our 5 year anniversary and it was such a treat. The service was fantastic and the food was amazing. The afternoon tea is themed and this one was Alice in Wonderland themed. It was simply magnificent and such a special experience. I already cannot wait for the next big occasion to visit again.,5,2016,08,21
207,"Came back after initial visit, always a good sign","We, my wife and I, stayed our first weekend with my brother and his wife at the Shelbourne.  At the tail end of trip, last two nights we left open to decide.  We enjoyed our stay so much the first time we came back.  Trust me we are avid travelers and not once ever did this, it was that well done.

Rooms well appointed, location excellent, food and drink options plenty and excellent, lastly service outstanding from all the staff.

",5,2016,08,21
207,"Wonderful Hotel, great location and very helpful staff","We spent 3 nights at the Shelbourne as part of a Tauck tour of Ireland. Great facilities and super helpful staff. The location is right across the street from a beautiful park and a few blocks away from a great shopping and eating area. Our meals in the hotel we excellent, the bar is cozy with a larger space available across the hall with food service and a bar as well. I return on a business trip in a week and am looking forward to staying here again!",5,2016,08,21
207,"Central, friendly and comfortable","The Shelbourne is an ideal place to stay when visiting Dublin. Not only is it extremely central which makes exploring on foot the obvious option, but it offers everything you need for a city break - comfortable rooms, friendly staff and an interesting history. We stayed for two nights and I would happily have stayed for longer. Our room was tastefully and comfortably furnished - the bed very comfortable and the bathroom roomy and well equipped. If you enjoy Irish hospitality (and who doesn't!) the bar is the place to be in the evening. I don't think I have ever been in a busier, more popular bar and I lived in Eire for many years and deeply appreciate the warm welcome  that is always on offer. This was the first time I have visited The Shelbourne and it would definitely be my hotel of choice on my next visit. Lovely.",4,2016,08,20
207,The Very Best in Town,Stayed there for five nights. Having returned to it after five years. The place is just magnificent. Luxury ++ . The rooms are fine -ours was quite small room but since we were out most days it did not matter much Breakfast is a very good spread with excellent staff who are there to oblige to your every taste and needs. The bar seems to be busy all the time. The saddle room ideal setting for a quiet evening-with excellent cuisine. Try the beef- melts in your mouth!,5,2016,08,20
207,Simply recommended ,"What's not to like when you have:

Great central location
First impression when leaving the car out front for valet parking was polite and efficient 
Nice spacious rooms with all the trimmings expected of a 5*
Friendly helpful professional service providers throughout
Tidy, clean, facilities to fill an hour or two if needed (pool, spa etc)
Restaurants that serve a good variety of delicious food and cocktails with a great wine offering
Oh and room service is tasty too and quick!!

Simply enjoyable not a thing to complain about. 

Special mention The service in the saddles restaurant (older gentleman wish I had his name) was professional outstanding, balanced in attention and foresight and the set menu food was delicious! Would go again. ",5,2016,08,20
207,Upgraded in luxury!,"Rang a day earlier to check rates, etc. Got a good rate & was asked if I'd like to include dinner for a small fee. Also got upgraded to a heritage room for this package.
Was so looking forward to an evening of luxury & fine dining - it didn't disappoint. Upon check in was greeted by friendly staff who happily told me they were upgrading is to a junior suite! The suite was huge, more like an apartment. It was huge! Exquisite bedroom, high ornate ceilings with 2 walk-in closets, huge marble bathroom, Elemis bathroom accessories, fluffy big towels, robes & slippers. Huge tv in bedroom & the living room had a large work desk, couch, chairs & another tv. Plush throughout!! So posh, thoroughly enjoyed my stay & wished I could've stayed a lot longer. 
Food was delicious but will review that under the restaurant section. 5* luxury with amazing staff to boot. Please invite me back!",5,2016,08,19
207,First Class - Irish or any style!,"We arrived in Ireland early and when we arrived at the Shelbourne we expected them to store our bags and send us on our way; nope.  The staff greeted us with a ready room and the day just got better.  

The rooms are amazingly comfortable.  The staff is amazing.  The Food is great, we had the buffet breakfast and it was one of the best ones I've been to at a hotel.  

We will return!",5,2016,08,19
207,Great hotel,Stayed here many a time and it's always a great experience. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms are spacious and have everything you want for a relaxing stay. Staff are very nice and the hotel itself is in a great location close to all dublins big attractions. Would definitely recommend ,5,2016,08,18
207,Gorgeous in every way,"What a lovely hotel!  Gorgeous lobby, beautiful restaurant, bars, spa and lovely comfy rooms.  All in a fabulous location with outstanding service!!!  You cannot ask for more in Dublin.  Concierge is helpful and made our stay wonderful.",5,2016,08,18
207,OVERNIGHT STAY,Had a lovely overnight stay here.  everything was excellent although the room was a bit on the small side for 2 people and I would really have liked a bath but hay its city centre and space is scarce!!  Best nights sleep I have had in a long time.  Best night sleep ever in a Hotel!! Can not fault this Hotel.,5,2016,08,18
207,"Yes, Excellent","This is an excellent hotel. Quiet, efficient, service staff both friendly and very competent. This is a Hotel I would love to stay at again and would not hesitate to recommend. Excellent in every way, including location. It is a classic in a world that has far too few! ",5,2016,08,17
207,"Very nice rooms, too expensive for what you get","Good (not brilliant) location, a bit of a walk down grafton street to access city centre. Rooms are nice though once interconnecting doors are open not massive. Bathrooms are lovely. Facilities are good restaurants on the expensive side, but there you get your monies worth. Would be nice if children (under 18) are allowed in swim pool after 5, or from 9 (instead of 10).",4,2016,08,17
207,You get what you pay for,"We had a comfortable room, very clean, plush linens, nice and quiet. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious. Service in hotel was overall very good. But the really wonderful thing about this hotel was it's location. Easy to get to everywhere you wanted to go, usually by walking and occasionally with transportation. ",5,2016,08,16
207,"Great location, nice rooms. Great Salon. Service was disappointing.","I was excited to stay at The Shelbourne after watching the documentary. I was expecting to be blown away by the level of service provided. I was a little disappointed. I felt that certain nationalities get the red carpet rolled out for them. This was clear from check in,  as the couple in front of us got a very different experience than we did. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We were attending a black tie event in another hotel and I got my hair and nails done in The Salon which I loved. It is very small but has a great buzz and I was really happy with the service and think it is great value and will definitely be back. 
Upon our return after the event we were very surprised at the unprofessional  doorman, we felt like we nearly had to get out our reservation to gain access to the hotel and felt like we were dealing with a ""bouncer"" in a nightclub. We then queued at one of the bars for about 10 minutes before being told it was closed and we would have to go to another bar, regardless of people just being served before us. We just went to bed. This was in stark contrast to the service we received recently in The Westbury, which was 5*.",3,2016,08,16
207,Plush city stay,"This hotel is centrally located in the city right across from St. Stephen's Park. Always bustling with their upscale restaurant and bar, can also accommodate weddings. Small lobby, sometimes you have to wait more than I would have liked for service. Outstanding breakfast buffet with lots of choices and fresh foods, best in our visit to Ireland. The pool didn't look so appealing but often is the case for indoor city hotel pools. Plush rooms had comfy beds and pillows, robes & slippers, turn down service, lovely marble bathrooms with walk in showers. ",5,2016,08,14
207,Still an institution,The horseshoe bar is still an institution . Food is just lovely .try seafood platter in the restaurant main bar has a great atmosphere and the bedrooms while not big are fab .a must visit in Dublin. The champagne glasses are unforgettable!,4,2016,08,14
207,A lovely hotel in downtown Dublin,"The Shelbourne Dublin was the perfect place to start our Ireland holiday. 

We arrived on an overnight flight and had a delicious reviving lunch in the hotel bar. The concierge, Alan, was very helpful in planning our day and booking our dinner reservations. The Hop On Hop Off bus (green) was right outside the hotel and we jumped on for a city tour, including a tour of Guinness. If you plan to visit the Gaol, book your tickets online ahead of time.

The doormen at the hotel were very helpful in flagging cabs. We  took a short cab ride to a wonderful restaurant called Forest Avenue. The second night we walked one block to the hip Etto Wine Bar, which was packed with Dubliners-a sign of a very good restaurant.

Our room was on the 7th floor. It was elegantly decorated, with a beautiful bathroom and very comfortable king sized bed. It was so quiet on our floor, you would never know the hotel was full. Not sure if we paid extra for the balcony- not worth it if we did, as we faced an office building. 

Just a few minutes walk from Trinity College and Grafton St., we were able to go for an enjoyable morning walk before heading to the train station.

We will stay in this hotel again, when we return to Dublin. It was just perfect and ticked all the boxes for a city stay.",5,2016,08,13
207,Wow. ,"When travelling to Ireland for a family wedding, we decided to splash out and stay somewhere nice for a few days, and how delighted are we that we did. The Shelbourne Hotel is stunning! There is a small museum in the hotel that you can see some of the original ledgers from guests a hundred years ago and original political documents drafted in the hotel. The in room compendium also included extensive information about the hotel, it's history and previous famous guests. 

Our room itself was quite small, but covered everything we needed and more. I loved the three visits a day from house staff - one in the morning to make the room, one in the afternoon to tidy up snd then one in the evening to turn down the room for bed time. It was a wonderful touch to cone back from dinner and have your room ready for bed!!

The food in the restaurant was delicious, as were the high tea options. The gym facility was excellent and the pool was delightful.  The staff very always helpful and would go out of their way to help even the smallest request.

Directly opposite St Stephen's Green and only a five minute walk to Grafton St, the location is perfect. ",5,2016,08,12
207,Anniversary treat ! ,"What an amazing experience!!!
First class hotel in the most classic tradition.  

Having taken a very early morning flight from the UK we arrived at the hotel by 9am and were very pleased to find out our room was available so we could dump bags and start our tour of Dublin. 

I can't say enough about the hotel, just class, class, class! Super food p , super service. 

Great location, with the hop-on, hop-off bus tours all stopping across the road which is well worth doing if you are there for 24/48hrs. 

Thank you for a lovely stay, can't wait till next time. ",5,2016,08,11
207,Luxury all the way,"I've always wanted to stay at the Shelbourne and I wasn't disappointed. Lovely room, lovely staff and my sister and I were very well looked after. Breakfast catered for most palates and there was plenty to eat. Stayed in a Queen Room, and it was great, especially the turn-down service and the chocolate left out for guests. Well beyond my means but great for a special treat. ",5,2016,08,11
207,Very enjoyable stay and sublime afternoon tea!,"I enjoyed a one night stay here recently followed by afternoon tea! The room was very comfortable and very clean, beautiful toiletries and bath salts! However I still believe the room prices to be too high for the standard. Afternoon tea was very enjoyable, food and desserts were delicious!",5,2016,08,09
207,Suspended from the Grande Dame's until further notice.,"We stayed here on a work incentive and I extended with my 15 year old Daughter - as The Shelbourne IS Dublin! Alas, this review is based on the expectation that this is 'The Grande Dame of Dublin' & is compared with other City Grande Dame's - the Metropole of Hanoi, Raffles of Singapore, The Oriental of Bangkok, The Baglioni of Florence, The Plaza of NY. So, so sadly, 'The Shelbourne' is suspended from this list until further notice. As a boy, I loved this hotel, so much, it pains me to comment negatively. I hope this review will help them make some tough decisions to get back to where this gorgeous property belongs. Currently it is badly deceived by a Management team that clearly do not appreciate the cultural importance and attention to detail that should be a minimal standard - the experience for my Daughter and I (and others) was shockingly shameful. I won't list everything but half eaten mouldy sandwiches in the fridge left from previous guests, multiple unanswered calls to the 'Desk Manager', room service meals that were clearly ""Tesco's Finest"" (possibly ""Value""). Generally a heartbreaking experience for a Grand Dame that deserves so much more respect. Martin Burke - sorry to disturb you. ",1,2016,08,08
207,Still the most iconic hotel. In Dublin ,"Just spent a night in the shelbourne and again  have been blown away with this amazing hotel.  It's simply beautiful, full of history and very luxuriously in decor. When we checked in we were upgraded which was a lovely surprise. Rooms are not huge but that is well forgotten once you see and enjoy beautiful ambience of the room. Only small criticism woylf be the yv size was smsll. Could do with a min 42"" . The bars are amazing and a great place to have lunch and people watch. We did not eat in the Saddle room but have done many times in the past and love it. Once again you surpass yourself. We will be back
 10/10 ",5,2016,08,06
207,Very friendly,"Experience right from check in to check out was awesome. A blemish less stay, if there could ever be one. A room with a balcony would have helped a smoker like me and since it was not to be, have a suggestion to create a small alcove to let smokers sit and smoke in peace. And our family was large, 5 adults and 2 kids..3 rooms in total. Don't miss our on breakfast spread",5,2016,08,06
207,"Location, Location, Location","This hotel is in walking distance to everything you want to see in Dublin. It reeks of history, yet has been kept up to date with nice bathrooms, etc. I must admit, I'm a bit of a sucker for these grand old hotels. I mean, they have a video in the reception area showing visits by Rock Hudson, Grace Kelly, Cary Grant ...

We found the service to be very accommodating -- they even provided a feather free room. And, they provide Marriott points. ",5,2016,08,06
207,Great location!,We stayed here for 2 nights with kids aged 11 and 8.  The location was great.  We walked around a lot which is how we like to get around when possible.  Very handy to many great restaurants and sights.  We also all had a great sleep.  The service was just ok....  I expected a lot more for the price and everything  I had heard about the Shelbourne.  We found much friendlier and better service in other Irish hotels during our 2 week stay.,4,2016,08,05
207,Service not as promised!,"Stayed 4 nights in a suite over the Bank holiday weekend.
Checked in around 1130 am and guest relations was able to procure a room for my family by 1230 pm-appreciated that

The hotel is very busy over the weekend and there was no place to sit in the main bar. Service in the smaller bar was very slow and the server served the drinks after a long wait and then disappeared and forget to serve a bowl of nuts that we saw on the other tables

During the 4 nights that I stayed, I noticed that that the service in bar was slow as they are very busy and do not have enough staff, waited  20 min one night before the server came to our table

Breakfast is worth it in the morning 
It is a buffet and there is no wait time

The rooms are dated and will probably need a makeover 
The bed and pillow are very luxurious and comfortable.
There are not enough plugs to charge phones/devices etc. esp. In the bedroom 

Concierge esp. Dennis was very helpful 
This hotel is not a perfect fit for people with disabilities or mobility problems
The front entrance has no ramp.
I am a Gold member on Marriott but for reasons that the check-in could not explain, my membership status did not show when I checked in. I went back later to ensure the above and was given a standard letter welcoming elite members
On enquiring, I was informed that the hotel did not have an executive lounge 
My Marriott awards number did not show up on my invoice when I checked out!
The fitness center is small and has only treadmills, elliptical, bikes and weights

Afternoon tea was relaxing and enjoyable 
The hotel is very central and one can walk around in St Stephens Gardens which are opposite 
There are some great restaurants in the neighborhood 

For the room rate I was charged, the hotel did not live up to my expectations ",3,2016,08,04
207,Still the best hotel in Dublin ,"I have been fortunate to stay at this magnificent hotel on numerous occasions. The staff are so helpful the rooms/suite are very luxurious and comfortable,location is perfect. You pay for what you get,although you are the heart of Dublin the hotel does not reflect the bustling noise outside. It's by far the best hotel I've stayed in,the food is superb and I would be very fussy on food and presentation. I have visited the spa here and it is just amazing a lovely area to relax. It would definitely be a hotel to stay if you are giving yourself a little treat especially at Christmas time. I stay here quite frequent and I would stay in any other hotel in Dublin. Can't wait to return again.",5,2016,08,04
207,The grand old lady  of Dublin. ,This is  the finest and most beautiful  hotel in Dublin. The atmosphere is of quiet elegance. Relax in one of the beautiful  bars. Have a  drink or a light lunch.  The old Horseshoe  bar is a timeless bit of local history. ,5,2016,08,04
207,great city hotel,"The front desk staff and the doormen are very helpful and very friendly.  It's always busy but easy to get around, however they took away half the lobby to do some renovations.  Overall a very nice stay",4,2016,08,03
207,Sunday afternoon relax ,"Not normally a visitor to the Shelbourne but it proved a handy spot as the rain came down. However on entering the bar we were pleasantly surprised to find a live jazz band.
And there were tables available. We ordered some cocktails and enjoyed the music and the complimentary nuts.
Definitively with it for the relaxed ambience and live music",4,2016,08,03
207,Still hard to beat ,"Another wonderful stay in the Shelbourne. It's one of Dublin's oldest and historic hotels, which is key part of its charm, but it never fails to deliver to the highest standards. Stayed in a beautifully appointed Double King room with full size bath room. High prices with a pint of Guinness setting you back a massive €6.40 by Dublin prices and breakfast costing a whopping €29 each - but worth it so go hungry! 

The hotel is minutes from some of Dublin's best tourist, dining and shopping attractions - right on St Stephens Green. 

From dropping the car with the valet, check in was seamless and our room was immediately available at 12:30pm - unusual for this hotel as it is normally very busy and typically full at the weekends. 

The hotel was recently featured on a TV program which has probably contributed to its popularity with very high occupancy rates. So expect it to be busy however this is where the Shelbourne separates itself from others in Dublin - you always feel they give that little bit more attention and service just to you to make you feel special and part of the Shelbourne family. ",5,2016,08,02
207,"Great location, historic hotel","Beautiful hotel walking distance to everything. I loved the museum room where you could find old hotel registers and bookkeeping journals. Rooms were comfortable but small. The rooms felt more like a mid priced Marriott than rest of hotel. Recommended if you can find a great deal on room. If you are looking for luxury, you might be disappointed ",4,2016,08,01
207,Pamper yourself,"This is a first class hotel in a prime location in central Dublin.  While we found it because it is a Marriott, the level of personalized service really distinguish this hotel beyond what you'd expect at an international chain.  All the staff with whom we interacted were a notch above....exceptionally cordial, helpful and polished.  (A special ""thank you"" to the front manager, Daireann!)  Our room was luxurious...a perfect place to bounce back from jetlag upon arriving in Ireland.",5,2016,07,31
207,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel is beautiful, the staff were very helpful and cheerful.  We had a lovely room overlooking the park, the bed was very comfortable, breakfast was great.  Very nice pool.  So why only 4 stars? Small things but at this price everything should be perfect; the shower wasn't great, pressure was low and controls didn't work properly and no extractor in bathroom.  The breakfast is great but the bacon was always over cooked and hard.  I'd definitely stay here again though.",4,2016,07,30
207,Great location!,"Not only was this hotel in the perfect location, the staff was exceptional, they could not do enough for us. We loved the pool and workout facility. We enjoyed high tea but thought once was enough, it was very pricey. Breakfast was wonderful and they were accommodating for my dairy free diet. 
I wish the lobby was larger as you enter the hotel, that would be the only suggestion I would make!",5,2016,07,28
207,Truly a grand hotel,"We stayed two nights at the Shelbourne, and from the minute you enter the door it's old world elegance.  It has been renovated, and there are some renovations going on right now, but the staff is outstanding.  The public areas are elegant and our deluxe category room is very comfortable and well appointed.  We are on 5th floor, overlooking some buildings rather than St. Stephen Green, but that's the price point we have.  Location is great, next to Trinity College and many historic & political buildings, plus close to shopping.  The hop on, hop off bus is right across the street at St. Stephen's Green.  We took the Coach Bus from the airport to the hotel and it was a very short walk around the corner to the entrance of the hotel.  They checked our bags for us while we took the bus to get an over view of Dublin.",5,2016,07,28
207,"Simply charming, not to be missed.","Location is great. Bed is perfect.  Service is flawless. 

Marriott rewards members in particular would be foolish to miss this hotel whilst touring Europe. The service is very highly personalized, five-star at three-star prices. Just tell them what you're hoping for, and they'll make it happen.  Breakfast is delicious, lots of cook to order selections and the buffet is well kept and generous. 

The main bar was fantastic people watching, too. After a day of sightseeing this grand old hotel is a wonderful place to retire for the evening. 

Just go!",5,2016,07,28
207,"Historic gem, but pricey","Nice location.  Famous hotel.  Across from St Stephens Green - Dublin's ""Central Park.""
Great concierge.  Classy, well-run afternoon tea- Was a highlight of 3 weeks in Europe.
Rooms extremely well-appointed and comfortable.  With complimentary water, tea and Nespresso coffee in our rooms (don't know if that's standard).  We walked everywhere from the hotel.",5,2016,07,27
207,Luxurious,"In front of Saint Stephen Green you find this exclusive hotel which belong to Marriot. Absolutely unique and luxurious. Huge rooms, great service and yummy restaurants. Close to Grafton Street and best museums",5,2016,07,27
207,beautiful,very good. nice people great value and very helpful with your luggage i would recomend this hotel to all familes and couples and people who want a break away from home and want a bit of pampering in a happy place.,5,2016,07,27
207,"If you can afford it, go.","Maybe my favorite hotel in the world, location, service, especially Dennis the concierge, breakfast is not as good as before, prices in the bars is crazy, $60 per person for high tea. $500 a night for a nice room, but I always hate to leave.",5,2016,07,26
207,Fantastic Location!,"When attending the Beyoncé Concert in Dublin on the 9th July,my sisters and I chose this hotel for our accommodation and we were not to be disappointed! One of Dublin's most iconic hotels offered great service,great food and a great location. Upon check in we where upgraded to a suite which provided superb space and an extensively appointed bathroom,alongside the most comfortable bedding. The valet parking is efficient and competitively priced. During our stay we visited the No.27 and Horseshoe bars with an impressive offering of drinks with knowledgable service from staff. The Salon offers a unique and pampering oasis, my blow dry and pedicure where perfectly done,the girls there are fantastic! The Shelbourne offers a truly amazing experience, and can be highly recommended!",5,2016,07,26
207,Afternoon tea ,"Had afternoon tea for my birthday and it was so so so good, the attention to detail was breathtaking, staff made us feel Very important I can't wait to go again and thank you for my birthday plate, the background music was perfect without being intrusive best afternoon tea ever ",5,2016,07,26
207,"The building shines, but the staff needs polishing","Marriott touts The Shelbourne as a five star hotel.  In our mind that puts it on par with The Ritz, however that was not the experience we had.  The Hotel is grand with lots of character, interesting artwork on every wall, and is in a fabulous location...the staff just doesn't live up to what one would expect from The Shelbourne's reputation.

We traveled from the States for the Dublin Horse Show.  Having flown overnight, landed in Belfast and driven to Dublin (2 hrs) we desperately needed a nap.  There was a crowd at reception even though there were 4 or 5 people working behind the desk, so we had to wait about 20 minutes before we were able to begin the check-in process.  Being a Marriott rewards member, we were able to get a room right away.  However, it was on a side hallway behind the spa, and the only room on that side of the hallway.  The room was elegant, well-appointed, European proportions (not huge) and the bed was delightful.  Being tucked away where it was with a window to a small courtyard, opening the window did little to cool the room, so we used the air conditioning.  

After napping and trying to adjust to the time difference we decided even though it was late, a walk and some food would be a good idea. 

We stopped by the concierge, he had to hear us walking across the lobby, but didn't look up even though I was standing in front of him.  Once he acknowledged us, he clearly indicated it was an effort to answer our question as to where to get a bite to eat and a drink. Admittedly it was about 11:30 pm local time, but this is a hotel in a major city that is used to international clients, especially those arriving and adjusting to the time difference.  He said that there really wasn't anything that would still be open.  We were perplexed, it was a Friday night and we were in the capital of Ireland, we didn't think it completely shut down at midnight.  *A note:  the concierge was not Irish, unlike the Ritz, the Shelbourne does not include city/country on the worker's name tag, so I can't say where he was from.

We ventured out anyway and found plenty of pubs, and clubs bustling with activity.  The problem we encountered was that they were crowded and we didn't feel like elbowing up to the bar.  We returned to the Shelbourne and went into The No. 27 Bar & Lounge.  The server said they were closing, but we could go across the lobby to the Lord Mayor's Lounge which was open for residents of the hotel.  We availed ourselves of this opportunity and had a drink and some nuts (see separate review). 

We decided to go get some sleep so we could be up early for the Horse Show.  Unfortunately during the night, we were awakened by a dripping noise.  The A/C had leaked and soaked the carpet enough that each drip was clearly heard.  

We let the front desk know as we headed to breakfast in the Saddle Room.  By the time we finished breakfast and returned to the room, someone from maintenance was already working to fix the air conditioning.

We didn't realize until we returned after a day at the Horse Show and dinner, but the ""fixing"" of the air conditioning was such that it no longer really cooled the room.  The bed was still comfortable even if the temperature wasn't and we were exhausted.  We left early the next morning to head back to Belfast.",3,2016,07,26
207,Brillient experience,"Attended a concert in town with my wife and decided to spalsh out on the Shelboure for a night. Just brill, everything about the experience was first class. From check in to check out everything was definitly first class and could not find fault in any way.",5,2016,07,26
207,We love it !,"It's a beautiful hotel in a fabulous location.  The staff are highly trained and attentive.   The rooms are spotless and well appointed.  The public areas are just beautiful.  I cannot fault it - stay here when you visit Dublin, you can't possibly be disappointed !  ",5,2016,07,26
207,Wonderful stay at the Shelbourne!,"This is a fantastic hotel - it oozes character and class, from the tasteful rooms, to the lovely bar, to the professional staff. The room was great with an incredibly comfortable bed and a very large bathroom. The hotel is in a perfect location with easy access to many historic sites, shopping, and restaurants in Dublin. The breakfast in the morning was plentiful and you could order from a menu or do a buffet. We also had a family dinner in one of the private dining rooms and the food was excellent.",5,2016,07,26
207,Honeymoon stay,"We booked our first honeymoon night in Dublin at The Shelbourne as a bit of a treat. 
Beautiful entrance lobby, friendly staff and efficient service but both my husband and I were slightly underwhelmed with the room. 
It was rather pokey, had a terrible view but my biggest complaint was the mattress-quite an important part of a hotel stay. It can only be described as being filled with cement. Neither of us slept well because of it and we were left very disappointed especially considering the price as its a 5* hotel. My husband stays in 4&5* hotels continuously with work and he admitted its the most uncomfortable he's stayed in. 
The day we checked out we found the baggage staff rather aloof and uninterested in serving us. We only stayed in a 4* hotel on the second night and it was so much more comfortable by comparison. I'm afraid we won't be returning in future. ",3,2016,07,25
207,Landmark hotel oozing personality and charm 💖,"We recently enjoyed a two break to celebrate a sisters milestone birthday and our stay at the Shelbourne was perfect. Upon check-inn we were greeted by welcoming staff and ungraded to a suite which was greatly appreciated.  The suite was spacious and homely but in keeping with the period of the building 👌🏼. The hotel itself is beautiful, full of charter and personality. The hotel offers a wonderful spa and salon which is a must if you have time while visiting. 

The hotel overlooks St Stephens Green and is perfectly located to the shops on Grafton Street and the upmarket bars and restaurants on Dawson Street. 

This is most definitely a five star hotel offering five star service and I look forward to returning very soon.",5,2016,07,25
207,Trip North,"I did not stay at the hotel as it was full due to the Horse Show.  I did walk by and noticed the sign for afternoon tea so I booked a table for 1 for the next day.

What a wonderful, civilized and delightful afternoon Tea.  Enjoyed champagne with the full tea, a lovely black Chinese Tea. They had a pianist for the brunch and one could stay for one and half hours for ones reservation. The items offered were quite tasty and chef offered a cute twist on the  Alice in Wonderland. 

The hotel is beautiful and one did not need a jacket and tie for the tea but sports attire is not welcome",5,2016,07,25
207,Very impresive,"First time of staying and yes probably the best of all the hotels we have stayed at in Dublin over the past few years.
Very attentive staff knowledgable about the area and always willing to help.
Room was very clean and well maintained, turn down service included.
Yes a little pricy but you are only here once.",5,2016,07,25
207,GO BACK IN TIME IN THIS 5*HOTEL,"Stayed here recently and to be honest it was not my first time staying here. We as a family have visited The Shelbourne Hotel 3 times in as many years. 
We checked in as normal albeit a little early and low and behold our room was ready and we were whisked in to our garden view room. These rooms and large and take you back in time with Stephens Green Park across the way you could envisage horse drawn coaches top hats etc walking the street below. 
The food here in the Saddle room is to die for and with a service second to none and all of this while doting in our children. From the greeting by the Doorman on arrival to the farewell from the staff you will always want to return. One regret is I missed Afternoon Tea and my Daughter was not happy that she did not get to have her lovely sandwiches as she calls them. 
WE WILL BE BACK VERY SOON SHELBOURNE HOTEL. ",5,2016,07,25
207,Outstanding service - highly recommend,"We recently stayed over for four nights over a weekend.  Hotel staff were excellent.  I had an injured leg and staff brought ice packs to the room for me and tracked down a physiotherapist for me close by.  Restaurant recommendations were great as well.   Concierge made the weekend for us. 

The hotel has a  beautiful bar area that always was hopping.  Great atmosphere. Had breakfast at the hotel.  Food was good but like all buffets a little pricing.  There was a breakfast restaurant close by that was more reasonable that was also great and so you could mix it up.  

We'll be back.  ",5,2016,07,24
207,Super Swanky City Hotel,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for a couple of nights for a recent business trip.

The hotel is quite impressive - from the moment the top hat wearing doorman ushers you through the revolving front doors you are in world of luxury that is stunning, even by five star hotel standards.  The public areas are all gloriously opulent.  This is certainly hotel to be seen in - and many of the public areas are crowded with people who are there for exactly that reason.

The location of this hotel is unbeatable.  Right on the beautiful Stephen's Green, a stones throw from the shops of Grafton Street and a 15 minute walk to Temple Bar.

My room was also beautifully furnished, but I was very, very surprised at just how small it was.  There was a good sized king bed, but the bathroom was very small (no bath, only a shower) and (if memory serves me correctly) there wasn't much in the way of storage.  I do like to unpack my suitcase for any stay, so this was something of an inconvenience.  I'm sure the room I got was exactly what was advertised (and what I paid for) but its surprising to see such small rooms in such a luxurious hotel. Most of the rooms in this hotel are also not going to have much in the way of a view.  My room faced on to a fairly grim looking courtyard, as did many others.  Only a relatively small portion will face St Stephens Green.

I liked the Shelbourne - its certainly an experience to stay here.  That said, if space is important, I think there may be better luxury options in Dublin - The Westin and Marker are good alternatives - though those come with their own compromises.",4,2016,07,24
207,Will stay here again!,"Only had one night in Dublin at this lovely hotel. It had a old world feel, but with modern comforts. With our package we had free oysters & Guinness, since we're not big oyster fans we were able to substitute the food and have a ""free"" lunch. The staff, starting with Doireann, gave us a warm welcome and were very helpful during our stay. If we get a chance to go back to Dublin, we will definitely stay here again!",4,2016,07,23
207,Apparent luxury ... But at a price,Visited overnight in May for a concert - unfortunately the company was guilty of gouging as regards pricing and certainly for me did not deliver on the promise of the brand I.e. That of The Shelbourne as an iconic luxury location in Dublin and the Renaissance brand that I recognise worldwide.  Staff excellent and very friendly as expected but the twin room was pokey and had absolutely nothing to it - may as well not have had that window as there was nothing to see.  Had breakfast outside rather than waste money ... Disappointing and aggravating given the situation ...,3,2016,07,23
207,The Lovely Valeria,"Had a few girly drinks in the bar here on Wednesday.  Our waitress Valeria was so nice we had to give her our compliments.  She was exactly what you would like in a waitress, friendly, efficient and looked after us so well while we were there.  Hang on to her as she is a great ambassador for The Shelbourne, mannerly and a 5 star waitress.",5,2016,07,22
207,Lap of luxury in the best location,"From the moment you're greeted at the door to the time you depart, you're treated like royalty! Spectacular rooms within a magnificent hotel serviced by staff that embody the best in customer service!  If I could live here - I would!",5,2016,07,21
207,Outstanding,"Me and my wife like to travel to Ireland as often as possible. We have stayed in various places mostly Dublin and Belfast but the shelbourne was a hotel that stood out amongst all others. We were greeted by the friendly concierge who took our bags to our room , we were checked in within five minutes even considering we arrived earlier then Expeceted we had a nice bottle  of white waiting for us. The food was good. . The afternoon tea according to my wife was spectacular (not my thing but still enjoyed) , I wouldn't know the difference. All in all we had a very pleasurable relaxing experience . And my main concern in any hotel was that every single staff member was friendly and pleasant. The only down fall was the building works but we seen past that as there was no fault in anything else . Mark",4,2016,07,21
207,This is the place to stay when visiting Dublin!,What a nice place right in the heart of Dublin.  The room was nicely appointed.  The staff was awesome…. There was a huge park right across the street.  We loved our oyster/Guinness pairing which took place in the hotel bar with was happening with energy and music.  Turn down service each evening.  I am truly glad we selected this property!  You MUST try the spa also ;),5,2016,07,21
207,Birthday Treat ,Celebrated special birthday here. Staff heard my Mum saying Happy Birthday to me and brought a plate of treats out for me. So lovely and thoughtful. Staff very friendly and helpful. Lovely atmosphere. Magical. Can't wait to go back. Cocktails powerful! ,5,2016,07,21
207,Somewhat Comfortable,"Let me start with the good.  Hotel is quite lovely with great charm and decor.  Location is fairly central and close walking distance to many attractions.  If you are looking for some of the best authentic Irish pubs, just down the street is Toner's & O'Donoghues.
  
Now the bad.  I felt service was lacking and was very unimpressed.  I had originally booked another hotel in Dublin but changed my mind after hearing such great things about this hotel.  One day room service never even came to our room.  Additionally we had come back to the hotel for a night drink in the lounge to enjoy the live music.  Staff came over to give us a menu and after 10 mins of them not returning we got up and left.  Staff appeared to be busy with some paperwork, but they were right near us.  I kept staring and trying to get their attention to no avail.  

I had such high expectations and unfortunately I was let down",3,2016,07,21
207,"Historic hotel, good service, great location","Just returned from three nights in Dublin staying at The Shelbourne, a Renaissance Hotel.  Nice bonus is that you can use or accumulate Marriott points there.  Check-in was a breeze, mid-day one room was ready, the other ready by the standard check-in time of 3pm.  This is a historic property, dating to 1842, well-maintained, pretty posh, great restaurant and bars, fantastic location to Grafton Street and central Dublin.  We only used the restaurant for breakfast but the buffet selection was abundant and the food quite good.  Standard rooms were a bit tight but not more so than in hotels of the same calibre in other major European cities.  Both of our rooms were on an inner courtyard, so very quiet at night, and we can't speak to how noisy the street-facing rooms might be.  The location by St. Stephen's Green is quite busy.  Only complaint for the rooms might be that the shower was outsized but the sink too low and lacking sufficient room for toiletries and cosmetics.  Had to actually use the blow dryer in the room itself due to no outlet in the bathroom.  In the evenings, the bar to the left of the lobby is quite lively and appears to be the place to see and be seen but we always found a spot to sit.  All in all, this is a great hotel in Dublin and we will absolutely stay there again.",5,2016,07,20
207,Old world awesomeness with Modern Grandeur,"Seriously.  This place is the hotel to stay in.  Not only was it the love of Marie Carroll's art work, but the food, the service, and No. 27 drink were all amazing.  The staff are so accommodating to change and adaptable it was lovely.  We could have stayed here forever.  Our 4 year old was treated as an adult and made it quite a magical stay.  I'll be coming back.",5,2016,07,17
207,Wedding,My Nephew had his wedding der yesterday had a Fantastic day Hotel is Fabulous Staff are Brilliant couldn't do enough for us we were all treated like Royalty food was fantastic the day was Brilliant from start to finish ,5,2016,07,17
207,Loved this hotel,"This is a fabulous historic hotel. The room was clean and the hotel is in a good location within 1-2 km of most sites in Dublin. 

We checked in on the Marriott app (iPhone) the day before our arrival and our room was ready at 11am. I recommend doing this if you're arriving early!",5,2016,07,17
207,Underwhelmed,"The room we reserved was not available upon check-in.  Needed to relocate on day two.  No follow-up call to confirm the move.  Required us to ask several times if the room was ready and when could a move take place.  

Good location, good food, average service.  The concierge was very helpful.  

Net net, poor value for the price.  Would not choose this property on a return trip",3,2016,07,16
207,I would return to Dublin just to stay here!,"We stayed on Marriott points, and it is THE BEST USE of points ever. This hotel has it all.  Fantastic location, excellent service, comfortable beds, gorgeous rooms, a great bar, and atmosphere.  We only stayed one night, which I regret. We disembarked from a cruise so we arrived early in the morning and our room was not available, which we expected.  We stored our bags and explored the area after having a complimentary drink at the bar. (My husband is platinum and that might be why we got them?) 

The bar is beautiful and airy, the service is friendly and attentive, and when we returned later, the prices were reasonable. :)

We were upgraded at check in to a stunning and expansive suite with an old fireplace, a large bathroom with a towel warmer, and a bedroom with a bed so comfortable I did not want to leave it.  

In the lobby, there was a small room with some history of the hotel and a guest book.  It is steeped in history and atmosphere.  All of the staff were amazing, friendly, and helpful.  

This was one of our best stays at a hotel anywhere in the world.  It's a pity it was only for one night. 

We were given free breakfast but did not have time to enjoy it so I can't speak of the restaurant. 
The free wifi worked great. 
The only oddity was that we could not find an electrical outlet in the bathroom to use the hairdryer. Not a big deal tho.  

The blackout drapes worked splendidly and although our room faced the street, we were not bothered by noise.  I did not hear a peep out of any other hotel guests and the hotel was sold out. I am a very light sleeper and I slept like a baby, which is unusual for me in a hotel. 

I recommend a visit to St. Stephens across the street.  It is a lovely park with a lot of Irish history and was an enjoyable time. 
The location is close walking distance to Temple Bar and especially Trinity College. We only used a taxi to get to the airport.  It was a simply remarkable stay.",5,2016,07,15
207,Just Wonderful,"I travel to Ireland for work quite often and always try to stay at The Shelbourne. It exudes quality, and attention is paid to every detail. The rooms are fantastic, the food is excellent, and the service is second to none.
If I had to complain about anything, and it's not really a complaint, it would be to say that their newly installed in-room entertainment system is very slow to respond at certain times of the day - probably due to multiple guests using it at the same time. But that is not a reason to fault this excellent location.",5,2016,07,15
207,Great Central Location - Hostorical Location,"This is a great hotel in a great location.  it is walking distance to everything and just a few hundred meters away from the Temple Bar scene.  The staff is courteous and well engaged.  the rooms are a good size and have been updated, yet they have not lost the old world feel.  I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,15
207,Exceptional!,"While the hotel is expensive, it was a wonderful place to stay. Beautiful with very good service. Breakfast which was included in our rate was outstanding. Great location. Had lots of charm. Formal but not stuffy.",5,2016,07,15
207,Wonderful for a special mother-daughter afternoon,"During our recent trip to Dublin, my 12-year-old daughter and I had a wonderful time at tea at the Shelbourne. The women who work in the tea room were so gracious and kind, and the elegant room and pianist added to the experience. It was a treat to have champagne for me and cups of elegant tea, beautiful plates of sandwiches and cakes, and a relaxing moment together during a busy trip (while my husband watched the European football match at a pub nearby). The Wonderland theme was playful and fun. I can recommend this experience with no hesitation. Thanks to the staff at the Shelbourne for an afternoon to remember. We'll be back!",5,2016,07,13
207,Afternoon tea in the lounge,"While visiting Dublin we came for afternoon tea at the Lord Mayor's Lounge, although we did not stay at this hotel. We enjoyed a great selection of sandwiches, scones and cakes together with large amounts of freshly brewed tea. The lounge has a relaxed old world atmosphere and the staff is friendly and attentive. Booking in advance may be needed some days.",5,2016,07,13
207,Continental Charm,"This old, fully renovated classic was a delight.  It might look stuffy, but it was comfortable and deluxe.  The staff was simply wonderful: welcoming and friendly, despite their formal dress.  The rooms were top-of-the-line, with classy touches like towels on the floor near the bedside at turn-down.  The buffet breakfast (expensive if not included in your room-rate) was enormous and delicious.  It's on the pricey side, but has a fabulous location in the best part of town near all the major sights.  We quickly got over the formality of the lobby and starting feeling right at home.",5,2016,07,13
207,Luxury without stuffiness,"Our stay in this elegant hotel was highlighted by excellent service, extremely comfortable beds and room, and wonderful concierge staff. The breakfast buffet was also above average. Especially helpful was the pre purchase of tickets to see the Book of Kells and the ""hop on hop off"" bus, which is an excellent way to get oriented to the city.",5,2016,07,12
207,A Luxurious Experience in the Heart of Dublin,"I stayed in the Shelbourne hotel in February of this year for one night with my family; one member with business in the College of Surgeons, and the rest of us for leisure. The decision to stay here was primarily because of the location; which we had walked passed several times on previous visits to Dublin, and we thought it looked very nice indeed from the outside. The final factor on this trip which drove our stay was by a recent TV documentary on Irish television, which featured the hotel.

Location: Judging this depends on what exactly it is you want to be close to in Dublin; the hotel is located on St. Stephen's Green, a well-known and central area in the city. The College of Surgeons is also on St. Stephen's Green, hence our choice for the business aspect of the trip. For the rest of my family, shopping and walking around the city centre was the key. To walk to the top of Grafton street (which runs into St. Stephen's Green), it takes less than five minutes. In this regard for us, the location of the hotel was excellent. To walk to the other main shopping street in the centre, which is Henry street, it takes about 15 minutes, as this requires traversing down Grafton Street, and crossing the River Liffey to O'Connell Street.

Hotel: The hotel property and building is elegant, bright, and luxurious. The front entrance is particularly nice and welcoming, as you walk in the doors into the grand front lobby with a high ceiling and the famous Grand Staircase facing you! The reception lobby is then located further back, and is also spacious. Unusually, it features a small museum room with historical Irish items of interest, including a copy of (a draft if I recall correctly) the Constitution of the Irish Republic, which makes for a fascinating look, albeit behind glass! The hotel also features a very good range of dining and drinking options, from fine dining in The Saddle Room, to lunch options in the No. 27 Bar and Lounge, and the Lord Mayer's Lounge. The Dubliners used to attend here apparently, and some photos and memorabilia of them is featured. The hotel also features a florist just off from the Lobby; it just so happened to be Valentines weekend, and they had some lovely bouquets of Red Roses available, which we arranged to have delivered as a surprise to us on leaving the hotel as a surprise for someone in the family!

Rooms: We had two rooms with Queen Size beds, and these two rooms joined via an interconnecting door. They were both very nice and clean, with a classical kind of decor, rather than modern, but well featured with all expected modern facilities. You could get rooms at the front of the hotel overlooking St. Stephen's Green, but we had requested rooms away from the front to avoid any possible noise, so we were at the back of the hotel, facing into the back of an office block, where everyone could be seen working at their desks. This made the rooms a little dark. Also, the rooms were also a little small, with not much excess clearance between the bed and the desk/dressing table. There was a chair and a small table in each room as one would expect, and this also cluttered up the small space somewhat. The rooms and beds are very cosy and comfortable though, had a wonderful sleep! The only real complaint is that it was February and very cold in Dublin; despite setting the air conditioning to the hottest setting, the air that came into the room was only slightly warm, so the rooms were cool in the morning.

Staff: All the staff we encountered at the hotel were very accommodating, friendly, welcoming, and cannot be faulted! 

Dining: We had dinner on the evening we arrived in The Saddle Room, breakfast in the same, and then lunch in the No. 27 Bar and Restaurant. Dinner in The Saddle Room was superb; a lovely restaurant setting, not very busy so the atmosphere was quiet and very pleasant. The waiting staff were very attentive. I for one had a Pumpkin soup to start, very rich in flavour, along with a Trout dish as the main, which was cooked to perfection. My other dining partners had a steak dish as their main, which I'm told was also cooked better than some of the steakhouses of London we have visited. All dishes were very well presented and garnished finely. The breakfast featured both a buffet with a very wide choice, as well as chefs who could prepare something from the menu. Waiter service was also in full swing for this. I'm not a breakfast person really, and stuck with a cereal, no complaints from me. Hot toast though which is always good! The lunch in the No. 27 Bar and Restaurant was obviously very popular, and from where we were sitting, sometimes it took the waiting staff a while to spot us. I just had a Shelbourne Fish and Chips, which was delicious. My family had a very nice selection of toasted club sandwiches, which I tried, and were also delicious.

Overall: I have no meaningful cons for our stay aside from the cool air conditioning in our rooms; if I was staying again, we would definitely ask for a room at the front of the hotel, which should make the rooms brighter, and feature a better view. One member of my family thought that it didn't live up to what was featured on the TV documentary, but reasoned that only big Suites had been featured on that; she was disappointed with the room not being more spacious, and she also thought the entrance lobby looked much smaller and not-so grand in real-life. I for one thought the lobby was fantastically spacious, and disagree with that view. I do agree with her on the rooms we stayed in that they felt a little cramped, but I'm sure we could have paid for bigger rooms. All in all though, The Shelbourne was a beautiful luxury hotel, and we will definitely return the next time we are in Dublin, and would have no problems recommending the experience to anyone!",5,2016,07,11
207,Wish we could've stayed here.,"Just stopped to look around and it's almost like a museum. Denis the concierge was pleasant, funny, very helpful and full of knowledge. We felt like close friends after about 5 minutes and he had great suggestions for every stop on our itinerary.",5,2016,07,10
207,Is it me or you?,"Not sure if it's me or the hotel but we just don't gel! I think it's me though as once i've classed the place into the ""there's carpet on the walls"" category it's very hard for it to redeem itself.

The entrance to the lobby is grand as you'd expect and the interior of all common places very luxurious. The room is likewise furnished in a way that most people would call stylish but that I find less then perfect. Renaissance style chairs that looks as if they're from a movie set but are awkward to sit in, large pillows everywhere that look nice in a furniture catalog but just get in the way if you try to do anything. Etc. etc. I realise I should probably focus more on modern styled establishments!

Breakfast was very nice but there was a huge queue to get in in the morning and if the place is sold out, or close to it, definitely something to keep in mind and check in advance what the quiet hours are as I'm sure you'll have better things to do in Dublin then spent 45min waiting in line first thing in the morning.",3,2016,07,10
207,Alice in wonderland,"We enjoyed a beautiful high tea in the grand room. The cakes were so nicely decorated to the theme and were delicious with hidden secret surprises. The time went by so fast, beautiful memories. Thanks to all the servers and bakers. The jug of 'drink me ' liquid was a nice topper.",5,2016,07,09
207,Marvelous,"They treated us like royalty. Our room was elegant and the bathroom huge with all the ammenities. Very nice staff, always helped us get a taxi, and the hotel is so well located. You can walk or bus to all the main attractions. Highly recommend!",5,2016,07,09
207,Great property but air conditioning was an issue,"Our room was too hot two out of three nights.  The air conditioning wasn't working properly.  Breakfast was very nice.  Shelbourne Benedict was a pleasure to enjoy...like eggs benedict except with steak instead of ham.
The hotel is located right in the middle of everything in downtown and that was good.",4,2016,07,09
207,Rather disappointing,"Spent a couple of nights here, expecting great things.  Not to be.  A very fussy check-in, with porters and doormen tripping over themselves.  Shown to a minute double room on the 7th floor, appeared to have the air-con unit directly overhead.  Room was well appointed tho', fab shower and excellent toiletries.  
BIG disappointment was the breakfast.  A local lad served us in the restaurant the first morning, could not have been more attentive and charming.  We both ordered Eggs Benedict - not great.  Muffin, 2 nicely poached eggs, lovely hollandaise, but what should have been ham was crisp, hard slivers of bacon.  
Next morning the restaurant was full, so we were shown into the bar.  Several females, dressed in black, too cool for school, and definitely above serving guests were hanging about.  Hubby went for the hot buffet, and it looked good.  Scrambled eggs, pudding, mushrooms, etc.  I asked for 1 slice of French Toast, with a piece of bacon.  2 massive slices from a bloomer loaf arrived, soaked in uncooked egg, only fried on one side, so not crisp, brown and soggy, then dusted in icing sugar.  The bacon had been deep fried, and was like a floor tile.  Just revolting! After 2 mouthfuls I pushed it aside.  The females drifted past a few times, but eventually one of them came to ask if it was finished.  I said it wasn't very nice. She said ""Oh"". And all this for £200 per night.  I don't think so!!!",3,2016,07,08
207,Not what I imagined,"I'm writing from the front, as it were, as I am presently a guest at this hotel. I come to Dublin for work fairly often--and have often stopped by the Shelbourne for a drink, thinking it would be fun to stay here. Since this trip, with my partner, is for vacation, I'd thought we'd give it a shot. I love historic hotels, expect them to be quirky, and am not anticipating the same experience as a newly built Four Seasons. However, this property is a serious disappointment.
We checked in to a Queen room, which I had booked. However, the room is diminutive. It might work for one person for an overnighter--but not two for several days. In all my years of staying in older hotels, including the likes of the Drake in Chicago, St. Regis in Rome, or the Brown Palace in Denver, I've never seen the likes of this. There was actually nowhere to unpack our clothes--no bureau or wardrobe--for 390 Euros a night! We could barely walk around the bed.
Fortunately, the staff--who are marvelous!--upgraded us to a larger room for a nominal fee. I will say that the new room is wonderfully quiet. 
Then yesterday we returned after a beautiful, warm day in Dublin, to find our room like an oven. The air conditioner was broken throughout the entire hotel. I'm not big on a/c, but when you can't open the window you need some air. Twelves hours later--and after a night of little sleep--the a/c is still broken and I think it's time to head to the Westin!
Bottom line: This hotel is truly historic, with a great role in Ireland's history. Come for a drink and enjoy the ambiance. Just don't check in.",3,2016,07,08
207,Very Disappointed,Myself and two friends stayed in the hotel recently and I have to say I was very disappointed with my experience.  I had a gift voucher for €300 which I might add was a year and a half old so had expired but I explained that my father in law had been very sick hence the reason why I did not use the voucher.  I was told that the voucher was expired and that they would not honour it.  They did not even offer us breakfast or dinner which would not have cost them alot but would have been very good customer relations.  For a hotel that is constantly talking about its excellent customer relations I must say my experience was not good.  I appealed it to the Director of Finance in the hotel via e mail who did not even have the courtesy to reply until I sent him a second e mail.  I will never be going back to this hotel again,3,2016,07,08
207,"Crowded, impersonal convention venue","I'm just getting around to writing this review.  I stayed here last October.  It is a beautiful hotel, but they host so many events that it is impossible to cater to their own guests.  The bars and restaurants are so horribly overcrowded, I ended up leaving most times when I just wanted to stay in.  The situation was so bad that I moved over to the Westbury for the remainder of my visit.  When I return this September, I will stay at the Westbury again, which is a lovely hotel, with a great location, and much more personal service.",3,2016,07,06
207,Very Nice ,"Very nice hotel. Outstanding by European standards. Staff very courteous and helpful, all of them.  When they found out my wife needed to keep milk on hand to take her medication with, they offered to clear out the pay items in the room's refrigerator. Wow! Our room was very nice and comfortable. Very spacious by European standards. Well located for tourists, city center is easily within walking distance. The three hop-on / hop-off tour buses have pickup locations across the street. St. Stephens Green is across the street. Grafton St. (shopping district) is a couple short blocks away. Highly recommend.",5,2016,07,06
207,Excellent Service and Comfortable Rooms,"From the very welcoming doorman to the extremely helpful housekeeping staff, our arrival at the Shelbourne was a pleasure.  They even sent someone in person to our room to check to make sure that all our needs had been met!

The rooms we had were not large, but had plenty of storage space and were well appointed with all the things we needed.  

Wifi works well.  Heating and air conditioned also worked well.  

Plenty of easily accessible electrical outlets for all our devices.  

Although the hotel has a very long history (and some beautiful historic architecture), it seems it has been renovated relatively recently. So, it has all the modern conveniences.

Comfortable, but not exceptional, beds.

The concierge was knowledgable and helpful (which was not the case at a couple of other hotels where we stayed in Ireland).

We did not eat breakfast in the hotel because it was served in a room that was quite busy/loud and did not seem to have any windows.  But, one can have tea/coffee and a pastry in the beautiful Lounge, and there is a Starbucks very nearby.

The hotel is located in a very nice area (near high end residential and business districts, and across the street from an excellent park).  It is about a 10 to 20 minute walk from many of the tourist destinations we visited.

We were able to have interconnecting rooms.  Great for families.

All the staff were very friendly and professional.

It did take a long time (about 15 minutes) to get a bellman to help us with our luggage when we left.  But the guest services representative was apologetic and so I expect such delays do not happen often.

For a luxury hotel in Dublin with high quality amenities and service, the Shelbourne was a good fit for us.",4,2016,07,06
207,Classy hotel in wonderful Dublin location,"Stayed 3 nights at the end of long trip through Scotland and Ireland.  It was the perfect place to savor the trip and to unwind.  The room was comfortable and spotless.  The large bar was beautifully decorated with plenty of choices to sit and enjoy a drink or a meal.  The hop on/off buses stop acoss the street providing a way to see all of Dublin.  In addition to being across the street from St Stephen's Green, the hotel is a short walk to Grafton Street with all its shops, and an easy walk to Trinity College and the Book of Kells.  The staff is welcoming and professional.  Hotel has a classy old world charm with modern amenities.  The breakfast buffet is ample and delicious. The hotel was a great way to end a visit to Ireland.",5,2016,07,05
207,Remarkable,A wonderful hotel. An amazing experience.  Staff was so attentive. The rooms were beautifully decorated. The location is next to great shopping and museums. This was an experience that my family will forever cherish. Expensive but worth every bit of it. ,5,2016,07,05
207,The saddle room,Went to the restaurant and not only had a lovely meal but was served by Pavel the best and most lovely mannerly waiter out of any restaurant i have ever been to!5 star treatment and the food and even the atmosphere was just lovely we eat in the saddle room and altogether had a lovely day ,5,2016,07,05
207,Always a wonder,"Sometimes its just a real pleasure to revisit some old favorites - and the Old Lady of the Green is definitely one of them. From the welcome at the front door, the reception staff, concierge, the 27 bar, Horseshoe Bar and the Saddle Room everyone was welcoming, warm and friendly in the way only exceptional hotels do. Booking a Heritage Room overlooking St Stephens Green is a must to get a real sense of the luxury of the hotel. Great food, fantastic ambiance and magnificent service is what separates the good from the great and this is a great hotel. Cant recommenced it enough. Close to all the main attractions and shopping areas.",5,2016,07,04
207,A Grand European Hotel,This property is all you'd expect in an older grand European property.  Old world design in the common areas.  Beautifully maintained.  Guest rooms are modern with all the conveniences one could want.  Excellent location in the heart of Dublin.  Service was very good as well.  It should be noted that for Marriott Elite guests there is no lounge.  However full buffet breakfast was included for platinum guests.  Wifi is free for Marriott Elite guests,4,2016,07,04
207,Beautiful hotel.,"Stayed here while on a visit to Dublin. From the time I walked in I was made to feel 'special' as nothing was ever too much trouble, the staff extremely helpful, appearance was immaculate and I was always addressed with respect. The hotel is exceptionally comfortable, from slippers & bath robes to the toiletries & towels. ( little touches make a huge differecnce ). The saddle room for both breakfast and dinner is an experience. Not cheap but you are in the heart of Dublin and enjoying the surroundings of being throughly spoilt. Would defiantly recommend and I would stay again.",5,2016,07,03
207,Best hotel in dublin,"Had an amazing stay at the Shelbourne with my husband. The service is impeccable, the surroundings are beautiful and the atmosphere is magical. Nothing we asked was too much hassle. The horseshoe bar is really cosy and a lovely place for a quiet few drinks. Would definitely recommend afternoon tea here also, a really lovely experience that has to be done at least once. ",5,2016,07,03
207,A slice of style in Dublin,"The Shell our new hotel has proven quite a treat. A lovely place for a business meet up. Follow that with an afternoon tea and then gie yourself a little snippet of culture. I found hidden in the shelbourne the room where the treaty was signed for the Irish Republic....only Dublin best kept secret. Amazing culture, food, herbal teas and smiles.",5,2016,07,02
207,Magic afternoon tea,"Had afternoon tea at the Shelbourne Hotel yesterday. The theme for the tea was Alice in Wonderland. It was the best afternoon tea  I have ever had and this includes London other hotels in Ireland and many parts of the continent. The food was wonderful but the service was unbelievable good. Everything was done to perfection. Nowhere have I been for afternoon tea that I didn't have to pour tea myself. Sandwiches (beautiful open sandwiches) were served and tea was served by the waitress. From then on this lovely girl kept an eye on us and whenever we required more tea we never had to ask she automatically brought it along.  Then  the cake rack arrived with wonderful goodies, lovely scones, brack, panacotta, wonderful cakes depicting Alice in Wonderland . To finish we had kir royals. We couldn't possibly eat all the lovely food that was produced. We need not have worried about leaving it as once again the waitress appeared to ask us would we like to take it home. Of course we said yes. There apon she reappeared with the remaining food beautifully packed in a lovely carry box with the Shelbourne logo. Full marks. I have not seen this done so beautifully before. Usually one would have to ask and it would probably arrive in tinfoil. Congrats to afternoon tea manager and staff.",5,2016,07,02
207,Fantastic ,Started our trip with two nights in Dublin at the Shelbourne. Impeccable service and super comfortable rooms. Attention to detail was evident at this hotel. Concierge was spot on with recommendations.  Perfect location. Walking distance to everything. Will definitely be back. ,5,2016,07,02
207,Beautiful,Always wanted to stay here and finally made it.  Our room and facilities were amazing; Staff attentive but not intrusive.  Loved every minute of it.  The views of St. Stephen's Green are lovely.  Its walking distance from Grafton Street for shopping!!,5,2016,07,02
207,The ONLY place you should stay in Dublin!,"The Shelbourne is basically the Waldorf Astoria of Dublin, a classic 5 star hotel in the center of the city. Even Bono stays here when in town!
Front desk staff was super accommodative when I was checking in, as I booked through Booking.com and my request for 3 beds in one of my two rooms (for my 3 grown kids) had not been relayed to the hotel. A few minutes after arriving they were able to not only accommodate,  but were even able to give us adjoining rooms.
The Horseshoe Bar is a great place to stop for a drink after a long afternoon of sightseeing as this hotel is within walking distance of everything that you might want to see and do in Dublin.",5,2016,07,01
207,Pure Luxury,"We stayed  in the Shelbourne in May to celebrate our Anniversary. The hotel is beautiful, the decor is luxurious and the location is excellent.
The pillows were so soft and the hotel is extremely clean.
Staff in the restaurant- the saddle room were very attentive and friendly which is always a plus.

The only con I have is that straight after knocking once a member of the accommodation staff came into our room without waiting for us to answer. We notified the front desk who apologised profusely. 

Also to note: we had a queen room which is quite small, but as we have stayed in similar room sizes throughout Europe it wasn't a problem as we were used to it.

I would definitely stay in the Shelbourne again.",4,2016,06,30
207,Simply Amazing!!!,"Unfortunately I only stayed here 1 night, but it was an amazing hotel!! Everything from the location, decor, staff, food, bar, rooms, was perfect. Would love to stay here again when I am in Dublin next. I will say it was a bit pricey, but ultimately it was worth it if you want to treat yourself!",5,2016,06,30
207,Lunch in the bar,"We just wanted to stop for lunch and I have always wanted to go there so my friends treated me.
I loved the setting the staff and the food.
We ate in the bar and were served by several very helpful staff.
The food was delicious and I will definitely return",5,2016,06,29
207,Beautiful hotel,"This was a great hotel with great service. We enjoyed our visit and it was a good location. Could walk to several interesting sites and gardens. Staff was helpful and very considerate. 

The hotel is older, but in very good condition. Rooms are  nice sized and comfortable. Plenty of closet space and dresser storage. 

Bus transit system was in close proximity to the hotel which was really convenient. ",5,2016,06,28
207,"Very, VERY nice","My best friend and I treated ourselves to staying in the best hotel in town. It was really a beautiful building, extremely lush. The staff were wonderful, I have to say. The location is superb, just on St Stephen's Green, close to shopping and some stonkingly good restaurants, such as Bang Restaurant & Matt the Threshers. 
We loved the bar, where you can sit and enjoy a cocktail or two and let the world come to you - you meet some interesting people in there (either of the bars). 

Only let-down was our room itself. For such a lot of money, it was quite small and had NO view at all. Sadly, we got the view of a nasty municipal building and carpark instead of the green park. But, just to show us what we missed, they put a picture of it in the bathroom for us. How kind. Maybe don't run the salt in the wound! Oh, and their coffee was awful (but some say it's not good in Dublin full-stop). 

But we did love our stay here in this handsome, old historic hotel.",5,2016,06,28
207,Excellent Experience,The reputation for customer service and luxury offered by the Shelbourne is our reason for booking. We were not disappointed. Our park view room was elegant and comfortable. We had dinner at the Hotel and enjoyed a wonderful meal. The entire experience exceeded our expectations.,5,2016,06,28
207,Great stop on our Ireland adventure!,"Can't say enough about it from the cab driver's great comments on the way to the hotel, the check in, the ducks at the bar, the staff, the room....you will adore the experience!!!
The rooms had everything you'd need, even built in converters for those from other countries.  The bed was the most comfortable.
Location cannot be beat since it is in the heart of the city!!",5,2016,06,28
207,A wonderful hotel,Visited for afternoon tea and we had a really excellent experience.  The staff are so friendly and the service is outstanding.  The food was lovely and so well presented.  The decor and the atmosphere are just fabulous it is a lovely experience. Highly recommend it.,5,2016,06,27
207,Dublin's Crowning Shamrock!,"This is a Dublin tour stop not to be missed. We wish we had stayed at the lovely
Shelbourne, located in the city center of Dublin. The bar was hopping and such fun!
The cocktails were delicious and priced appropriately. 
The best part of our visit was the special tea, reservations required. The room
Was so bright and pretty with many windows with a view. Our tea was so special,
Serving different sandwiches from most teas. I loved the ham salad and the cheese
And tomato options. The servers had specific jobs and were quite efficient. The
Price was high but totally worth it.
The hotel was old and quite beautiful. We had to descend steep steps to use the
Lovely restroom. I would highly recommend a visit to the Shelbourne and enjoy
Their special tea!",5,2016,06,26
207,Fantastic European Luxury,"We choose the property based on reputation and location and where thrilled by what we experienced. This was our first stop upon flying into Dublin. We hopped the Air-Coach bus from the airport to the Kildare St. bus stop and then it was a short 3 minute walk to the front door. We had requested an early check-in due to our flight schedule and thankfully they were able to honor our request. 

We booked a heritage king room and found the room to be not overly large but certainly adequate. The bathroom was large, beautiful, modern and clean. We were in room 152 which overlooked Kildare St. It is quite a busy part of town so I would have probably preferred to be on a higher floor to cut down on the road noise in the evening. The room featured both a coffee pot and an expression maker as well as the usual amenities. 

The location of the hotel could not have been better. St. Stephens green was directly across the street and was very pleasant to walk through. Trinity college was a short 5 minute walk away and all of the sight seeing busses stopped immediately adjacent to the property making for easy transit.

If I were to think of one area that needed improvement it would be the breakfast. While it was delicious and more than adequate it was not included in the room rate and was quite expensive. For what you pay to stay at the Shelbourne I would have hoped this had been included.",5,2016,06,26
207,"Great Location, pleasant and efficient staff","This is the place to stay in downtown Dublin - just a very short (less than 5 minutes) walk to St Stephens Green, The Little Museum of Dublin, National Museum of Ireland - Archaeology, and National Gallery of Ireland.
Room was of nice size, well appointed and maintained, and staff were wonderful.  Great breakfast buffet.
Hotel history is interesting - built in 1824 by freemasons, and was founded by  Martin Burke, a native of Tipperary, when he acquired three adjoining townhouses overlooking Dublin's St Stephen's Green - Europe's largest garden square. Burke named his grand new hotel The Shelbourne, after William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne.

During the 1916 Easter Rising the hotel was occupied by 40 British troops under a Captain Andrews. Their objective was to counter the Irish Citizen Army and Volunteer forces commanded by Michael Mallin.

In 1922, the Irish Constitution was drafted in room 112, now known as The Constitution Room",5,2016,06,26
207,"""Unforgettable""","My husband and I spent our first day and night in Ireland at the Shelbourne Dublin.  The hotel was beautiful, the service, first rate, and the breakfast was perfect.  The hotel was beautifully decorated and our room was large and cheerful.  We ate dinner in the Saddle Room and that was the best meal we had in an eight day trip.  We both had the Tasting Menu without the wine paring.  Each course was tastefully prepared and was absolutely wonderful.  Plus, the portions were just right.  The service was a stand out--not stuffy, but done with style.  The meals were pricey, but well worth it.  What a wonderful introduction to Ireland.  Can't wait to go back!",5,2016,06,25
207,Grand Hotel - Never Disappoints,"Our group of (9) stayed 6/17th and our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer. Our 3rd stay at The Shelbourne and it won't be our last.

From check in (my granddaughters loved the favored water), to the room (quite comfortable), to the bar (vibrant - and thanks to the staff for helping us secure a table for our last night gathering of 20+), to the breakfast (simply delicious). My granddaughter put it best ""this place is fancy!"".

Enjoy it!",5,2016,06,25
207,fab food,Went on fathers day to this gem of restaurant for lunch great food great staff great wines and a procecco to die for can't wait to go back Well done to the chefs the food is amazaing so refined food is full of flavour.,5,2016,06,24
207,"Superb, Class & welcoming.","$ family members spent 3 nights here to celebrate my Mothers birthday. Thereis simply nothing I can criticize about this hotel. While the ambience, food, rooms, decor etc were superb-- it really is the warmth, good humour & overall consideration of the staff that MAKE this hotel. I plan to return there Nov 2016 for a repeat celebration.",5,2016,06,23
207,Disgraceful staff behaviour not worthy of the Shelbourne or anywhere else.,"Our visit to the Shelbourne was marred by the behaviour of staff in the restaurant. Whilst eating breakfast we were joined by friends who were also staying. All of a sudden two members of staff appeared at the table and without so much as an excuse me to either myself or my wife and began publically harassing my friend and his wife regarding the charge for their breakfast. We might as well have been invisible. I have never witnessed this type of behaviour in any hotel let alone one that purports to be 5 Star.  
The breakfast was included in the room rate but for some reason they did not know this. This was obviously the hotel's problem as for whatever reason it was not on their system in the restaurant. The staff stated that they were not allowed to let anyone leave the restaurant without paying? Does the Shelbourne regularly detain guests? One can only wonder - my wife had taken me and invited my friends to the Shelbourne for my birthday as a celebration. The whole experience was ruined by this incident. Their behaviour was totally unacceptable and unnecessary given that they hold guests credit card details. Why did they need to conduct themselves in this way in the middle of the restaurant? Why did they have  to do it so publically? This could have been dealt with discreetly and in a respectful and manner. Very poor service. I don't expect that we will be back in the Shelbourne.",2,2016,06,23
207,"The bees knees, if your in Dublin, do it","We went the Shelbourne for a night, it was our poshest hotel we have stayed in. The staff were completely fabulous, the room we had overlooking St Stephens green opposite was amazing, the decor in the hotel was epic and the food was excellent. So for once in your life blow the expense and just do lt, you will be glad you did it.",5,2016,06,23
207,Steeped in history but a little tired,"Great historical hotel in a wonderful location.
Alas the room was down a long, narrow corridor and in the back of the hotel. The window looked onto offices a few metres away necessitating the blinds to be closed all the time.
Room was poky and stuff and not worth the price. 
Average front office staff who are more focussed on seeing the back of you rather than the serivce that typifies the Renaissance brand.
Stay somewhere else for better value",3,2016,06,22
207,Off the charts Excellent!!!! Facilities / Service / Location,"Not only is this a premier Marriott property, but it is History! They even have their own museum in the Lobby. I have stayed here several times and each time I am impressed with one aspect or another. The rooms are excellent. The air conditioning works much better than most of all hotels in Europe. The breakfast is out of this world (if you are Marriott Gold it is comp'd). The location is perfect. And each time I am impressed with the service provided. I really hope I get to come back with my family.
Thanks for another great stay!",5,2016,06,22
207,Sumptuous Lunch,"What a truly wonderful experience! A light lunch of home smoked salmon plus a green salad was quite one of the most memorable lunches ever. It is no surprise that their smoked salmon is also for sale in the hotel....it is absolutely the best I have ever eaten.
The only disappointment was that I didn't have a bigger appetite....this WILL be addressed on our very next visit!!",5,2016,06,22
207,Great finish to a great trip,"We spent our last two days in Ireland at the Shelbourne; other people and reviews recommended it and we weren't disappointed. We were greeted at the curb by Greg, who unloaded our car, collected our luggage and directed us to check-in. He was also invaluable arranging cabs, giving directions,  and more. The concierge worked hard to deal with our difficult airline. Staff - from hostesses, servers, chefs - in the main  restaurant were universally superb, as was the food. Check-in and -out were smooth. The great service we, just ordinary people, received was in spite of the hotel hosting two weddings and a noted entertainer giving a concert in Dublin.",5,2016,06,22
207,Fantastic hotel re-pleat with Irish History,"The Shelbourne is one of THE classic hotels in Dublin.    An integral part of Dublin's history the hotel is beautifully maintained.   Our room was clean, well appointed with very comfortable beds and nice decor.   The facilities, restaurant and bar facilities are very upscale.   Staff is old school excellent...the old saying of you get what you pay for is very true with this property.   If you are looking to be pampered in a classic hotel this is definitely a hotel you should consider!     Next time we are in Dublin we'll be back...",5,2016,06,22
207,Mother Daughter trip of a life time.,"The Shelbourne is grand old hotel. Great location with staff that are friendly, helpful and responsive to any concerns we had. The one negative was with some guests that were very impressed with themselves and made racial comments, which is not the hotels fault.",5,2016,06,20
207,5 star hotel with a 5 star service,"We had a wonderful lunch yesterday at the saddle room restaurant , the food and service was amazing, we were not rushed in anyway , a great experience for all , can't wait to return ,  lunch is fantastic value for money and the quality of food  and  service was first class",5,2016,06,20
207,Aivis is the Cocktail Guru!!!...,"My wife and I went to the bar in the Shelbourne Hotel on Sunday evening for drinks after having a birthday dinner in Hugo's next door.

As soon as we approached the bar we were greeted by a tall man with a very big smile.  We then proceeded to spend the next 90 minutes being served by the 'Cocktail Guru'.  

I explained that my wife would like a gin based cocktail and he recommended 'The Restoration' 10/10 and this was followed by something with a bit more punch...'Torch of the Earth' 11/10!!!

We thoroughly enjoyed our time in the bar with Aivis and really appreciated his passion for cocktails and attention to detail.  The music and lighting in the bar were also spot on.

Please make sure Aivis gets to see this review and tell him that we will be back for more!!!

Richard & Janice, Dublin",5,2016,06,20
207,Beautiful property,"This is one of the best properties in Dublin. I guess this is the oldest one too. Grand building with rich heritage. The location is the best in Dublin. You can't ask for anything better. It is right opposite St. Stevens garden, barely 1 min walk from Grofton Street, few mins from Trinity College. I stayed here for 4 nights & each day was phenomenal. The rooms are well-kept, perfect lighting, corridors are nice. This is a beautiful hotel & I surely recommend to stay if you want to be in the city-center.",5,2016,06,20
207,"Comfortable room, but a very hectic, self-impressed place with little focus on the average guest","The Shelbourne is an impressive hotel, or maybe impressed with itself.  

They try to sell the glamour of staying where such history has taken place and where luminaries like Bill Clinton have stayed.  But they forget that you have to make each guest feel that the Euro 300-400 they are spending for their room is appreciated by the hotel.   The hotel pays very little attention to the individual guest.  The only interest anyone expressed in us was when they wanted to upswell us to a more expensive room.  

We couldn't have a drink in the lobby bar areas because it was so packed with events.   They are obviously more focused on being a place for hip gatherings than on being a first rate hotel for guests.

The rooms are nice, though the hallways are long and awkward.  Furnishings, bed and bath were very comfortable and nice.   So it's not a bad hotel at all.   Just not as good as it should be.",3,2016,06,18
207,Highly Recommended! Would go back just to enjoy the hotel more.,"Spent five nights at the hotel early June 2016. First visit to Dublin. Completely lucked out with the most gorgeous weather which made it even more difficult to leave the hotel. Book extra nights so you can just enjoy the plentiful facilities at this hotel and not feel like you're missing out on anything in the city. 

The Spa and fitness facilities were fantastic. If you book a massage go early so you can decompress in the spa sitting room prior to - beautiful room with high ceilings, architectural detailing, soft music, light refreshment and a view towards St. Stephen's Green. We had a couples massage by two Thai ladies, was decent. Almost went back for a second treatment during our stay for the atmosphere. 

The pool is surrounded by three glassed in rooms with ample GoodLife fitness equipment, well laid out and wasn't very busy during our visits over the bank holiday long weekend. Schedule in some time to take advantage of this for sure. The change room facilities are also of high quality with lockers and all the necessities. A nice touch prior to the massage was a locker already name labeled with a plush terry robe and slippers to slide into. 

The Hotel. Where to start. Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. So nice to stay at a place with some history and true character compared to the hotels where we live in the UAE which are all so new and try so hard. You could say we are kind of ruined due to the hotel culture in the UAE but this hotel exceeded expectations in almost all aspects. Service was all around superb and professional, would have liked to see a bit more interaction (acknowledgement) from the staff when walking through the main areas to the elevators. Service was good when directly dealing with them but you did feel a little invisible otherwise. Or maybe we just looked unfriendly...?!

Being an older hotel you can imagine how the room hallways could feel a bit like a maze but they were well lit with just the right amount of decor and wall/floor colouring. Nice design touches throughout. Adequate signboards/wayfinding to get around and up and down.

Room was spacious as was the classy bathroom with a standup shower, soaker tub, wide vanity and separate toilet room. Room was always well stocked and wifi signal strong. The TV was proportionately small on the wall as the distance to the bed was quite open - it was a spacious room :) -wasn't there to watch TV but would recommend an update. (Room 458) That would probably be about our only somewhat less than positive comment about the facilities and that isn't bad!

Location: PERFECT. So many places around the area, stumbled upon some great finds when you go out the front of the hotel to the left and many on the side streets behind it. Lots of activity given the sunny weather. We were able to enjoy a Sunday afternoon with some pints listening to a group of Irish men singing with what appeared to be more locals than tourists. More than enough options in the area for food and drink. Close to all kinds of shopping. Can walk everywhere. The park was green and peaceful right amidst the city buzz. 

Food at the Hotel: Sunday brunch and jazz, delicious. Breakfast in the Saddleroom, classy with good selection, chef made great omelettes and always had a big smile on his face. It shows when people enjoy what they are doing. Dinner, creative and sophisticated dishes and flavours. Seemed small at first but was perfectly portioned. Wanted to do the Afternoon Tea one day but we ran out of time. 

Overall, thank you to the Shelbourne for a memorable stay - even with the regional specialities! We had the most perfect stay and really can't say enough good things about the hotel, design, character, staff, special touches, facilities and can't wait to return!",5,2016,06,17
207,Amazing,"Spent 3 days at the shelbourne, wasn't dissapointed, the staff were so friendly and welcoming, the suite was beautiful, and the perfect location for sight seeing, would love to visit this hotel again, loved every minute.
The breakfast was delicious, everything you could possibly want, and the service was second to none.",5,2016,06,16
207,a WOW experience,"A very old historical building, extraordinary service, very spacious room, lovely bathroom, amazing breakfast...what more I can be wow-ed by this hotel?
We shared their Heritage Room in a party of 3 girls so they put an extra bed in a corner right before the wardrobe.
My other coworker stayed in another room by himself with a very spacious balcony.
They use Elemis in their bathroom which I really really like.
But there is bad drainage of bathroom sank, we have to take out the thing so the water won't stay in the sank.
TV signals are a bit weak as well, the screen is freeze when I turned to Discovery Channel.
Overall I believe this hotel would be one of the best 5 luxurious hotel in Dublin.",5,2016,06,16
207,Dinner,"We chose Prosecco, oysters, smoked salmon, seafood pie dusted with fresh dill, fish and chips. Fresh crisp linen napkins served with every course. There is an extensive menu, but chose pub food. 
A lovely pot of tea at the end with tea cookies. 
Service was slow but gracious. ",5,2016,06,15
207,Not Quite What We Expected!,"Overall disappointed in The Shelbourne.   I think that we may have the worst room available at this hotel -a lovely view of the air conditioning/water filtration unit for the whole hotel.  Booked a queen deluxe room for my husband and I.  We have two doubles instead of a queen backing up to a utility closet so room smaller than most.  No queen bed, no deluxe, no view. Happy 25th Wedding Anniversary from The Shelbourne!

After arriving at 10 am from an overnight flight, we were told that our room would be ready in 30 min to 1 hour.  And voila-  rooms not ready until well after 4 pm even though check-in is at 3 pm.  We went to the Saddle Room for breakfast while waiting for rooms.  Seated at a dirty table, waited 5 mins for staff to remove dirty dishes etc., and then manager or hostess advised us that they would need the table in 30 minutes, essentially kicking us out before they even cleaned the table that we were seated at.  

Overall, not what we expected at all!",2,2016,06,15
207,Once again you never let me down!! ,"Had a wonderful weekend stay in the Shelbourne yet again. I can't thank the staff enough. The waiters in the no 37 bar car not look after you enough. Keeping an eye for stools when they are super busy. Can't recommend the hotel enough. A special shout out goes to Janus... I think that's the correct spelling! You know who you are and always great us with a smile! 
Ate lunch and breakfast all of which was very good! 
Will be returning next month.. On small complaint was I had the smallest room I've ever been in. Sliding door for bathroom after having climbed over the bed to get in. 
We travel here once every two months or so and gave done for many years so had hoped for a bit of help On 
this issue as they normally do, but sadly to no avail this time! ",5,2016,06,13
207,Arguably the best,"Probably the best hotel at which I have ever stayed. The room was clean, large and luxurious. Food was very high quality with decent sized portions, always a member of staff on hand to help with anything. Thoroughly professional combined with typical Irish friendliness.",5,2016,06,13
207,Gold Standard Service,Booked for my parents for a special occasion. They were brilliantly looked after and the service was excellent. They said that the room was wonderful and that breakfast was incredible and kept them going for a whole day of sight-seeing! Great location for visiting the Book of Kells at Trinity and then watching cricket on a lazy sunny afternoon. The historic significance of the hotel to Ireland's centenary celebrations also made it that bit more special.,5,2016,06,13
207,Amazing Mademoiselle Martini Cocktail,"As a girl who is fussy about her cocktails and has never managed to find one to beat an incredible Margarita from many years ago in Mexico, the suggestion that I should try the newly invented  ""Mademoiselle Martini"" by Stephen at The Shelbourne hotel was met with scepticism that it was unlikely to be as special as he promised. I was utterly wrong.  I would travel to Dublin just to have another...I promise you. So if you're a fan of great gin head to The Shelbourne and try one for yourself. Simply divine darlings. Chin chin. 🍸",5,2016,06,12
207,Very warm and friendly staff,"I really enjoyed my 4 night stay here.  The staff are so helpful and friendly it made you feel like you were visiting a friends home.  The hotel is beautiful and historic, I think it started as a hotel in something like 1824.  The only negative was that in my room I could hear people walking above me.  I'm sure it's due to the age of the hotel and it wasn't really a major problem.  The staff and the beauty of the hotel made it a non-issue to me.",5,2016,06,11
207,Two day interlude in Dublin,Four of us spent two nights in this lovely understated and elegant hotel last week. Excellent position on St Stephens Green and convenient to most attractions .  Had a very nice room albeit not a great view but one expects that in an inner city hotel.  Great buffet breakfasts at which the Irish excel. We had a wonderful afternoon tea on the day of arrival and had dinner the following evening which was also very good.  Only sorry we couldnt have stayed longer,5,2016,06,11
207,Fab location!!,"I stayed in the Shelbourne with my husband recently. It has a fantastic location. It's just a stones throw away from Grafton Street, which is the main shopping street in Dublin. Our room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable and relaxing. The staff were very friendly and efficient. I really enjoyed the breakfast. The breakfast bar had a great selection of food, which was really well presented. The cooked breakfast was delicious. Overall we had a great stay and we would definitely recommend the Shelbourne. ",4,2016,06,11
207,Great location ,"Lovely hotel  friendly staff 
Nice rooms 
Great location near shops - st Stephens 
Really recommend this hotel 5* 
Would lovely to return 
Lovely restaurant - al la Carte  or buffet breakfast 
Really beautiful building that has been nicely maintained 
",5,2016,06,10
207,Dublin introduction,"We booked a night at the Shelbourne before our Rick Steves tour started. It is the hub of activity for Dublin society. Our room was beautiful and the bathroom modern but with classic taste--still a couple of things wasn't prepared for. Smell of smoke in the bathroom. And no way to plug a hair dryer in the bathroom. 
Pedicure in the spa. It is a bit of a maze to get there.  But loved my chance to chat with gal from the heartland. ",5,2016,06,09
207,Top shelf Hotel and great location,"When you stay at a premium property, there are certain expectations. The Shelbourne exceeds them all. I was a Marriott Platinum member for quite a while and this hotel rates as the highest in my travels in terms of service, amenities, and just the pleasure of staying there. If in Dublin, spend a night there. You will not be disappointed.",5,2016,06,09
207,Not Great. ...,"Just back from 2 nights here and wouldn't hurry back. Not a great room, dark with awful view to concrete inner sanctum. Offered other rooms all at premium prices to the already fully priced  € 350 rate. The ""business centre"" is hopeless. Could not print off a straightforward pdf, nor photocopy my back up hard copy  None of the printing / copying equipment worked and the staff trued but could not help. The staff did make copies for me overnight from another machine in the building which was kind but even then those copies had black ""tyre marks"" from that printer and were not of a basic decent quality. 

On checking in the form asks for newspaper preference, it came one day not the next. The bathroom sink did not drain although it was fixed quickly.

So just a number of things that add up to a second class experience. Pity. ",2,2016,06,08
207,The ONLY place to stay in Dublin,"This was probably the best Marriott Property that I ever stayed at and we are Platinum Members so we have stayed at quite a few fabulous locations.  Added to the level of Marriott service was the over the top Irish hospitality seen in every department throughout the hotel. If I could give it 6 stars, I would.

The location directly across from St Stephen's green was spectacular.  You can walk very safely to everything from this location.  No need to look any further...this is the place to stay!!!",5,2016,06,08
207,Wonderful in every way.,"I booked this for one night recently for a special occasion and I can't recommend it enough. Everything was just top notch from start to finish. I don't think you'll get a better hotel in Dublin, from the food to the staff to the service.I loved it. I cant wait to return again.",5,2016,06,08
207,not living up to the hype,"I am currently staying here instead of the nearby Merrion that we usually book. The Shelbourne is in a beautiful historical building and ideally located for our daily meetings.  The room is spacious and spotless, however some of the furniture is in a less than perfect condition - the hanger holding the luggage stool simply fell off the wall last night. A rather unpleasant experience upon check-in when I was told my credit card was declined and had to pay in cash for the first night. Obviously very embarrassing. I spent the morning on the phone the following day only to be told that they never received the billing request i.e. that the problem was the hotel's terminal. In fact - we tried it again today and it worked fine. while I understand that technology can't always be relied upon, it would have been appreciated if another device had been tried or assistance called. Using another credit card, which I don't have, was the only other option I was given. I don't dare to guess what would have happened had I not had cash on me. all in all, given the reputation I expected the bar to be set a bit higher on all accounts.",3,2016,06,07
207,Would Rate it 6 Stars if I Could!,"This is a luxurious, historic hotel is housed in a 200 year old building in a great part of the city that my husband and I had the privilege of spending two nights at during our short stay in Dublin while touring different parts of Ireland.  Our king pillow top bed was extremely comfortable, the linens heavenly and the room decor simply lovely.

The staff were friendly and efficient.  We used the valet parking. Wireless internet was available throughout the hotel which made it easy to plan our travels.  Breakfast was superb and the bar in the evening was lively and a nice place to end the night.

All in all, the most luxurious hotel in Dublin with 6 star service!  If you have found this review to be helpful, kindly let me know by clicking below.",5,2016,06,06
207,Think carefully who is here...and you would want to be yourself.,"Locals who get a promotion celebrate here; sports celebrities stay here; Americans whose universities have alumni tours stay here; Travel groups from Boise, Idaho stay here. Local power business meetings happen here. After staying at the number one hotel a few blocks away our last visit to Dublin, we put in two nights here thinking it would be a comfy stay for us as Marriott Gold Level travellers. The people on the elevator going to our room lived two miles from us in Massachusetts; the people at breakfast were alumni from one of my wife's universities. You come a long way to Dublin not to meet Irish. Recently on the TV there had been a series of special episodes on The Shelbourne in which one episode explained their five levels of guest recognition (the top level was sports, movie celebrities and royalty who get gifts of food and drink out the wazoo). It is, granted, an historic hotel and there's a small alcove where you can see some objects preserved there. We had problems with the present: no-one at registration was native English speaking..we had a very halting Asian. No recognition as Gold Level members, let alone any one of the five levels of ""gifts"". No explanation of where to go for what or how to access the Wifi. The king-bedded room was on an upper floor, small, jammed with furniture and in one area slanted so badly that objects on the nearby table rolled to the floor. We tried to switch but were told no other rooms were available (and this booking had been done four months in advance) due to all the tour groups they had in. The sink taps both leaked even when shut: we tried to explain that later that same day to another person at the main desk to no avail..words like ""tap"" or ""faucet"" didn't work. We even tried bringing the point up when we checked out but still got no suitable English speaker to work with. So during our stay washcloths were jammed around the taps.  There was free Wifi (they had billed us for it and we had to point out Gold members get free Wifi) but it never worked reliably in our room..signal was too poor. 
The main floor is rather labyrinthine--a huge L-shaped bar area obviously cobbled together from older, smaller rooms was on one side...one round of drinks there was enough as we dealt again with servers who barely had a word of English aside from what they needed to take orders--even asking them to bill to the room as problematic. The dining area loops back and around with many nooks, ending up finally into a large bland room jammed with tables. There is a copious buffet, a bit of a walk away, for breakfast. Also in the lobby is a large tea room: both days we were there it was booked for special business or government meetings so we never got to try that out.  The photogenic doorman who had been featured on the TV episodes was not on duty when we were there...the ones who were often did not even hold the door open for us. We ended up cancelling our last day of the stay and went back to the number one rated hotel a few blocks away: we had asked the doorman to hail a cab for us, but after a long wait (he started talking to a friend) we ended up rolling our suitcases along the street ourselves. Really not worth the stay here by any means, and no outreach by the staff for ordinary guests...guess they are all doing up the gift baskets for rock and sports stars. The only native I heard talk was the Concierge who was a bit of the self-consciously extroverted Dub putting on a show for the Yanks (which for his job was probably a good thing). This was perhaps my 20th visit to Dublin as a dual-citizen and one-time native but I was embarrassed for my wife who, for this stay, didn't see the city in a very good light. There was a question here as I'm writing this review about families and children: this is a very formal hotel..no room for children and not an atmosphere to run and play anywhere: look elsewhere.",2,2016,06,06
207,Best Marriott ever!!,"We stayed 7 days and it is the best Marriott we have ever stay in!  The Shelbourne has such great history and decoration, but the service is impeccable!  Every need it attended to with a great smile and as if it is a pleasure to serve you!  This is far better than any the Ritz-Carlton. The location is also perfect as you can walk about everywhere.  We also ate at the Saddle Room and had 45-day aged Chateaubriand for two.  It was absolutely wonderful and a gracious serving.  We were too full for dessert.  I can't say enough of a wonderful week.",5,2016,06,05
207,Worth every penny ,It's become an annual trip for my Eldest daughter and I . A Christmas tradition. Expensive but worth it. Would rather stay here for one night that elsewhere for two. Location is perfect and service is excellent. Rooms small as you'd expect in a city hotel but luxurious.Looking forward to our 2016 trip already.,5,2016,06,03
207,"Lovely Hotel,","Visited on a business trip and this was a lovely hotel, Nice pool if ou can find it, it feels like you have travel via middle earth to get there.  The cooked breakfast is was not so great but otherwise, it was a lovely property and the staff were very nice. 

I had a room at the back of the hotel and whilst it was very well appointed the view was out onto the bins and an office block.  However, it is a city centre hotel! 

Internet ok, but not fast.",4,2016,06,01
207,Girls day out pampered in the salon,I spent the day in the beauty parlour after a fantastic nights stay!! I opted for the Hollywood legends waxing pack and had my hair done I got ballyage I was looked after by grainne for the whole day and she was absolutely amazing I now use her as my full time hairdresser.what an feel good amazing stay *****,5,2016,06,01
207,Old World Charm with a Modern Buzz,"Fabulous traditional hotel with friendly staff who couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel is neither pretentious nor stuffy and has a lovely atmosphere. We had a great room overlooking St. Stephen's Green, classically furnished with a large bathroom and really comfortable bed. There is free wifi throughout the hotel should you require it and a very good buffet breakfast with signature dishes made to order. Will definitely return!",5,2016,05,31
207,REview,"I spent one night with the Shelbourne Hotel to celebrate my 20th Anniversary.  We arrived at 1 O'Clock and our room was not available yet, as expected.  Maggie on reception offered us an upgrade for €30, but we decided not to take her up on this as we were going for lunch and our room would be ready on our return.  However, when we returned, we were upgraded at no extra cost - not sure how that happens.  From a customer serivce point of view if there was a freee upgrade available it would have been a nice touch.  Other than that we were extremely impressed with the hotel, location etc.",5,2016,05,31
207,Proper hotel!,"Excellent hotel. The rooms and facilities are complemented by superb, friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, clean and quiet. Breakfast is absolutely delicious (and plentiful). It is, however, the staff that really make it such a special experience.",5,2016,05,31
207,Shelbourne Hotel Review,"Last time I stayed was 15 years ago. The hotel was fully renovated about 8 years ago. They did a very good job of keeping what was good, and updating the rest. Not having Irish staff that have been there for years is a negative. Buffet breakfast for me, is a negative. Everything else is excellent.",4,2016,05,27
207,Dublin Institution,"Heritage  hotel in great location.
TINY rooms.
Great service from team at front desk. Very helpful.
Service noise in the corridors in the morning annoying at 7am.
Grand Dame of hotels in Dublin.
Public areas busy and noisy for a quiet drink although resident lounge available.
Overpriced rooms.
Great location.
Would return if I could get room at right price. At last attempt they wanted  430 Euros for the tiniest room in Dublin without breakfast!! PASS!",5,2016,05,27
207,Solid hotel in great location,"Spent three nights at this hotel while on a conference in Dublin and my overall impression was solidly good.  If possible I would rate a 4.5 stars rather than 4.  For the price the hotel just couldn't quite hit all the buttons to give it an exceptional rating.  The room was small, but that is typical for Europe.  The bed was comfortable and the service was great.  One complaint is that the quality of the toiletries (shampoo, etc) left a little to be desired for a hotel of this caliber. Elevators can be slow to get to your floor when the hotel is busy.  The location cannot be beat though and provided a great jumping off point to explore the wonderful city of Dublin.",4,2016,05,26
207,Historic and Luxurious,"This hotel is beautiful, clean and centrally located.  My husband and I could have stayed there forever, the lobby had beautiful candles that made the hotel smell amazing.  Upon arrival we were upgraded the room was beautiful, service was amazing.  Even if you don't get the opportunity to stay here you MUST have tea in the tea room loved this special time. Make sure to get a reservation for the restaurant, food and wine selection is very excellent.",5,2016,05,26
207,A wonderful time - Everytime!,"Myself and my boyfriend visit the Shelbourne last night for cocktails. This is our favourite place for cocktails in Dublin. It's always a treat, the service is always outstanding and the atmosphere is just perfect! Last night I got an espresso martini which I absolutely love and order almost everywhere I can get my hands on one, this one was my absolute favourite! Stephen (our cocktail maker) came to chat with us, explaining to me that the espresso martini was so good because he had added a little extra coco. Amazing! Stephen was very informative and helpful, he also introduced us to his signature cocktail The Renovation which was also fab! A gin based cocktail it had lots of great flavours - a definite must for gin lovers. We will definitely be returning to The Shelbourne! Fabulous time!",5,2016,05,26
207,"Short stay, luxurious surrounding, customer service fail","Stayed for 1night on a Saturday while attending a dinner in Dublin. Got a reasonably good deal with booking.com for a queen room and I was very excited to stay there. Have been for afternoon tea and food many times. 
Lobby was buzzing when we arrived but thankfully a helpful staff member greeted us and carried my bag around to reception.
Check in was swift. No real niceties or welcome.
The public areas are spectacular. Such opulence!
Our room was very small. Just enough room to walk around the bed and fit one person in the ensuite which had a sliding door. However it was fine for our short stay. The decor was beautiful. The bed and pillows very comfortable. Robes and slippers provided and a turn down service carried out. Also a great shower and tea/coffee making facilities.
Two bottles of water were in the room also which were topped up during turn down service which was great. The fridge also had extra which we opened the following morning however unknown to us at the time these would be charged at check out. I think that is a bit ridiculous when you offer complimentary water!
At check out the area around reception was busy but as I stood patiently I was summoned by a hand in the air to a man at the end of the desk. No good morning, no question about how I enjoyed my stay etc. Just a print of the bill and the unfortunate owed for water. The man I believe was a manager so the check out left a really bad taste. A little bit more friendliness and care towards customers would be nice. Expected more. It is a five star hotel after all!
Not sure I would return for accommodation in future.",4,2016,05,26
207,Excellence ,"The definition of luxury and excellence, Very formal service. I sometimes wish that places like this that are so high end would relax a little bit but it is why people come to places as high end as this - for the service and quality of service.

I went here for afternoon tea and it was very pleasant. It came with 5 finger sandwiches to start and then the sweets. (the afternoon tea is to commemorate the 1916 rising) They were all beautiful and for a dessert fan they would definitely hit the spot. I suppose it is expensive at 57EUR for afternoon tea with a glass of champagne. But the attention to detail makes it all worth it for a very special occasion! This is the highest standard of service and quality that you will get in Dublin (well I hope as it is a well established name)

As we had our afternoon tea there was a pianist on the grand piano which was lovely. The service was very good from all the girls in the lounge as well.",5,2016,05,25
207,Wonderful hotel,"Had a 2 night stay at the Shelbourne (traveling with a tour group).  It was by far the best hotel stay of our 2 week trip in Ireland.  Beautiful hotel, outstanding service!  Great luxurious beds.  My only complaint was the temperature of the hotel room.  It was set at coolest - 18 degrees C, but no way did the room ever reach being that cool.",5,2016,05,25
207,Incredible historic hotel,"Loved our stay at the Shelbourne. Great location right on St. Stephens Green in Dublin.  The hotel is immaculate.  Marble bathrooms, very comfortable beds, amenities (water in the room, free wifi, an assortment of power plugs in the room, chocolate at night, etc).  The breakfast in the morning is superb as well.  Check out the Shelbourne ""museum"" near the reception desk too.... I found an entry in 1916 by a couple who stayed here from Jacksonville, FL (where I live). Pretty incredible place with amazing history.",5,2016,05,24
207,Comfortable and elegant,"We spent two nights at the Shelbourne at the beginning of a driving trip. Our flight from Chicago got in early on a Sunday morning and the hotel could not have been more welcoming, getting us into a lovely room well ahead of check-in time. Breakfast was great and we had drinks with friends in the bar, which is very fine. The hotel is close to everything and our car was parked by the valet, not to be seen again until we left. Looking forward to returning.",5,2016,05,24
207,Perfect,"Stayed for two nights over a weekend, we loved it.   The room was not big but was very quaint.   A beautiful room and such a comfortable bed.   Well located, just fantastic.   Yes it is expensive but youpay for what you get.   Beautiful breakfast, great staff, well worth that bit extra for a great experience.",5,2016,05,23
207,A great place to go for pre dinner drinks.,"I visited the Shelbourne on a recent shopping trip to Dublin. 

I really enjoyed the courteous and attentive service and the classy and luxurious surroundings of the bar. I certainly would have spent longer here if time had permitted.",5,2016,05,22
207,John,"Loud external noise in bedroom, moved and the next room was the same.Small bedrooms , poor bathrooms.
Good location but very expensive for the quality and space. This is the poorest hotel I have stayed in , in Dublin.
If booking make sure the room is not adjacent to outside Air conditioning apparatus , kitchen fans etc.",1,2016,05,22
207,Great location and service but expensive tiny room,"Luxurious, great service and location but expensive as expected. My room was the smallest hotel room I have ever had with limited storage space. Had to turn sideways to walk around bed. Small for even a single. They called it a double.",4,2016,05,22
207,Elegant and Great location at the Shelbourne,"This is a great hotel!  It is located in a great location in Dublin.  It is close to great restaurants and shopping.  There is a park nearby and the best hop on/off bus stop is directly across the street.  The front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful at check-in.  The concierge, Dennis, is very friendly and informative.  The bell desk is also ready to answer any questions if the concierge is not available.  My husband and I stayed in a premium room.  The bathroom was enormous and elegantly appointed in marble. It was stocked very well with many upscale toiletries. The room itself was not large, but it was elegant with nice bedding.  The closet is rather small.  We had the buffet breakfast daily and it was great.  The buffet had many selections and was all delicious. Overall, it was a lovely stay and would return again.",5,2016,05,21
207,Mixed feelings,"Wonderful, warm, cheerful & super helpful staff - The Best without question! They are the hotels best asset.
Location was excellent & extremely convenient for shopping & sight seeing.
 2 of had breakfeast in our rooms whilst 2 more of the group ate in the dining room-big differences in our experiences.
Our bacon was over cooked, the apple juice was the cloudy type with a not so great after taste. Also, we only got 2 small little triangle pats of butter between us for use on 2 croissants, 4 slices of toast & 2 slices of soda bread. The gang who ate downstairs thoroughly enjoyed theirs.
My mother is 5ft  & has arthritis in her ankles. The beds are extremely high so
we had to use cushions and a foot stool to get her safely into the bed. They were extremely comfortable.
We had a gift voucher for €500 & the twin room was €428 for one night. In truth, the hotel is very beautiful & the staff surpass all expectations but......I can't justify the price of a room with a bed that you use for a couple of hours-madness really!",3,2016,05,21
207,A magical and historical place in Dublin; and yes it's the best hotel in town too!,"Try to think of place where perfection, class, style and service are redefined. Quite hard actually, but when I visited this hotel I knew I had found it! When you approach the hotel from the outside you already notice that this hotel is operating at a whole level than other hotels in Dublin (and I would argue: in Europe). The building looks stunning and you can feel the rich history come alive. This history is actually quite remarkable and interesting and I would recommend anyone to look into it, make sure to visit the little museum in the hotel that is dedicated to this history. Also, when you see and experience the rooms you get a feeling of what this hotel brought its guest in past. The venue is of course updated with the latest comforts and technology, but I am guessing the experience must be the same: impressive, overwhelming and very welcoming. I loved the entree in the main hallway: it's not grand or overdone, but elegant with much eye for detail. As Dutchman I immediately noticed the ""Sneeuwbal"" flowers near the mirror! Absolutely fantastic! The checkin process went smooth and one of the best and quickest I've experienced so far.  Walking towards my room felt like wandering an old historic place ... But is was quite easy. The room I got was a deluxe and is very spacious for a hotel room. Especially the marble bathroom was grand and very well equipped. The room just felt complete! Every little thing was there. It felt warm and comfortable and you would actually want to stay in your room just to experience it to the max. I also used the lounge which is very stylish and elegant. The staff is truly wonderful and you can tell that these are the best in class. I would gladly visit again in the future, one of the best hotels I've ever seen and visited!",5,2016,05,20
207,One teriffic Hotel,My wife and I enjoyed 5 nights in this excellently run Renaissance hotel. The service was top of the line. We enjoyed the breakfasts and the proximity to major tourist sites in and around Dublin. In a very safe location.,5,2016,05,19
207,Amazing Experience,We had booked a castle stay and The Shelbourne Saved the day.  The castle we were booked at for the last two nights of our stay hardly resembled a castle.  A local restaurant owner assisted us in securing a room at The Shellbourne and we were so thankful.  We stayed in a fantastic suite facing St Peter's Green I believe and loved every bit of our experience during our stay.  We would definitely stay again if ever in Dublin.,5,2016,05,18
207,A very enjoyable weekend,"We stayed in The Shelbourne for a weekend a few weeks ago, on the Friday we had afternoon tea, everything was beautiful and the service excellent. The rooms were beautiful and the hotel staff very friendly and courteous. The overall ambiance of the place was very friendly, genuinely a lovely place to stay. The one issue I would have with the hotel would be the bar staff, we were there for an international weekend but nonetheless the bar staff were very slow. The breakfast each morning was beautiful, I would highly recommend the Eggs Benedict ! Overall a very enjoyable weekend was had by all.",4,2016,05,18
207,Top Shelf!,"I stayed here for two nights at the start of an Odysseys Unlimited tour of Ireland. We got to the hotel about 10 a.m. and our room was ready. It was beautifully decorated and a fair size. Everything was in working order and extremely clean. Breakfast was included as part of our tour, and the service in the breakfast room was exceptional, especially Patrick! The bars were extremely crowded at night so we missed having a nightcap at the bar. All in all, however, a wonderful hotel and a great start to our trip. Thank you Odysseys Unlimited for booking a top notch hotel in the center of Dublin.",5,2016,05,17
207,Deadly Disappointed,"Prior to visiting The Shelborne Hotel i had been told many amazing stories so you can imagine my excitement as i was going for two nights. Upon arrival to the hotel the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. They helped us with our luggage and they politely took my car to park, but before the men did so, i was explaining to the man how my car worked and his reply was ' i have driven one before.' I felt he could have humoured me and there was no need to be so cutting. The lady who checked us in at reception was polite and provided us with a refreshing glass of lemonade, which was a nice touch after our long journey. 

We were shown to our room and in my opinion the room was very small compared to what i expected. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels, and i felt room wise this has been the most disappointing to date. The interior of the room was of the best quality, however there are many rough edges to the architrave, which shouldn't be. Personally i feel that this hotel is in desperate need of renovations. The first rooms toilet was broken and although they did send an engineer around to fix it quite promptly, to much avail we had to change rooms, which was an effort for us as we had unpacked and was a bad start to our stay. The room we stayed in also only had two night-gowns and two sets of slippers even though there were three adults staying.  

On the first night we had reservations in The Saddleroom Restaurant. The service in this restaurant was impeccable and the quality of food was divine. I do highly recommend this restaurant and will leave a separate review for that. I requested at the reception that i have milk heated for my child and they were helpful with assisting with this. The reception area is exquisite and the marble work is beautiful. The staff are dress appropriate and are all very well educated and well spoken which is always a bonus. 

In the evening time there is a turn down service which was a lovely touch. The hotel has lovely touches like this which is probably why it has been awarded 5 star. The bathrooms were small and i have seen better quality bathrooms in other hotels. The bedrooms were warm and the beds were extremely comfortable, but if you are of large size i wouldn't recommend this hotel. 

We also used the Hotel swimming pool, which was clean and of good size. However the swimming pool was quite cold, not what i am used to. It is not child friendly and it lacked a jacuzzi. I did find the hotel refreshing and i did enjoy my swim, as so did my son, but again i have seen better swimming pools.

The breakfast in The Shelborne was the finest i have had. The selection was outstanding and the service at breakfast was great. Having breakfast was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience, and i would highly recommend the breakfast.

Upon check out i settled my bill with cash, that was not a problem. I enquired with the reception staff when the preauthorisation would be returned to my account, and they told me it would take five working days. Almost two weeks after checkout and the preauthorisation was not returned to my account. I had the annoyance of having to recontact The Shelborne and discuss this matter, plus i had to telephone my bank several times which i was put to the expense of. The Shelborne stated they dealt with the matter and emailed my bank however my bank stated they didn't and i ended up having to email my bank with The Shelborne's confirmation of return of the preauthorisation. I felt that even though the manager Eamon was extremely helpful and was knowledgeable of the matter in hand, i felt i was put out and bothered by this. On checkout there was no mention of this possible bother, even though i was informed it had happened previously when i initially contacted The Shelborne.

Overall i feel i would return to this hotel but i wouldn't bring my child and i would be more prepared for my visit. I also feel the hotel is over priced regarding stays but is worth every penny on the terms of fine dining and wining. I hope my next visit is more enjoyable.

207,Beautiful Hotel!,"The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin offers it all....history, beauty, quality, ambience, service, outstanding rooms, and fantastic food in a perfect location. I would highly recommend this hotel on any visit to Dublin.",5,2016,05,17
207,Afternoon tea,Have just returned from having afternoon tea in the Shelbourne Hotel. It was amazing. The attentive staff couldn't do enough to make sure you thoroughly enjoyed your afternoon. The presentation of the food was excellent as was the taste. Would definitely recommend a wee bit pricey but for the ambience worth every penny. Will definitely be back.,5,2016,05,15
207,The BEST of Dublin,"Being Marriott elite members, we have stayed at many, many Marriotts all over the world. This is one of the best. Our top locations have been the Marriott Buscolo in Budapest, the Marriott in Shanghi , and the Marriott in Beijing. But this one takes top honors. Old world elegance. Attentive staff, great bars and a lovely breakfast, but the gentleman who is the concierge at 2 pm on Sunday was a bit lacking in manners. He could've done a better job. But overall, loved our 2 night stay.smallish room, lovely marbled bathroom w/ great amenities, in room safe and very easy wifi!!! Would def be back when we have more time!!!!",5,2016,05,15
207,Worth it,"Dublin is small, perfect for a tourist to walk for miles visiting places, then at the end of the day, come back to this very elegant hotel in an excellent location (centrally located), sleep on its very comfortable bed, wake up on the next day and enjoy its excellent spread of breakfast, before heading out to visit the city again. 

I like the Shelbourne. It is truly classy and the breakfast is simply amazing.",5,2016,05,14
207,Favourite Dublin hotel ,"The Shelbourne is just the Shelbourne and it continues to evolve with the times . Relax and watch the world go by in luxurious surroundings . Breakfast is whatever you want .... 
Given the fabulous restaurants with in walking distance , the food on offer at the Shelbourne is excellent and great value . I would highly recommend this institution .
Next time I would like to avoid the room beside the  constant screaming child all night .  
",5,2016,05,14
207,Beautiful hotel but does not cater to families...,"Stayed for one night with two young children. The hotel is beautiful and the location cannot be beat!!  Across from St. Stephen's Green and close to everything.  The two double-bedded room was well appointed but small, as was the bathroom. We specifically booked this hotel not only for the location, but because of the indoor pool for the children.  

We checked in with the children in tow and I asked about the pool and requested a crib in the room.  We got to the room, dropped our bags and headed out to explore.  When we returned hours later, still no crib in the room.  I called down and asked again and inquired about the location of the pool.  I then geared up the kids (as moms know- not an easy task... Bathing suits, toys, floaties, etc) and we headed down to the pool.  We entered the fitness center and started into the beautiful pool area (which was empty) and was stopped by a staff member and told that there are pool hours for children and they had ended for the day (it was 4pm).  I looked over at the pool that was completely empty (imagine crickets chirping) and at the kids and asked if they could go in quickly.  ""No.""  Returned to the room with two sorely disappointed children.  Oh yes, returned to a room that still did not have a crib in it.  My husband went down to the front desk to request the crib for the third time and it was delivered shortly thereafter.  

Later that evening, I spoke to a manager at the front desk regarding the pool hours.  I explained that no where on the website does it list pool hours, when I checked in and requested info on the pool this was not mentioned, nor was it brought up when I phoned down.  I understand having family pool hours, but these should be clearly communicated to families.  Like I said, beautiful hotel but customer service and communication lacking.  ",3,2016,05,10
207,As excellent as you would imagine.,"Great hotel. Stayed 2 nights for a work trip in March.

Excellent location, great outdoor running spot just across the road (St Stephens Green) or a good gym, pool and sauna/steam room in the hotel if you like to stay active.

Service is second to none, food is amazing.  Rooms are great. Can't fault anything at this wonderful hotel. ",5,2016,05,09
207,Elegantly Comfortable,"We stayed at the Shelbourne Dublin our first night in Ireland.  Because our flight came in early morning, we asked for an early check in, which we were graciously provided.  The hotel itself is elegantly appointed, the staff is extremely polite, professional and courteous.  The room was very comfortable, with all the extra amenities provided (plush rope, slippers, bottled waters, etcetera).  Our wash room was grand and the bath products provided were luscious!  
We had a difficult time getting the room cool enough, but the staff provided us with an oscillating fan, and we were fine for the night.  
We spent a little time at the Horseshoe Bar and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The bar keeps were very attentive, appropriately friendly and kudos to Chris, at the bar, who makes the second best Espresso Martini that I have ever had, it was exceptional!  
On the safety side, I will say that there was a young man at the bar, who came in quite intoxicated.  Staff very kindly, but firmly, told him that they were unable to serve him and escorted him out in a very friendly, non-confrontational manner.  I was impressed!
We enjoyed breakfast in the Saddle Room, the eggs Benedict were prepared perfectly and the service there was also quite good.  My only complaint would be that when we arrived at the Saddle Room, the hostess there asked for our room number and name and then checked a list on her clip board before she matter-of-factly informed us that our meal was not included in our stay.  I had not expected that it was, and was quite taken aback by the method.  If some guests do receive a complimentary meal, perhaps there is a more delicate was to manage this.
Overall, we enjoyed our first night of our first visit to Ireland.",5,2016,05,09
207,Elegant and Modern,"Recent upgrades to this landmark Dublin hotel have brought new elegance to The Shelbourne, conveniently located off Steven's Green with short walks to Grafton Street and Trinity College. The hustle and bustle of modern Dublin stops at the revolving doors as attentive staff welcomes guests appropriately. A bonus is the concierge staffers who help with suggestions, directions and reservations. Just good old fashioned service in a modernized setting with a tremendous sense of history.",5,2016,05,09
207,Another Great stay in Dublin at the historical Shelbourne,"This is a great hotel in a number of different ways.  The hotel sits across from St. Stephen’s Green, and is close to Grafton Street, Trinity College, museums, and all of the sights in the south city center.  Also, the Hop On Hop Off buses stop literally right across the street.  
We have stayed at the Shelbourne twice, and have found the staff welcoming, knowledgeable, informative, helpful, and professional.  On both visits we have arrived at the hotel early in the morning, and reception has been able to accommodate an early check-in.  The rooms are comfortable, and the wi-fi was strong throughout our stay.  Although in a busy part of Dublin, we could hear no street noise from our room.  
The breakfast choices in the hotel restaurant are plentiful.  You can get eggs cooked the way you like them (omelets included), along with a plentiful variety of hot and cold offerings.  Fill up for the day at breakfast then get out sightseeing!",5,2016,05,09
207,Afternoon Tea for the Ladies of the Manor,"12 ladies went for afternoon tea to The Shelbourn - walking into the Hotel was such an experience as its very much steep in history with all its beautiful charm and if the walls could talk !! we did go there with high expectactions and we were not disappointed - We had our own dinning room, table was dressed with linen & silver service, Food was delicious and we were offer fresh tea/coffee during the afternoon, all the staff made us feel very welcome and we did feel like Ladies of the Manor even just for a few hours! So i would recommond that you should try this wonderful experience .Thank you to all the staff who looked after us so well.",5,2016,05,09
207,Lovely Space...... Industrial Service,"Great hotel bar and I had high expectations.  We went on a Saturday night for cocktails.  A very popular place with a nice crowd.  Yet.... Cocktails weren't high quality and a plain gin martini was too despite a dry request and the aviation didn't make the grade.  Yet...  Service was transactional and with one drink spilt as it was delivered, the waitress had to be reminded to clean up the spillage.

We will return to try again yet but not a good first impression.  ",3,2016,05,08
207,A wonderful location & historical hotel,"We stayed at the Shelbourne in April for a business trip.  This was a beautiful, historical hotel & situated in a perfect location to see Dublin.  Right across from a gorgeous park, and around the corner from shopping, you can't go wrong.
We did a tour to Wicklow & Glendalough, which was stunning- a great 1 day trip to see the countryside.  We travelled with Hilltop Tours, but didn't do the hike because of the weather that day.
Other great spots - Mulligans Grocer (Pub) across the river, the Guiness Store house, shopping on Grafton Street & Howth - a small fishermen town....wish we could have stayed longer!",5,2016,05,06
207,Afternoon Tea At The Shelbourne. Fantastic Service.,Recently visited the Shelbourne Hotel. Afternoon Tea was lovely. Presentation was brilliant. Quality service. Delicious food served in the lounge and front bar too. Staff are very friendly and efficient especially the blonde Swedish girl serving in the bar and restaurant.,5,2016,05,04
207,Worth the price,"My wife and I are not fancy travelers, but once and awhile, it's ok to pamper yourself, and the Shelbourne was the place to do it. For us, $200 a night for a hotel is a little pricey, but it was worth every penny. To begin with, you cannot beat the location, right there in the middle of Dublin, across the street from St. Stephen's Green. Check in was easy, staff was friendly and eager to make your stay in Dublin enjoyable. The rooms had everything we needed. They were spacious and had all the amenities (you don't know you need slippers and a bathrobe until you have them). For me, the shower is important (showers in Europe are not always what an American is expecting, and I understand that) the water was hot and the pressure was great.   I was experiencing some back issues at the time of our vacation, so I appreciated having a spa in the hotel, that actually had availability for there guests (it has happened on two of our trips this year, no availability once we get to the hotel) I was there for 4 nights and I very easily got 2 massages. There was a great bar/restaurant in the hotel, we did not eat dinner there, but we did have drinks and GREAT appetizers. And, every morning I could not wait to get downstairs for their breakfast. You could order off the menu, but why would you, the buffet was great. In short, pamper yourself a little at the Shelbourne in Dublin, you will not be disappointed. Thank you to the Shelbourne and all their staff, (the ones you see and the ones you never see) for making our stay in Dublin a great stay!",5,2016,05,04
207,No quite five star,"The staff (excluding those in the restaurant, The Saddle Room) were excellent; courteous, informative, etc. the room (442) was clean and fairly elegant, but a bit rough around the edges. The bathroom was fantastic, however! The tv was sluggish and ranged from difficult to impossible to use.

The big problem lay In check-in. Admittedly we arrive early in the morning and about noon was still not available by noon when we returned from a city bus tour, but we we tired from our trip and wanted to relax. There were three chairs in the noisy reception area, two chairs in the lobby, and that was it. The bar was completely full (on Sunday morning no less) and it seemed everyone else's rooms were ready except ours. Being that many transatlantic flights arrive in the morning, they should be more prepared for this. They didn't offer a free breakfast or lunch, not even coffee. Maybe a 30-minute massage, but all we really wanted was a quiet place to wait and they couldn't even provide that. We had to camp out in reception for two hours watching everyone else check in.

Now to their in-house restaurant, The Saddle Room: the waitress started by asking us if we were ready to order fore even offering to get us some drinks? In a dimly-lit restaurant you would think at least one staff member would have a pen light to help people with trouble reading the menu like my partner. No, the turned up the lights, slightly, but still not enough, and I had to read the menu out loud to my partner.
As for the food, the potato and fennel soup, and open ravioli were excellent, but let me warn you, do not eat the fish. It's as bland as food gets. Additionally the waitress forgot that potatoes were included in one of the mains and served it only after we had finished the entrees! No apology, just, ""Oh, forgot these! Here you go!"" It took twenty minutes after the table was cleared for her to get us out check, and only after repeatedly trying to flag her down. Of course she forgot to give us a pen.

Avoiding The Saddle Room, I would probably stay here again, but it is definitely not what I would consider a 5 star hotel.",4,2016,05,04
207,The best of the best in Ireland,"We saved Dublin until the end of our 15 day journey and spent 3 nights there.  The taxi driver told us it was the best hotel in Dublin and I believe he was correct.  It's a historic hotel located by Grafton Street and close to Temple Bar.  St Stephen's Green is right across the street where you can also access the Hop On Hop Off buses.  The hotels restaurant and bars were not only gorgeous but the food was excellent.  Finally, the service was impeccable.  I was contacted a few days before arriving to see if I needed anything.  Since it was our wedding anniversary Etore assisted in having a fresh flower arrangement in the room upon arrival.  The entire stay was fantastic!",5,2016,05,03
207,Amazing Staff offers the most attentive service!,"I booked two stays at the Shelbourne Hotel during April (beginning and end of my trip), and this hotel exceeded all expectations in every area!  Both rooms were superbly decorated, all amenities are provided, and the beautiful bedding is so comfortable that you fall asleep instantly; the rooms are well-insulated so that noise isn't an issue. The bathrooms are spacious and completely updated very tastefully. From the doorman to the porters, the concierges, and front desk staff, everyone anticipates your every need with a smile. Their location is central to everything that you'll want to see in Dublin, and both the Saddle Room and Oyster Bar restaurants offer fresh and inventive offerings accompanied by delightful service.  I highly recommend The Shelbourne Hotel for anyone looking for top notch service and accommodation; you won't find any better in all of Ireland.  I can't wait to return!",5,2016,05,02
207,Luxury at its best,"The hotel staff is what makes this hotel rise above just a beautiful building in a great location.  They were so helpful, arranging to have luggage transferred for us etc. And of course there is a beautiful health club and pool to use to refresh after a day of walking.  Water both sparkling and flat provided daily.
Large elegant rooms and public areas with great service.",5,2016,05,02
207,My 50th birthday celebration in Dublin,"Stayed here on March 27, 2016.
Sebastian from concierge desk walked me up to the room where they signed the independence of Ireland. Beautiful fireplace and gorgeous classic furniture  in the room.
Told him it was my birthday and he told his supervisor I believe. He surprised me with a shot of Jameson whiskey.  That kind gesture made my stay special. 
Enjoyed the steam room and dry sauna and pool at the hotel Spa. They are so fancy and big, its always a pleasant experience for me to be there. 
Visited the spa 3 times and was there for one night only. Adore this spa.
The reception staff is always lovely and professional. Provided a big plate of Shelbourne cookies for me and their delicious lemonade too.
I adore this hotel, they treat me like family. 
My room was fancy. I danced in my room and watched lots of funny local tv while drinking a few cups of coffee. 
This is my favorite hotel in Ireland.
Families and couples can enjoy it equally.
I walked to the park across the street from it and took photos of their pretty gardens.
Had a lovely and delicious breakfast at the Saddle Room Restaurant inside the hotel.
Always a good meal and friendly service from staff.
Sincerely,
Rosa Guimaraes Santos

207,Beautiful and historic! (Across from St. Stephen's Green),"Lovely hotel; great service; wonderful little history museum (nook) about the Irish Constitution. Note--must make advance reservations to dine in luxury restaurants.  Luxury spa (wow! I know why Grace Kelly preferred this hotel!). Beautiful rooms.  I have nothing but good things to say about this great hotel!  (We arrived with backpacks from a long European trip and they still treated us very well!  Unusual as backpackers are often treated poorly, especially at luxury hotels and this is a true luxury hotel!)",5,2016,05,01
207,A good hotel with highs and lows,"Visited for May bank holiday weekend for a friends birthday treat.

Highs:
Stunning hotel with beautiful public area, fresh flowers in abundance.Staff attentive, from Keith who arranged dinner reservations to the bar staff who made great cocktails.Lovely staff uniforms for the girls.

Great location on St Stephens Green, walking distance to everything

Bar 27 was fantastic,although we did not eat there, we certainly made up for it by drinking there!Sunday mornings into early afternoon they have live Jazz,great bar scene.

Bedroom was furnished well with lovely linens, robes and slippers,nice to have tea making facilities.

Excellent breakfast,everything you could wish for, eggs cooked to order,pastries,juices,etc.very good indeed

Lows: We opted for a deluxe King, which was not the smallest/ cheapest room available. It was VERY small with a ridiculously small shower room - we felt like we were on a boat,the wash hand basin was the size you would have in a guest cloak room NOT a bedroom in a 5 star hotel.Goodness knows what the Americans thought of these rooms ( and boy were there a LOT of them about!)

Too many big tours and groups staying in the hotel, the place was over run with large groups of Americans - many inappropriately dressed with shorts and sportswear in the lovely bar and dining areas,with loud and brash voices.This is the price you pay for staying in a large chain hotel, and it also makes me realise Its better staying at a smaller boutique hotel which was an option but on this occasion I was looking for location, which is what this is all about.

Spa needed a few extra touches,compared to The Ritz- Carlton were in the changing rooms you have EVERYTHING, hair spray, face, body creams, straightening irons, apart from make up you needed to bring nothing!

I was travelling light this weekend, and was surprised that there were no hair straighteners available in the hotel.

It's little thing like this that set a hotel apart from the rest, may sound like nit picking but it seems nowadays you have to be one step better!

Top tip:Ladies bring your best dresses,the bar is quite a scene and the Irish love to dress up.

Would I return, yes for location and bar scene, but would upgrade to a much bigger room.

Management responses are not always tailored to the review they reply to and often skirt the issues flagged up!",4,2016,05,01
207,This is how it should be done ,"It has been many years since I last visited this hotel. Such elegance in one of Dublin's timeless locations. Food, wine, service and surroundings were absolutely superb and I cannot compliment the hotel enough on the quality of their hospitality.",5,2016,04,30
207,Excellent hotel in great location,"Hotel is right on St Stephen's Green, so location could not be better.  The rooms are tastefully decorated with some wonderful pictures/photos in them. The staff are very helpful and polite, and you can tell they take pride in their jobs.",5,2016,04,28
207,Not sure how we would have entertained the kids if we had stayed somewhere else,"The Shelbourne was a perfect base when visiting Dublin. Admittedly we were attending a wedding at the hotel but we decided to spend 4 days/3 nights in Dublin with our two kids ~2 and 5 years old around the big event. When the Dublin weather was dreary we were glad we spent a few extra dollars to stay at such nice a hotel. The large indoor swimming pool is a beautiful space. Having left swimming costumes at home we visited Dunnes to make a purchase and took the kids there every morning. The breakfast was fantastic and our kids loved it. Fantastic, friendly service everytime. 

As the weather brightened we took advantage of the Shelbourne's central location. We could walk to all the places we wanted too and it was easy enough to come back as we tired. The hotel was a great wedding venue too. Friendly and attentive staff.

The only negative note was that we had to report a few problems - bathroom door not locking properly (twice) and tub not draining. All were resolved quickly but it was disappointing to experience these issues in quick succession.",4,2016,04,28
207,Perfection!,"We arrived on April 15th mid-morning from the States.  Unfortunately, our room was not ready and we had to kill four hours.  But, that was the only disappointment.
Service was impeccable and our room very comfortable.  
Due to the hotel's ideal location, we were able to find our way around Dublin quite handily.  
There was one other disappointment.  The lovely bath salts are not available for sale.  
But, the property as a whole is top drawer and ranks up there with the Ritz and Four Seasons. 
I'd love to go back to Dublin and stay at ""The Shel"" again!",5,2016,04,27
207,"Beautiful property, terrible experience","I stayed at this property for a week and must repeat what everyone else says - it's a beautiful property in a great location. The view from my room was awful (a dirty adjacent balcony), but that can be overlooked. 

My experiences at the hotel, however, were awful. During my week stay, I was: 
- overlooked or ignored several times (waiting for service several times)
- asked in surprise if I was a guest 
- brushed off seemingly as a bother when I asked for help twice 
- put in a largely abandoned back room during meals (despite being appropriately dressed per dress code) multiple times

For those that don't care about the service but do care about the wi-fi, that's bad news too, since I probably ended up connecting and getting booted off about 10 times/evening.

When I voiced my concerns (I stay in Marriott properties on average about 100 nights/year and this was by far my worst experience yet), I received an apology from corporate and a dressing down from the property manager to whom corporate forwarded my concerns. 

Needless to say, I won't be back and, unless you're planning on staying in their presidential or princess suite, I wouldn't recommend it.",2,2016,04,26
207,Great Hotel Celebrating Centenary of 1916 Rising and It's Role in those Events,"This is a beautiful hotel and a joy to visit. If anything it has improved from my last visit.
The outside fascia restoration is now complete and the scaffolding removed and you can see the old stonework and plaster corniches in their restored glory. As always the staff are exemplars for the hospitality industry setting a standard as high as I have experienced in a lifetime of international travel.

This visit was to attend a family celebration but on rrival we discovered that the Hotel is also making a contribution to commemorating the 1916 Rising in which it played a part. In the reception they have the old register books which people signed in on (before computers and registration cards!). On Sunday 24th 2016 they had the page of the old register for 24th April 1916(The day the rising started) on display showing the signatures of guests in the hotel and as this was the day of the horse racing at Fairyhouse there were names associated with the Irish horse industry on display and which last down the years to their descendants of today. The hotel also had a blank registration page available and guests were given the opportunity to ""sign in"" on that page thus completing a link over the 100 years. Clever idea and touching. In the Rising the hote rooms overlooking St Stephens Green were used as British Army sniper posts to shoot into the Green which had been occupied and fortified by the rebels. Later in 1937 one of the rooms was used for the signing of the new constitution of the Irish State. We had a great visit and as always felt greatly at home.",5,2016,04,26
207,Short break,"This a 5 star hotel and you get everything you would expect, the service is excellent and the staff are very pleasant and helpful,the hotel is situated very central for shopping and sight seeing and is opposite St Stephens Green a lovely place for a stroll",5,2016,04,26
207,Gorgeous old hotel in perfect setting,"Overlooking St. Stephen's Green, around the corner from Grafton Street, National Library, Trinity College with the Book of Kells, and the Chester Beatty Lubrary in Dublin Castle, it is the perfectly located hotel.  And a gorgeous one.  Old world, beautifully renovated, gracious staff, high class restaurant, (Liam Neeson was at the next table), all services needed are provided.",5,2016,04,25
207,MrsC,"Very welcome with a baby for lunch in the bar. Best place in Dublin for a glass of wine.  Food always lovely in bar and restaurant. Stayed a few times, rooms expensive but breakfast the next morning is the best we ever had in Ireland or abroad. Afternoon tea lovely too but you have to book well in advance. Hotel fab and location the best in Dublin.",5,2016,04,25
207,Superb Hotel Nestled in Central Dublin,"As you read the reviews on this property you will see a variety of comments on the rooms themselves.  My wife and I spent a week here and came to realize that it appears this property has over the years been cobbled together from 4-6 adjoining buildings, hence the differences in room layouts, floor levels and a variety of accesses.

Do to potential noise, we had requested a room not facing the street in front of the hotel, and were given a 5th floor room that overlooked what many hotels might consider an internal ""courtyard"". In the case of the Shelbourne Dublin, if you looked straight down you would not see a picturesque garden area, rather the roof of the second floor.  This may bother some, but in our case it was what we asked for - a nice quiet room.

Upon arrival we were greeted by hotel staff (doorman, official hotel greeter).  Once inside this grand property we were surrounded by richness, Parlors flank either side of the main entrance, and a grand staircase is ahead.  The main welcome desk area has a very nice sitting area if that is needed, but we did not as we were quickly accommodated.

It's best if you get directions to your room as this is not your typical box hotel. With the different hotel appendages you might have to traverse into different constructions . . .  even though it takes a discerning eye to pick it out.

Our room was your typical high end Marriott (on par with a JW).  Comfortable beds, and great bath to soak away your sore muscles from a long day of walking tours.  If you are up to it, there is a first class spa and exercise facility.  I did not use the spa but the gym was really top notch, with indoor pool, steam and all the free-weight and cardio equipment you would expect at a full-service luxury hotel.,

In the mornings we indulged in the superb breakfast buffet.  I usually started at the grazing with fruits, yogurts, and a pastry or two and then settled into made to order omelets.  Staff started us off with a pitcher of coffee (or tea) and we never ran out.  Only thing I missed right away was smoked salmon, and on day four I found out that if I asked, it was provided.  

Outside the property, if you were up for some exploring you had several parks to chose from - St Stephens Green across the street, or out the door and left to Merrion Square Park.  

Up for a little more exploring, put on your walking shoes, head right and soon you'll be gazing at Christ Church Cathedral and a little farther St Patrick's Cathedral.  Ready for a drink and Guinness has their brewery tours and tasting room.

In the evening, you have a wide variety of choices for dinner, too many to list here, but pubs abound (my favorite was McGrattans Bar and Grill out the door to the left and then about three blocks).  To the right out the door are several side streets have that great food too!.  he Temple Bar area is famous  for drinks and eats.",4,2016,04,25
207,Buffet Breakfast,"Myself and my Wife stayed in the Shelbourne on Easter Sunday 2016.The room was lovely and the staff were efficient but clinical,but the most disappointing thing was that the breakfast the next morning was a buffet style affair.The scrambled eggs were in  wet mess,the bacon was like leather and the sausages were insipid.I have had better Irish breakfasts in a greasy spoon cafe.I would have expected better from a five-star hotel.",3,2016,04,25
207,Perfect in every way!,"I stayed here three times in 2015, once celebrating my birthday, and twice during the celebration of my sister's wedding. I have also spent several afternoons and evenings here for other social occasions. I love the lemonade on arrival, and the attention paid to every detail by the staff! During one stay an unfortunate incident and a slow response from security left some of the younger and older members of my family quite shook and upset, which was distressing. However, the staff took our comments on board on this occasion. Aside from that every visit has been wonderful, magical even. The staff are warm, and friendly and the hotel has excellent amenities, delicious food (& cocktails!). Its our place in the city!",5,2016,04,25
207,Stunning hotel,"Between the exception staff and the stunning decor and its perfect location in the center of the city, there is nothing  negative I can say about this hotel. Whether you are staying for a few nights to explore Dublin or just popping into the bar for a drink, the service is excellent. Christmas wouldn't be complete without a visit to the Shelbourne",5,2016,04,25
207,Commemorating 1916 at an Iconic Dublin Hotel,"As a history graduate and a lover of all things heritage related, I had to be in Dublin for the official commemoration of the centenary of the 1916 Rising! I had visited The Shelbourne on numerous occasions for various events over the years, but this would be the first occasion that I was staying as a guest. 

The level of service was, as always, impeccable.  It was the perfect base from which to participate in the centenary events.  Dublin was definitely 'alive, alive o' over that weekend! The addition of The Spa and The Salon to the hotel is definitely welcome and both are worth a visit.  A visit to the historic Constitution Room is definitely a must for any Irish history enthusiast.  The Saddle Room provides a range of excellent cuisine and a cocktail or two in Bar 27 will set you up nicely for an enjoyable evening.  The famous Horseshoe Bar must be visited and if it's afternoon tea one requires then where better to partake than The Lord Mayor's Lounge.  

A stay at The Shelbourne is not one for the price conscious.  It is expensive, but worth considering should you be celebrating a special occasion or just wish to 'push the boat out' etc.  My only issue would be the designation of my room, 284, as a 'deluxe room'.  Having stayed in many five star hotels at home and abroad, this room whilst adequate did not have 'a wow factor' in view of the price being paid per night.  Other than that, my stay was a most enjoyable one.",5,2016,04,25
207,Pleasant but nothing special,"We were looking forward to our stay at this historic hotel in Dublin - unfortunately, it didn't live up to its luxury, 5 stay reputation.  The staff was pleasant enough but certainly no one went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  As lifetime Marriott Platinum members, we were disappointed in our accommodations.  Our room was nothing special - especially the view of the back parking structure.  When we mentioned how noisy it had been the first night, since apparently we were the floor above the ballroom, the front desk response was, ""There are no events tonight.""  We were also disappointed there was no Executive Lounge - we always enjoy meeting other guests from around the world & relaxing in the Lounge.",4,2016,04,23
207,Luxury in the city,"First time in Dublin, fantastic hotel, we upgraded to a suite, worth the money. We stayed in the JFK room, 2 large rooms and bath. Staff was over the top, anything they could do to make your stay better, consider it done. ALL the staff was very friendly and helpful. food was also very good. Hotel is in the center of every thing, perfect location. Right across the street is a great park just to sit enjoy nature and people watch. 
Will love to go back",5,2016,04,23
207,Excellent Place to stay in Dublin,"My husband and I spent a week at The Shelbourne Dublin last week. The hotel staff was very accommodating and pleasant.  We booked the hotel through Tripadvisor and while I feel we got a great deal, the room was extremely small.  It was very clean and comfortable, but small.  The bed was a queen bed and again very comfortable, the bathroom was small but the shower was good size.  There was little drawer/closet space for two people but we made do.  There was a good size safe in the room.  We received a daily newspaper, daily turn-down and complementary chocolates and bottled water.  All very nice touches.  The hotel breakfast (which was included in our price, I would recommend getting this) was absolutely fantastic.  Unbelievable selection and again staff was very accommodating.  We ate a late dinner in the bar one night and that was very good.  The hotel has so much history and is just beautiful.  The location is great for Dublin, right across the street from St. Stephen Green, which is beautiful but we were able to walk anywhere in the city without any problems.  If you need a taxi, we used the app Hailo, which was also excellent and reasonable.  Right next door is a small restaurant called KC Peaches Cafe, excellent home-made fast food.  We used Aircoach from the Dublin Airport to The Shelbourne, Kildare Street drop off very close and convenient.  While we didn't try any, the Spa services looked great also.",5,2016,04,23
207,Stylish elegant classic hotel,"The Shelbourn hotel is a stylish classic hotel, very central just in front of St Stephen’s green. I would say that it is an historical hotel, as the list of famous guests includes Grace Kelly and John F. Kennedy. I think you pay for the hotel's long tradition, as I find the Shelbourne hotel overpriced for the standards in Dublin.
The lobby is extremely elegant, while rooms (at list the guest rooms) are good standard but not excellent.
Rooms are clean although not impeccable and the staff is professional and extremely nice (as always in Ireland!).
Unfortunately, my stay was very short (only one night) and I could not enjoy the spa and the restaurant. I hope I will, next time I will visit Dublin.",3,2016,04,23
207,Incredible historic hotel in a great historic location,"From checkin through checkout three days later, this was a delightful stay.  The hotel has historic charm but has been very nicely updated with all current amenities.  The staff are unfailingly friendly and helpful, the rooms comfortable and restful.  
We loved the dining opportunities as well, enjoying a dinner and three wonderful buffet breakfasts.",5,2016,04,22
207,Stunning,"I just love this place. Check in excellent, room wasn't ready but they took our bags and left us to explore. When we came back at like 2 ish the room was ready and the bags in there. Little touches like water whilst checking it were good. Bedroom was their standard but nonetheless was excellent, bed comfy, bathroom great and clean, power showers as well. The drinks bar on a Saturday evening was heaving but as residents they advised to go upstairs to the drawing room and they brought the drinks to us. Drinks are a little eye watering on the cost BUT this is a 5 star hotel in a city centre, so get used to it. Had some more drinks when we came back from the restaurant and they have a residents only bar. Breakfast is fantastic but then it needs to be at 29 euro each! Left full up and excellent service from the chefs who cooked up a good omelette. Went to use the leisure facilities which were nice and quiet for a Sunday and in good nick as well. All in all a memorable experience and will hope to do again soon.",5,2016,04,22
207,Hotel Supreme,"Great hotel.  Right in the middle of everything.  Easy walk to restaurants, shops, you name it!  Service outstanding too. Super accommodating, had two small grandchildren with and they, the hotel staff, were great with the kids.",5,2016,04,20
207,Drinks with friends.,We spent a very nice afternoon having drinks at the bar at this hotel. Buzzing atmosphere. Definitely a special place to visit in Dublin for a treat. The bar was very nice with lots of old features but still had modern touches. Loved it!,5,2016,04,20
207,The Shelbourne Afternoon Tea,"When entering the stately Shelbourne Hotel,  we were greeted by a distinguished and friendly doorman.   While we were early for tea, we decided to enter one of the bars.  What fun,  as there was a famous horse race occurring at that time.  The bar was busy and all were enjoying a pre whatever beverage.  Tea was at 6:30.   With broad smiles, lovely manners, we were greeted by several staff members.  Our wraps were taken for us and we were seated,  after the hostess made a decision as to where we would be most comfortable.  There was plenty of space between tables,  so that one felt that their conversation was private.  The tea itself was quite lovely.  I was most impressed with the tea sandwiches,  as they were substantial.  Having stayed at both Dromoland Castle and Ashford castle,  the tea at the Shelbourne I thought superior to either castle.  In that tea is so popular at the Shelbourne,  if visiting Dublin is in your future,  do make your reservation well in advance.  I believe that I made mine at least 6 weeks prior.",5,2016,04,20
207,We stayed when we were getting married,"Myself and my now wife stayed here Christmas week. We were getting married elsewhere and staying in the Shelbourne really made it for us. The staff and service were excellent and the little things, unprompted (like flowers and champers) when they knew we were getting married; we really appreciated. We were made feel so special. I won't forget it and I intend to return for our anniversaries for many years to come.There is also an excellent spa and gym/sauna/pool.This is the best hotel I've stayed in actually
Thanks to everyone there.",5,2016,04,20
207,An Historic Hotel with personality!,"A Dublin landmark hotel, the Shelbourne is not to be missed! From the uniformed footman at the front door, the scene is set for a very special stay. Don't miss the afternoon tea, with windows over looking St Stephen's Green. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but expertly finished and every details is immaculate. The service is friendly if a bit rushed, this is a busy hotel. We loved the Horseshoe bar and the extensive whiskey selection. Breakfast was excellent and set us up for a great day of Dublin sight seeing. The concierge was particularly helpful and gave us some great tips on where to go and what to see.",5,2016,04,18
207,A Dublin classic...,"The Shelbourne is old world Dublin stylishly updated. Great atmosphere, excellent rooms, wonderful location. Some of the best pubs, restaurants and shopping all with a few minutes walk from the hotel. 
Possibly my favourite hotel anywhere!",5,2016,04,16
207,Very Clean Hotel,"It is always impressive to walk into a hotel and see how spotless the floors and lobby space are.  Well, this place sets the bar!  The lobby is rich in history and there is plenty to see while just staying at the hotel!

The counters are long and there are plenty of staff members to help you when you arrive so that your wait is short.  Once clear of the desk, there are elevators located in different parts of the lobby area for your accent into the luxury rooms.

The rooms are well stocked with high quality furniture.  Some rooms are smaller than others, so if you need a larger room, be sure to ask for one.  In the rooms, the climate controls work very well.  There is also a nice flat screen TV on the wall directly in front of the bed.  The showers are comfortable as is the entire room.  

There is a nice pool, beauty salon, and a small gym located in the building.  It takes a little getting used to when learning how to navigate the building. However, once you get that down, you will find what ever you need at the Shelbourne.

This hotel seems to be very busy, so if you are a premium member, don't expect any upgrades.  However, they do take care of you with other benefits such as drink tickets, free breakfast, etc.  There is no executive lounge.  

Overall, this is a very nice hotel with plenty of staff members to ensure that you have what ever you need at a moments notice.",5,2016,04,15
207,EXEMPLARY SERVICE,My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Shelbourne.  It our first time in Dublin.  We loved the friendliness of the Irish people and the helpfulness of the hotel staff.  Particularly Dennis in the concierge who helped us with local restaurants which proved to be very good.  It luxury on a plate at the Shelbourne and a real treat for us.,5,2016,04,14
207,Wow,Amazing stay in the Shelbourne - home for a school reunion and amazed by how good the hotel was - yes I used Marriott points but - room great - horseshoe bar - just as I remembered it - breakfast (I was a bit fuzzy the morning after the night before) was brilliant and as they say in Ireland it put me right  ,5,2016,04,13
207,Luxurious stay,"Had two beautiful double twin rooms with a view over St Stephen's Green and the Dublin mountains. Rose petals on turn down was a nice touch. great choice of breakfast - buffet or waiter served.
Only disappointment was that the two breakfasts served in the room were cold.
Could do with more seating around the lobby and entrance, especially for people of a maturer age.
Valet staff, Porters and concierge all very helpful.",4,2016,04,13
207,Nice hotel,really nice hotel very clean and comfortable. This place is historic and well kept. Staff is always there to help. We arrived at 4 am room was not ready as the hotel was fully booked the night before the manager on duty got us a coffee pot and cups and brought us to a lounge area with couches and a fireplace which they lit for us so we could try and get some rest.,4,2016,04,12
207,A dream from start to finish,"Staying at the Shelbourne has been on my bucket list for some time. I'm now not sure I ever want to stay anywhere else. The sign of an outstanding hotel is their attention to the little details. The Shelbourne have thought through the entire guest journey and we just had the most fantastic stay. Our room, the breakfast, the bars, the service... I couldn't fault any of it.Thank you.",5,2016,04,12
207,"Lovely Hotel, great ambience, location and staff","I stayed for a couple of nights in the Shelbourne as we had a business meeting in their conference rooms. The bedroom was immaculate, the bed very comfortable, the breakfast was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is located centrally within easy walking distance of temple bar etc. Although as it was raining heavily in the evening we only made it down the road to a local bar. The only slight niggle I had was that the Hotel itself was very warm, but that is something that I tend to find in most hotels these days.",5,2016,04,12
207,Very enjoyable weekend!,"I booked the Shelbourne for my Mum and Dad this weekend to celebrate her Birthday in style. They thoroughly enjoyed their stay remarking on the high standard of service and facilities they received from all staff.
They were very happy with the stay (as they have been in the past) and are looking forward to staying again soon. 

Thank you for a lovely weekend!",5,2016,04,11
207,Full marks.,"Spent weekend of April 8th / 9th at The Shelbourne. We used a voucher for night 1 and extended with an extra night stay.
The highlight was the quality of food and general ambiance in The Saddle Room. 
Our voucher included a meal there and we would not have thought of eating there but for that. That super food experience extended to breakfast in the same restaurant. It was so good that I would consider it a destination in itself for a romantic evening meal or a hearty breakfast when next in town.
The second high point is the entire reception / bar area. The athmosphere is second to none, I know it can be crowded but we were always able to find a seat and yes its not cheap but we felt it was worth it for a special occasion.
Rooms are on the small side, bathroom was huge, Elemis goodies were appreciated.
We used Valet parking. It was efficient and we were allowed to leave our car as long as we liked on the day of checkout.
Overall a lovely experience and its good to be back in love with The Shelbourne after a less than perfect experience on earlier visit.",4,2016,04,11
207,"Good Enough for the Princess of Monaco, You'll like it too!","Did you know you can use your Marriott Points at one of the most famous and luxurious hotels in the United Kingdom? - Somewhere heads of state have stayed and even history was made? - You Can!
The beautiful - The Shelbourne Dublin is considered one of the finest hotels in the UK and perhaps the world. You might want to consider dressing like royalty because you will be treated like it. I'm a BIG Marriott fan, and I've really grown to love some of their most elite properties and the Shelbourne is a shining example of a 1820's era hotel that has been slowly and meticulously upgraded and maintained under the highest of standards. My stay was short, a mere day and a half but I wanted to have a superb time and not have to lift a finger, and the hotel staff made sure I didn't.

The location is perfect, right in the middle of everything.. you can walk to all of the popular sites, Guinness Museum, The Jameson Distillery, St. Michan's Church etc.
or you can enjoy high tea in the opulent tea room or sit and sip a Jameson's in proper style in one of their restful bars. There's even light shopping if you need to add some pretty shiny thing to your trousseau.

The rooms are very traditional, small but very luxurious and in a lovely way almost like being in a fairy tale.

The Shelbourne Dublin is a spectacular destination, as a base of operations for a visit to Dublin or a one night theatre and romantic night in one of the world's most exciting cities, and...you can use your Marriott awards points too!",5,2016,04,10
207,Top Notch Service,"My wife and I were at the Shelbourne Hotel for 3 nights and were very impressed. The hotel is important historically and the management live up to it. 
Also, good new for those who need a good night's rest: the bed in our room was possibly the best in any hotel we've ever been to. 
If you are looking for old fashioned service and quality, the Shelbourne is a great choice. ",5,2016,04,10
207,The Shelbourne Experience,This was a great hotel and one of the most luxurious hotels ever. The staff could not be more than nice and we even had a turn down service. The pool and health club made me feel like I was staying at a Four Seasons. Historic yet Luxurious.,5,2016,04,10
207,High Tea,"The setting, service and food were all top shelf. We have done high tea in many different places. This was wonderful but the price was pretty steep. If price isn't an issue this place is great but probably better value elsewhere. Great location right off the Green ",4,2016,04,09
207,Great service with attentive staff,"I stayed for three days and enjoyed my stay.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The valet parking was very prompt.  The rooms, in particular the queen room, are pretty small.  If there were two people staying in the room you'd struggle to avoid each other.  They are still very nicely appointed and recently renovated.  The King rooms are ""normal"" sized.  The pillows and comfort of bed were pleasant.  
The breakfast service was really good, and the cocktail bar was always buzzing with a great selection of anything you'd want.  

My only complaint was the lack of quiet spaces you could have an impromptu small business meeting.  The guest reading room was booked for a private function the whole time we were there, so we ended with with tablets out in the bar for a few hours.  In the hotels defence, they did offer to a business meeting room, but we didn't think paying for a room for three of us fir a few hours was a good use of money.  ",5,2016,04,09
207,"Elegance, history...a special hotel","LOVE staying at The Shelbourne in Dublin.  One of our all-time favorite hotels.  Great bars, restaurant, lobby, concierge staff.  The only thing we haven't tried yet is the spa...and we can't wait to do that!  It will be our go to hotel for every visit to Dublin...which will hopefully often!",5,2016,04,08
207,"The best of the old with a good mix of
The new","Top of the line service, amazing breakfast, comfortable and Cosy bedroom, amazingly updated bathroom....and to top it all a great view of St Stephen's Park from our bedroom window. This has been a great first experience of Dublin. Definitely one of the best hotels I have stayed in.",5,2016,04,08
207,Old school grand hotel,"I stayed a few nights recently. The rooms are big enough and the beds are really good. The hotel team is very friendly and professional.
What I did not like was the breakfast buffet or the whole breakfast setup. If you book ""full buffet"" for quite hefty 29 € still seems to not include something like an omelett or a pancake. Or at least thats how I understood it. To make a long story short, had breakfast there only once.
Overall 4 stars.",4,2016,04,08
207,Retirement Dinner Celebration,"We booked a table for four at the  Shelbourne Hotel at 1800 hours and we arrived on time. We were met by maitre'd  and taken to our table and seated, within a second a waiter arrived with the menu and then a basket of bread and butter, We were allowed time to study the menu and then the waiter arrived to see if we were ready to order, we ordered our meal , The food was  delicious and the presentation and attention to detail was outstanding, A waitress called Trudy came over to see if we  was ok and my Sister mentioned on passing we were here to celebrate her retirement when we were served our dessert's she arrived and a  plate   was presented to her with a Happy Retirement message written in chocolate and some edibles. We went for the Early Bird Menu and it was more than perfect. Thank you Staff.in the   Shelbourne",5,2016,04,07
207,Afternoon Tea,My wife and I partook of the Shelbourne's Afternoon Tea on Tuesday 5th April. It was a very pleasant experience if a little overpriced at €45 each. The setting was beautiful and the service was first class.,4,2016,04,06
207,Wow,"I stayed here for a night with my family and as soon as I stepped into the lobby I knew the hotel was going to be more than comfortable. The location is perfect as it's in the center of Dublin and our room was beautiful. The staff was also very helpful in giving us ideas for places to eat. This was a splurge, but if you want a nice place to stay in Dublin, I would definitely recommend the Shelbourne. ",5,2016,04,06
207,Magnificence Personified,"Visited last weekend to celebrate a special birthday for my wife.  It had always been on her bucket list, not so much mine, but she was right, from the get go this was a case study in exceptional customer experience.  To start with we were upgraded to the De Valera suite which was superb in terms of size and location.  Through all our interactions with the staff, including booking, reception, dinner (separate review), to house staff to breakfast they couldn't have been nicer, more friendly, professional or obliging - a rare commodity in any business nowadays.",5,2016,04,05
207,FABULOUS!,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for our anniversary. Upon arrival I was told we has been upgraded to a suite overlooking St Stephen's Green Park for free. The suite was absolutely huge & really beautiful, very much old world luxury. The view was gorgeous, being that I am originally from Dublin it was lovely to see the park from a different aspect. The suite had everything you would expect, very large living room with 3 piece suite, 50 inch TV, writing desk, mini bar etc.
The service in the hotel was excellent & the staff were lovely. The swimming pool area is very nice, being in the basement it is very quiet & relaxing, there is a steam room & sauna (no Jacuzzi).
Overall we had a wonderful stay. For those who are not familiar with Dublin you can not get a better location than The Shelbourne!",5,2016,04,05
207,A great classic in a good location,"From friendly helpful staff at check-in and at breakfast, we enjoyed our time at the hotel.  The rooms are plush and comfy.  The dark drapes allowed us to catch up on our sleep!  The National Ireland Rugby team stayed at the hotel.  It was fun to watch the send off on Saturday morning.  After a day of Guiness, I needed a martini and the hotel bar did not disappoint.  Breakfast was a delicious buffet.  Enough to send us out for a day of sightseeing.",5,2016,04,04
207,Love the Shelbourne but there are glitches,"This was our second visit to the hotel having enjoyed two nights there last summer as well.

I do love staying in the hotel because of the location, the luxury and the sheer convenience of it for meeting friends but there are a few things that they could really look to improve on:

1. The halls, corridors, etc. on the actual floors above the lobby are in a pretty tired state by now and need some work if the hotel is really to label itself as top notch. I can't imagine many hotels around the world operating  at a top level that would be ok with wallpaper peeling off parts of the wall in spots of open corridor.

2. The staff service levels vary from excellent (a gentleman in the lobby who went out of his way to accommodate us having a good place to sit down for my pregnant friend who dropped by for tea) to average or below average (one or two staff in the main bar who really let the side down with just a general poor attitude to service or just being generally grumpy and disinterested). It's more the good people on staff that I feel for in this scenario as they are doing their best to give the true Shelbourne experience to guests only to have their colleagues let them down.

3. Where you are seated at breakfast can have a huge impact on how enjoyable it is. In fairness to the staff this is not their fault and, outside of politely asking the one or two extremely rude people who insist on practically shouting at each other across the table regarding their plans for the day to quieten down, the room(s) are what they are (but the last room is far superior to eating at close quarters in the section to the left just past the bar).

Overall it's still a great experience but you are left feeling that the little niggles take some of the shine off it.",4,2016,04,03
207,"Beautiful building, comfortable and central",Have visited here lots of times but stayed with my wife while at a wedding for the first time and really enjoyed it.mthe room was spacious and very comfortable. Breakfast was fantastic and the service is great. Highly recommended.,5,2016,04,03
207,It is not really a 5 star hotel,"We staied a weekend in this hotel. I often visit Dublin, and I usually stay in other 5 star hotel as Fitzwilliams Hotel and the Merrion hotel, but this time I decided to stay at the Shelbourne hotel for the weekend with my family due to the swimming pool. 
 Big mistake because the swimming pool timetable for Children under 16 years is reduced, however the prices for the same children room are the same than for adults.
 One of the elevator areas and even the same elevator smells to cheese, at least during our full weekend.
 The corridors painting, and carpets of the hotel need to be replaced inmediately.
 In me corridor some rooms were being refurnished and smells to constructión. 
 We occupied two rooms for my family, and one of them, the room number 476, perhaps could be ok for a 3 star hotel but was terrible for a 5 star hotel. Very tight room with a noisy heating sistem, probably not allowed by the authorities, at least for human beings who wish to sleep.
 The only really thing ok is the location, but there are more hotels in Dublin with similar location.
 I do not suggest this hotel, there are much better 5 star hotel choices.",2,2016,04,02
207,Fantastic hotel at the very top of my budget,"I stayed at the hotel with my wife and two young children for her 40th birthday, and chose the hotel because of its reputation as one of the finest in Dublin, and its swimming pool.

Our room was fantastic, although the beds were a little on the small side, and the view was made up entirely of concrete (our room was towards the back of the hotel). I could almost wave to some office workers only a few feet away.

Because of the occasion of my wife's 40th, I thought I'd splash out a bit, but I'm not sure it was the best move. Everything in the hotel was so expensive that we ventured out any time we needed to eat or drink. Perhaps you're reading this and thinking 'what did you expect?'; well perhaps you're right, but I have got better overall value for money elsewhere.

That's not to say I don't think it's a fantastic hotel, if you have the money to fully enjoy it.

207,5 Star Service,"Stayed here for Easter weekend. From the minute we entered the lobby to check it, service and staff were top rate. Easter treats were fantastic, room was faultless. Residents bar was again excellent with no need to wait. Breakfast was superb also for service and quality. All in all a superb weekend.",5,2016,04,01
207,Sevice with a Smile,"Returning for the 5th time, we were a little concerned about the possible ongoing exterior renovations, but as Mr. Casey stated, they were completed before our arrival, March 20th. 
From the efficient check-in through the easy check out the staff was service minded.
For instance a technical support person arrived quickly to resolve a problem with the television. 
Our room faced St Stephen's Green and may be in line for some renovation, as the rug seemed tired and worn in a number of spots.
The older concierge, although pleasant, was not really up to date on some of his information. 

Since it was the 100th anniversary of the Easter Uprising, 
we appreciated the fact that the hotel had copies of the Irish Constitution in their museum room as it was drafted at the hotel.  
When you read over our previous 2 reviews you will find more about the excellent location and wonderfully complete breakfast each morning.
Hoping to return again next March to more of  Irish hospitality and service with a smile.",4,2016,04,01
207,Outstanding People on the Staff,"The Shelbourne Dublin may not be the most exclusive hotel in Dublin, but it is the best. It has a long, rich history, beautiful rooms, numerous hotel amenities, but the main reason I love the hotel is the staff.  They are welcoming, courteous, informed, and even remember your name when they see you.  The meals (especially breakfast) are outstanding.  They also have an extensive wine selection.  You can do high tea in the front sitting room and have your choice of two bars. The hotel is always hopping with activity, but there is always a calm and smile among the staff. The Shelbourne is the place to stay in Dublin.  ",5,2016,04,01
207,Glorious Shelbourne,"Stayed here for my daughters 17th birthday.  What a treat this place is.  We loved it.  Not cheap, but got our money's worth! Its seems like the whole of Dublin's society scene gathers here.  The bar is legend as is the Horsehoe bar?  Great room, fabulous breakfast and all round great service.  Will be back when I can afford it again :-)",5,2016,04,01
207,Rennaissance at 57th St - Elegant and Historical,"The Shelbourne Dublin - an elegant hotel in a 200 year-old, historic building.  The décor and furnishings are elegant in the entrance and reception area, beautiful floral arrangements. Elegant king bedroom is adequate with a modern marble bathroom.  The breakfast is buffet with a cold and hot section, where you can order your eggs - porridge with Jameson whiskey.  We had 5 to our party were always able to be accommodated with minimum or no wait time.

The afternoon tea is a must - a selection of 37 types of tea or several types of coffee, sandwiches/canapes followed by wonderful cakes - a take away box is available.

The hotel is across from St. Stephen's Green - a lovely park with a childrens' playground. Merrion Square is close by with elegant Georgian homes around the square - there was a fair the Sunday that we were at the Shelbourne and our 3 year old grandson had a great time.

Good amenities  -  a business center for those who wish to check their e-mails; a Spa and pool which my grandson enjoyed with his grandfather.

The Shellbourne is very centrally located and we were able to walk to Trinity College, Grafton St. shopping, great restaurants, pubs and restaurants.

The staff at the reception area were friendly and helpful, also the concierge gave us great directions and helped in getting a taxi to the airport as we needed one that would accommodate 5 with lots of luggage.

My salute to the services and friendly staff at the Shelbourne.",5,2016,03,30
207,Kingsize Rooms tiny,"Booked in here for one night last at €379 for the night  - without breakfast! That was for an upgraded kingsize room.  I'd hate to have seen the size of the regular double room.  Breakfast was €30 extra per person which we declined.  The bed was comfortable but quilt way too heavy.  Air con was noisy when on but room unbearably hot when off.  Unfortunately I left a top after me but when I called (probably 10 days later) when I discovered it was missing, the person I spoke to said it had not been allocated in our room.  The location is very central with city centre in your doorstep.  The bar is expensive (even for Dublin) but has a great buzz. ",3,2016,03,29
207,Beautiful hotel in good location ,"Hotel Quality-
Beautiful hotel! The lobby, restaurants, tea room, quiet rooms offers hotel guests plenty of places to sit, relax when there is rain outside, which can be often in Dublin. Though the rooms are a little small, they feature a really lovey marble bathroom floors, nice decorations, high shower head, and comfy bed. 

Location-
Awesome! Right across from a St Stephen's park, a nice park and a block away from Grafton, the shopping streets. For a great lunch or breakfast spot, check out Cornucopia for whole foods, vegetarian and vegan foods! 

Service-
Front desk was good. Concierge gave us some mixed information. First, told we would have to walk 10 minutes to get a taxi in the morning at 6am because of the Easter rising parade later that morning, but later said could get a car to take us to that spot to get a taxi from that point. Then in the morning there were taxis outside the hotel and we were able to get right into a taxi to the airport right away, but they were cash only. Overall, was a good experience, but a little more clear information would have been appreciated. Rest of the staff were excellent from the door men, front desk, room service, and housekeepers! ",5,2016,03,29
207,Not as great as I had hoped,"The Shelbourne looks and feels like a 5-star hotel. The lobby is gorgeous and the location right on St. Stephens Green is perfect. We had a wonderful bellman help us when checking in and checking out, and we ordered a lovely meal from room service that arrived quickly and tasted delicious. I'm only giving 3 stars because there were a few things lacking. Our room was very cramped, with two small full beds, and even though I had the temperature control set to the coolest setting, the room was still stuffy and hot. We were not able to use the fitness facility in the morning because it didn't open until 8 a.m. When we realized we had forgotten to pack a personal care item, the staff was unable to help and did not even tell us that there was a 24-hour convenience store a short walk away. Also, when we came out of the hotel at 6:45 am looking for a taxi, there were no bellmen on duty. We were able to find a taxi on our own, but for the price of this hotel we shouldn't have needed to do that. I realize these are picky little things, but when I stay at a hotel of this caliber, I expect every little detail to be taken care of, and in this instance it wasn't. ",3,2016,03,28
207,Luxury in Dublin,"Where the rich and famous congregate.  No detail spared and great for people watching. We had the added bonus of watching the Irish rugby team leave the hotel for their match with Italy and enjoyed a jog at St Stephens Green across the street. Great concierge as well. 

The negative was that the room was hot and the temperature control didn't do much on floor six. Not cool for the price. Otherwise impressive hotel. 

",4,2016,03,28
207,Beautiful old hotel,"I know it's a busy time so we made a reservation months in advance, when checking in we were told that our room wasn't available yet but for an upgrade fee we could have a much nicer room. I gladly paid an upgrade with expectations of a great room, if this was much nicer can't imagine what the original was like. The bathroom had been recently upgraded and was great, very large, a true 5 star. The bedroom, on the other hand, was old and in need of a refit, the mattress was old ( I slept closest to the door in a hole), the bed barely fit and the dresser had been outfitted with a mini-bar so no space for clothes. The closet would fit one days clothing for a couple. We planned to stay two weeks so we cut our stay and moved to a nearby hotel that offered us a very large suite for less that I was charged for a base unit here. The room was so old the floor sloped by more that 4 inches from end to end, so bad glasses kept falling off of the bar. The 5 star status is predicated on the facilities and while herself enjoyed the spa next door none of the restaurants, tea rooms or bars could be used unless you wanted to do  hand-to-hand combat to get served. The locals all know the hotel lost it's 5 star status and they also quote the amount spent to regain the status, based on this fact I'm sure most of the rooms are really great they just forgot to update the room we stayed in.",2,2016,03,27
207,Very Good,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights. The room was big enough for my family, myself, husband and teenaged son. The beds were comfortable and the room quiet. Upon arrival we were met by a smartly dress doorman but when entering the building I was disappointment that the lobby was not grander, perhaps at one time it was big and beautiful but I found a entry way surrounded by 3 bars/restaurants. As you travel farther in the hotel you will find the front desk with a table and a 4 chairs.  One of my favorite things to do is to spend some time in the lobby of a big hotel after a day of sightseeing, it is not possible here. Again this is a nice hotel but I fell for the hype of it being a historic grand hotel and it just didn't feel any different then a hotel that was built 10 years ago. The location is good, we often walked to Grafton Street and Temple Bar, the WIFI worked great. The water pressure was not great. It was a little underwhelming for a Renaissance hotel.",4,2016,03,27
207,Friendliest Hospitality,"From the time we pulled up in front of the Shelbiurne Dublin we were welcomed by a smiling, friendly, young man.  Our baggage was unloaded and we were taken to check in desk. During the quick check in process we were offered fresh lemonade. We were asked if we would like to have dinner reservations made or if we needed anything.
The room was a typical hotel room size. However there was a fully stocked fridge and water at the bedside.  All bath products provided. Most important were the very comfortable beds.  
We ate dinner in the restaurant and the food was excellent along with the service.  Thank you Molly for providing such a relaxing ,enjoyable dinner experience!
We will be returning!",5,2016,03,27
207,Luxury at its best,"From check in to check out, everything was amazing. Everyone from was so welcoming and helpful throughout the trip. I would like to specifically thank Jack at reception who was very helpful when making our dinner reservation and giving us tips on what to do in Dublin. I would recommend everyone to stay here.",5,2016,03,24
207,Night away with herself,"My Wife and I headed to the Shelbourne for a night away from the kids and oh boy was it worth every penny. The hotel is fantastic, the staff are so helpful and our room was huge with a huge bathroom and separate toilet. We had afternoon tea which was a lovely treat (but i would suggest share one between two people too much food) Location Location Location perfect",5,2016,03,24
207,The Best there is in Dublin,You will feel like royalty! Feels like pure luxury and worth every penny! We were there for a week in March 2016. You are not going to find better accommodations in Dublin. Across the street from a beautiful park and wonderfully located for a little of everything. BTW- Starbucks is right downstairs and opens quite early!  We had High Tea there and was a wonderful experience (even served me gluten free cakes!) Also a highlight is the Champagne bar in the lobby- beautiful and a lovely place to sip after a long day  of touring Ireland.,5,2016,03,23
207,a very elegant step back in time with all the convenience of a modern hotel,"We staid at the Shelbourne hotel, near most of the sights, a historical hotel taken over by Marriott :  it is like taking an elegant step back in time with all the convenience of a modern hotel.   The service is impeccable,. The staff could not be more helpful.  

The rooms are very traditional but the beds and the bathroom are not. The amenities are the best.  Nice warm towels. Turn down service.  The double windows protects one from the noise if you overlook the park.  At the same time, the windows can still be open if you are so inclined.  WIFI works well and is free.  You can hook as many devices as you want. 

The breakfast can be buffet style (abundant) or a la carte. Delicious toasts are served with coffee.  The breakfast is served in a suite of smaller rooms. If you like to see daylight in the morning, keep walking till you see it.  And of course, if you tempted by high tea, it is served in the afternoon.  The two bars are alive and well. 

I am a jogger and St Stephen’s Green across the street is a perfect spot to stretch your legs.    There is also a pool and a spa but I did not have a chance to use it. 

if having a view is important for you, make sure to mention it when you make your reservation as many of them do not have one.  A room with a view on St Stephen's Green comes with a significant price increase.",5,2016,03,23
207,Top notch!,"This place was top notch.  I arrived early (5am) on a Saturday and got right into a room,  upgraded me and accommodated every need we had.  The food was great even though I only had breakfast there and no Mamosa's but that's fine.  Location was great,  walking distance to everything.  I would def recommend this hotel!",5,2016,03,23
207,"Beautiful, Historic, and Wonderful Staff","This hotel was an incredible experience. We spent 2 nights here on a tour of Europe and loved it. 

The staff is obviously proud to work here. On arrival, we were offered a glass of homemade lemonade which was delicious and refreshing. The staff told us history of the hotel and also pointed out the small museum in the lobby. 

The room was nice and updated. Bathroom in beautiful marble and very nice comfortable beds. Our view was nothing special, but it certainly was in the best part of the city. 

What a great location for a hotel! The staff were all very well trained and helped us get a great amount of business done overseas. We had a drink in both the lounge and the bar which were really nice and very prompt, trained staff that were extremely professionals. 

As Marriott Gold members we were treated to free breakfast and 2 free drinks. I must say this was amazing! Breakfast was probably the best spread of food I have ever seen in a hotel. Amazing service once again. 

I would highly recommend this hotel. Would return anytime I'm in Dublin!",5,2016,03,23
207,"Upscale, perfectly located hotel",Hotel is right on St. Stephens Green Park. Maybe 1-2 blocks from Grafton Street. Maybe 15 min walk to O'Connell Street Bridge. Hotel is beautifully decorated and spacious rooms. Super breakfast about 27 euros for the buffet breakfast.,5,2016,03,22
207,"Grand Old Hotel, Modern Conveniences","Not many hotels have their own history room - the Irish Constitution was drafted here in 1922. Marriott updated the hotel in 2007 and although it's a gathering place for elites, it functioned well for me on a business trip. Staff excellent, Concierge very helpful, beds quite good, internet speed acceptable. The grand staircase was my way to the room - such a great atmosphere. The gym/spa is part of the building, has indoor pool, reasonably equipped. Food and drinks good; predictably expensive. Location is fine for access to city center, National Museum next door, just about everything close, a few extra minutes to/from airport through congested streets. Some rooms are smaller than others. A few minor hiccups - a noisy gathering in the ""Reading Room"", a little challenging to find a table on special weekends, but overall this is a classic, excellent place. Will return.",5,2016,03,21
207,Cinematic Hotel Experience,"When you see movies that feature nice hotels, you always wonder ""when will I be able to experience this?"" Book a night or two in the Shelbourne, and you have your answer. This hotel is straight out of the silver screen it seems. Central location in the city gives access to activities, shopping, restaurants, and more. The staff are well-trained. The hotel bar is popping on Friday nights. 

I enjoyed this hotel a great deal. When you first check in, the sticker shock for the room is high. But It is a nice hotel in a capital city. Make sure to get the best rate available, then you can truly enjoy your time. Head next door to the museums, or go across to St Stephen's Green. 

I am a big Marriott guy, so that is a plus. I will say, the hallways are very windy. And it seems they have a key issue. Our keys were blanked out 8 times in two days. Also parking is pricey. The logistics of getting in and out of the hotel are difficult, but the bellboys are quick to help. Our AC did not work, but they were quick to fix it.",5,2016,03,20
207,Great Hotel,"I recently visited the Shelbourne for business in January.  We arrived on. Saturday afternoon for working group session set for Sunday.  The entire hotel was alive with energy on a Saturday night with couplesome and families heading out to enjoy the Dublin nightlife.

On Sunday we used one of the stately conference rooms for a team session.  the accommodations and food were a perfect fit.

  The rooms were very nice, the food excellent and the location is truly perfect.",5,2016,03,19
207,Don't go out of your way,"Very busy Sunday lunchtime. Will tell you they don't take reservations for the bar but in reality they hold tables for favoured or regular guests.
Food is overpriced and the hotel is living on its reputation of old. I won't be rushing back anytime soon.",3,2016,03,15
207,Beautifully updated buzzy hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Lovely very comfortable room although ours was rather small if you had a lot of luggage,as we were here for a long weekend it didn't matter comfortable beds.Bathroom although small had a great shower. There was a kettle for making tea or coffee if you wished. Breakfasts were superb.",5,2016,03,15
207,Amazing place,"Wow  what a beautiful place. Had a bit of a Julia Roberts pretty woman experience. Whisked away from our cab by the bell hops and an Irish Gentleman in a top hat and tails. Our room wasn't ready so they brought us into a quiet bar for drinks on the house. We were the only onces until Pierce Bronson came in at sat next to us in the next booth. I assume he was in town to see the big soccer game.
Our room was small but beautiful with the most amazing bathroom. We only stayed one night but it was amazing.",5,2016,03,14
207,Great location,"I chose this hotel for the location (not for the price!). The room was relatively small as expected but nicely furnished. The bathroom was clean and there is a turn down service which is of course a nice touch but absolutely unnecessary. The bathroom was small but very clean and included nice products. Bath robes, slippers, tea/coffee facilities and iron are all available in room. The best part was the absolute absence of noise in the morning i.e no cleaning staff etc. The check in staff were very helpful and friendly. I would rate it a 5 but for the price. ",4,2016,03,13
207,Wonderful stay.,"The Shelbourne never lets us down. This was our third stay at the hotel and the standard improves with each visit. Jack, on Front of House went beyond the call of duty, very professional and helpful. I had the most relaxing facial with Stephanie. A fantastic therapist and a credit to the Spa. Can't wait to stay  again. Thank you Shelbourne for making my hectic  life stress free.",5,2016,03,13
207,Another fantastic stay at the Shelbourne,"The Shelbourne never disappoints - all the staff are lovely and very attentive without being overly so and the rooms we have stayed in have been really nice, very clean with very comfortable beds.  Our recent stay in a deluxe room booked through Trip Advisor was especially nice and large and was very good value as it was booked well in advance, the cost also included breakfast.  The location could not be better as it is right in the centre of Dublin, parking is also no problem as your car gets taken from you on arrival but it will cost you 29 euro.",5,2016,03,12
207,A great start to our honeymoon-,"Well, The Shelbourne was a slice of history and romance we were looking for. The hotel staff were fantastic, especially Liene who made it extra special with all her touches. Looking forward to returning to the hotel for another special occasion. Thank you for the beautiful memories we have.. :)",5,2016,03,12
207,"Great place, no complaints","This place has everything you'd want - great location, great service, great accommodations. Recognize plat inum members with  complimentary breakfast which is very good. Nice gym and spa available to guests also. Have stayed several times and plan to return",5,2016,03,12
207,did not live up to expectations,"Room very small and stuffy, shower grubby with broken tiles and scum marks around base. Attention to detail just not there from a hotel that goes on about how they pride themselves on leaving nothing to chance. The finish was just not there. Dinner was ok but only ok for the price. Would have expected that in a restaurant of this rating a basic thing like serving the cheese board at room temperature and not cold from the fridge would be a given. the breakfast was like a cattle mart and food was cold. when we asked for our food to be heated to a hot temperature in the microwave we were frowned on by the waiting staff as if we had committed a crime, same thing when we asked what cheeses had been delivered on the cheese board, no indication of what had been served and we were nothing short of being sniggered at by the waiter. I have no problem paying the prices this hotel demands however I expect to some basic expectations to be met.",3,2016,03,08
207,Amazing hotel!,"The Shelbourne is a wonderful hotel! It is so close to everything, I can't imagine not staying here next time we are in Dublin.
The restaurants and bars at the hotel were all great, plus you are within walking distance of many pubs and restaurants.
Our room was super clean and luxurious.
(Watch out for the glass partition in the bathtub/shower though...it does move)
The hotel is very gluten-free friendly.
There's a convenience store right around the corner and the hotel is within walking distance of just about everything.
There's a fantastic park right across the street from the Shelborne. It reminded us of a smaller NYC Central Park.
The hotel offers an afternoon tea. The hotel is very beautiful, lots of chandeliers, and it was nice to sit by the fireplace in the lobby at night.
We would definitely stay here again. It was a joy & great experience to stay here!

",5,2016,03,08
207,A Most beautiful hotel,"I honestly couldn't have asked for a better stay. The staff the ambience and most impressively the food I couldn't recommend a more delightful hotel right in the centre of the city. The facilities available are also brilliant, one of the best hotels in Dublin by far.  ",5,2016,03,08
207,"A very special hotel, a very special experience.","From the moment we drove up to the hotel we knew we were in for a first class experience. The staff were so attentive, efficient and warm. Our car was valet parked and our luggage was transported to reception quick step! 
We were greeted at reception by a very helpful and courteous staff who informed us of a room upgrade! What a start! The chilled lemon water served at reception was most refreshing and most welcome.
Our room was a Heritage room overlooking Kildare Street. It was a beautiful room, recently redecorated and designed. It was luxurious, a real palatial pad. The King size bed was impressive as were the furniture and fittings. 
The marble bathroom was something else! We felt like royalty every time we entered. The bathroom was spacious and cool with a bath and a shower. 
Fragrant shampoos and shower gels added another dimension, as did the soft and generous towels. 
The flat screen smart TV was of top quality, as to be expected.
We would highly recommend a stay in this magnificent hotel, a gem of Dublin city.",5,2016,03,07
207,Disappointing ,"Very disappointed with our stay in the Shelbourne. Had heard so much about the fantastic 'experience' to be had at the hotel. On arrival the check-in area was chaotic. We requested an early check in as we were attending an event early that day, understandably that couldn't be guaranteed, however the staff implied that I hadn't requested it. Ended up going to a neighbouring hotel where a family member was staying to get ready. The staff member said he would call me immediately when the room was ready, I am still a awaiting that phone call. The hotel was extremely stuffy and uncomfortable. The room was ok, but not as luxurious as expected. On arrival to breakfast I was surprised to see that it was self service. The prices charged for breakfast are astounding. On leaving the hotel, the door man handed me the keys to my car and offered no assistance with our bags. After anticipating this stay for quite a while I was extremely disappointed . ",1,2016,03,03
207,Great location.Step back in time with this historic hotel,"Step back in time with this historic hotel. The décor is 1900 ish and afternoon tea is a tradition. I believe that we had one of the more basic rooms and properly wasn’t value for money as we paid a lot but cant fault the hotel I guess that is supply and demand. 

Service and foot both excellent.  The hotel is old fashioned and might not be to some peoples taste. Walking distance of most sights you don’t need a car on a city break in Dublin just use taxis. 

We took our 10 weeks old baby and two year old with us and the hotel welcomed our children. Due to the nature of the hotel and the price point most guests where older without children so always felt a little out of place with our children but as I said the hotel were most welcoming.  The restaurants all had a kids menu and even a children’s afternoon tea!  

There is a step outside which was a pain for heavy twin stroller and I guess would be the same for a wheel chair but door staff where used to helping people overcome this slight access issue.  I noted that they did have a wheel chair lift which I guess we could have used. 

Free wifi worked well in most of the hotel, only has issue in the bar one night when hotel was full and im guessing wifi was just overused. No problems with wifi in the room. 

If money is no object, then this is the hotel to stay at in Dublin.",5,2016,03,03
207,Beautiful and great location ,"Beautiful old hotel that is located within walking distance  to many historical buildings.  Also right across the street from Green bus which is hop on and off tour of city bus.

Hotel has spacious rooms. Instant hot  water with plenty of pressure. Has 110 volts in some plugs. Service is excellent and rooms are very quiet. First class all the way. 

Highly recommend. Food is excellent. ",5,2016,03,03

207,One of the top hotels in Dublin,"The Shelbourne Dublin is my favorite hotel when I go to Dublin.  The staff is great bunch of very professional yet friendly people, the location is great and the hotel itself is full of history.  Although the hotel is considered a historical landmark, the rooms are elegant and not dated at all. I have top tier status with both SPG and Marriott and the Westin Dublin is very nice but to me there is simply no comparison. If you have elite status with Marriott hotels, this is definitely one hotel you need to consider. I am not sure when is my next trip back to Dublin but I will certainly pick the Shelbourne as my first choice.",5,2016,03,01
207,Everything I hoped for and more!,"Had the pleasure of staying at the Shelbourne for one night at the end of Feb. I was mesmerized by the ""old world"" glam that radiated from pictures online and I definitely wasn't disappointed! Everything about this hotel exudes glamour and elegance. It feels like you are stepping back in time and into another world, right from when you see the bellman outside in his top hat and long coat
The service was absolutely fabulous. The reception staff were friendly, polite and efficient. The concierge were patient with our endless questions and helped us plan our weekend in Dublin. They even managed to get us a reservation at a Michelin Star restaurant last minute, even though it was Saturday. 
The room was stunning and so big! Beautifully fitted with the softest beds and fluffiest pillows. We really felt like princesses! 
We hadn't booked breakfast with our room as we planned to head out on the town first thing, but when we saw the spread we couldn't resist! All the staff were great but especially the manager, who came and checked on us many times to ensure everything was alright. The staff in the lobby cafe (I believe it was called Mayor's Lounge) were equally great.
There really aren't enough warm things that can be said about this hotel. If you are looking for a special treat and a true experience then this is the place for you!",5,2016,03,01
207,"""Magical experience""","From start to finish this hotel was such a lovely experience, three of us had a triple room booked with breakfast and dinner included.
We arrived at hotel early and at the reception they made it there business to get our room ready as soon as possible which was great as we were only staying one night, the room was the Earl of shelbourne suite it was perfect, the room was spotless nothing was out of place, the beds were unbelievably comfy, the sitting room was so relaxing, there was two big flat screen TVs in each room, the bathroom was beautiful I could have lived in it!! We had a dinner reservation for 7.30 and the food was more the perfect and the service was excellent, everybody made you feel so welcome! The breakfast was also the last word! We were celebrating two birthdays and they could not have done enough for us, we look forward to  staying in the shelbourne again very soon!",5,2016,03,01

207,Completely lived up to my expectations,Gorgeous entrance despite the work being done and very quick check in.We had booked a queen room but were disappointed not to find a bath (the case with all queen rooms)but we were quickly upgraded to a King. Rooms are kept immaculate and well supplied by double service during the day. Did not use the main restaurant as we ate in it for breakfast and although the food and service was top notch we didnt like the murky ambience for an expensive evening meal but booked and loved our meal in the smaller restaurant.Also ate in the bar and although busy found service for food and drink very quick.Enjoyed the history room too.,5,2016,02,28

207,Good hotel with lot of history behind it ...,"Firstly I landed at the hotel fairly quickly (courtesy airline chauffeur service) and my class of suite was not available ... overbooking I guess which has become common because of many travelers to Dublin nowadays. I did not bother because it was a short stay.

Check-in was smooth and as you reach the elevators, one sees a television screen showing famous figures who stayed at Shelbourne since decades. That's the bit of long history of this hotel. Also hotel was undergoing renovation at that time but it was well managed.

Entering the room -- the size was decent for a big city but to my surprise, there was a welcome note, a box of chocolates and some complimentary sparkling water awaiting me. Basics were covered like good bed and pillows, bath tub and shower with good amenities.

What I missed was a good working table but given that this was not a modern hotel I had to manage. The other minor quib was one has to remove kettle from wardrobe area and plug it on the tables.  

Location is great -- get out of the hotel and the doorman helps you with a cab for travel. Walking on the street there are many options for food from pubs, restaurants, mini markets. One sees streets being busy even late at night.

Next trip -- if it is personal travel, I would prefer it to soak in the history and experience. But for business travel, I would prefer to stay in one of the modern hotels.",4,2016,02,27

The afternoon tea is a delightful way to spend an afternoon even though you need to book it weeks in advance. The pool is lovely and there is a good gym area. Breakfast was a massive buffet full of healthy and not so healthy options. I wish I had dinner there too, the menu looked great. Cocktails in the bar are a must even if you just try one. Valet parking was very reasonable at €29. I had a great stay in the heart of Dublin. The hotel is so lovely.",5,2016,02,27
207,Beautiful Hotel ,"Located across Steven's Green this is a great hotel. 

I only stayed two nights, wish I could have stayed longer. They were performing renovations on the exterior of the hotel during my stay. The staff fully informed me of the occluded view and apologized ahead of time. I appreciated their concern and told them it was fine. 

I was given the choice to upgrade to a bigger room if I didn't mind the above. I choose to upgrade. Very pleased that I did, beautiful large room. 

Thanks, I'll be back.

207,Celebrated our wedding anniversary,"a lovely treat in a brilliant setting. Staff were so accommodating and welcoming right from stopping our car, which was then taken away and returned once we gave 40 minutes warning. We were kindly upgraded and  a plate with macrons delivered to our room wishing us a happy anniversary. The hotel is old world standards yet not pompous the decor is like out of Hollywood. The setting a stone throw from Grafton Street and St Stephan's Green caterers for all tastes and interest, not to mention access to some of some of Dublin's top restaurants.
We had dinner in the saddle room which is casual dining so caters for everyone. The waiter was excellent and informative re the dishes and helped with the wine selection. We went for ala carte menu. A lovely meal however the monk fish was a bit lonely in a consommé served with jacket potatoes on the side. 
Breakfast on the other hand was not five star, no nuts or seed or banana .  The self service bar with usual culpits bacon sausage tomato and mushrooms and scrambled egg that looked more like a bad omelette. The food was not hot or freshly cooked. I do believe for 32 euro a hot breakfast should be hot and preferably served to the table. We had had better breakfast in three star hotel for a fraction of the costs, such a pity to spoil a five star experience",5,2016,02,25
207,Lovely stay,Lovely comfortable bed.  Friendly staff.  Good atmosphere.  Great location.  Very big bathroom with lovely shower.  Good breakfast.  Fantastic decor.  Very busy on Sunday morning so glad we used Express checkout.  Room was not very big but was comfortable with street view.  ,5,2016,02,23
207,Very enjoyable brilliant stay.,"Our stay was purely for pleasure & was a treat for my birthday from my wife. Therefore, something better than average was required. We certainly had that here. From the first greeting received from the doorman all the way our stay was brilliant.
The location of reception is not immediately obvious, but that's no problem as the attentive staff instantly noticed we needed guidance & carried our bags to the desk. I know you'll say that in a hotel of this standard it's what you'd expect, but it was done seamlessly. Our room was ready (a queen room) but we were offered the option of an upgrade at a modestly higher cost. We declined, but nice to be offered the option. The room was lovely in all respects. There was no view, but we don't care about that. We don't visit a new city & sit in a hotel room looking out! We had a minor issue with the shower door, so reported it to reception on the way to breakfast, and by the time we got back after eating it was fixed. Great service.
The food is amazing, no matter what you choose, be it basic or fancy.
Drinks on offer is mostly impressive. Although, as a real ale fan, only one bitter is not great but at least it is a decent pint. Guinness is there of course, but I don't like it!
I could go on with superlatives but you'll all be getting bored. 
Let me round off with one good, one not so good comment.
Good - all the staff are fantastic but there was one young lady who helped us above & beyond what could be expected when we were in a pickle ( I kick myself for not noting her name for certain. Jeanna or Jenna maybe?).
Not so good - and this is the worst I can come up with - the choice of artworks in a lot of the public spaces is terrible. But as that's purely personal, nobody is going to consider this an issue are they ?!

207,Wonderful Experience,"A lovely stay at the Shelbourne. The hotel had great ambience. Room was nice with a comfortable bed and large, modern bathroom.  Breakfast was perfect.  Hotel staff recommended eating breakfast early since the restaurant can get very busy from 9 to 11.  We were very thankful for this recommendation and were able to beat the rush.  
Great location.  Very close to shops and of course the pubs!",5,2016,02,22
207,First Class Experience in Dublin,"The Shelbourne is a wonderful hotel opposite St.Stephen's Green. The beds are very comfortable and the room was spotless as expected.

We had breakfast which was top class. Breakfast staff were very helpful and the pancakes were delicious. 

We decided to make use of the swimming pool. As I had a child with me, I checked the room guidebook which said that children were welcome from 8-5pm on a Sunday but when we arrived, we were told it was 10am. We returned to our room and did go back at 10am but it is worth noting, that there is an error in the room guide so if you have small ones it is 10am. (Have attached photo of page in the guidebook)

We did enjoy our stay, staff are very friendly and helpful.",4,2016,02,21
207,Classic chic and outstanding service,the location is perfect;  the classic and chic atmosphere are the perfect background for a business trip or a vacation. The bar provides great food & drinks for single travelers or friends to gather. I enjoyed the indoor pool to recover from jet lag.,5,2016,02,21
207,A small business/pleasure trip,"What can I say The Shelbourne is quite simply stunning. On a arrival our car was whisked away and our bags carried through to reception. First impressions are very important and this place carries this off with consummate ease. The staff were friendly and helpful and nothing seemed to much trouble. On entering our room it was amazing everything you could desire from a luxury hotel. Clean crisp sheets, a huge bed and a very tastefully decorated ensuite bathroom, bags of wardrobe space ..... the list goes on. Breakfast was also a delight with all the usual on offer and if you couldn't see it you just asked. I can't wait to visit again in the very near future.",5,2016,02,21
207,Birthday stay,My wife and I stayed in the Shelbourne recently and I have to say it was top class. From the moment we arrived we were treated to a five star experience. The receptionist Jack was particularly friendly. Our room was outstanding and the breakfast is out of this world (try the Omelette or the pancakes!). The only flaw and I mean the only one was that the leisure centre doesn't have a jacuzzi (but that's being picky!). Overall it was a brilliant experience. ,5,2016,02,21
207,Superb,"Love staying in this hotel. Friendly staffs, great food, the ambiance, in the center of everything.  Won't change a thing. Our room overlooked the greenerys. Pricey but worth it!  It has 4 restaurants and all has something different to offer.",5,2016,02,20
207,Great place to stay! ,"Another fab stay..living at the Shelbourne for next couple of weeks so will review each room! 

This was a heritage room on the 2nd floor (256) was a great size with dedicated bag area! 

Love there slippers so comfy also a free shoe shine service which could be convenient.  

This room had plenty of space with a separate toilet and separate room for the bath and shower. Lots of lovely products including lovely bath salts the perfect thing after a long day working!! 

Gym staff very friendly and was nice and quite so got a good swim and workout in... Only drawback is no jacuzzi.

Room disadvantage: card deactivates very easy / No fridge space for milk or lunch etc! 

Tip: online check in didn't work and no advantage as your required to queue for your room key... Always a very fast checkin service. ",5,2016,02,19
207,Excellent service again.,"Yet another wonderful stay at Dublin's best hotel. Great ambience. Luxury room with lovely firm bed and good linen. 
Amazing breakfast with very helpful waitress who can't do enough for you. 
Great location close to shops and of course pubs! ",5,2016,02,18
207,Lovely hotel,This hotel is lovely but do not make the mistake i did and not request a view. Our room looked out over the rubbish tip which I did not expect for the steep price and I was awoken both mornings of our stay before 6am by glass bottles being launched in to the skip! disappointing for £250 a night.,3,2016,02,18
207,Absolutely Divine!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Shelbourne for a couple of nights over the Valentine's day weekend. While most of our fellow guests were couples on romantic holiday, we were quite comfortable all the same. The hotel couldn't have been more accommodating; we were completely spoiled with a lovely room, warm, comfortable common spaces, and doting staff to ensure our every need and want was met.

You would never know we were staying 'on (Marriott) points'; we were treated like celebrities.

The Shelbourne was definitely the premiere accommodation of our 10 days in Europe.  Well done!",5,2016,02,18
207,Overrated!!!!,"We stayed at the Shelbourne in January, when we arrived at we where met by a sea of people we literally had to fight our way to reception, had arrived early so room wasn't ready so we went out for a while. Got checked in to our room which was the Premium heritage King room very small but the bathroom was a better size. Decided to have some lunch but we couldn't get anything to eat because all the restaurants where fully booked so fought our way through to the bars but couldn't get a seat anywhere even in the lobby.
Wouldn't recommend this hotel for a relaxing break. Would like to give a special mention for Rachel in the dining room who we found to be the best thing about the hotel.",2,2016,02,18
207,Heaven on earth.  Best location in Dublin,If you can afford only one night check in early and enjoy the sheer pleasure.  Ask for a view of St Stephens Green.  Enjoy a Hennessy Brandy in the Olde World Bar.  Kick off your shoes and relax in the retro furniture.  Have tea and scones with strawberry jam and fresh cream. They have their own florist and  I know her family personally.  She is a TV star now.  Everything is magnificent.  The porter carries your bags.  You have room service with a smile.  The restaurant has fab food and it is not that pricey.  You are one minute from Grafton Street...Dublin most upmarket street.  Lots of famous people stayed here including President Obama s wife and daughters.  I had my wedding here..  Once you have been here you will love the earthy feeling and world charm.  Please don't waste your time looking any where else for even one night in Dublin.  Food excellent.  All around treat.  Lots more here that I have not mentioned. Please go here and let us know how you get on. You can get a taxi outside the door to local train station.  From here you can go to lovely areas on the Irish Riveria.  Perhaps Dalkey on the Southside or Howth on Northside.  Here you will get nice hotels and B and B. Beside the sea with wonderful pubs and good restaurants to choose from.  All in all The Shelbourne is the place to start after a flight or trip from country.  Car parking available also.  The bar is open to locals and people socialising in Dublin.  The buzz is fantastic and the Guinness is super.  Everyone is tell trained and you will not encounter any unsolved problems. You can use the taxi to get to Temple Bar but my advice don t  bother going there. The Shelbourne cannot be beaten.,5,2016,02,17
207,Easily the best luxury hotel I've stayed in,"There are lots of luxury hotels, but the Shelbourne oozes traditional glamour effortlessly. It really is quite special.

The staff cannot do enough for you and make you feel like their most valued guest from the moment you arrive. My partner is covered in tattoos and often gets stared at or treated with condescension as a result. The very first time we walked into the Shelbourne lobby 18 months ago, the Manager walked straight over and shook his hand and welcomed him. We were so impressed and it this first impression has made us feel truly welcome ever since.

The food is amazing and well priced, we have enjoyed romantic anniversary dinners in the Saddle Room, sumptuous breakfasts and wonderful room service.  On occasion the breakfasts can be busy with a short queue to be seated, but guests are immediately found a table in the lounge to wait for a few minutes until a breakfast table is available, with whatever drink they would prefer. Not a hardship in such lovely surroundings. 

The only way I can describe the rooms is pure old school luxury. We have stayed in 3 different types of room now, most recently a stunning suite for Valentines night overlooking St Stephens Park which was bigger than most apartments! Your feet sink into the carpets, the curtains are thick heavy brocade, the bathrooms divine... I really cannot praise the rooms highly enough. 

I love this place and cannot wait for our next visit to celebrate our 2nd anniversary in October. We have become quite emotionally attached to the place! Thank you to the Shelbourne staff as always.",5,2016,02,16
207,Fantastic hotel! ,"Location perfect.... Everything within 15 mins walk and where it was further you had the choice of taxi or Tour bus stops within a 1 minute walk of the hotel 
Staff helpful and kind. The Room was immaculate and comfortable. Breakfast brought to your room was a lovely option!
Bars have great atmosphere, plenty to choose from drinks wise and bar food was spot on!
Restaurant Breakfast was perfect and there was plenty to choose from.
I would recommend this hotel to those that wanting to do Dublin in style! Excellent break and we will be back again soon for certain!

207,"Amazing, amazing, amazing!!","We stayed in The Shelbourne for 2 nights over Valentines weekend. It was amazing. This hotel goes above and beyond to please. From the time we pulled up outside to the time we left. Every member of staff here had big smiles, Helina who check us in was extremely helpful and polite, and Leslie from bar No.27 makes the most amazing cocktails.  We didn't dine at The Saddle Room for dinner but will definitely do so when we return. Breakfast is amazing also, and even though we did have to wait for a table we were seated in The Lord Mayors Lounge beside a huge roaring fire, what more could you ask for! The room was spacious, warm and couldn't have asked for anything more. Valet parking was prompt. Looking forward to returning here soon. ",5,2016,02,16
207,Could be better,"We stayed here for a night and we were left feeling underwhelmed. I am basing my experience here to my stay at the Merrion Hotel around the corner and i don't feel like the Shelbourne are on top form.  The lady who checked us in didn't smile once but our room was very comfortable, the bathroom is impressive and there was fluffy gowns to wear down to the spa. We received a gift of chocolates delivered to the room which was nice but it was addressed to the wrong person.  
We went to the pool the next morning before breakfast, great sauna and steam room. The breakfast queue was building by 10 am, fabulous breakfast selection but once again staff were not smiling or warm, they made a show of me ordering a smoothie which was extra on top of the B&B rate which I think is crazy considering how much you are paying to stay in the hotel. 
i will stay in the Merrion Hotel next time or the Fitzwilliam",4,2016,02,16
207,Dreadful. Avoid as a huge disappointment.,"Just such a disappointment:
- had requested an early check in (a mere 1 hour before time) - wasn't available but offered an upgrade for another €60 on top of a high rate, when I said no he suddenly ""found"" a room that was ready
- no restaurant table available for in house dining - even though we said we could eat any time of the evening. Understandably busy but a pre-stay email/phone call or holding some tables for residents would be normal and best practice
- room ordinary with view onto uninspiring courtyard and building works
- returned for post dinner drinks in residents lounge - drab unwelcoming room - girl in the residents bar refused to get us drinks and said we had to get them ourselves - was rude. We asked for supervisor and she allegedly went and checked and said the supervisor confirmed we should get the drinks ourselves. So far from 5 star service!
- went to bar - ordered two cocktails and they were delivered about 10 mins apart. Bar staff rude and surly. Another guest beside me told the bar man he was rude and he continued to be rude! 
- Letter in the bedroom basically said the hotel couldn't cope with breakfast numbers so order it to your room (unwelcoming letter from ""Guest relations"" or some other mysterious department).
- Ordered breakfast to the room - breakfast late so we had to ring down. Eventually arrived and order was wrong - response was that I had filled out the form incorrectly. I had not. 
- Paid invoice on TV as we were running late due to late breakfast. Before leaving room checked TV again to make sure zero and charges had been reapplied to bill. Rang down to sort over phone and told we would have to go to desk. Explained that we were running late (due to late breakfast) and could we sort over phone to avoid queues - got told no as they were too busy at reception. 
- went to reception - after queuing and delays at reception eventually confirmed zero balance. 

No manager present at any stage of all the above. Complete absence of anyone who cares. Have stayed in the Westbury and the Fitzwilliam - both utterly charming and in an equally brilliant location. Avoid the Shelbourne at all costs - it is very far removed from 5 star.",1,2016,02,15
207,Excellent hotel,"Very helpful and friendly staff with beautiful large rooms. The bar at the hotel is also lovely. Great overall experience and very central, with the park across the road and restaurants and bars/pubs near by. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,02,13
207,Rugby weekend away.,"We used this grand old hotel as a hub during last weekends 6 nations rugby and it certainly didn't disappoint. Yes if you looked hard there were a few niggles but nothing that you wouldn't of thought trivial!

Rooms are comfortable, spacious and well designed. Bars very lively with great atmosphere, dining room serves a chateaubriand to die for! Along with an extensive 'old world' wine list and good breakfast.

Service is quietly efficient and unobtrusive.

Thank you we will be back SOON!",5,2016,02,09
207,Fabulous Hotel,"I have stayed here several times on business and one day I will bring the family out here. A luxurious oasis in the heart of Dublin with great staff, amazing bar and a fabulous restaurant. The rooms are beautifully appointed with great features and many  little extras which make staying here and absolute pleasure.

I would highly recommend the Saddle Room   restaurant and the ball is a great place to enjoy a drink and relax with friends. ",5,2016,02,09
207,We wanted a special new years eve in a special hotel,"We decided to treat ourselves on New Years Eve in this iconic Dublin Hotel. It was far from special and certainly not what you would expect from a 5 star establishment.

The welcome on arrival was good enough but was a little marred by an attempt to sell an upgrade.  We did avail of that and glad we did as even the upgraded room was small enough. Room was very comfortable.  It was good but not spectacular. 

The public bars were jam packed and there was no space reserved for residents.  It felt like it was all about the money and no care for their guests.  This was also true of the lounge for afternoon tea. Unless pre booked no places available for residents. 

The residents reading lounge was depressing.

I couldn't believe that the breakfast was a buffet served in a makeshift location in a bar.

On leaving we had to wait 30/40 minutes for valet parking to return our car

All this for a premium price. 

Not good for a five star hotel.",2,2016,02,09
207,M/s,"We stayed here on a Friday night  late January 2016.
From start to finish it was such an enjoyable experience.
The staff must be complemented very pleasant and helpful...
Great athmosphere in bar around 5.30pm
The piece the la resistance was the breakfast.... The best I ve had in recent times....
Loved every minute",5,2016,02,09
207,Best weekend we have ever spent in Dublin,"We recently celebrate our wedding anniversary at this exquisite hotel, from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. The staff are professional and polished, I did not take the name of the lovely lady who checked us in, she was I believe from India, the warm banana cake and homemade lemonade was a lovely treat while awaiting our key. 
Our upgrade was an unexpected surprise, the room was stunning. The small touches really were very much appreciated.
Keep doing what you do as you all do it very well!",5,2016,02,09
207,Classic,"The Shelbourne has a great location in Dublin.  Quick walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, and numerous dining options.  It's an older property but it has been very well maintained.  I didn't notice anything in need of imminent repair.  My room was spacious and comfortable.  I also enjoyed the common areas of the hotel.  Staff was warm and customer service oriented.  Upon arrival, I was booked in a room on the 2nd Floor immediately above the trash bins.  After listening to the annoying sound of bottles being discarded for several minutes, I decided to ask to switch rooms.  My request was granted without question or delay, a pleasant surprise.  The restaurant was good and the bar was a comfortable venue for an after dinner drink.  Concierge staff was efficient and responsive.  The only downside to this hotel in my opinion was the shower in my room, low water pressure forcing one to stand virtually underneath the shower head right next to the shower wall.  Otherwise, a very classy property..  ",5,2016,02,08
207,Best oysterbar!,Great food at the hotel bar. Oysters are lovely with a selection of platters. The fish and chips are also out of this world. Best stop for cocktails and to meet up! Such a great venue to meet up with friend or a romantic dinner/lunch. A must to visit,5,2016,02,08
207,It's the Shelbourne!,"...so of course it was wonderful. What else is there to say, except maybe thank you?!

Except Tripadvisor wants 200 words. Okay - the location is perfect, the rooms are beautiful: spacious, clean... furniture you'd love to take home... and the breakfast is varied and top quality (we had the buffet included in our room price). The staff are friendly and welcoming, and the hotel bars have a great atmosphere - pleasant and welcoming, plus prices at the bar are pretty standard... and that is the only thing that is standard about this amazing hotel!",5,2016,02,07
207,A lot of character,"Lovely old fashioned place with modern amenities. Welcome was great and room has everything one would expect from a hotel of this calibre. They have some rooms on the inside with no view etc, not ideal but ok if you do not plan to spend much time in the room. Centrally located.
Breakfast was really a great affair, service excellent.
Would visit again, makes a difference from the usual modern hotels one has to visit these days.
Still waiting for my Marriott reward points though, its been 2 months almost.",4,2016,02,07
207,Can't Say Great,"The 5 star Shelbourne, in Dublin, on St. Stephen's Green, is a Marriott Renaissance Hotel.
The hotel is housed in a 200 year-old building, and is just loaded with its signature dark green marble and rich woods.
Expect to pay from €430 for a basic room with breakfast, to €975 for a one bedroom suite. WiFi inclusive.
At 560 sq. feet these are not large suites, but they are ""cozy"" and comfortable. Of course, Marriott's great beds are in evidence, and the not-so-large bathrooms are wall-to-wall marble.
The staff is great. Very friendly. St. Stephen's Green is across the street, and Grafton Street a very short walk away.
The hotel has a large Spa and health Club.
The Horseshoe Bar is fantastic and a great old Dublin institution, with its rich red walls, artifacts and memorabilia. Oh, and a pint or two as well.
The Lord Mayor's Lounge serves afternoon tea and Supper.
No. 27 Bar & Lounge is a stylish lounge serving light fare, and Sunday Brunch.
The Saddle Room is very gold, and has been reinvented as a steak and seafood restaurant.
Eat dinner elsewhere, if you stay here. Chapter One, a Michelin One Star is nearby, as is Marco Pierre White's Steakhouse, Dax's, Fire, Shanahans on the Green, and the Pearl Brasserie.
So try the Shelbourne for its location, friendly staff, historic building, the Horseshoe Bar, High Tea, and the cozy bemarbled rooms.
Cheers!",4,2016,02,06
207,staff let this grand hotel down,"We went here for my birthday having watched the RTE programme about the shelbourne. The building is beautiful the room was  tastefully done the hotel is grand. But the staff varied on customer service , one person appear to believe it was beneath them to clean a spillage and shouted across the restaurant for someone to clean it. One staff was  belittling when I asked about gluten free bar snacks and keep inform me they were complementary that was not my point I was asking could the hotel not provide snacks that customers could eat that did not have a  allergy gluten free or nut allergy. The bar staff were very good and did chat away . Breakfast was service the first  day we were showed to the bar and inform it was help yourself the young lad came and said morning lads can I get you coffee/tea toast. We asked the young lad was the sausages gluten free Replied No. Second day we had breakfast the young woman inform us we could have a newspsper also if we didnt want scramble eggs chef can do poach or fried egg at server we were seatted in the dining room. The  spa and leisure  were really great we had a lovely afternoon in the swimming pool steam room and sauna total relaxsation. Please sort out customers issue with allergys gluten free or nuts as we do feel excluded at time and spoiled are visit.",4,2016,02,06
207,Pure indulgence,"Just back from a fabulous weekend at the Shelbourne. From the moment you arrive you are made feel special,  from the homemade lemonade and cookies while you check in to the extremely courteous reception staff. We stayed in a lovely balcony room on one of the top floors. The level of service that the Shelbourne offer their guests is what makes them stand head and shoulders above the competition, nothing is too much trouble. Make sure you allow time for cocktails in the front bar, an experience not to be missed. Great location for exploring the city. Will be back",5,2016,02,06
207,Amazing hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The room was just fantastic, it was on the smaller side, but it had everything very conveniently located. The front desk staff during checkin were extremely friendly and welcoming.  I look forward to staying here on my next visits to Dublin.

Also, hotel desk has international plugs for foreign travelers.  The mint chocolates left on my pillow were a nice classy touch to a long day working in Dublin.",4,2016,02,05

207,Grande Dame in Great Location,The Shelbourne Dublin is a Renaissance hotel set just across the street from St Stephen's Green.  I visited in November for 2 nights and the hotel facade and some of the interior was under construction.  It was not a problem and we experienced a lovely stay.  I spent a lot of my time on the High Street shopping since the dollar was so strong against the Euro!  Rooms were small but comfy and daily breakfast was varied and outstanding (buffet and made to order).  Bar at night was packed and not a lot of intimate places to sit - more of a restaurant atmosphere with communal tables.Not a problem - the two of us just made friends with some local Irish crew who were there celebrating graduation at Trinity College just around the corner from the hotel.,4,2016,02,02
207,Lovely stay with family :-),"Beautiful hotel, valet parking, unfortunately there was a huge gathering of delegates in the foyer when we arrived, could not hear myself think. They disappeared quickly talk about women chattering....no contest...Room was lovely nice bathroom products, did not dine here but did have breakfast, which was buffet style but extremely good. Whilst awaiting car and luggage did imbibe in some champagne in the horseshoe bar - really one of those places you did not want to leave.............Highly recommend and very central for any walking or sight seeing............

Visited January 2016",5,2016,01,31
207,Disappointing,"We have stayed in this hotel for two nights to celebrate New Year Eve.
I am a Marriott club member and was advised to check in with application on my mobile. A day before our arrival I was asked by email about our preferred check in time: I indicated 1 pm (normal time is 3 pm) and received a confirmation that everything possible would be done to accommodate us. We arrived at 2 pm and were told that our room would be ready after 3 pm . The day of check out, I have asked if it was possible to stay in the room half an hour - an hour longer, until 12.30 -1 pm (we had a concert the same afternoon and I needed a place to get ready). The answer was negative... Really? Not even for half an hour?... Small things but bad impression. In both cases we were treated in polite but very distant and indifferent way. No effort was made to accommodate us. 

Other detail: to avoid queuing, it is advised to check out on your mobile application and bill would follow by email. We did it and never received the bill. Still waiting. 

There is a swimming pool in hotel open until late and I decided to relax in it on December 31. I have called reception at 5 pm to be told that swimming pool was closed. There was no apology letter about inconvenience caused in our room and in general, it would have been more appropriate  to inform guests in advance to avoid disappointment. 
We booked a New Year Eve dinner in hotel restaurant Saddle room. Food was very average and in this 5 star deluxe hotel restaurant we were served by temporary staff recruited for festivity season from different countries. They were friendly, smiley, with some English,  but badly trained and unaware how to work in this class of restaurants. 
Other mission impossible was to get to main bar which was permanently occupied by non-residents. On our arrival on early after-noon, I tried to reserve  a table for drink for one hour (7-8 pm) but they didn't take my reservation and alternatively  arranged us a table in Horse Shoe bar which was less trendy but nice. Neither could we squeeze in main bar for jazz, champagne and counting down on New Year Eve. They kept a lounge used for after-noon tea for residents but there were no music or entertainment.
And finally, positive part: hotel location is perfect for shopping and easy access to several good restaurants. Hotel rooms are luxury and well renovated. 
Would I spend 520 € per night to  stay there next New Year Eve? I doubt. Would be back to Merrion.",3,2016,01,29
207,One of the best Hotels in Dublin,"First saw the Shelbourne on an RTE streamed programme and determined to visit as and when I could.
All the great and good ,including the Irish Rugby team  prior to a home game stay here at one time or another .
We visited on a Sunday night,the entrance to the hotel is through a set of revolving doors manned by a crew of doormen all smartly dressed in matching livery.
As you go in to the right there is a grand lounge area ,big fireplace etc and just past this is a large bar ,eating area ,all very luxurious furniture and tables ,table lamps etc ,whist we were there a lot of people were taking early ,or late,afternoon tea,we headed for the bar,the other side of the main door entrance ,luckily fond a seat in the horseshoe bar and had a very pleasant hour ,the drink ,especially the wine was expensive as to be expected in Ireland and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
The amenities were very good ,well sign posted and clean.
I would recommend a visit whilst in Dublin as it is in St Stephens Green area and a trip to Dublin is not complete without a trip the see the Green and what better than to treat yourself to a bit of luxery as well.",5,2016,01,27
207,Disaster,"What a let down, Service was poor, Room was not a Deluxe room and the Breakfast,,, waited 40 minuets and were put in a Bar with a Buffet on the Bar with Cold food. Paid to Eat our Breakfast in a Restaurant Not in the Bar.. This is Not a 5star Hotel",1,2016,01,26
207,Simply stunning,Been at the Shelbourne Dublin for a Christmas Ball and did not actually spend a night at the hotel (although I wish I actually had). This place is simply breathtaking and the setting brings you back in time.,5,2016,01,26
207,"Comfort, Luxury and Sevice","Lovely hotel to fit every need. Complimented by exceptionally friendly and helpful staff.
Don't miss the lovely breakfast options. Good location in the nicer part of the city centre and away from the noise of Temple Bar.",5,2016,01,26
207,Stunning Hotel and location,"Great room with small private balcony, spotlessly clean and all you could wish for provided. Spent a very pleasant afternoon passing the time of day in The Horseshoe bar. StFf were second to none  and the food excellent",5,2016,01,25
207,Love this hotel...comfortable and classic,"The Shelbourne combines the comfort of the great older hotels with all the amenities of modern ones.  Some rooms can be quite small  but I had a deluxe with a king bed which was very comfortable.  The bathroom which a tub and shower was also quite spacious.  The service was overall excellent.  We did have a fire alarm go off around 11 pm which required hotel evacuation which we understood, turned out to be a system malfunction that involved the sprinkler system..  The one thing that was not good was that apparently and unbeknownst to us, the fire alarm/sprinkler system malfunction affected the hot water, so I had none at my 5 am wake up.  I couldn't raise anyone at the front desk to address so suffered through a very brief and chilly shower.",5,2016,01,25
207,Second visit first review,"This was our second visit to the Shelbourne for myself and my wife, the first visit I would like to forget about as we did not have a good experience but they assured us if we stayed again we would not be disappointed. So I held off writing a review to give them the chance to redeem themselves. They did not disappoint upon arrival were upgraded to a suite, even though we had arrived early our room was still ready which was great as my wife wanted to do some shopping and upon our return there was complimentary bottle of wine box of chocolates and a lovely note welcoming us back which was a nice touch. The room itself was huge we even had our own Christmas tree. They also got us a table in Fire restaurant at short notice which was great for us. Overall a brilliant experience, our faith was renewed and we will be back.",5,2016,01,25
207,Lives up to reputation,"From the moment we walked up  the few steps to the entrance the hotel passed with flying colours. Great efficiency and courtesy at check-in, the double queen room was luxury itself and we were well advised about facilities. All evening and late into the night, there as a great buzz about both bars. Breakfast was one of the very best I have had the pleasure of feasting on. The food was fresh, high quality, service was quietly efficient and the detail was all present. The only quibble (and I had been advised accordingly) was that valet parking was slow.",5,2016,01,24
207,Quality,"Only back from 1 night stay hotel is perfect 
From the moment you arrive the door men are courteous and then the reception staff are very helpful we booked a std room and where offered a free upgrade nice touch
Room is classy  
Bar staff very friendly and the breakfast show fantastic 
Hotel location is fantastic directly opposite st Stephens green and a short stroll from graft on street 
Lastly one thing I did notice was how quiet the hotel corridors etc was",5,2016,01,24
207,Overly hotel ,"Gorgeous interior hotel. Our room was very modern and clean although both the bathroom and room itself was quite small

Oma brilliantly positioned and located hotel. Def will be back. It's got something special plus breakfasts were escellent x",5,2016,01,24
207,old world style in Dublin,"Super Hotel - Location, Location, Location
Grand Hotel in the traditional style
If you have the money this is the 5 star Hotel for Dublin - there are other good modern 5 stars but this has the olde world charm, even part of the Constitution of Ireland was written here - yes you have guessed in the Constitution room!",5,2016,01,24
207,Best stay ever!,"My wife and I stayed for out twenty anniversary ,the staff went out of there way to make it a super special occasion including leaving a lovely plate of savouries with a happy anniversary message.We enjoyed the hotel so much we did not leave , there was a great atmosphere in the bar and the Saddle Room meal was excellent . I cannot thank the staff enough for a great stay in a wonderful hotel",5,2016,01,24
207,Beautiful hotel!,"We stayed at the Shelbourne in October 2015 for a long weekend in Dublin. Not only was the property gorgeous and full of historical charm, but it's location is fantastic and the service was impeccable. The hotel's different restaurants offered the perfect pre- and post-ludes to our evenings out, and the central location enabled us to do everything on our wish list while staying in Dublin without wasting valuable time traveling very far. If you have the chance to stay here, I would definitely recommend it!",5,2016,01,22
207,Amust visit in Dublin,"Having seen a program on the Shelbourne Hotel we had to call in and savour the grandeur of the place.
A marvellous entrance to the busy hotel with people bustling in and out ably assisted by the numerous doormen ,all attired in long coats and top hats.
To the right was a grand drawing room to take afternoon tea in luxury ,the toilets downstairs was worth a visit just to look at the opulence and cleanliness .
The main bar downstairs to the left of the entrance was very busy with business people gathering for the last drink before heading home and people just enjoying a wind down drink before going to the Theatre or Dinner.
We enjoyed a drink in the bar wallowing in the atmosphere before heading out again for a look at Stephens Green and to catch up on some shopping in Grafton Street.
You have to see it at least once as it is the iconic Hotel of Dublin.",5,2016,01,22
207,Relaxing ambience,"Central location to all amenities. A relaxing hotel where staff were exemplary from check-in to check-out.  Exceptional customer care, including a superb breakfast in elegant surroundings. A 5 star experience.",5,2016,01,22
207,Great Business venue,Managed to get a meeting suite during an exceptionally busy week when the hotel was overbooked.  Service was just a fraction below par from past experience eg breakfast trays not arriving on time - but explainable due to the busy-ness  Front desk staff a delight.  Food very good especially the breakfast buffet and main bar.,4,2016,01,21
207,Great ! ,"2nd stay at the shelbourne and already booked our third . Georgeous room - it seemed 
a shame to leave it but the shops around the corner in grAfton street were calling ! You won't get a better hotel in central Dublin but you will pay for it - and it's worth every cent . No 27 bar and Lord Mayors lounge within the hotel are lovely - they serve good food in relaxing surroundings . Cannot recommend this hotel enough . Special mention for Halina on reception - fantastic welcome and so helpful . ",5,2016,01,21
207,Dougie Sligo,"We visited the Shelbourne on Tuesday 19th January for afternoon tea in the Mayor's Parlour. It was the 1pm sitting and right from the start the ""experience"" was excellent. The foyer of the hotel was quite busy as there was an aviation conference on but our hostess was very efficient in bringing us to our table. The attention to detail of everybody was wonderful and we were all made to feel that we were the only ones in the hotel. Adam was particularly helpful and efficient, no sooner was our cups running dry when he was at hand refilling them. The food was out of this world. I was amazed at the egg with the top cut off and filled with mousse and a passion fruit yoke to top it off. It was my daughter's birthday and the staff noticed some presents being given to her and then a slate with some macaroons and a candle were produced. Even the pianist played Happy Birthday. An excellent gesture just because somebody noticed. All in all the day was made very special by the staff and by the that very special quality which I now realise is the 'Shellbourne'

Thank You ",5,2016,01,21
207,The Breastfeeding area advised to visit was the disabled toilet.,"We stayed in the shelbourne for two nights on the 21st dec. 
so okay the food was great and the room lovely however one part of the customer service let it down. We wanted to relax in the afternoon tea area before they started service. The manager needed the table back in 20 mins this was fine  as we just wanted a quick drink and to absorb the atmosphere. However once the manager realised that I intended on discreetly breastfeeding my 4 month old baby he suddenly needed the table back in five minutes. He then  advised that if I wanted to breastfeed that there was a facility upstairs he was clearly very uncomfortable and repeated about the available facility and made me feel awkward and I hadn't even started feeding at this point.  I left the area to find the ""facility"" which was actually the disabled toilet! So the five star hotel was asking me to either sit on the loo or the floor of the toilet to feed my baby. Can the management of the hotel please understand a toilet is definitely not a breastfeeding facility and either provide one or train your staff on how to deal with a situation with your usual level of customer service.",4,2016,01,20
207,Disappointing,"My stay at the shelbourne was a surprise for my upcoming wedding. After following the documentary on the shelbourne I was very excited about staying in such a fabulous hotel. However I was rather disappointed with the service.
The staff had been informed that I was getting married however there was no mention of it during my stay. I was told upon checking in that we could upgrade for €70! 
One of the rooms which was booked for three people was only serviced for two ie two bottles of water, two bathrobes etc. We rang reception however after returning a few hours later it still was not serviced. We contacted reception again and were informed that the room would be serviced at turn down. Upon returning to the room that night we realised that turn down was only done for two people. This in my opinion is disgraceful. After all we were being charged for 3 people. When my sister mentioned the situation on checkout the guy simply said ""oh sorry!"". 
The rooms in which we stayed were very small and the view was awful. 
I left the hotel with rather a bad taste. After seeing the rte programme I am of the opinion that five star treatment is only for the celebrities who are staying in the suites not for the average customer who is still paying the five star price. 
",2,2016,01,19
207,A taste of Luxury,"Excellent location,Friendly staff, very clean hotel, rooms were a good size & a very large bathroom.Staff were very friendly.The two bars were both very nice & busy so no need to leave the hotel at night.A bit expensive but well worth it for the extra luxury especially if you can book early or get a deal.",5,2016,01,19
207,Fabalous experience!,"A very relaxing/unwinding place, it was like being in a different era, not only are the staff friendly,  efficient,  courteous but they are totally relaxed in their various jobs.  Thewhole experince was wonderful from the moment we step inside the door until we left, the only tiny issue was the toilet paper, not as tender as you eould like 😢 My biggest regret is not staying another night.",5,2016,01,18
207,The jewel in Dublin's crown.,"Another memorable stay at The Shelbourne to celebrate my wife's birthday.
From the beautiful and spacious upgraded room to the excellent food, service and
warm hospitality this hotel offers affordable luxury and for us ticks all the boxes.
We love Dublin and The Shelbourne seems to capture all that is so special about this vibrant city. The central location with its scenic setting, the history, and the architecture are all complimented by staff beyond compare. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived and nothing was too much trouble.
Rounding off our stay in style with a mouthwatering afternoon tea in such a majestic and serene setting truly was the perfect end to a perfect trip.
Roll on next January - we'll definitely be back!",5,2016,01,18
207,Excellent stat,"The best hotel in Dublin, it has everything - the history, excellent rooms, modern gym.
Would have given 5 stars but they botched up the breakfast service by allowing everyone to come for breakfast at once and subsequently running out of tables.

Still a small niggle only.

The Sunday Jazz brunch is brilliant, I think it starts again in April",4,2016,01,18
207,Excellent stay,"Checked in without any hassle. We were offered a room upgrade for €30 per night which we accepted.
Lovely room with clean linen. Spotless bathroom.
Only one niggle was there were not biscuits provided in the room,I enjoy a biscuit with a cup of coffee.
Breakfast was great. Staff very attentive. I had a b&b package so I could order of the A la carte menu and have the meal brought to the table.
We ate in the bar in the evening. The soup was very nice as was the fish and chips
I will return",5,2016,01,18
207,Lovely Breakfast but Very Small Rooms,"Lovely Breakfast, lovely for afternoon tea in the front room but the bedrooms are really small and let down the overall experience.
The location of the Hotel you just can't beat but there are other others luxury hotels nearby with nicer rooms",3,2016,01,17
207,Great place,"Beautiful hotel, great location, and extremely friendly and helpful staff including the front desk, the concierge, and the bellmen out front. Absolutely no complaints! I also arrived very early and they were extremely helpful and accommodating and allowed a very early checkin (which I was very grateful for after a flight from the US and no sleep).",5,2016,01,17
207,Fabulous hotel but needs improving ,"Stayed as a surprise for one night at The Shelbourne for my birthday. My other half had been ringing the hotel the weeks previous to get concierge to organise a present pick up but there was no answer. Also he had informed them it was my birthday but there was no mention of it at all by any staff. I thought there is where hotels try to go the extra mile. Although everyone is so friendly when they greet you in the hotel. The room was had was lovely, nice and spacious but very outdated. There is an iPhone dock but only takes the first generation iPhone and that is very old, would be nice if it had more connections. Also the floor boards are very noisy, I felt like I would be creating lots of noise for the guests underneath us when I was walking around in the room. I had my hair blow dried at their new hair salon and it was a 5 star experience. They even gave my other half an iPad and offered him drinks while he waited for me. I'd go back again just to get my hair done. Breakfast the next morning was a little disappointing. We gave our room number to the lady and she asked us to wait in another room until a table was available. 35 minutes later and still we were not called, even though numerous other people had been called. I approached a man and told him and he didn't even have our number written down. Then the original lady who we gave our room number to said breakfast was finished and she had been calling us but we never answered, which was untrue. We were then quickly brought in for breakfast but at this stage, we were just annoyed and would have preferred to go somewhere else. In fairness the breakfast manager Cesar I think his name was came and apologised and gave us 2 glasses of prosecco. Although if something is done correctly in the beginning, there should be no need for apologises. The Shelbourne is a must to stay in, just to soak up the history and the atmosphere ",4,2016,01,16
207,An over-the-top experience,We were gifted a four night stay at The Shelbourne over New Year's Eve.  We had a suite on the 6th floor that included our own Christmas tree in our sitting room. The decor was very tasteful and elegant.  Lovely linens.  Large bathroom with a deep tub and separate glassed rainfall shower.  We appreciated how very quiet it was.,5,2016,01,16
207,Enjoyable stay,"Just back from a one night stay at Shelbourne. I'm a regular visitor to Dublin, but I've never been or stayed here before, though it is a very well known and established hotel.

I booked the hotel in October 2015, though when checking in the receptionist stated that I was expected the day after! She took a copy of my booking confirmation and I was upgraded to a Queens room at the back of the hotel. The reception is a bit difficult to locate, but is very efficient with friendly staff. A deposit of 50 Euro is also taken on check in. 

We were on the 2nd floor and the room was well sized, with everything that you would need. Bathroom had shower in the bath and was also well sized.

The hotel is centrally located, short walk to Grafton Street, which is the main shopping area and attractions in the City, 
as well as Stephens Green, which is located opposite the hotel. There are great restaurants and bars in Dawson Street, which is two streets from the hotel. (Cafe En Saine is worth a visit.) 

We ate at FX Buckley Steakhouse, which is good and I had probably one of the best pints of Guinness in the Long Hall bar. 

The bars in the hotel were very busy with guests and professional Dublin people and had a great atmosphere, with efficient and friend staff.

We had breakfast in our room for a small extra cost and was delivered at the exact time that we requested. The hot food was maybe a bit cold, but overall was prefect.

There are other similar hotels nearby and have higher ratings on Trip Adviser, so I would choose carefully. 

Will I stay here again? Probably but not definitely, I prefer the Marker Hotel, though it is not as centrally located as this hotel.

",4,2016,01,16
207,Simply Marvellous,"We stayed three nights in mid October; although much of hotel was covered in scaffolding, did not detract at all from a wonderful stay; hotel staff helpful, rooms clean and tip top shape (although no view); terrific breakfast buffets.   Have stayed at Merrion before and found Shelbourne to be a slightly more convenient location for walking to most spots downtown.   Incidentally, having lived in Boston many many years, the feeling stepping out of the Shelbourne is very reminiscent of stepping out of the old Ritz across from the Public Gardens.   ",5,2016,01,16
207,Christmas stay 27 Dec 2015,"️Gorgeous hotel best in town,couldn't be compared to any other 100% especially Dec time of year with beautiful decoration,and a Christmas tree in every corner .Staff very welcoming nothing too much trouble,at breakfast we were served by a young gentleman with exceptional manners and professionalism,great food with a number of choices,we enjoyed it so much ,looking forward to returning for our private dining wedding ",5,2016,01,16
207,Impressive Hotel - Wonderful Staff,"I recently stayed for one night at the Shelborne Hotel with my friend. The entrance foyer is very impressive and the welcoming/reception staff were really lovely, nothing was too much trouble. Our room was a  deluxe double room at the back of the hotel and was spacious and very comfortable. We wouldn't normally stay in a 5* hotel but we got the room at a special rate and it was too good a deal to miss. The breakfast was buffet style with plentiful of choice of both cold and hot dishes. Overall it was a really lovely experience.",4,2016,01,15
207,High Tea at the Shelbourne,"During my recent visit to Dublin I treated myself to ""Afternoon Tea"" at the Shelbourne Hotel. Even though this is quite expensive, the delicious food and atmosphere at the Shelbourne are definitely worth it. And if you really want to spoil yourself, add a glass of the lovely champagne to your scones, cake and other goodies....",5,2016,01,15
207,Top Class Hospitality,"We stay as a family once a year in December if we have the opportunity. It's a great way to soak up some of the Christmas atmosphere and start the holidays. 
For a very busy hotel there is no drop off of hospitality levels. Excellent professional and friendly service throughout the hotel. I've never experienced the feeling that the staff were too busy to deal with customers or felt put upon in any way. 
With the weight of history behind them, it's great to see how seriously the hotel takes its position as the preeminent hotel in Dublin's social fabric. I've always been struck by their respect for the history the hotel has been part of. The appreciation of what a part of so many peoples Christmas the hotel is very evident in their commitment to the Christmas spirit. I'll be going back again.",5,2016,01,15
207,Great history but not worth the price,"This is a great hotel with wonderful history and fantastic location. The staff were great, the food was nice and the atmosphere was lovely. The room though was just an ordinary hotel room so for $350 its just not worth it. Better off staying in another hotel close by, saving $150 and using that to pay for a wonderful dining experience somewhere in this great city.",3,2016,01,14
207,"Great location, room not worth it...","This hotel is an institution in Dublin and my wife and myself where really looking forward to spending a night there before flying back home. The hotel has a fantastic location right in the city center, bar and restaurants are of fantastic quality and the service is very good. Breakfast was also very good with a lot of choice and quality products. 
The room in itself was a very disappointing because it was extremely small for two people and smelled damp. The view was into a courtyard that was being renovated...For a price close to 300 euros a night we would have expected better. Being a Gold member with Marriott we normally receive a little special treatment to reward our loyalty, in this case it was totally ignored even when I reminded them. 
We will for sure go back to the Shelbourne but only for a drink!  
We much preferred our stay at the Merrion hotel (200 m away) that has the same level of service but much nicer rooms.",3,2016,01,14
207,Top Service!!,"We just want to thank the  General Manager Stephen Hanley for everything. The service is excellent and the staff are amazing! The hotel is central to everything .The rooms are clean and comfy, the food is amazing at the restaurant. It so Classy hotel!",5,2016,01,13
207,Overnight tsy in the Shelbourne - a real treat,Everything about the Shelbourne was excellent. The room (a double deluxe) was a den of luxury with the attention to detail beyond reproach. Location - could not be better and the atmosphere within the Hotel was wonderful. ,5,2016,01,13
207,Great Hotel,"Lovely traditional old style hotel oozing with history and charm, with all the modern requirements of any modern business hotel.
The Saddle room restaurant is really top class, with food and service second to none.
We had a complaint in relation to room service on our arrival night, however our complaint was dealt with adequately and professionally.
The staff at the Shelbourne were friendly and efficient. 
",5,2016,01,12
207,Old world élégance,"the best in Ireland. What amazed me the most is the exceptional quality of the service, from the doorman, concierge, the reception, the restaurant waiting staff, the health club personnels, the room service, the housekeeping. The deluxe queen rooms are pretty basic, views to the inner court was gray and dull. The location is central, within walking distance to all sites. The TV remote control and telephone are definitely ""out of date"" for a five star hotel. Unfortunately we couldn't eat at the restaurants since we were wearing sports shoes.",4,2016,01,10
207,Five Star Property,"We had a fantastic time during our one night stay at the Shelbourne. Having stayed at dozens of Marriott properties over the past year, the Shelbourne is truly in a class by itself. The service was impeccable, the Platinum Marriott perks were great including a demi-bottle of wine and cheese platter, and the property was beautiful. The room was large, and the bed was FANTASTIC even having a King sized bed which is hard to come by in Europe/ Ireland. We will definitely be returning to the Shelbourne on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2016,01,10
207,Mother daughter event,"Where do I begin, absolutely THE VERY BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN, from walking in the door the staff made us feel like royalty. We treated ourself a to a facial in the spa, well it was heavenly, the girls in the spa were so nice and looked after us so well. When we went for our afternoon tea the girls knew it was my mothers bday and went above and beyond to make her feel special with no extra cost. 
The bedroom was beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable, beds amazing! They turned down our beds, put  out our slippers and left chocolate by our bedside. 
I know the shelbourne is a five star hotel and is expensive to stay in but I have been in five star hotels all over the world and paid as much for not near as much attentiveness or overall comfort. 
So this is my thanks to the great staff at the shelbourne for looking after myself and my mam on her birthday as they did. 
And I highly recommended it to anyone looking for somewhere special for a mother daughter day out.",5,2016,01,10
207,Vip lunch ,"It was my birthday and my mother and I decided to treat ourselves to a lunch in the shelbourne. What a treat it was... We decided to go for a Vip experience... Champagne at lunch accompanied by a prawn cocktail, roasted chicken with baby boils, creme brûlée and coffee to finish. We were treated so special, staff were very pleasant and ambience was perfect ",5,2016,01,09
207,"Best hotel, best location!!!! :-) :-) :-) :-)","Love the staff. Love the location, always feel at home. Highly recommend :-) excellent ambiance. Excellent food. Love the lounge. Great music in the evening. Very central. Just off Grafton Street. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)",5,2016,01,08
207,Just lovely!,"Beautiful Hotel, lovely ambience, great bars, fabulous breakfast, tremendous staff.
Irish Staff too, which is important! Superb location on the Green!
Didn't get a chance to use the gym or spa, next time perhaps!",5,2016,01,07
207,VERY disappointing,"It looks wonderful at first glance but there are just too many slip-ups for a hotel that claims to be  5 stars. The room was nice and big but the table in the room was so wobbly that you could´t put a glass on it, the temperature changer in the shower was loose and came off in my hand and finally the toilet was blocked. On arrival I asked for two single duvets which the staff said was no problem but apparently they don't have covers to match them which means an oversized and uncomfortable cover, housekeeping said it was the best they could do. I would´t sleep in that at home never mind in a hotel. There was a wait for 20 minutes to be seated at breakfast, some waited 40 min. the cheese was filled up by a staff member with his bare hands, you don´t expect to see that either in a hotel like this. Eggs undercooked, bread dry etc. The worst was the guy that fixed the toilet carried the plunger out of the room dripping water all the way, and that housekeeping just walk into the room with no notice. Staff seems untrained and unexperienced. We got free parking and a drink in the bar as full compensation. A rather bad deal. Find somewhere else to stay if you want to spoil yourself, it won't happen at the Shelbourne.",2,2016,01,07
207,Unforgettable Experience,"Myself and my family stayed two nights in the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin and had the most wonderful experience. What really sets the Shelbourne apart from other hotels in Dublin is the unparalleled customer service. Joanna who showed us to our room upon check in was a very professional and welcoming host. 
Myself and my 5 year old daughter had booked treatments in The Salon. Maria and Sade looked after us both, they were extraordinarily accommodating and friendly. 
Any staff member we encountered during our stay could not have been more helpful and are a credit to the hotel.",5,2016,01,06
207,so very lovely,"lovely lovely lovely...beautiful, old world charm. genealogist and historian on site.  very friendly, helpful staff.  Delicious food and Downton abbey style service! Special shout out to humble chef who should be over the top ego maniac but isn't!!! Great location.  Thank you soooo much for treating all of us (travel agents) like your regular celebs/royalty!",5,2016,01,05
207,Very Bad Service,"Things and places change, my last review of The Shelbourne was excellent but not so on my last visit.  It was Christmas week and the bar was crowded, there was no floor service and tables were left unattended with dirty glasses, leftover peanuts etc everywhere.  The Hotel was greedy for profits at the expense of the service and standards expected of a 5 star establishment. We went into The Saddle Room Restaurant for dinner and had the festive menu, which was the only option available.  The food was very good but the service was very bad, to the point of almost being non existent, which it was later on.  The Hotel is a 5 star but on this experience it should lose one star for the poor service and drop in standards.  There is no excuse for poor or bad service, poor service is the result of bad planning of staffing levels, bad service is an attitude problem, we experienced both on this visit.",2,2016,01,05
207,Classy,"I stayed at The Shelbourne on business for 5 nights and was impressed. From the grand entrance, spacious accommodation and luxurious interiors this hotel oozes class above most.

Located in the heart of Dublin, plenty of restaurants, bars and retail shops are within walking distance.

My stay at the hotel was very comfortable and given a few late nights at the office i was pleased to fall quickly asleep with ease (not always possible when constantly travelling). The breakfast buffet was of the highest standard and service truly 5 star!

Given the choice to stay in Dublin.. there is no contest.",5,2016,01,04
207,Disappointing stay at the Shelbourne ,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed in the Shelbourne as a treat New Year's Day. 
I have visited several times before just for lunch or to drop in for a quick drink, but have never stayed.  

Staff were very friendly on arrival, reception was busy but we were dealt with efficiently.

The room was small for a 5 star standard but nice and well decorated, however we thought we got a slight smell of sewerage when we arrived.  

We ate outside of the hotel as it was to busy in the restaurant, when we got back to our room the smell had gotten worse but it was around 11 so we thought it was a bit late to complain at this point.

We went for breakfast the following morning at 10am. There was a long line of
People waiting for a table, after awhile we were seated at a breakfast bar with 2 barstool for seats in the main bar.  This was somewhere you would sit down for a few pints not the 5 star breakfast experience we were charged for. 

The lady that seated us was gone before I had time to comment.  

I asked one of the waitresses for tea and coffee, she had barely time to listen to me and had left before I got to ask for toast too.  

The buffet was fine. Kind of average.  The tea and coffee was out quickly but we had 
finished our breakfast before we got our toast.

I understand the hotel was busy but you would expect a 5 star hotel to be able to deal with serving breakfast efficiently to it's guests. 

I heard staff saying to a number of other guests that everyone arrived down for breakfast together and that was the problem.  This was being said for over an hour.. So I do not accept this excuse. 

When we left we saw around 30 people standing around in the hall outside where breakfast was being served waiting for tables.  

A hotel should be able to cope with being fully booked, otherwise it should reduce its capacity.  
 
We rang reception and asked for a late check out because we had been delayed at breakfast and were given a straight out no, they were fully booked. I felt this was unfair as it was not our fault we were delayed and felt the hotel should acknowledge this. Bad customer service in my view.  We argued our point and were given an extra 30 minutes in a room that smelled of sewage. 

I like the history and location of this hotel but can't really add much more than that.  

Paid for a 5 star experience and received 3 to 4 at best.   

Complained when leaving, was offered a upgrade on my next stay.  I said thanks, but we would not be back.  When you have a bad experience the last thing you want to do is pay over another approx €230 and hope it will be more of an enjoyable experience next time.   We were given complimentary parking which would have cost us €29.

207,Christmas treat,"2nd year running to book the shelbourne in the middle period from Christmas to new year.
The hotel is stunning and I always find the staff very accommodating from check in to check out.
In the heart of Dublin at a special Time of the year.

207,A classic Dublin Landmark and old world hotel feel.,"We stand for a quick break in Dublin and weren't disappointed. We booked a suite and the standard was as one would expect for a hotel of this category, in this location and at this price. The Shelbourne is always an excellent choice and rarely disappoints.",5,2016,01,04
207,Grandparents 50th,"We sent my grandparents to the Shelbourne for their 50th anniversary. The staff and hotel was fabulous. The meal how ever in the Saddle room was the worst experience they have ever had. They have been all over the world and are disgusted that the worst was in their own country. Grandad specificly asked for stwak with nothing on it as he has to be careful with his diet.sent stake back as it came out with wveryting on it, and when it arrived again, it was the same steak just with everything scraped off. In the end grandad didnt have a main course, as he has himself worked as a cheff all over the world, was very dissapointed with how this was handled. The staff and hotel itseld could not be faulted. But they would never be back. ",2,2016,01,03
207,"Very nice hotel, but don't stay a minute past checkout or else...","The Shelbourne is in a great location. It looks like a 5 star hotel and the rooms are very nice - we had 3 of them. Check in was perfect. The breakfast was good.

The reason I have given it a 4 and not a 5 is because they couldn't wait to get rid of us. As a lifetime gold Marriott rewards member I am used to a late checkout, not a call telling us to get out of the room immediately. I understand they are busy, and it was because it was new years and they had a wedding, but still,  I felt it was done very rudely and I was just about pushed out the door to make way for the new paying customers.

Also, one of the rooms (room 182) was a furnace. We even turned off the air conditioner/ heater but it kept getting hotter and hotter.",4,2016,01,02
207,Excellent stay,"Stayed here between Christmas and new year and found it to be a great place with lots of character and lovely decor. Room was very comfortable and clean. We found the staff to be very helpful and the breakfast was excellent.

My wife enjoyed her pampering in the spa and the hotel is very well located close to shops and parks etc. Hopefully we will be back !",5,2016,01,02
207,Good Location for Stomping about in Dublin,"Had four nights here for a trip between Christmas and New Year's.  The beds tended to be a little firm, but we had a good time hanging out in the Horseshoe bar.  Not too far from Temple Bar and the other shopping streets.  On the downside - we were supposed to have breakfast included each morning, but we only made the list the first morning.  They seemed like they were too busy, but sort of made us feel like we were trying to scam for a free breakfast.  That was really frustrating.  Breakfast was great though, awesome coffee, good eggs, great sausages.  Maybe a little pricey, but everyone we met that we told we were staying there was oohing and ahhing.  Overall, a pretty good time.",4,2016,01,02
207,Lovely hotel,Great location and helpful staff. Rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated.Plenty to see and do within walking distance. Not cheap but very nice for a special occasion or treat! So if it is your first visit to Dublin it's worth the extra :),5,2016,01,02
207,Luxury few days.,"We stayed in the hotel between Christmas and new year.The standard is extremely high and the staff are most professional.The location is brilliant and close to many excellent restaurants,shops and attractions.The hotel was very busy but staff were always friendly and welcoming.It was a great experience but a tad on the expensive side.It is a hotel for a special occasion.Afternoon tea pleasant but overpriced.Breafast was exceptionally good and will exceed expectations.It is clear the hotel is well run and there is a sense of pride with staff.",5,2015,12,31
207,Lovely afternoon tea at the Shelbourne,"Had afternoon tea yesterday at the Shelbourne. New experience for me. The ambience was lovely and the sandwiches, cakes and tea delightful, if a little bit pricey. But the evening was made very special by our waitress Toyah who attended to our every need and never let the teacup go empty. It was such a lovely experience. Personally I would love if the savoury outweighed the sweet. But that's just what Id like. Altogether a lovely bit of pampering for Christmas",5,2015,12,31
207,Disappointing for wedding anniversay,"My wife and I have stayed in hotels all over the world not always in five star hotels but when one is staying in a five star you expect five star treatment, our bags and clothes (on hangers) were brought to our room and when we got to room our clothes were strewn across the bed!! We had a drink in the stuffy horseshoe bar one pint of Heineken and a glass of Champagne the bill was 26.65! We waited 40 minutes to be seated for breakfast, and we had to stand in the lobby, no offer of a seat or a glass of orange juice while we waited, two bluffers came down the stairs and said they rang ahead through room service and said a table was waiting for them it was obvious they were bluffing but were let straight through, I know it had history but very average hotel, won't be going back",2,2015,12,30
207,Disappointed ,Stayed 28th December.  Staff very friendly but service was below what is expected.  Also had to wait for ages to be seated for breakfast.  The hotel was too busy and couldn't cope.  This was not a five star experience and for that money I would recommend the Merrion instead.,3,2015,12,30
207,Very disappointed,"This was our second visit to the hotel in 6 months. We enjoyed our first stay so much that we booked this visit before check out. Unfortunately this visit was far below our expectations.

I had emailed in advance to say we were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. I knew we wouldn't be getting an upgrade as the hotel was so busy but I was expecting a good quality room. Instead I got a room where the wallpaper, in the supposedly recently modernised room was peeling of the wall, and the view from the room was an office block. The door had a gap at the bottom big enough for my husband's hand to go underneath, because of this the room was constantly noisey and the room was never completely dark. Add to that the awful weather and the fact that for some reason our room had no umbrella.....Not what I expect when I book 
6 months in advance in a 5 star hotel.

It is my understanding that there is a pre theatre menu between 5.45-6.45 we were never offered this menu. The menu that came read well but we were a little concerned by the fact that there was little or no mention of side orders with the meal and each one was priced individually. Sure enough the waiter informed us we would get a bowl of baby potatoes and nothing else with the meal. As a couple that eat out regularly, prior to last night our most recent meal out in Dublin was in Guilbaud's, I have to say this meal was shocking. 3 courses for €59 and a bowl of potatoes is what is served with the small main courses!! My steak came and the shallots from the menu turned out to be 2 layers from a quartered shallot.... This is unacceptable. We ordered wine that we had to ask for twice. It was moved away from us too far for us to pour but we were then left with empty glasses twice. Our bread arrived 5 minutes after our starters were served, very poor and below par for a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. All in all the Saddle room provided my most disappointing meal of 2015. Our anniversary not mentioned until almost time to pay the bill!!

Then we come to this morning and our 30 minute wait for breakfast, again this is unacceptable and way below par for a 5 star hotel. Worse when I did got to my table there was a big chip out of my glass!! Also while we waited in the Lord Mayor's Lounge, on the 2 mornings, 15 minutes yesterday and 30 today, nobody offered us juice, water, coffee or even a paper!

There were some huge high points, Bar 27 was brilliant, the Salon was great, the food for breakfast was really nice also. The charm and elegance of the hotel was brilliant as always.",3,2015,12,30
207,Excellent Hotel seems alive,"Excellent hotel, lives upto the name. It seems alive and incredibly busy all the time. We stayed for a few nights and loved it. Few small things that aren't really worth mentioning dropped it to 4 rating but only because these hotels pride themselves on every single detail.

Lovely rooms, amazing feel of history in the hotel. Extremely hard to get a seat in the bar at any time. The residents lounge on 1st floor should be pointed out to residents so that they know about it! ",4,2015,12,30
207,Great historic hotel,"I had the pleasure to stay in this hotel two times and both experiences were very positive. Therefore let’s start with the goodies: what a great building! Style and superb atmosphere. The rooms are big and comfortable, equipped with modern technology. The breakfast offer is simply fantastic, one of the best I have seen. The feeling to stay in such hotel is very special. Additional note to the positives: I was fortune to enjoy a corporate rate, therefore excellent value for money. Unbeatable really.
Things to improve: the staff is not especially welcoming, they could be a bit more attentive and show they care more. The hotel looked very busy and seemed the facilities could barely cope with the amount of people staying. No seating area in the lobby, very small breakfast room, there was such a long queue for breakfast. Also the business center is small and busy.
In any case I highly recommend this hotel and it will only enhance your stay in this beautiful city that is Dublin.",4,2015,12,30
207,Surprisingly Disappointing,"We were looking forward to a special stay for our wedding anniversary, but the hotel did not measure up to our expectations. I absolutely love the Shelbourne to dine or enjoy a drink in, but had not stayed there before. In Dublin we usually stay at the Fitzwilliam, but i thought we would like to have a more luxurious and elegant experience for this special anniversary occasion. But there were a bunch of unexpected shortfalls and annoyances during our stay that really bothered us.....
First, on checking in, the receptionist wrote down a room number which did not exist and we walked around the third floor up and down various sets of steps looking for it for 15 minutes. Note fir future guests there is NO 345. There is a 344 and and a 346 and so on, but no 345.....Finally came across someone on staff who called reception to check the number for us and got to the room to put our bags down. 
The bedroom through the night was really overheated and very uncomfortable as a result, and the cooling system (even on max), made lots of noise but had little effect. 
Following morning, We waited over 20 minutes to be seated for breakfast. It was a busy time of day, but the Shelbourne should know how to handle peak times efficiently and in a way that the customers are kept comfortable. The hostess taking names did not point out coffee or juice in the crowded lobby (saw them on way out), or invite peole to sit in the bar area (door to bar closed and the tea room was full of other people waitingg for tables) so people stood around the lobby. Then another hostess was erratically calling out the names amongst some (but not all) of the people standing around the lobby and it was by accident that we heard her say ""take the Bxxx party off the list, they did not answer"".....? 
Once finally seated. My husband ate from the buffet and enjoyed it, but i ordered from the a-la carte menu and we waited 30 MINUTES for my food to arrive! It was good when it finally got there but it was ridiculous to have waited that long for a basic plate of eggs! My husband gave up waiting, ate his breakfast, finished it, and had a second and then a third coffee waiting for my food to arrive. 
After breakfast, on returning upstairs to pack - we found that our room key had been disabled (30 minutes before checkout time). So we trek back down to lobby to get it reactivated and back up again. Sounds like a minor annoyance but it was another layer of bad service! 
I stay in lots of hotels for business, and I was fully ready to give all this feedback to reception on checkout, and i was honestly dying for her to ask - but she did not ask if we enjoyed our stay or found the room satisfactory! By then i was ready to drop it and we wanted to get out of there as we had been significantly delayed....
Some good points to point out were the amazing location, historic and gracious building, cool little onsite museum, nicely appointed room, luxurious bedding, fab toiletries, great service from concierge and valet, good food, meticulously clean - as you would expect from a landmark five star hotel.",3,2015,12,29
207,Great Hotel,We stayed here the first 2 nights of our honeymoon. The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The customer service and hospitality was above and beyond our expectations. The breakfast was the best in Dublin. Highly recommend this historic Dublin Hotel. ,5,2015,12,29
207,"All night bottle noisy bank under  ""5 star rooms""","I reviewed this hotel a couple of years ago and found it to be very good - however my attitude towards the hotel has completely changed for the worse.

Last time the review was completed we were showing signs of coming out of the recession and there was a sense of welcoming about the hotel , it warmly welcomed the visitors and took case of their needs.

However now totally changed, I stayed over the Christmas it was very busy, frankly the facilities could not cope with the amount of people staying, from the unavailability of seating in the bar area to the complete inadaquate lack of facilities at breakfast.  there was such a long queue for breakfast I could not wait I had to skip  When my daughter finally got in most of the food she wanted was gone.The breakfast area is tiny for all the guests they have staying in the hotel 

But the most disturbing aspect of the visit was the room - crazy an all night noise fro a  bottle bank sorting depot - you simply could not sleep - when I complained at 1.30pm  nothing was done - the noise went on and on and on - I rang again at 5.30am nobody answered - this simply was disgraceful in a five star hotel with the amount of money you are paying 

When I complained in the morning and looked for a manager - none could be found ""how convenient ""= my wife when paying the bill complained - there was a complete lack of empathy - just come back another time and we will see what we can do - not good enough

If you ever thinking of staying here check the location at first of your room - do not accept second best which they conveniently  shoved on us as we would not pay the €100 extra to upgrade - a very very shoody practice. Check your room location first 

This hotel is currently busy because of its location and its recent feature on RTE 1 television - but if it does not to manage correctly and expand its facilities  for the numbers coming it will suffer long term and there is always other and better hotels like the Merrion Hotel around the corner",1,2015,12,29
207,Lovely Decor extremely poor service,"Stayed on Dec 27th for a birthday celebration.Supposed to be recently refurbished room but had obvious signs of water damage in the ensuite. Lovely meal in the Saddle Room but they ran out of steaks early in the evening. Service in the residents bar was terrible, nobody clearing tables, guests waiting up to 30 mins to be seated, wrong orders and wrong bills being given to guests. In the morning we were informed that there would be a ten minute wait for a table at breakfast. We informed the staff that we had a booking in the Spa in 1 hr, made no difference, were not seated for 40 minutes. Again poor service, coffee instead of tea, plates cleared while we were getting more food, ordered a newspaper but none arrived. This is not the service I expect from a hotel with this reputation or for the money I paid. We were not the only disgruntled guests as we spoke to numerous other guests both local and international who could not understand this level of service. Extremely dissapointed for that was meant to be a special birthday.",2,2015,12,28
207,"Beautiful, authentic and friendly","This hotel is truly fabulous, it's situated at a beautiful location along the park and very close to Fade Street and the shopping area. Service is simply superb, great breakfast and beautiful rooms. A perfect stay!",5,2015,12,27
207,Noisy Construction,"My family just returned from a Christmas visit to the Shelbourne and had booked two rooms, one for my husband and I and one for our 3 children.  We arrived on a Saturday and all was fine for the weekend but on Monday morning the construction started at 9 am and the hammering was incredibly loud in our kids' room.  We tried to have them switch rooms but the only options they showed us were on a different floor our room which I didn't feel was safe.  I was really surprised that they would put families on vacation in a room right under the construction. We ended up giving up the room and all squeezing into one room for the rest of the stay but the hotel clearly didn't learn their lesson as I saw a couple with a baby going into the same room as we were checking out.  I just wanted to warn anyone booking a room there during this construction to make sure they don't put you in a room under the scaffolding as the hammering goes on all day.  I was disappointed in the way the hotel handled this.",2,2015,12,27
207,Fabulous!,"Myself & my husband stayed here for one night December 13th for my birthday. From the minute we pulled up outside the hotel we were treated so well.Check in was very quick, our room was ready at 11am. Gorgeous room. Breakfast was Devine, would definitely recommend the shelbourne pancakes. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The only fault we had was service was very slow in the bar but it was 2 weeks before Christmas & it was quite busy. Staff were so helpful & friendly. We look forward to returning again soon. ",5,2015,12,26
207,Outstanding!!,"We stayed at the Shelbourne just before Christmas. I had previously emailed the hotel to say we were staying with my parents for their 50th wedding anniversary. I also said that my mother had been unwell and we needed rooms close to each other and close to the elevator. I had a response very quickly from a member of staff (Anna) who was so helpful. When we arrived we were met by the valet parking attendant who was extremely polite and helpful. Check-in was smooth and quick. 
Our rooms were exactly as we had asked close to the elevator and each other. The rooms were spacious and luxurious, absolutely 5*. 
We had supper in the hotel which was first class, perfect staff and delicious food. The restaurant had a lovely singer who just added to the atmosphere. 
My husband and I used the pool and health suite in the Shelbourne and again it was absolute luxury. 
I can not commend everyone enough All staff were polite and friendly and we will definitely stay again. 5 Star all the way !!",5,2015,12,26
207,Our Amazing Shelbourne Wedding!,"I just got married at The Shelbourne 3 days ago and all I can say is that the entire experience  was PERFECT! From our first contact with Cathy O’Shea the Wedding Planner (we planned the entire wedding by email) to our rehearsal meal at the Saddle Room (the monkfish was divine!), to the wedding dinner, the flower service, the front desk/concierge staff- every single member of the staff we encountered was gracious, accommodating, friendly, professional and they all went out of their way to make our wedding and stay absolutely perfect. 
 I have spent my career in the high end hospitality/hotel/restaurant business and I am currently a wedding planner in the States.  I notice EVERYTHING and in almost every case my expectations are not met. And while I expected everything to go well, I did not expect The Shelbourne to blow me away with their attention to detail and their high level of service. 
 I am thoroughly impressed- I could not have asked for a more elegant, beautiful setting for the most important celebration of my life.  Bravo to The Shelbourne and its staff!",5,2015,12,25
207,Piccadilly Circus,Arrived at the Shelbourne thinking that we had booked in for a stay at a hotel.  Getting from the street to reception to check-in seemed more like navigating Piccadilly Circus  than the reception of a hotel.  People outside having a smoke; people in the foyer having a chat;  people in the hallway spilling out from the Horseshoe Bar.  I was tempted to ask for a return to Oxford Circus instead.  Hauling luggage through the throng was an adventure too. Is there not a way for people actually staying in the hotel to get through the crush?  Undoubtedly it is a popular destination for Dublin's glitterati. Hotel guests are optional.,3,2015,12,24
207,Christmas in the City,"Lovely historic hotel with excellent service, luxury rooms and very good food. Don't miss the breakfast buffet (open to 10:30am for those of us jet lagged). Especially beautiful at Christmas. Bar was quite popular but expect luxury prices. ",5,2015,12,23
207,'meeting old colleagues ',"Spent a fantastic afternoon relaxing , relating and rejuvenating with some friends in 'the old lady of Dublin'  enjoy good beer followed by a fantastic meal .. this surely is a 'relic of ould dacency '  ..  watch the world go by  . you would never know who might drop in !  .. anyone from Joe Soap to Bono   !  .. and enjoy the beautifully restored Shelbourne hotel on the green  .. well worth an afternoon wasted !",5,2015,12,23
207,Super service ,Had morning coffee with a family member and thoroughly enjoyed it. Big mention to Maja who looked after us... Every place could do with her very friendly warm service. Will defo be back.. Shelbourne is a true national treasure ,5,2015,12,23
207,Splash out on lunch or just a drink in the Bar,"This is review is simply of the bar and its food. We love the buzz that is always present in the bar, which is a Dublin Institution. Felt we owed a good write up even if there are plenty more.The clientele is always so varied from ladies of a certain age having soup and a glass of wine on their own through business men and women to a younger crowd. Stuffy it is undoubtedly not.

The welcome and service is always impeccable and friendly. The lounge for afternoon tea doesn't like sportswear but the dress code is very relaxed.  The menu varies from light specialities liked a very good smoked salmon plate through to a solid burger and very good chips. Oysters are sold individually so it could be the time to take the plunge.

Bar is well stocked and the pint of Guinness poured and stood to perfection. Timing of lunch is guaranteed if you're in a hurry (why?) but there's no pressure to leave and you can people watch as long as you like, trying to think if the people are famous - Jean Butler of Riverdance was our spot.

Don't be put off think it's overly grand and give it try. At Christmas it's worth it for the train set in the lobby!",5,2015,12,22
207,A great hotel in a great city,"A business trip to Dublin and a colleague recommended the Shelbourne. Even if we hadnt got a good rate, it would have been worth it.

The style, character and attention to detail in the hotel, and by all of the staff, are second to none. Superb quality rooms, very friendly people and only a short walk to the main shopping area and restaurants.

I will go back here if I can..",5,2015,12,21
207,"Special, elegant way to relax and enjoy afternoon tea","Very welcoming to an American couple not quite dressed enough for this special place (had just walked very nice St. Stephen's Green). Impeccably posh (new tablecloths were steam ironed before the next guests were seated), but also warmly friendly and the teas, finger sandwiches and desserts. The Grace Kelly and Hermes inspired pastries actually tasted even more amazing than they looked. Next time in Dublin we will be sure to stop again for this gem and treat",5,2015,12,20
207,Dublin style and character ,"Got a special offer booking and we were not disappointed. Simply staying at this hotel is an event in itself. We had a smaller room but it was still really nice with comfy bed and all very high quality. The breakfast is second to none, we hardly needed to eat all day! Only negative would be the foyer and bars can become rather boisterous, would be nice to have a resident only bar. ",5,2015,12,20
207,two visits,"It seems churlish to complain about the Shelbourne in view of the enormous attention to detail by most of the experienced staff.  However on two visits recently there were a succession of minor incidents which did not help the experience.

First of all in very early December two us booked Afternoon tea which I had had previously.  We booked it in person with the lady at the hotel a day in advance for the second sitting.

We turned up duly on time having been around the city.  We waited in the bar until the time and went to the desk.  The two employees seemed to have a problem seating the few people ahead and then came to us.  They could not find any record and asked us if we had booked under another name.  No we said and showed them the lady who had taken our booking.  She recognised us and said one of our names.  Without any further ado we were taken just inside the door and seated.  I was concerned that it would be unpleasant there and when I asked if there were any other seats the man (most likely inexperienced)  said no.  I said I'd like to be further away and had booked yesterday.
His answer was ""People have booked 12 months ago"".  For a five star I thought this was very poor answer.  It turned out that we enjoyed our afternoon tea very much and the selection was lovely as you would expect and we did not mind being at the door.  However we noticed he had to run and ask his colleagues questions every time a customer had a query.  A lot of the diners were half way through at that point.

So therefore on that occasion I would like to have seen a better attitude.

A week or so later I booked a room to stay in Dublin.  I checked in.  Room was lovely as you would expect.  Later on after a few hours doing the business I came for I returned tired to the hotel around 4.30 pm.  I went to the bar for some food but it was packed which of course is great for the hotel.  I did not really want to eat in the room and the Lord Mayor's room was booked out with the afternoon teas.

I went to the reception and asked the lady there if there was anywhere in the hotel to get something to eat as the bar was full etc.  No was her answer.  I asked again if there was any residents' lounge to which she answered No again.  I asked if she thought some of the people in the bar might move out to a function or anything as a lot of them were dressed up and she said she had no idea what clients would or wouldn't do.  I got a little tired then having realised she was not giving me any solution except to eat in the room.  I asked again if I could get anything to which she said  ""there are several dining options in Dublin"".  |She said the Lord Mayor's room would be free after 6 for residents. I gave up then and went and ordered room service which was splendid.  I was very surprised that there was no place for residents to relax.

My other family member joined me at 9.15 and I thought we could have a drink in the Lord Mayor's room but I was duly shunted out of there and they said it was for Supper.  I questioned that as a lot of tables were vacant could we not just go there as both bars were crammed to full capacity.  The two gentelmen seemed totally removed from any kind of empathy and just answered textbook style which is not Shelbourne style.  One took down my details and said he would talk to the manager but I heard nothing back.
We eventually were told we could sit in an area at the top of the stairs which was for residents.  

We went up there and got the cocktail menu.  A nice but unexperienced girl with black hair took our order.  About ten minutes another blond lady frog marched her over and as she was much taller stood over her shoulder which the nice girl asked for my room number.  I gave her the number and both of them marched off.

After another while the two cocktails arrived.  One of them was wrong when my daughter tasted it.  After a while the bar senior man came along and asked if the cocktails were good and my daughter explained she got the wrong one but it was ok.  He immediately offered a refund which we accepted gratefully.  After a few more minutes the girl arrived with the proper order for us both asking if we wanted to swap but as she did not say whether or not we would have to pay we declined graciously.

I was checking out the following morning and the housemaids were banging on door after 8.3o which was unusual as they would have known we were to check out later.

The copy of the Irish times never arrived.

I went for breakfast and the staff and the food were wonderful.

All in all a mixed experience.  I hope the Shelbourne are not a victim of their own success.  It is a wonderful place but needs tweaking when it obviously is so busy.",4,2015,12,20
207,get away,great staff and great hotel cant wait for next visit great food and great location hoping to go back for our annivrray . very central and in a great location .the best breakfat i have ever tasted and will,5,2015,12,20
207,Stay at Shelbourne,Very enjoyable stay. Staff were great. Very attentive and always willing to help. Bedroom was lovely and clean. The only issue was that I felt like they tried to spoof me a little by saying I got an upgrade but the real reason for this is because it was one of the rooms with scaffolding outside therefore we had no view. ,4,2015,12,20
207,Worth every penny! ,"My first visit to Dublin and as a treat from my girlfriend.
What can I say... the Sherbourne is amazing, from the staff to the rooms the food and facilities.

Ideally situated for the city centre, the staff look after every need, the buffet for meals is put if this world. 

Lovely pool and gym with steam room and sauna. Beauty treatments, bar & lounge.
I could use a string of superlatives for this hotel... but my recommendation is, visit yourself and see why.",5,2015,12,18
207,Meets all your requirments,"Wonderful friendly staff lots of elegance and steeped in history. Very much refldcts christmas as a marriot member i really felt at home.
Breakfast was variety and beautiful restaurant bars worth taking your froends for day trip.
Liesure facilities clean maintained room perfect would definately stay again
Thankyou to caeser breakfast manager for making us laugh( dhl delivered on time!",5,2015,12,18
207,Possibly the friendliest people in Dublin,"Ireland is known for the congeniality of its residents, as well as its other delights, such as Guinness and Jamesons.  The staff at The Shelbourne take the normal friendly demeanor of the Irish to another level.  All of the employees were wonderful, the rooms are fantastic, and the public areas extremely impressive.  If you go, spend some time at the Horseshoe Bar, as well as in front of the coal and turf fire.  The best hotel in town!",5,2015,12,17
207,The Best in Dublin,"I have stayed at The Westin, The Westbury, and the old Four Seasons (now Intercontinental), and none of them came close to my recent stay at The Shelbourne--I highly recommend it. Perfect location right on St. Stephen's Green, walking distance to everything from shops to Temple Bar District, and other scenic sites. The room was large and comfortable. The hotel is beautiful, and it was a special treat visiting during the Christmas season. The best part, however, was the service. From the agent at check in to the doorman at check out, every interaction with a Shelbourne representative went smoothly, efficiently, and professionally. Excellent stay. Highly recommend.

207,Spot on!,"I must admit I didn't know quite what to expect, so was even more pleased. Even though I was served by a trainee, it was as though she had been there years. The room was spacious, cracking shower and although the air-con was a bit noisy, I could open the window!

Very quiet on the 6th floor as well! Worth a return visit - again and again!",5,2015,12,16
207,Luxurious and majestic ,"Truly amazing hotel with fantastic staff. 
Stayed here in November 2015 and absolutely loved the place. 
The door staff were amazing and extremely helpful,  giving advice on where to go and what to see.
Luxurious rooms and excellent facilities 
I could sit and write about it all day.

Suffice to say that they are a credit to the hotel group an to Dublin itself. 

Thank you and we highly recommended the Shelbourne Dublin 😁",5,2015,12,16
207,Expensive but the rooms are small.,"Stayed here Easter 2015 with wife and 3 teenagers. Bar food on the first evening was very good, there's a brilliant atmosphere in the whole hotel. Brilliant location for shops etc and St Stephens Greens in front of you.
Breakfast in the restaurant was really good, great choice and great service.
The downside to our stay was exactly the same as the previous time we booked, the rooms are very small and dated. For such a expensive hotel I would expect a bit more space .",4,2015,12,15
207,Lovely hotel with perfect location ,"The hotel itself is stunning,good atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff. 
All the areas in the hotel made you feel you were 100 years back in time,and everything was lovely decorated -
Breakfast in the saddle room was very good,and the bars had a nice atmosphere .
The room was very nice decorated and had a fantastic bed,but a queen room was very very small with a microscopic bathroom ,the shower was good,but it wasn't much room elsewhere in the bathroom.
As a Marriott gold member I got a nice welcoming letter,but the hotel could maybe have treated their best customers with a small upgrade or a view...a view would have made a difference as the room was a bit claustrophobic facing a wall ...the corridors also had a bad smell during the day... 
Other than this,the hotel was perfect ,housekeeping and everyone did a good job,and it's absolutely worth 5stars.
The location is perfect ,close to shopping,bars and restaurants ,I will highly recommend The Shelbourne hotel and will not hesitate coming back ",5,2015,12,15
207,Short break to Dublin,Great location right overlooking St Stephen's Green.  Great bar always busy.  Back bar Horseshoe is also good with a lovely atmosphere.  Going to Dublin for Christmas will definitely be here. Lovely restaurant Hotel also serves afternoon tea,5,2015,12,15
207,A celebration lunch in the Saddle Room.,We booked our table as soon as we found out when my naturalization ceremony would be. The Restaurant were running a Festive Christmas Menu. Our lunch was delicious and the service impeccable. Construction work was going on but we did not notice.,4,2015,12,15
207,The finest hotel in Dublin,"We occasionally spoil ourselves and stay at the Shelbourne, the first time was 20 years ago on the night of our wedding, and it never disappoints. This time we got an upgrade to a suite making it a particularly special experience. The room was fantastic with wonderful bedding, lots of space and a sumptuous bathroom. The fact that we were in the old part of the hotel added to the experience. The staff were as attentive as ever and the complementary drinks were a nice touch. We had these in the Horseshoe Bar which is just perfect for people watching. Breakfast was very busy but the manager asked us to take a seat in the residents lounge and within 5 minutes he had found us a great table. It was a great, romantic weekend and we can't wait to go back!",5,2015,12,15
207,Superb,Stayed here for two nights at beginning of December and it was excellent. From arrival to departure the quality and efficiency of the service was very good. The room upgrade was unexpected and the room was superb. I would recommend staying at this hotel even though it was more than what we would normally pay but it was definitely worth it and a real treat for our anniversary ,5,2015,12,15
207,Expected more,Stayed here with my fiancée and we were truly looking forward to the experience.  Room was very nice but for what we paid we expected something special.  Unfortunately this was not the case. View of the extractors was not pretty.  Staff were professional but not friendly. .not rude but again we expected more. We're irish and travel to Dublin frequently but I don't think we'll venture here again.  A lot of choice in Dublin that we'll have to give consideration tooo.. ,3,2015,12,14
207,"Overall very nice, but!","Arrived on a Sunday at 12 noon, thinking that we would just drop our bag and head out, reception was very busy, but, there was a girl going around with a tray of apple cider which was delicious and a really nice touch, we were offered an upgrade for €30 which we took. The room furnishings were nice however there was a kettle instead of a nespresso machine and the bathroom was functional but you had to step into the bath for a shower, pet peeve. Would have expected a separate bath and shower. Lunch was very nice and reasonable. The bar men in the afternoon on Sunday in the horseshoe bar were awful. Yawning behind the bar, uninterested. However, the cocktails were nice and a pint of the black stuff was €6 odd, I suppose you have to expect that. The decorations are beautiful, very festive. On turndown the comp water wasn't replenished, which was disappointing. We found the bed hard and thus ended up in the pool at 7am, the heat needs to be turned up in the health club, freezing, we couldn't sit around. also pool a little grotty. Breakfast was nice, pancakes were delicious and eggs benedict was very good. Overall, we enjoyed it and would return but wouldn't pay for an upgrade as we didn't think it was worth it. ",4,2015,12,14
207,Xmas party,"We had our xmas party at the hotel on sat night, First of all I was very shocked to learn we had to walk out of the hotel and down the street to the room. The room as lovely thou, The food took way too long to come out it went on for over 2 hours so was nearly 11 by time it was over. I found the bar staff were very very slow and could not keep up with the amount of people at the bar. The worst thing was the smoking area, I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life, It was a JOKE.....Small area of about 6*4 in size, No heater, chairs and there was water coming from the light above your head....!!! That was with the other leak to the right of the light. For a 5* hotel it was the worst smoking area I have every been in.",3,2015,12,14
207,LOVED The Shelbourne Dublin!!,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel!  I was lucky enough to stay Nov 25-Nov 30!
I knew from the moment I arrived it would be the best place I've stayed in Europe.
It was drizzling as my car from the airport dropped me off and immediately there was an umbrella over my head!  (It was like that every time I arrived back at the hotel too!)

Check in was quick and easy and I was shown to my room.  The room had a plug with US voltage!!!  Also the room was HUGE in comparison to any other European hotel I've stayed in.  King size bed.  Two night stands, a desk, lounger, bureau and full size flat screen tv.  But wait, then there is the bathroom with walk in glass shower, tub, and fresh flowers.  The bathroom was almost as big as my room!

The breakfasts were wonderful and so was the service.  Room service was fantastic too.  One night I ordered dessert that had ice cream with it and they delivered it AFTER my meal !

Alan Grange Concierge was wonderful in helping me arrange two days of private tours.  I had emailed the hotel and he arranged it all.  AWESOME!!  Concierge Reece was also very, very kind and helpful.  

I was in town for two U2 shows and loved every moment of my stay in Dublin and the Shelbourne!!!",5,2015,12,13
207,Christmas on a plate,Thank you for a fabulous Christmas Afternoon tea on the first day it was on this year. You never fail to amaze us. Theodore and Adam are a credit to the team; nothing was too much trouble. Perfect place to finish of a little trip to Dublin. ,5,2015,12,12
207,Luxury break,Stayed in a beautiful junior suite for a weekend away with my husband (and no kids) 😀 The hotel is gorgeous staff efficient and courteous. Breakfast stunning.... Highly recommend the shelbourne benedict yummy. We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend here and wouldn't hesitate to return,5,2015,12,12
207,Charming full of history great service,My wife Ligita and I stayed in The Shelbourne 4th Dec.From the moment we arrived to check out was 100% hands on customer service.The room was fantastic well lit very clean and comfortable...we would recommend you have breakfast in your room....first class..they even set the table for u....this a great hotel to stay full of charm and great history.We would definitely stay again and would highly recommend The Shelbourne Hotel. ,5,2015,12,11
207,"Amazing, like a step back in time","Steeped in history and intrigue this delightful hotel delivers on every front.
What ever you though of Georgian opulence is manifested in this wonderful hotel.
The service is almost Downton Abbey  like and the Decor is unbelievable. A true 5 star experience in the centre of Dublin, a stone's throw from the Dail (Irish parliament), the National Museum and gallery, St.Stephen's Green opposite and Grafton street but 5 minutes walk away. The food is truly wonderful and we found the Saddle bar was more lively and atmospheric than the famous 'Horseshoe' bar.
Well worth a visit if you are basing yourself in the city for a few days or even just a night as we did, the luxury and experience are well worth the price.",5,2015,12,11
207,Amazing,"Amazing Hotel, amazing experience. 
Mags & Jack on reception were exceptional. They could not do enough. we were upgraded to a larger room which we were delighted with. All staff (even back of house) are so welcoming. The Shelbourne staff seem so passionate and driven. The breakfast was gorgeous. I stayed for one night to do a little christmas shopping with my mum, we will be back same time next year. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else. Room 167 was over looking a delivery area, quite noisy evening and morning, only very minor fault. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2015,12,11
207,Extraordinary Hotel let down by poor Bedroom maintenance,"We have stayed in the Shelbourne before and on the face of it is certainly a cut above the rest. The rooms are well appointed but this time things didn't work as they should have due, I think to a lack of attention to detail in the Bedroom department.  Everything else in the Hotel was perfect. The dining experience was first rate and the staff very helpful at all times. When we arrived at the hotel we were given a superior room.  My wife was rather weary and so went to bed for a rest after unpacking our suitcase. Unfortunately as we found a bit later the hot water was not working. Reception arranged for an engineer to assess the problem.  He eventually diagnosed that there was a problem with a valve in the plumbing. Reception arranged for a change of room which we did reluctantly because of the hassle of packing and unpacking again. We went to the new room and issues emerged with it.  The toilet seat had come away from its fixing. My wife couldn't operate the plug mechanism in the washhand basin because the lever was bent. The shower head was hanging out of the wall and there were no instruction on how to operate the water system in the bath. The safe was not bolted to the wall so that someone could come in and remove it along with the contents. A 5 star hotel should not have such problems. There appeared to have been a lack of attention in the maintenance of the bedrooms.

Otherwise as I have said everything else was perfect.  However as a result of this experience we will be seeking alternative accomodation in Dublin in the future. 

I have rated the service as poor because of the Bedroom maintenance issues but I would rate it excellent otherwise.",4,2015,12,11
207,Classic hotel in the heart of Dublin,"At first blush walking into the Renaissance Shelburne through its grand, gilded doors, the hotel seemed a bit stuffy . But that all changed as soon as we started talking to staff, a very friendly group led by Dennis the concierge .
 
Renovations were going on, but really caused no discernible disruption. Our room was large enough and lovely. Amenities were fine and breakfast each morning was outstanding. 

Look for the promotion ""Take the Elevator Home"" for a deluxe room including breakfast and a couple of drinks at the bar.

We  checked four other close by centre city hotels to compare. They all were 5 star properties like the Shelburne but seemed to appeal to a younger, hipper crowd.  

Liked the Shelburne, loved Dublin.

First time here and we fell in love with this wonderful, friendly walkable city. The Guinness tour is a must as was the wonderful  Fabulous Food Trails foodie walking and snacking tour. Loved visiting Grafton Street and Temple Bar neighborhoods and Trinity College.",4,2015,12,11
207,Quite spectacular in every fashion,"We began our 8-day Ireland vacation in Dublin, and spent one night here at the Shelbourne. We arrived rather early in the morning and were prepared to not check-in and just leave our bags. The staff told us our room was not available, but another room that was a little larger was ready and was only €30 to do so. It was totally worth it, checking in and showering before taking on the day and night in Dublin on zero sleep. 

The room was not huge, but the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was nearly silent too, even with construction happening all over the building as it is being renovated. The bathroom was spacious and rather luxurious and the other room appointments were high quality. Everything was spotlessly clean. The free Wifi worked pretty well in our room.

Included in our rate was a traditional Irish breakfast which was expansive and wonderful. We were served by very attentive staff and ate a great meal to being our next day. 

All of the staff were very kind and helpful. I wish we could have stayed more nights to enjoy their hospitality and the comfort of this hotel. Do plan to stay here if you have the choice.",5,2015,12,10
207,"Amazing hotel, staff and food!","We stayed at The Shelbourne for my Wife's 40th birthday.  Being a special occasion and my Wife's first trip to Dublin I went a little extravagant and booked a premium room.  Yes, it was pricey but it was well worth it.  The room was huge, comfortable and very clean.  My Wife was very impressed, as was I.  Ahead of our visit I contacted the concierge to arrange for flowers and champagne in the room, all there when we arrived and the flowers were stunning.  During our stay, service was impeccable, food was great and the whole atmosphere was amazing, sometimes you really do get what you pay for. If I have to say that there was a down side, and it was in truth hardly noticeable, you do get a little traffic noise from around 6am but it is a city centre hotel so should be expected; also the hotel is currently being refurbished so during the day time you hear a little noise from the ongoing work. In conclusion, if you can afford it, I would absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,12,10
207,An extraordinary hotel,A classic beauty in the heart of Dublin awash in history. Our family was able to enjoy a beautiful Christmas in Ireland and the Shelbourne pulls out all the stops! All of the thoughtful extras made it a memorable stay. Great locations are within walking distance and the concierge staff is second to none. ,5,2015,12,07
207,A must stay while in Dublin,"The Shelbourne in Dublin is right in the middle of everything you could want. It is one of the older hotels in Dublin and stunning. The service is great, the rooms are wonderful and the food in the restaurant is excellent. If you want a super trendy hotel go to the Four Seasons, which is nearby. But if you want real Dublin, with old fashion manners and the best service in the City, stay at the Shelbourne. A few Presidents have stayed there and others. It is just uber cool. I love it and when I visit Dublin I just don't bother staying anywhere else. You will love it. Down the street from the hotel is a great bar, the name escaping me, but leave the front of the hotel and start walking to the left one block, cross the street and it is there. It is a local's bar and the people there, as in all of the South, are funny and kind. They will buy you drinks, give you tips on where to go. After they have gotten you plastered (I don't drink but the husband does), go back to the hotel and fall into a comfortable bed.",5,2015,12,05
207,"Stunning hotel, popular with all","Our 2nd stay at the Shelbourne was generally fantastic. 

The room, breakfast and bernal service was excellent as always. We also had afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors lounge, which was delicious.

I have read another post from someone else this week who raised 2 current 'problems' - its popularity for Christmas parties and also ongoing work to the facade. Having a drink in either of the 2 bars was impossible, and whilst the LM lounge is for guests only, there is no atmosphere (you don't want to do more than whisper!). 

The work is also obviously important, and I guess we were unlucky, but it does put a dent in the overall experience.

Will probably come back but not in xmas party season! ",4,2015,12,04
207,Disappointed,"As Lifetime Gold members of Marriott, we try to stay in an affiliated property as often as possible.  On this trip to Dublin, we stayed for the first time at the Shelbourne, a stately (and expensive) property with rich tradition right on St. Stephen's Green.  At check-in, we asked about an upgrade which Marriott provides as a matter of policy when available.  The receptionist told us they were fully booked, and no upgrade was available.  Then she proceeded to check further and told us if we paid an extra 30 euros a night, we could get a ""heritage"" room.  We assumed this must be a suite, but it was not a suite--it was simply a room.  And it bothered us, as loyal Marriott patrons, that we had been worked over.  At check out, we asked a different receptionist if this was common practice, as it seemed unusual.  She told us the upgrade was actually 80 euros and that we were lucky to be only charged 30.  Wow.    

We boarded a plan for London, checked into the JW Marriott Grosvenor House, and (without asking) were given a complementary upgrade to an executive room, with access to the concierge lounge.  The contrast to our experience at the Shelbourne was stark.

To be fair, the Shelbourne is a beautiful old hotel, with beautiful art, nice rooms, and most of the employees were top notch.  Still, it was disappointing that the first night place was filled with drunken graduates from Trinity college (throwing up in the bathrooms).  The outside façade was being repaired, and a big tarp was draped over the front entrance.  Next time in Dublin, we will stay at Powerscourt.",2,2015,12,03
207,Excellent Food,"This hotel has it all, excellent food wonderfully trained staff and great rooms.  Location is excellent for shopping.  Breakfast is wonderful.  Afternoon tea is an experience which matches central London for quality. I would return again",5,2015,12,03
207,Very nice hotel,"The hotel is located right in the city center, very convenient location. The building itself is very nice. Reception was very friendly, checking in smooth and quick. Help offered with luggage. The room is very stylish, beautiful and comfortable bed. Big variety for breakfast, pastry, continental, and lots of fruit and cereal, even hot porridge. Staff very friendly and everyone greeted me all the time. Gym open from 6am, free towels, modern machines. No free weights available, I presume because of health and safety. Still good workout, good amount of cardio machines. Pity I didn't have swim suit with me, but they've got a big swimming pool also. Would definitely come back, nice, pleasant stay and the room was quiet also with fast internet connection.",5,2015,12,02
207,great,"Good location. Very nice staff. An ""old"" hotel in a good sense. Good breakfest. Very good room service. Great bathroom. I was extremely pleased with the stay. Nothing to complain about. Very busy hotel bar.",5,2015,12,02
207,Amazing Hotel,"This may be the best hotel I have ever stayed in. From the moment you arrive everything is exceptional. There are bellmen to greet you and take your bags, someone accompanies you to the front desk to check in and offers you a refreshment.  The rooms are elegantly decorated and spotlessly clean. Location is perfect for walking Dublin, across the street from St. Stephen's Green and around the corner from shopping on Grafton Street. Breakfast was delicious and the Saturday afternoon jazz in the bar was a real treat. Wait staff, bartenders, concierge were all excellent. Excellent experience would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,12,01
207,A spolit retirement weekend,"This was supposed to be a real treat for my husband's retirement. The Hotel could not find any space for us on Friday, or Saturday night, nor lunch on Saturday. I complained the manager who sent a bottle of wine but forgot to come back to us about lunch on Saturday.  We therefore had room service and they got the order wrong.  Breakfast early Sunday was cold, we couldn't wait we had a flight. So really this was simply a bed factory for us, the hotel was absolutely mobbed both nights. Clearly, residents don't much matter to them as there was nowhere for us to relax!",2,2015,12,01
207,Stunning afternoon Tea,"This has to be the best afternoon tea experience in Dublin. It is non stop pleasure from the elegant surroundings, excellent service, fab champagne and of course, tasty treats. The cakes are expertly executed and the flavours will linger in your mind for some time.",5,2015,11,29
207,Luxury hotel - and it shows!,"Stayed for one night with my daughter, bed and breakfast + 3 course dinner, a lovely Christmas (2014) present from our daughter. I had walked past this hotel on many occasions, having heard so much about it, but this was the first time staying in it. On arrival at the hotel, valet parking sorted any parking issues instantly! Perfect! Was guided by member of staff to reception, where we registered while being offered real lemon juice. Check in was completed in no time! We had upgrade to a ‘Heritage' room, and it was large, comfortable, massive soft bed, and the bathroom was HUGE!!! Had a quick drink in the bar - very nice and friendly, and dinner was perfectly organised, with small but nicely prepared meals. Not sure the extra charge of 7 Euro for the sirloin was warranted - however could not fault the food or the service. Serving staff very professional and competent - it showed they were well trained. Had some more drinks in the bar later, and slept well all night, before enjoying a beautiful breakfast, yet again served by a competent and friendly waitress. It was totally hassle free. Checkout was equally pain free - done in 30 seconds - before leaving in the car which had conveniently been brought back to the front of the hotel by the concierge - what a lovely experience!",5,2015,11,28
207,Best hotel ever stayed in,"Where do I start, quite simply the best. We were lucky enough to get a great deal on this hotel after watching Richard E Grants hotel secrets. We have been looking forward to it for some time. We were not disappointed, firstly we were upgraded on arrival free of charge, the room was outstanding, very clean and great service. Breakfast is a fantastic experience. We loved the oyster bar on an evening and to top it off I booked champagne afternoon tea as a surprise for my wife, this was an absolute treat. I would like to put some photos on to show how good, but the app isn't working for photos. Hope we can visit again someday ",5,2015,11,26
207,Can't rate it 5 stars yet. ,"Having been at the Shelbourne numerous times down through the years for different events, and to enjoy a bite to eat during the day etc, strangely it was only my first time staying in it's ccomodation relatively recently. 

I will start with the negatives to end on the positive. 

The reception area can be one of chaos and confusion. It was extremely crowded and there were people using the very busy guests elevator that presumably should have used a service elevator with cleaning equipment which had a very strong odour. 
The hallway outside my room had another much more displeasing pungent odor which lingered for the duration of my stay. 
On entering the room I noticed very quickly that the ""bathroom"" was the smallest bathroom I have ever seen.akmost comical so. It was as though a wardrobe had been converted. I make no exaggeration when I say it was not much wider than the toilet to the shower. Very claustrophobic area. Reminded me of a toilet area on a boat.
The room was visibly quite dusty.  Unacceptably so for a 5star hotel. There was dust in multiple areas. Especialy under the glass areas on the furniture. That was easily noticed and therefore missed /skipped by the cleaners.
Service in the bar is slow. Between the smell in the hallway, the TINY bathroom and the dust, I certainly could not award the hotel 5 stars. I was dissapointed and suprised. 

Now the positives. 
Most of the staff are very charming and extremely helpful. Especialy the doormen and concierge. Truly very attentive and worthy of a special mention. The Shelbourne is in a fantastic location and the fact that it is within walking distance of Grafton street and Stephens green is a bonus. The hotel has an old world charm certainly. If you are looking for flashy, modern luxury try the Marker hotel in Dublin, but I personaly like the romance and glamour of the Shelbourne, it reminds me of the Walforf NYC which has had its problems too but also remains charming nontheless. 
The lobby is beautiful and is tastefully decorated.  The florists do a good job and there is always a lively atmosphere directly on entering through the doors. 
The bathrooms downstairs are that of a 5star and very elegant. There is a barbers and a spa. The food is good and there are facilities available for private dining -my husband has eaten there with colleagues and clients previously. There are many areas to relax and converse in. There is a nice ambiance downstairs both during the day and at night.  
I was particularly impressed by the excellent breakfast. In fact it was the highlight of my stay. Wide range of choice.   Cooked to perfection and wonderful presentation.  Breakfast couldn't be faulted. 

So I have given a 4 but wish it had been a 5 star experience. ",4,2015,11,26
207,No respect for voucher holders. Poor communication.,"My sister recently spent €350.00 of her hard earned cash on a Shelbourne Hotel voucher granting us 1 night bed breakfast and evening meal in the Saddle Room.
On Monday morning (its now Thursday) we emailed the Hotel reservations to ask if we could use it for this coming Saturday night and add Friday as an extra night for which we would pay. We had no response. So I sent the email again the following day. No response. Time was getting tight so I sent the email to the Voucher Department at the hotel. No response 2 days later. Ok so I sent a Fax copy of the email to the front desk / sales on Tuesday evening highlighting the question. No response. Sent  the fax again on Wednesday with bigger highlights and here we are on Thursday without any communication from the Hotel whatsoever. I can only guess that they are busy preparing for Christmas of in the middle of filming another series for TV. Why don't I call them ? I should not have to. I contrast this sloppy way of doing business to an experience recently with a proper 5 star hotel in Portugal where emails from us concerning airport transfers, dinner reservations etc were promptly answered within a couple of hours by well trained local staff and a piece of clothing left behind was posted back to us. You will see from a previous review that our last visit to the Shelbourne did not go particularly well either but we were hoping to make a fresh start and give it another chance. Wont be this weekend !",2,2015,11,26
207,A Fabulous Hotel,"Only got to stay for one night, but it was a memorable one.  We ate in the Saddle Room Restaurant, and the food and service was super.  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a special occasion. The location and Service cannot be beaten.

207,Wonderful,"We stayed here for while In  Dublin  celebrating two joint special occasions. Sunday moment are are car arrived and door open for us the service what outstanding ,every member of staff was warm happy and helpful. We had lunch on our first day which was gorgeous and a breakfast are also wonderful with a huge selection to choose from all good standard. They really made are trip special and I could not of asked for more. Simply wonderful",5,2015,11,24
207,Fantastic !!,"One of the best places I have ever stayed. Great customer service throughout our stay.We had booked a balcony room but with the exterior works we were upgraded to a suite. Chocolates delivered to the room as a Halloween treat was a lovely touch. Breakfast & the service by the people on the floor was exemplary.
Well worth the price...",5,2015,11,24
207,AS MAGNIFICENT A PLACE AS THERE IS,"you get what you pay for - history, elegance, service and incredible comfort. we were upgraded to a suite as renovations blocked our view of St Stephans Green. more elegant than the Plaza in NY. rented a car via concierge - Enterprise delivered. had dinner in the Saddleroom - great steaks and specials. and drinks in the #27 Bar and lounge - cocktails and piano like you see in movies. centrally located in the heart of Dublin, 2 blocks from Trinity College. staff was wonderful. did i mention we got room service in the morning of our departure in 15 minutes!? expensive yes, but worth the treat!",5,2015,11,23
207,Faultless ,I stayed here for my 40th I was a little apprehensive because of the building works going the place would be chaos. But from the moment we got out of our taxi the staff were amazing. A glass of fresh lemonade was given to us on arrival. Our room was wonderful and they did a turn down service every evening . I'm not sure what people are complaining about on here but breakfast was brilliant and yes the bar is a little expensive but it's a 5 star hotel in the city centre. The hotel couldn't do enough for us great pool and gym. A wonderful hotel steeped in history. Thank you for a great stay ,5,2015,11,23
207,Rip off bar prices!!!,"Had a great evening at a trade social event in the main function room of the Shelbourne Hotel. Food good, entertainment appropriate for the event, company brilliant. Experience soured somewhat by the excessive prices charged for some drinks at the bar. Glass of house red €15.50 and a glass of sparkling water with ice (from a large bottle of sparkling water that remained behind the bar !) €7 !!!!! I can only think the hotel assume that all the guests were on expenses and price was not an issue ! If that is the case, they are sadly mistaken, as many of the guests at the event were struggling small business owners, for whom this event is the sole annual social outing with their trade peers and suppliers to raise money for trade members fallen on hard times. How much of the bar proceeds at these prices went to the charity?
Has become the abiding memory of the night despite all else being perfect.
Please review bar pricing.",2,2015,11,21
207,"Overpriced, aging hotel","Room was small, air con was not functioning at first so room was cold, when it was working it was so old and clunky, throwing out an average of 70db that it was impossible to sleep.  So had to turn off and wake up cold
Breakfast was a poor selection, and mostly cold, and the seat i was given was no where near so had to make trek to refresh my orange juice, one staff did point out as i was on my fourth trip that they could refresh it but that was the first i had seen of a staff in the isolated room they put me.
On the plus side nicely dressed guys to say hello as you walk in, i guess that is what you pay for.  Oh and good free wifi",2,2015,11,19
207,Wonderful stay,Check in was quick bedroom was big and beautiful swimming pool was great we had it to ourselves great to swim with no kids jumping in. Wonderful breakfast just love this hotel.. Nice touches in the room beds turned down and slippers left out beside bed.,5,2015,11,19
207,Brill,"Great stay yet again. Good food, oysters you will never better! Guinness always good so hard to say a bad word. Well done to all the staff thank you to the barman (Gabor Kiss) who arranged for steak for my guests despite the chap at the restaurant till  (think his name was Daniel who couldn't be bothered) saying it wasn't possible til 5.30 (bar menu could do with a steak on as not everyone into steak sandwiches) and a special mention to Antoinette who kindly arrange for a nice strong coffee at breakfast! Best wishes Noel Sainsbury ",5,2015,11,18
207,Awesome,My wife and I recently stayed at the Shelbourne and loved it from minute we arrived to the minute we left. The staff were great and made you feel special. The hotel is a beautiful classic with great old world charm and you cannot beat the location! When we are next in Dublin we will returning!,5,2015,11,18
207,Another lovely break at the Shelbourne,Just returned from another lovely stay at the Shelbourne. The staff are excellent & are pleasant & helpful in every way. We got a lovely room & a bottle of Prosecco and macaroons for our Anniversary & my husband's Birthday. . Lovely touch. ,5,2015,11,15
207,"Fabulous Hotel, perfect location.","The bedrooms are beautifully furnished and very spacious, we were very lucky to have views over St Stephens Green Park.  Great location in the heart of the city.  Lobby, bar and all common areas stylish and tasteful, a blend of old world charm and contemporary design.  Breakfast was delicious, and the service was second to none throughout.  Needless to say, I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,11,14
207,Utterly perfect,"We stayed in Dublin for the weekend and this hotel exceeded all expectations. 
The rooms were beautiful both in decor and comfort. The breakfast was truly exceptional with a variety of interesting options that catered for all tastes. 
We ordered room service on one night which was equally delicious, the service was first class throughout our stay. I would recommend this is everyone and it made our weekend very special indeed.",5,2015,11,14
207,A Delightful Experience - One to be repeated!,"We had a lovely stay at the historic and famous Shelbourne Hotel. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and were very kindly upgraded to a junior suite, which was very nice. The check in staff could not have been more helpful. Our room's windows  were covered by canvas, enclosing the facade during renovations. It was very nice, clean and very comfortable. We visited the horseshoe bar, where cocktails and other drinks are promptly and pleasantly served. We had dinner in the Saddle room restaurant which was absolutely delicious, and again service was wonderful. The Saddle room was also the venue for breakfast. It was extremely busy, and we had quite a wait for tea/coffee and an even longer one for toast. the buffet breakfast was again delicious, although the scrambled egg was not quite as hot as I would have liked. The really insignificant negatives did not detract from the absolutely wonderful stay. I really look forward to doing it all again!",5,2015,11,14
207,STYLISH FOR SURE,"How could you go wrong with the Shelbourne overlooking St. Stephen's Green, this palatial hotel is set in a grand 1842 Victorian building with an ornate facade. It's 4 minutes' walk from upscale shopping on Grafton Street, a 5-minute walk from the National Gallery of Ireland and 9 minutes' walk from Trinity College.

Luxe rooms in classical styling feature elegant fabrics, marble bathrooms, free WiFi, flat-screen TVs with cable channels, and iPad/iPhone docks (which was GREAT).   if you want to treat yourself if only for one night go there!!!",4,2015,11,14
207,Delicious food and happening bar,"We had a lovely lunch at the Shelbourne. It is a lovely hotel, a great stop as you make your way around Dublin. Planning on staying here the next time I visit. The Shelbourne is an integral part of Dublin and you can feel the history within.",5,2015,11,14
207,Afternoon Tea,Fabulous afternoon Tea. Outstanding service and tasty food. Great variety of sandwiches and cakes and plenty to eat. Free coffee top ups throughout. It didn't feel rushed even though we were there after our allocated time on the table. Lovely way to spend an afternoon in Dublin. Would highly recommend ,5,2015,11,12
207,Attention to detail and warm welcomes,"We stayed for our 32nd anniversary on Sunday night. Everything was beautiful. The extra little touches in the room really made our stay very special. Dinner in saddlers was excellent, as was the breakfast the next morning. This was our best hotel break by far. The staff were all very welcoming and helpful. Will definitely go to the Shelbourne again.",5,2015,11,11
207,"Disappointing , disheartening and upsetting ... :(","I have had the opportunity to stay at ""The Shelbourne "" on a number of occasions... My last visit to ""The Shelbourne"" was unimpressive and below par.. It seems to have lost it's charm.. I loved staying here in years past......
.
My stay in August 2015 was ghastly , it was lacking it's former brilliance, liveliness, vitality and spirit.....

I was extremely excited to be staying at ""The Shelbourne"" again ... I was staying with my son who also was excited to be returning there... 

On previous visits to ""The Shelbourne"" , I felt I was staying at one of the world's best hotels... I have many photos of these stays, many smiles , many magical memories, and always left the hotel with a sadness but determination to return...
 
We had fallen in love with ""The Shelbourne""...

In August 2015...Upon arrival .. no welcoming lemonade.. no cookies... no smiles... not a relaxing experience...
 
We stood in line... were met by a receptionist who spoke quickly.. it was rushed...

They was no offer to carry our bags to our suite as there were on previous visits... we made our way to our suite ... ""The Earl of Shelbourne suite"", which I am familiar with as stayed there before... 

Upon opening the door... there was a strong smell of disinfectant.... It lingered throughout our stay.. it was overpowering .. 

There were no flowers in our suite, it was dark, drap, dull. uninviting and tired looking...

As we had travelled some distance, the first thing I did was to drop our bags and head into the bathroom ... As I entered the bathroom I noticed scaffolding outside the window... then a screen outside of this ... I saw no one outside at this stage, heard no noises at this stage... continued as you do without getting to personal... and then I caught a glimpse of a guy wearing a work helmet looking in at me... I was and still am completely shocked by this... he quickly turned around and I quickly started to pull the blinds down .... 

As I continued to our bedroom where I had left our bags and began to unpack.. the noises began... hammering ... non stop hammering... guys walking back and forth.. chatting in-between the work and extremely loud banging ... 

I headed in to make a coffee in the other room and yet again I could not get away from these guys... I honestly can not put across the disappointment, high noise level , stress, let down and upset that this caused... 

My son was watching all the activity , waving out ... kneeling on a chair to see some more.. 

I contacted reception and was told Guest relations would be in contact very soon... A girl kindly called up to see us.. She said she could move us to another room.. She brought us to see it... it was a double room.. one bed, very small, tiny, crammed with little space... with a balcony.. at the back of the hotel looking over to an office block or apartments I believe.... ... this would not be in anyway suitable while staying with a little boy however I did thank her for caring to do this... she gave us the opportunity to think about moving, this was over a cocktail and drink in the bar... although this was kind , it does not impress me in the least.. I don't usually bring my son into bars... And as we had looked forward to a stay at a suite for a long time, a stay in a one bed, tiny room at the back of the hotel, ( with balcony ) was very upsetting.. It is not every day we get the chance to stay in a suite... This stay was planned and we had been counting down the days... it was also a stay to mark ""special milestones"" which the hotel knew about in advance... it was a total let down to us both... my heart hurt... tears were shed... 

We decided not to move as she had said the guys were finished up work ... we returned to room to change and to make arrangements for an event my son was attending early the next morning... we left hotel for awhile after this and later returned to meet another girl who did the turndown service.. she asked if we needed anything, I asked if I could please have a robe and slippers for my child, she brought these back.. however did not do a turndown service.. severe lack of hospitality .. I also must add she returned much later when my son was already in bed asleep... 

The following morning.. we had arranged for breakfast early in our room... again there were problems with this... we had no pepper .. I rang for some and got peppermint tea instead... I had asked for milk for my son as his drink instead of tea/coffee on the breakfast list which hung from our door the evening before.. when I asked for his milk, I was told the milk was in a jug on our tray...... no glass and this milk was for cereals... he never did receive his milk.. this is not a big problem however it was the smartness of saying his milk is in the jug that I found rude .. 

We headed out early, when we got back to hotel to change for a day at the museums, again the workers were hammering away.. it was really difficult to remain focused on anything as every time I went to speak to my son, there was another loud set of banging... there were guys walking past all the rooms in our suite... trying to change was difficult so in the end we had to close our windows, our blinds etc. it was like staying in a dark depressing room, with the odour lingering from the disinfectant we encountered upon arrival and also from breakfast items still in place from earlier .... there was nothing but noise upon noise... 

we headed down to the concierge desk.. there was a guy which I knew from our last visit there however he was busy.. there was also another guy.. wore glasses I believe.. I asked him which was the quickest way to get to ""The Natural History Museum"" , he seemed uninterested.. was not very chatty and in fact I felt I had no place in ""The Shelbourne"" at this stage.. he replied, left and left I believe .nothing else.. no have a nice day.. nothing at all. I found him quite rude... 

After our day of touring the museums, we returned to our suite, it was disappointing, darkened from earlier when I had closed the curtains.. uninviting ..depressing... the  door knocked again , it was the turndown service, the girl asked if we wanted anything... I asked if I could have some coffee for the room please... it arrived much later... no turndown service at all.. 

Upon our departure, I was met by a lovely girl who listened to me about our time there, however although she listened kindly , our time was over and we were leaving our break in Dublin... 

I had put this time aside to celebrate special milestones to stay at this hotel and to also fit in some work my son was involved in ... I wanted to create happy memories for us both... This did not happen .. 

It was a disappointing, uninviting , unwelcoming , dark, loud and upsetting visit to ""The Shelbourne"" .. 

I will attach some pictures from our visit to this hotel, These are not pictures of just one worker... there were a number of workers outside all our windows...I have lots and lots of photos of this, lots of recordings of the noise , it was horrendous .. The only reason I am giving this hotel 2 stars is due to it's location ... It is in a fabulous location , near St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street and some of Ireland's best museums...  

If I had have gotten a mail to say the renovations were going on , I would not have booked this hotel for our stay at this time... ... however to blame it all on renovations would be wrong... I found some of the staff unfriendly..in fact quite rude... 

 A complete change for our previous stays ... 

Our privacy was disturbed by the restoration project that was undergoing on the front of the hotel, I do understand this has to happen, I feel I should have been told of this when booking so as to decide if I would like to stay during this time or not...  I would not have stayed at this time..... 

We have had our time, it is over and we are totally disappointed ... The excitement we had upon travelling to ""The Shelbourne"" , was changed to tears while there...  and nothing can erase the disappointments we had...
However I am writing this review to advise people that there are renovations going on .. and rightly so... however if you are prepared to spend quite a lot of money to enjoy a quiet time away , be aware of the on going work on his beautiful building... it has to be done... but at least look into it first.....",2,2015,11,11
207,Careful of the small details,"Having booked the Shelbourne a good few times (always excellent), I was booking again for a break before Christmas. I emailed the Reservation Dept and got a rate €50 dearer than the rate available on generic website. When I queried this I was informed that this was a 'Queen room' not suitable for 2 people! I asked for clarity and was told that it was not really suitable for 'leisure'. I felt it was a poor attempt at trying to charge more for direct booking- which I feel should always offer best deals.  Needless to say we booked elsewhere.",2,2015,11,09
207,Another Stunning Visit,"Another one of our regular visits to the Shelbourne, this time with Grandchildren. Like us, they are now hooked on the décor, quality of food and exceptional service.
The total professionalism of the staff is the reason we return time and time again. On this occasion, we only had time for a day visit to shop (from the East Midlands). Lunch at the Shelbourne never disappoints.",5,2015,11,09
207,I will be back..,"I remember walking past the Shelbourne as a student in Dublin admiring it's grand entrance and smartly dressed doormen.  Walking into the impressive drawing room for afternoon tea was a treat, and the staff were just so friendly.  A warm welcome and a perfect cup of tea and the perfect atmosphere to sit and watch the world go by either watching the crowds pass the windows or the constant flow of visitors to and from the hotel.  It's a fabulous hotel in a fantastic location just a few steps from St Stephen's green.",5,2015,11,08
207,Central location,"The hotel was in central Dublin, opposite a park. Great access to main attractions. I had afternoon tea there. It was excellent. The breakfast was yummy as well as having a wide range of choices. The rooms were good. If I go back to Dublin, I will stay here again.",5,2015,11,06
207,Very nice personnel,"This hotel has a great bar and very friendly personnel.
The breakfast is great. Sometimes you have to wait a little bit longer if you ask for a special dish in the morning but overall is this a great hotel and very well situated.
I certainly will come back.",5,2015,11,05
207,I will be back.. Someday!! ,"We stayed here for 2 days and 2 nights. It was amazing. We arrived at 6:00am and they offered to have us use their spa to shower and refresh ourselves on arrival because our room was not ready and threw in an additional Irish breakfast at no cost. We had a balcony room, high floor with no view. I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money for the view because the facade is under renovation. The staff was excellent. The beds were amazing and I just cannot say enough about this place. The location is supreme and easy to walk anywhere. ",5,2015,11,03
207,Traditional Irish Elegance,"Wonderful hotel located directly across from St. Stephens Green.  Walking distance to Grafton Street, Temple Bar district, Trinity College, Christs Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Hop on and hop off bus located right across the street as well.",5,2015,11,03
207,Shelbourne,"A classic, charming hotel with modern amenities. Great bathroom, I took a tub bath after running the Dublin Marathon. I rarely do that, only when the tub is extremely clean. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was comfortable and delicious.",5,2015,11,03
207,Great stay,"I stayed here with my boyfriend few weeks ago. It was just lovely. Great bright and spacious room, fantastic location. The staff were very helpful and on point all the time. We both enjoyed the breakfast the next morning. Couldn't fault it. Next time in Dublin- we will probably stay here again.",5,2015,11,03
207,Sublime,"What a lovely hotel. We arrived early but that was no bother, our room was ready. Fantastically luxurious bed and linens ( and I am really fussy about thread counts). Professional staff. Wonderful surroundings. Perfectly placed for exploring Dublin.",5,2015,11,02
207,What staff!!,"The hotel is having a facelift which blocked the view over St Stephen's Green...disappointing! The wifi is terrible. It kept dropping out when I was in the middle of something. However, despite these problems the hotel is still a five star experience made that way primarily by the wonderful staff. Afternoon tea was superb and the bedroom excellent.",5,2015,11,02
207,Amazing long weekend away a must stay if anyone's staying in Dublin ! ,"My boyfriend and I stayed here last week for a late birthday treat and stayed in one of the Kings suits I have to say the room, hotel and staff really are amazing ! Our room was always spotless and the staff were sooooo friendly we even treated ourselves to a afternoon tea in the hotel and that was even perfect so all in all this hotel is yes again PERFECT !!! X ",5,2015,11,02
207,Perfect birthday weekend!,"We booked 2 nights with breakfast for a weekend birthday. From the minute we stepped in, everything was perfect! The room was spacious and luxurious and the staff brought a birthday plate to the room with biscuits and chocolate. The second night was Halloween and when we came back to the room after a day out, there was a lovely little pumpkin on the dining table full of truffles! Such a nice touch! Breakfast was absolutely amazing - we ordered from the menu and were not at all disappointed. We would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2015,11,01
207,FANTASTIC!,"We started our trip in Dublin and loved our stay here! The food was excellent and the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. The location is fantastic being across the street from St. Stephens green, the hop-on-hop-off buss tour, and a block from great shopping. We will definitely be coming back. Tip: Make sure you have high tea as it was a highlight. We reserved our rate on Trip Advisor for $260 a night including breakfast.",5,2015,11,01
207,splendid!,"This is an excellent hotel, in the middle of the city.It is also a part of the Irish history. I've spent three nights there with my husband, discovering the city. The bed and the sheets were wonderful. I had the best sleep in a long time. The staff is very polite. They do everything possible to make your stay a splendid one. The bar and the tearoom are quite popular. I recommend this hotel to everyone who like some luxury in their travels.",5,2015,11,01
207,Perfect!,"I stayed here with friends for New Years eve and was perfect! Right in the middle of Dublin and super luxurious. We booked well in advance so got a good rate but i believe its very expensive normally. Really nice experience wish ,we had stayed longer. Lovely atmosphere in the bar for the countdown. Would definitely stay again if i could afford!",5,2015,10,31
207,Nice one,"Charming hotel and perfectly located in the heart of Dublin, near main highlights and party places.
Breakfast not as great as expected: good quality but not enough variety.
Staff is helpful and nice.
Rooms are very comfortable.",4,2015,10,30
207,Absolutely PERFECT in EVERY WAY! Already planning next visit...,"*Note: We have some good photos posted with this review*

My wife and I did a 50th birthday trip to Ireland, Scotland, and England a few months ago in late May and early June 2015.  For her special occasion I planned for several months to try to get it all perfect and as Dublin was our first stop in the adventure I especially wanted to take extra time to make sure I picked the right hotel for us to set the stage for the entire holiday.  

As always, I do almost all of my initial hotel and restaurant research on Tripadvisor and quickly found several that looked promising.  I was aiming for luxury on this trip so I had The Merrion, The Westbury, The Marker, and The Croke Park on my shortlist.

While we enjoy fine hotels, we prefer sites that also have lively lobby bars, restaurants, & good energy.   For that reason, even though The Merrion ranked so highly, it seemed that it might be perhaps a little too quiet for us, and some of the other properties were a bit more attractive for that reason than the Merrion.

I placed a phone call to each of the hotels to ask a few questions about amenities, location, etc and also mentioned it was going to be a special visit for my wife's visit.

All of the staff were very nice and informative, but one stood out far and wide from the others early in the call and by the time the call was over I knew 'This is where we want to stay'.  That person was Peter Cooke, Guest Relations Manager at The Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin.

As melodramatic as this may sound, it's simply the only way I know how to say it - Peter made me feel like a long lost family member coming home again after a lifetime apart.  He asked not only what we wanted to do with our time in Dublin, but also made some suggestions, and even gave some pointers on some things he considered to be 'not to miss' while in Ireland, over and above our stay with them if we chose to do so. His interest in our upcoming visit and his enthusiastic responses had me hooked.

I will not belabor every detail of each of our several conversations and many email communications while I made all the preparations for our visit, so I will just say that Peter was the embodiment of what I expect when I am travelling and staying at a luxury property.  He balances his communications with the perfect combination of confident professionalism mixed with genuine interest in our comfort and overall Dublin experience while in his care at the hotel.

We arrived in Dublin mid afternoon on a BEAUTIFUL Sunday in late may and went straight to the hotel.  The door staff were incredible.  Instantly meeting us at the car and welcoming us the The Shelbourne and Dublin with smiles all around.

We were escorted in the front doors and were immediately impressed with the beautiful hotel  lobby.  It's an older hotel, and maintained fabulously.  Intricately carved pure white woodwork, with gold leaf trim, even on the ceiling, sets the stage as you walk in the front doors.  SEE IMAGES ATTACHED TO THIS REVIEW.  You rarely see woodwork like this in new properties - simply fantastic.

We were taken through to the check in desk and as soon as I gave my name the clerk immediately welcomed us to Ireland and greeted my wife with a big 'Happy Birthday Ms. S! and welcome to Ireland!'    It's not a big deal, in fact on the surface it's quite small - but it's the combined little details and minutia that often tip the scales to turn a visit that's absolutely 'fine' to absolutely PERFECT.  

We have been fortunate to stay in quite a few 4 and 5 star hotels so our expectations and fairly high.  And in our previous stays in Europe, the hotel room has traditionally been quite small, regardless of the quality of the hotel and decor.  Our room at The Shelbourne was simply perfect.  It was big even by American standards at 32sqm/344sqft,  directly facing St Stephens Green, with an amazing king size bed, plush chair and ottoman, desk, and large en suite bathroom.  The room was trimmed in gold fabrics, and pale yellows, elegant floor to ceiling window treatments and the double windows let all of that glorious sunshine (YES!  Super sunny almost our entire stay in IE!) fill the room with a warm and relaxing glow..(Dont forget to check out the photos)

After we settled it we discussed that the room was so nice, were we not so excited to go out exploring Dublin we would have stayed there for hours on our first day enjoying the champagne!  Hands-down, even over the quite nice Red Carnation  Chesterfield Mayfair London, this was our favorite ever luxury hotel room in Europe.

Aside from Peter Cooke's ambassadorship, I was also interested in the Shelbourne for it's outstanding history and location.  If you don't know you should read up on it.

I also has a reputation for a great hotel bar, and we were not disappointed.  We prefer a hotel with a bit of energy and activity over the more reserved and hallowed quite properties, and again The Shelbourne hit the mark with the lobby bar. Fun and interesting crowd, with lots of friendly locals and tourists mixing and meeting.  Were I a local in Dublin I would certainly drop in there for a pre-dinner glass of wine, or a nice leisurely lunch and drink on a weekend.

Our only meal service at The Shelbourne was our breakfast both mornings. For years, we heard about the famous Irish Breakfast, and what we had at The Shelbourne was epic and fantastic both days.  My only regret - too much food!  On the second day we tried to order one for the two of us but it still came out as two plates full of food.  My mistake in not explaining properly, but I just hated to waste the food so I did my best.  Even though it was my mistake, we were only charged for the one breakfast.

At every turn in the hotel, I found elegant touches that made the place so comfortable.  Beautiful artwork all over the walls, and if you go up the stairway just through the main lobby, there is a small landing with some plush seating to relax and unwind.

I need to wrap this up so in closing just a few things - I echo and agree with all positive comments of the other 'excellent' reviews I have read here about The Shelbourne and cannot recommend it highly enough.  I am sorry that I am not able to provide more specific names of all the wonderful staff at The Shelbourne but suffice it to say they are many and they deserve their well earned recognition.  

While the bones of The Shelburne are old and strong and elegant, it's Peter Cooke and all of the fantastic staff that create the heart and soul that welcomes and comforts their guests.

It was hard to say goodbye, but already we are planning our next visit to The Shelbourne",5,2015,10,30
207,A Dublin Institution,"Spent a weekend on a BB rate at the end of October. Pulling up outside the Shelbourne on a Friday afternoon a doorman quickly relieved me of my car. Upon entering the lobby I momentarily paused looking for the reception desk to be immediately asked by a porter if there was anything he could do to help me. Having been guided to reception a glass of homemade lemonade and some banana bread were offered while signatures were provided and cards were swiped. Efficient and friendly would be the way to sum up the check in experience. Our room was on the Third floor and immediate impressions were good. A really decent size with a huge bed and very tasteful furnishing the room looked and felt five star. However on closer inspection the unholy Trinity of hotel room design presented some issues. Lighting - although not succumbing to the current fashion for deep gloom there wasn't an easy way to have one bedside lamp on (for reading) with the other bedside lamp off. Water controls - the bath/shower tap was the most impractical I have ever come across being very smooth chrome but also very stiff requiring to be gripped by a damp towel before sufficient purchase could be gained to make it shift. TV controls - in all fairness the controls for the TV were quite straightforward but the ""system"" kept freezing on us - we didn't bother contacting reception re this as we were not particularly interested in TV but I did mention it at checkout and was told that they had recently introduced a new system and there were some issues. Also its a long time since I've encountered a charge for in room wifi - not really acceptable in this day and age.
The public areas of the hotel are very elegant and tasteful but the place never feels at all stuffy. This I would put down mainly to staff attitude. Every single member of staff we encountered throughout the weekend including the chambermaids were exceptionally polite and friendly and all had an effortless knack of putting your at your ease. Breakfast was busy and at times the buffet area was a little crowded but not to the point of it being uncomfortable. The buffet was good though not exceptional (similar to a good four star Hilton offering) but where things went up a notch were the made to order items - eggs benedict etc. These were beautifully prepared and presented. We ate in the Saddle Room on the Friday night and I wont go into any detail here as I have submitted a separate review of the meal. What I will say is that if you are someone who on principle avoids hotel dining rooms make an exception for the Saddle Room - it provides a fine dining destination in its own right.
On the Saturday afternoon we had a few bloody Mary's in No.27 Bar listening to some very nice live jazz. Service and ambience were lovely, drinks were expensive but taking account of the venue, music and numbers of staff on duty to make sure service was excellent they were probably reasonable value. I do have a slight quibble however. Two different members of staff prepared different rounds of drinks and they were not consistent in their preparation of the bloody marys. One used regular Absolut, house bloody mary mix and a celery stick for muddling. They other used absolut citron and also added a cucumber garnish. I know that this might sound very picky especially given that both versions were very nice but they were quite different. As I have said these were expensive drinks and the room is definitely a ""special occasion"" type of bar. In these situations people will return because they have had a wonderful experience which they want to recreate and having a particular cocktail can be a part of that so I think sticking to a house style or offering the customer choice in terms of how a drink is prepared is important.
So in conclusion we had a lovely time and would have no hesitation in returning to the Shelbourne - staff in particular were outstanding. Given that we enjoyed our stay so much some of my comments may seem rather fussy but this is a five star property and more importantly the Shelbourne is something of a Dublin or even Irish institution. We want to be proud of it. We want visitors to the country who stay there to be blown away and so the bar is that bit higher for this reviewer. Even excellence can be improved upon.",4,2015,10,30
207,A perfect return ,I booked here as a surprise for my husband and from the moment that we stepped back through the doors everyone and everything was perfect.  On our first night the guest relations team had left a surprise bottle of bubbly and treats as a birthday surprise.  We were totally blown away by their generosity and the little touches that mean a lot to us. Both times that we dined in the hotel the food was superb and nothing is too much trouble.  The cocktails we can highly recommend too! We are sad to be leaving but planning the next visit as we speak.  So thank you once again for the perfect stay X ,5,2015,10,30
207,LOVELY PLACE TO STAY,"This hotel is a great base to stay.  It's just up the street from Grafton Street which is where there is great shopping.  There are lovely bars and restaurants all over the place and the museum and art gallery is just around the corner.  It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.  I called the Hotel the day before arrival and told them that I would be there at 12 so they got my room ready for when I arrived.  When you call them, tell them the time of your arrival and they will request an early checkin.  The staff are very friendly but you would expect that for a 5 star hotel",5,2015,10,30
207,Half term break,"An excellent hotel, we received a lovely welcome, the room was beautiful and lovely and clean, the hotel offered excellent facilities with a great pool area and two saunas as well as a gym. The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful.

Location was also great, many of Dublin's main attractions in walking distance.",5,2015,10,28
207,Had more issues/problems than I was expecting (but overall a great place!),"From the start with the check in process, our room was not ready at 3:00 as all rooms should be ready by. No excuses were given and no sympathies were provided.  In the room, the outlet for the American plug did not work and after waiting for an hour for the engineer to come up, he did nothing and offered no apology or even an idea if it could be fixed.  We were told to look down the street for an American adapter which we could not find.  Luckily the hotel had two adapters after we asked them to check again.

After a long day enjoying Dublin we get back to the hotel at 3:40 and find that the room was not clean even though we put a sign on the door asking for it to be cleaned.  We asked for immediate service for the room and had to wait a while for that too while all we wanted to do is rest and enjoy the room.  Again no apologies. 

On top of that, the wifi did go out for a period of time.

After discussing several of these issues first hand there, we were offered a pair of drinks at the No 27 club.

The other nice thing the hotel did for us was provide us breakfast early in the day as our flight left early and we were not able to partake in the regular morning breakfast.

The hotel can be very busy with weddings on the weekend and I felt that maybe the hotel was overwhelmed or perhaps at least catering more to the wedding guests than their traditional guests.",3,2015,10,28
207,The best place to stay,"This is my favourite hot to stay in in Dublin. It is is the best location, near to the shops, loads of great pubs and restaurants and just opposite Stephens Green. The people who work there are all lovely and welcoming, the only down side is the cost, as on busy weekends it can be silly money, but with their facilities and location and the fact that people are prepared to pay those prices, who can blame them? If I could, I'd live there!",5,2015,10,28
207,Nice but Pricey,The hotel is top notch. The staff caters to your every need. An assortment of dining areas in hotel.The concierge are very  helpful when trying to locate places of interest in Dublin.You're going to pay top dollar here but it's well worth it when you look at the alternatives. Very clean rooms and polite staff.,5,2015,10,28
207,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location","The hotel is amazing, the rooms were beautiful, clean and comfortable!! The restaurants were fabulous! Staff were very friendly & very accommodating for our group of 250 people. The location is close to everything. You can walk everywhere. Right across the street from the beautiful St Stephen's Green park. Great stay would love to go again :)",5,2015,10,27
207,Luxury comfort old world charm The Shelbourne has it all,"What a super warm special place to stay. We had such a fabulous stay in the Shelbourne from check in to checking out it was superb. Warm inviting top quality from the moment we stopped our car outside till we left we had a super special time. The room was comfortable warm and the pillows!!!! best ever. Bathroom and toiletries were like a spa. Dinner super, breakfast super, just special. We were so lucky and so happy to spend such a lovely time in this fabulous hotel.",5,2015,10,26
207,Wonderful Stay,I have never stayed in a hotel where the staff were so nice and truly seemed to love their jobs. Was wonderful staying in such a historically famous spot. The room was lovely. The breakfasts were delicious. The only downfall was the roadworks all throughout the area of Dublin 2. A really wonderful hotel.,4,2015,10,23
207,Old world charm v2.0,"Clearly a lot of history at this place and loads of character so worth a stay when in Dublin just for that.  The rooms are modern, wi fi free and included and breakfast included.  I got a great rate so look out for specials.  Breakfast is worth it.  Location is awesome, across from the park and close to the main strip and a walk or taxi to some of the offices over the river.  The staff were great and the gym better than your average hotel - I noticed a pool (indoor) too but did not try.  There probably is room for a few further updates but recognising the age and pedigree of this place it is all forgivable and adds to the charm.",4,2015,10,23
207,disappointing,"Our wonderful children treated us to a voucher for a night in the Shelbourne I was so looking forward to it as it was many years since I stayed before... The check-in  was ok I know we only had a small case but it would have been nice to have been offered a hand with it. Our delux king room was fine nothing outstanding but it was a connecting room I did not like that but decided to live with it that was a mistake.when the guests next door returned late the t.v. on and the I was privy to the american gentleman's phone conversation at 4.30am .WE did not sleep , I believe you are entitled to privacy within your own room we did not get this we had to whisper as we were aware if we could hear them they could hear us. I felt the receptionist brushed off my complaint The breakfast was not great eggs completely dried out in the bain-marie even though we were down early for breakfast ..not 5 star standard .Most of the staff were lovely while some were a little robotic... service with a smile should come across as natural. I love the history of the place and the location is wonderful pity about the façade but that can't be helped due to on going work. I  am so disappointed with my stay after looking forward to it for so long .

207,Simply wonderful,"This hotel along with trump international Doonbeg really took my breath away! We have visited many hotels around Ireland but these 2 simply give the wow factor! They really go out of their way to strive for their guests. Even down to the cleaning staff in this hotel will go out of their way to salute you and ensure you have everything you need. A fabulously decked out hotel and very well managed! I thought it was a little expensive but I think that's the capital in general, we didn't mind paying it as the service was brilliant. I believe this hotel is an all rounder!",5,2015,10,21
207,Classic old world charm and grace...a fine hotel.,"We checked in after a long flight from Australia and despite the hour we were warmly greeted and our rooms looked good. We even managed a quick pint of Guinness before bed. In the morning we explored the breakfast room and were very impressed with the array and quality of food on offer. The hotel is a busy place; seemingly hosting as many locals as overseas visitors. The Shelbourne has a well-run rhythm to it and the staff work hard to greet people and offer advice. The rooms were great and we were delighted with the Shelbourne as the first stop on a quick 16 day visit to the UK, the Rugby World Cup and France. We gathered a lot in the downstairs bar and really enjoyed the place....a fabulous bar for sure with oysters and Guinness aplenty! A local Italian restaurant, 200m away, was stunning; and a dinner at Marco P White's around the corner was also very good.
 The hotel is undergoing huge refurbishments outside currently and so some of the magic is lost; but it has to happen sometime I guess. The park across the road is quite stunning and adds to the beauty of the experience. Very happy to stay again at the Shelbourne.",5,2015,10,20
207,My favorite hotel in Dublin,I stay here a few times every year when in Dublin. Great staff and always a pleasant check in experience. Great rooms. Great bars. Great breakfast. Staying here on a Rugby weekend promises a great atmosphere.,5,2015,10,20
207,Stay at Shelbourne or stay home!,This is the best hotel for many reasons. Location is perfect. I have stayed here alone and had a queen room which is on the small side but works for one. King rooms are very roomy. I have not had one facing St. Stephens but all have been very quiet. No street noise. Love all the bars for different reasons. No.27 is always lively and they have a great weekend brunch. They have a jazz combo that play good music. The Lord Mayors Lounge has a singer for easy listening. It is better for conversation. After about 9:00 it is only for people staying in the hotel. The concierge's are so helpful. Denis O'Brien is the head concierge and if he makes a dinner reservation for you rest assured you will be treated special. He is an institution in Dublin and loved by everyone who knows him. Renovations will soon be finished. Also the flowers that are changed every week are beautiful. ,5,2015,10,18
207,Beautiful Hotel,"This is a very busy, hustling hotel in a great location of Dublin. Easy to walk to local attractions and restaurants. The service is impeccable. The rooms and the entire hotel is clean and comfortable. We ate in the bar the first night we were there and the food and service were wonderful. Our room and bathroom was beautiful. The bed was so comfortable! The on downside was that the wifi was horrible! It dropped all the time and was very frustrating. That being said, it's a great choice for your stay in Dublin!",5,2015,10,16
207,Shellbourne Experience,This hotel was top notch.  From the slippers and robes at bedtime with the chocolate and turn down to the food.  Everything was of the best quality and thoroughly enjoyable.  We stayed there two nights at either end of a trip and the experience was the same each time.  Nothing was too  much trouble.  The rooms are well appointed and service was great.,5,2015,10,15
207,Not your typical Marriott--this is a five star hotel in perfect location with excellent food and great history.,"Stayed here twice during recent trip to Ireland (at beginning and again at end of trip). Service is great, location is perfect, the rooms are very nice and the food is excellent. The only bummer was the facade was being redone so there were no rooms overlooking the park (the front of the hotel was covered with a tarp). It is expensive by Dublin standards and when I heard it was a Marriott I was skeptical but this is a really great property. I would recommend without any reservation. ",5,2015,10,15
207,Simply stunning,We stayed here in a suite with my three brothers and uncle and had the mot amazing time. The hotel and staff were fist class and the food was second to none. Room service was also superb and nothing was too much trouble. Perfect in every way and so much charm and character.,5,2015,10,15
207,Amazing hotel in the City centre,"Lovely place - as in the name, a reneassance hotel. Beautifully arranged and run by very professional and attentive employees from the Management down to the cleaners. I really enjoyed the stay in the old but nicely maintained building. Rooms are well furnished, bathroom lavishely finished and spacious with all amenities one could think of. Breakfast was awesome and gym and pool also very nice. The only drawback was the price - personally find 750 Euro for a night a little steep but that's as usual a matter of supply and demand.
I'll come back !",5,2015,10,15
207,"Never fails to impress, simply superb","We visited the Shelbourne in September 30th for our wedding anniversary. As a regular visitor to the Shelbourne, everything was of the high standards one would expect, from car valet, to check-in etc.
On check-in the friendly receptionist asked if we would like to be upgraded for our nights stay to the Presidential Suite, which we were delighted to accept without realising this was in fact the stunning Princess Grace Suite. 
And what an upgrade! This suite is truly beautiful, from the understated elegance of the decor and furnishings, to the luxury of the two bedrooms, and two bathrooms. The suite has stunning views across St Stephens Green, a large lounge with Marble Fireplace, and Large Dining Room. 
Everything in the room was simply stunning, and an absolute delight to have the opportunity to stay in.
This upgrade has cemented the Shelbourne as our only choice of Hotel when we visit Dublin in the future.",5,2015,10,14
207,Not what I'd expect from 5 star hotel,"Front of house staff and porters very friendly. The hotel itself is in a great location. Spent a weekend there in august, definitely not for families. Asked where I could rinse my baby's bottle and waitress informed me ""in the bathroom"", w
hen I requested an alternative option waitress grabbed bottle from table and returned it without speaking a word. When my niece requested a pan cake at breakfast, chef informed her they would bring it to her, and enquired if she really wanted it as it was lengthy to make, 20 mins later and still no pancake. All in all considering the cost of our stay, very dis appointing and this hotel is definitely not for families.",2,2015,10,14
207,Irish High Tea,"Going to a high tea at the Shelbourne, Dublin was quiet an amazing experience. It was a decadent 2 hours that started with champaign and finger sandwiches and ended with tea and cakes. This tea is a themed where the cakes are designed after a famous person. Our tea was themed after Princess Grace. Everything was perfection as well as the staff. If you want to experience a real luxury high tea with delicious food, go to the Shelbourne Hotel.",5,2015,10,13
207,Whoa! Great way to start our trip!,"What a great surprise... this historic hotel was terrific! Chock full of history ....  The location was fabulous, close to everything. And literally across from St Stevens Green, around the corner from Grafton Street, walking distance to Temple Bar. The rooms were stylishly decorated, not overly spacious but nicely done. Bathroom was large. Bed comfy. Staff friendly. Breakfast was delicious, with great selections and good service. We stayed at all top notch 5 star accommodations on our self created tour, and this was our only "" typical""hotel as planned. It was a great choice!The bar was really nice and welcoming, and they offered oyster tasting with Guiness, which was a fun way to sample! Just wish they were not renovating the facade outside, but they had a nice fake front on the hotel. The doorman was also very authentic! Not cheap, but you do get what you pay for! Great time.....",5,2015,10,13
207,Fantastic Hotel,"We arrived into Dublin and, as advised by everybody, went to an ATM at the airport to get some Euros using our bank card.  After many unsuccessful attempts, we got into a cab, thinking that we could change some dollars into Euros at the hotel (Shelbourne) upon arrival.  Instead of making that exchange, they just gave us enough Euros to pay for the cab - of course they put it on our bill as expected - instead of making us wait to do the exchange,  That was our first exemplary service experience of our stay.  Later that day, after having continued issues with our ATM card, an employee, when asked where the nearest bank was, offered to escort me to the bank and refused to leave my side until my my issue was resolved.  I cannot remember that level of service anywhere else. And, in addition, the hotel is beautiful, well appointed, in a perfect location and just wonderful in every respect.
.",5,2015,10,13
207,A gem,"Finding the reception desk can take a bit of doing as it is not immediately apparent.

This is such a civilised place to stay and the breakfasts could take you all day (just ignore the irritating maitre-d' who kept wanting to give us a table in some remote corner and so we kept ignoring him and getting our own table).

The dayrooms turn into buzzing bars in the evening but there is still a quiet residents' lounge.  Afternoon tea here is quite an institution.

The rooms overlooking St Stephen's Green are currently covered with a gauze which the hotel's façade is being restored.  The views from these rooms are therefore of the back side of tarpaulins.",5,2015,10,13
207,Stunning Service - even just for tea!,"We visited the Shelbourne on Sunday for a cup of tea and a cake - what we found was an oasis of calm (on the afternoon of the World Cup Rugby where Ireland were beating France!). A great cup of tea was served from the most enormous silver pot into elegant cups with delicious cakes and scones on the side. All delicious but what sets this hotel apart from ""any"" other was the genuine warmth of the staff. It is they that have made us make the decision to stay at the Shelbourne on our next trip to Dublin - without exception of the 5 staff we met all we polite and an enthusiastic energy when discussing their hotel. It feels like an independent hotel - glamorous and comfortable with who it is - stay there! We're going to!",5,2015,10,13
207,This hotel just gets better.,"This is my first time back at The Shelbourne, Dublin in 22 years. In a city where much has changed, this elegant hotel has gotten even better--the splendor, exquisite, old world charm, top notch service that is almost a thing of the past is in full bloom here. The location on Stephen's Green is central and perfect. I would not stay any place else in the city. The room was gorgeous and the bathroom huge. The breakfast was superior to any other in our 3 weeks touring this beautiful country. And the weather made it perfect. The Saddle Room was the perfect spot for a light bite at the end of the day.",5,2015,10,13
207,Fantastic Location and Beautiful Hoel,"We stayed here recently for two nights and it was a really memorable weekend. The hotel is luxurious, the rooms immaculate and beautifully decorated and oh so comfortable. The bathroom facilities were excellent.  Just cannot fault this lovely elegant hotel.  Customer service was also really good from all the staff.",5,2015,10,13
207,The best in Dublin,This is a super hotel in the heart of Dublin.   It has all the amenities and the staff to make it happen.  Great rooms and beds with down pillows.  Well worth the price.  For sure I would stay her again.  Check it out.,5,2015,10,10
207,"Great location, superb service","Perfect location, accommodating staff, immaculate and comfortable room, and food that was both delicious in each restaurant and catered to my allergies. The only reason it is falling short of a 5-star review was my room view and the fact that it is under construction. Otherwise, thank you, great staff for a wonderful 4-day visit! We will definitely be back!",4,2015,10,10
207,Dublin's finest,"What a wonderful place to spend the afternoon, lovely staff, live music in the background and family & friends all around. The food is excellent in great surroundings that take you back in time. Be prepared to wait for a seat but gReat experience and well worth including in you schedule. ",4,2015,10,10
207,Another great stay,"Love the Shelbourne when I come to Dublin ! Rooms are classic and clean . Bars and food superb. Staff go the extra mile. As an extensive traveller it's my favorite hotel in Europe ! The incredible history grabs you because so many whose who's have stayed here. It's delightful in every way. A little old a little new, but most of all it's about YOU when the Shelbourne is your stay while in Dublin. Thanks everyone.",5,2015,10,10
207,Amazing break,"Stayed for a few days as it was our wedding anniversary . 
The hotel is beautiful within walking distance of the shops, eateries, pubs and parks.
But the staff are outstanding they were attentive from we arrived at reception and greeting with a smile and the shelbourne lemonade as we checked in, as we had arrived early they made arrangements for our suitcases to be taken up to our room when it was ready.
Every other member of staff from house keeping to service staff did their job with a smile to make our stay memorable. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2015,10,10
207,A once in a lifetime experience,"I have heard my mother speak so highly of the Shelbourne Hotel for many years about having afternoon tea while the piano player played in the background and the way the staff waited hand and foot on them also when my father and her went to the dinner dances in the hotel ballroom in the 60's her face lights up everytime she talks about it.
It was my mothers 90th birthday yesterday so as a special treat i booked afternoon tea for my mother and i so she could relive those very special memories she has of the Shelbourne Hotel and i could make new one's to tell my children about in time. From the moment you pull up outside the Shelbourne Hotel the whole experience begins with a welcoming smile from the doorman as he opens your car door and welcomes you to the Shelbourne Hotel as if he has known you all his life to the staff who look after in the Lord Mayor's lounge as you sit down to afternoon tea and the manager Adam who took the time out of his busy day to chat to my mother about what the hotel was like in the old days and the fond memories she has of it now i know what my mother experienced for all those years as i experienced it for the frist time yesterday thats  what makes the Shelbourne Hotel so special. Thats the true meaning of hospitality and when you leave you feel like you have made new friends who cant wait to see you again. If i could give it 6 stars i would.
So a big massive thankyou to all at the Shelbourne Hotel for making my mothers 90th birthday so special so much so she felt like royalty :) Sorry the site would not let me upload my pictures of my day at the Shelbourne :(
p.s we can not wait to visit you all again",5,2015,10,09
207,Great stay with a view of the Green,"My wife and I spent three nights at the Shelbourne, and found the experience fantastic and the service exemplary.

The location is second to none, right on St Stephen’s Green in the heart of Georgian Dublin, next to Grafton Street and within a short walk of many historical sites and museums. 

From check-in, we were made to feel like particularly exalted royalty. As it was our honeymoon, the hotel upgraded our room to one of only eight with a view of St Stephen’s Green. The room was decorated in heritage style, with some original features, and was a real treat, with a great big comfortable bed and a huge bathroom. 

Breakfast is a wonderful feast, with freshly-cooked full Irish, a la carte waffles, eggs and pancakes, and continental meats and cheeses all available.  

I would love to stay here again. It is an expensive option, but I think the extra expense is reflected in the standard of service and management, which is exceptionally high.",5,2015,10,08
207,Great place to stay in Dublin,If you come to Dublin this property is fabulous.  You feel the old world charm and traditions that are so much a part of the history of this hotel. Location is also great. Easy walking distance to shopping and Trinity College and Hop on Hop off busses are just across the street. Spa facilites are lovely.  Definitely worthy of the 5 star status. Staff is very helpful and accommodating.,5,2015,10,07
207,Very disappointing,"After a mix up in reservations for our small group, rooms were ""found"" for us. We were shown to a room by a less than friendly porter whose mission seemed to be to lead us as fast as he could to a tiny room. We tipped him and he was gone in a flash. We then found that the bathroom door handle had a shoddy repair and was close to falling off. The view? Air shaft!!! We requested another room. The same insolent porter showed up and escorted us to a second room (and we tipped him again...he scored better than we did!) This room was larger and did have a very nice bathroom with doors that worked. Again we looked over an airshaft and, in addition, there were tarps draped and scaffolding set up outside the windows. Worker's trash left on the scaffolding...We stayed but we weren't impressed with the view or with the incessant hammering and construction noise right outside the next afternoon when we returned to our room to rest. Amenities? Very few! The mini bar was overpriced and tea and coffee sparsely stocked. We think that the hotel ""found "" these unappealing rooms to appease us after the mix up before we checked in. All in all the Shelburne was overpriced and snobbish. Breakfast was a nice show and the porter who brought our bags down when we were leaving was delightful. Every other hotel we stayed in during our trip to Scotland and Ireland far surpassed this one in every way.",2,2015,10,07
207,Wonderful hotel,"This is probably the nicest hotel that I have ever stayed at in Europe.

What amazes me is that the hotel is located in an beautiful old building and yet they manage to have large rooms. Most comparable hotels in London would be half the size - specifically the Grosvenor which is also a Marriott property. 

Besides being sizeable the rooms are well appointed, laid out and the bed is super comfortable. 

The restaurant and bar are also very good add to this a friendly staff and it just makes for a great place to stay.",5,2015,10,07
207,Always a pleasure,"One night stay at The Shelbourne for our wedding anniversary recently. Always feels like a home away from home. Relaxed but service is second to none. Stayed in one of their newly refurbished heritage rooms. Very tasteful, but purely from a personal point of view I prefer the older type decor. 
We dining at the Lord Mayors lounge for their supper menu. Wonderful experience made even more enjoyable by manager Adam treating us to our wine as wedding anniversary present. The Shelbourne always comes up trumps for us whole staying in Dublin 

",5,2015,10,06
207,Fantastic hotel best in dublin,Just back from this hotel after a weekend stay  We booked a premium heritage room witch was fabulous  we loved it Went to the saddle restaurant on Saturday night the staff where very friendly an the meal was outstanding from start to finish it is now are favourite hotel in dublin,5,2015,10,04
207,We absolutely loved The Shelbourne Dublin,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at The Shelbourne during our recent trip to Dublin. The hotel is fabulous! The architecture of the public rooms (and all those chandeliers) was very opulent and elegant, and was an oasis to return to after spending the day in hectic Dublin.

From the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were treated very well, with everyone being friendly and warm. Check in was quick and easy, with us then being escorted up to our gorgeous room. 

The room was elegantly furnished and very comfortable. There was ample closet space, a mini- fridge, coffee making equipment, desk area, and a good size and beautiful bathroom with thick towels and bath amenities. The bed was extremely comfortable with high quality sheets. It was a terrific room.

We loved hanging out and having drinks at the Number 27 Bar and Lounge. It was a very unique setting (once again all those chandeliers!), lively, and atmospheric, especially in the evenings.   

The buffet breakfast in The Saddle Room was fantastic. There were many options of hot and cold items, and everything tasted great. Once again the service was great.
 
The front of the hotel is currently undergoing a restoration until the end of the year, so it was covered in scaffolding, but did not effect our stay at all. 

If you are looking for an elegant, historical, friendly, and comfortable place to stay while in Dublin, look no further than The Shelbourne.",5,2015,10,04
207,Disappointing ,"We stayed at the Shelbourne last night having one night in Dublin after a week in Ireland.

Positives first - the property itself is stunning and reception area very inviting.

I have to say that we were a little dissapointed with our room which we upgraded upon arrival.  The room was rather small and a little tired.  The view looked over the back of the hotel and faced into the windows of the next room.  The bathroom was also dated.

Room service was fairly fast but the food left a lot to be desired.

The main issue was that there appeared to be a house keeping area directly opposite our room and all night we were disturbed by trollies and the relentless emptying of bottles and cans.

Breakfast this morning was also a little odd - we went down at 9am to be greeted by a rather rude French employee and no hot food what so ever.  The hot buffet did eventually appear at around 9.20am.

We have just finished a fantastic week in Ireland and stayed in some fabulous hotels including Hayfield Manor and Marlfield House....we expected the Shelbourne to be a great end to the trip hut have been left feeling rather let down especially when we compare to the other hotels in which we stayed.",3,2015,10,03
207,Stayed before and will stay again,I stayed here a few years back and returning was an easy choice!  Took aircoach from Dublin airport to Kildare exit and it was an easy block or two off drop off spot. Restaurant in hotel is bit pricey but very good food and quiet for conversation.,5,2015,10,02
207,"Short , comfortable stay","Enjoyed our stay, comfortable and clean suite . Very convenient to shopping, and very good restaurants. Great concierge, sent us to his favorite pub, a short walk away. Only problem we had was monetary , discrepancy in charges. ",4,2015,10,01
207,Night in Dublin,The Shelbourne Hotel is an exceptional Experience. The architecture of this hotel is absolutely beautiful. The main bar is a must for drinks and food. This is a Marriott property and definitely worth a visit!,5,2015,10,01
207,An excellent hotel for business,"I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for business.  Everything was great from the nicely refurbished rooms that were a good size, to the very comfy king sized bed - which is so important!  As a business traveller, I appreciated the strong Wifi connection.    The hotel is within walking distance of many other restaurants, and Grafton Street - about 15 minutes away.  One interesting offering of the hotel was a Genealogy Butler who helps guests to search for their Irish Heritage.",5,2015,10,01
207,It's not the cheapest hotel in Dublin but it is probably the best,"I will happily save up to go there every time I am in Dublin.  It is as near to perfection as one might reasonably expect.  St Stephen's Green, opposite the hotel, is well worth a stroll and I really enjoyed the neighbouring Little Dublin Museum.",5,2015,10,01
207,Always a delight,"The Shelbourne Hotel is definitely one of the best hotels in Dublin if not Ireland. I regularly stay here. Time after time, they do not let me down but exceed my every expectation!

From front desk to the bar, the staff are so polite and so warm. Breakfast is outstanding. Plenty of coffee!! What more could you ask for?!
Central hotel. Rooms are spacious and always very clean.

Can't wait to return.",5,2015,10,01
207,Dublin Holiday,"The Shelbourne Dublin is a first class hotel with excellent staff and truly interested folks who value your vacation and experience in Dublin.  The rooms are great and the hotel has terrific everything from food to drinks; but the true feel of a great hotel is the first round of folks who meet and greet you and take care of your base needs.  The Sherborne ""first contact team"" is simply excellent and they do not miss a beat to insure you enjoy Dublin and their hotel...",5,2015,09,30
207,"Fantastic, but ...","The Shelbourne is truly an Irish national treasure; few properties can boast that the national constitution was written on-site.  We recently spent two nights at The Shelbourne, one was perfect in every respect and the other much less so.
  
The perfect stay was on Sunday, September 20.  The staff was warm and welcoming.  The property appears to be in excellent condition, with more restoration in progress.  Reception was efficient and I was delighted to be offered an upgrade.  The room was exactly what we needed after a long day.  Breakfast the next morning was a model of Irish efficiency.  The Irish breakfast was delicious and quick in delivery.  And the refill on coffee was offered and accepted.

The second stay was again also on a Sunday, September 27.  As I signed in, I again put down my Lifetime Platium Elite card and ask if an upgrade might be available.  The response was that our king room would be “quite nice.”  Reception was not up to Marriott standards.
 
We had stored two bags from our previous visit, so I presented the claim check to the individual who checked us in and was assured that the bags would be up shortly.  The bag that we arrived with did come up quickly, but not the two from the storage area.  So the bellman was not happy to make a second trip.  He came back with the remaining bags in ten minutes.

Breakfast the next day was, for a top-rated hotel, a disaster.  We arrived at 7AM, thirty minutes after the restaurant opened.  As we were seated, we noticed another couple nearby.  They said that they had been waiting for ten minutes to get someone to provide tea and take an order.  After another 3-4 minutes, the gentleman went and complained to the person at the front of the restaurant.  

It was also about ten minutes for someone to take our order for tea and coffee.  We were on a schedule and needed to get the airport, so time was a consideration.  I had some thoughts about ordering a “signature breakfast,” but those aspirations were fleeting.  The good news is that the buffet was in good shape.  My coffee arrived as we were finishing our buffett breakfast.  I got my second cup an hour later at the airport.

So one perfect night and one poor stay = average rating

207,Excellent Hotel with Lots of Atmosphere,"We had a room overlooking St. Stephen's Green, and it was very nice.  The hotel is pricey but worth it.

There are several dining option, and we ate tasty food in the lounge every night.",5,2015,09,29

207,First Class Hotel in an Excellent Location,"Our flight arrived early in the morning so our room was not ready when we arrived but the staff was very helpful in holding our luggage and directing us to various sites for a few hours. We used our Hop On/Hop Off Pass to acclimate ourselves to the area and found it was a great place to rest after a very long, tiring flight. Our room was ready at 2:30pm and because we were celebrating our 25th Anniversary, they had upgraded us to the JFK Suite. What a beautiful room! The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was huge and well-appointed. I did find it unusual for the hair dryer to be in a drawer in the bath room but the only outlet for it was in the sitting area at a desk with poor lighting. We also found it hard to regulate/cool the suite. It was always a bit stuffy. Comfy robes and slippers were also available for lounging around the room. The hotel is located right across from St Stephens Green and close to many sites and good restaurants and shops. We highly recommend The Shelbourne and would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,09,28
207,Wedding par excellence ,"Myself and my wife got married here on 21 August 2015 and felt compelled to write this review. There follows a list of superlatives that simply do not do justice to the level of customer service we received.
Prior to the wedding we met with Cathy O'Shea (the wedding executive) on several occasions. She was most accommodating and professional. She planned our day with precision and two weeks before the wedding sent us a detailed email which gave us the running order of our day down to the minutiae. This was carried out to the letter on the day. 
From our arrival at the hotel to the tunes of the bagpiper and a round of applause from the staff right throughout the day we cannot find fault.
The afternoon prosecco reception came with delicious food. The service was subtle but attentive.
The meal was sublime from starter to dessert. Again the service was attentive and prompt. This was exemplified when Gavin, a member of staff noticed one of the guests had dexterity problems. They asked discreetly if any help was required and cut the meat for the guest.
We had a massive problem with our chosen florist with the flowers for the ballroom being completely unsuitable. However, the hotel stepped into the breach and rescued the situation. Special mention to the in house florist who, at very short notice, created the most stunning displays for us. Upon checkout we were astounded when we saw we were billed only for the cost price of the flowers.
This grand, imposing hotel made an art of the little details which made the most special day of our lives all the more spectacular.
It exceeded all of our expectations.
Robert and Edel Dillon.

207,Dublin at it finest.,"Last night in Dublin.  Right in the heart of downtown Dublin.  Phenomenal amenities.  I learned after we checked out that they have a ""Heraldry Butler"" that could have helped me with my ancestry search. Service was impeccable from the doorman to the concierge and front desk staff.  You felt pampered from the time your drove up through Checkout.   ",5,2015,09,28
207,Change the music!,"Loved almost every minute! Service second to none, buzzing atmosphere BUT techno music in the Horseshoe Bar was completely incongruous - don't know what they are thinking but it made us want to leave and go elsewhere for a drink. Otherwise no complaints. Fab hotel, fab staff",4,2015,09,28
207,Wouldn't recommend staying until fully renovated.,"Regardless of my comments below I had a very enjoyable stay at the Shelbourne and I will stay again in the future, but for the moment the hotel rooms don't offer good value for money and I was left disappointed. 

First we checked into one of the newly renovated Queen Rooms. The decor is light and luxurious, but these rooms are described as 'small' on the website and they aren't lying. The bathroom is the size of a small walk in wardrobe and there is no bath. I feel for the price and standard of this hotel every room should have a bath. The room also looked onto a wall, but then I suppose this is a city centre hotel. 

So we returned to reception and upgraded to a Deluxe Room. The size of this room was much more appropriate, but as it was yet to be updated the furniture, wallpaper and decor was dated. The bed and facilities however were very good. 

Like I say I would like to stay at The Shelbourne again in the future, but for now some of her close neighbours would be the preferred choice as they are still very well located but offer much better value for money.",3,2015,09,27
207,Almost perfect ,"This is a high dollar posh hotel in a fantastic location, walkable to most highlights in Dublin, and close to public transport. The common areas and guest rooms are gorgeous, luxurious and comfortable. The service is impeccable. Didn't get 5 stars from me for 2 reasons:
1. The only food I had there was late night room service (a burger and chips) and it was mediocre at best
2. The wifi in the guest room was terrible. Of the 2 nights/3 days I was there, it barely worked at all one night and the rest of the time it would constantly cut out (as often as every 5 minutes or so) and end my session so I had to keep starting over. ",4,2015,09,27
207,Nicely appointed and located,"An older hotel, but recently -- and tastefully -- refurbished.  Room was very comfortable; bed very comfortable.  Lots of nice touches.  All staff very helpful.  Extensive breakfast buffet. Very centrally located.   If we return, we will certainly stay here",5,2015,09,26
207,excellent hotel-one of the best in ireland,"visited and stayed in this centrally located 5 star facility in dublin.valet parking on arrival,easy check in,very comfortable room,lovely bf in the morning,friendly enough staff and easy exit.recommended and will stay again if an opportunity arises",5,2015,09,26
207,Wonderful people,We arrived early morning. We knew our room would not be ready. All the employees made us feel very welcomed and were extremely helpful. Stored our baggage so we could go exploring. Gave us tips where to eat and where to visit. Very cheerful and helpful at anytime of the day.,5,2015,09,25
207,very good place to stay,"A very well run place, with very good service, very good rooms, a great location and a sense of history. My room was very well appointed & decorated but faced another building, lacking a nice view and being quite dark. The breakfast was very good - and the staff was extremely professional and courteous.",4,2015,09,24
207,Great location!,"Just returned home after a wonderful stay at the Shelbourne.  Our room was spacious and the bed extremely comfortable...which of course is important after a long day. What also stands out is its great walking location to shopping, Trinity College, St Stephens Green and terrific pubs and restaurants.  You can't go wrong.",5,2015,09,23
207,Excellent in every way,"My husband and I stayed at the Shelbourne for four nights upon arrival in Ireland.  This hotel is perfectly situated with excellent restaurants, and lots of shopping within a six block radius.  The staff are all very helpful, and we got several recommendations from the bellmen and the concierge for places to go and have dinner. St. Stephen's Green is just across the street.  The park is a lovely respite from the city, with beautiful flowers, greenery, ponds and bridges.  
   We had a lovely room with  king bed, and a large bathroom.  Everything was spotless, and very comfortable.  The one thing that is odd to me is the hair dryer is there in the drawer in the bathroom, but there's no place to plug it in, except in the bedroom!  There is a vanity table and mirror, but the lighting is not the best, and if I sat in the chair, I was too short to actually be able to see in the mirror!  
   We didn't eat dinner at the hotel, but we did have drinks in the HorseShoe Bar, and a breakfast snack the day we arrived in the  27 Bar and Lounge.  Both are lovely, and service is excellent.  Both of these bars are very busy in the evenings.  
   This is a luxurious hotel,and we were a bit nervous about feeling out of place as we don't often spring for such an expensive hotel.  But, dress ranged from everything from jeans and golf shirts to suits and elegant dresses.  The staff were cordial and welcoming of all the guests, and we never felt out of place.  This is a great choice for a perfect introduction to perfect Irish hospitality.",5,2015,09,22
207,Breakfast at the Shelbourne,"My friend and I had breakfast here as a birthday treat. Hashbrowns were cold, toast was cold and served without preserves and the coffee was just warm. The waitress didn't seem to understand that the breakfast we ordered should have been served hot. Not a nice experience for a special occasion or any occasion. We left very disappointed in the quality.",2,2015,09,22
207,Perfect Introduction to Dublin,"We stayed for 2 nights upon arrival in Dublin for the first time, so the Shelbourne was our introduction to the wonderful people of Ireland.  The hotel is immaculate and our room very comfortable.  The location in St. Stephen's Green is perfect, with tons of restaurants, shops and bars within easy walking distance. The entertaining Hop-on Hop-off City bus tour has a stop practically across the street. The helpful staff was amazing, including assistance with programming our GPS by the doormen as we left for a round of golf outside the city, and upon return, expressing an interest in how we enjoyed the course! Would definitely stay here on a return trip to Dublin.",5,2015,09,21
207,"A great ""big"" hotel experience","The Shelbourne is a very fine hotel with lots of marble and artwork.  To me, it has a ""grand hotel"" feel with its towering marble-lined entrance area with wide staircase leading upwards.  My room was fair sized and luxuriously appointed. The king bed was very comfortable.  The spacious marble-lined bathroom was fully equipped with separate shower. The deep cast iron tub with old fashioned chrome fixtures and towel warming rack was a pleasure.

The only think that might complain about was the lack of some small courtesy bathroom supplies that I have seen in the ""other"" nearby 5-star hotel, such as cotton balls and swabs, emergency sewing kit, and the lack of writing pens.  A simple request to housekeeping resolved these issues. 

Service and housekeeping was very efficient, helpful, polite, and abundantly available.  

Despite the current facade construction, my room, which was facing the back courtyard, was very quiet during the weekend and early week.  

I have never tasted a better Cafe Americano (not even in America) then in the oyster bar.  An order of snacks could take 10-15 minutes to arrive.

The spa was excellent.  It is higher priced like any other 5-star hotel, but it includes a lot of pampering, refreshments before and after, access to the scenic relaxation room with a view of the bustling street and St. Stephens Green.

My nightly cost for the weekend was double that of the weekdays.  In fact, the weekend reservation was very difficult to secure, even 2 months in advance. Perhaps due to social events, weekend getaways, and weddings.

I would not hesitate to stay at the Shelbourne again.",5,2015,09,21
207,Professional as always!,"I spend about 125 nights a year with Marriott. Platinum/Delta Diamond etc.
Always enjoy the Shelbourne. The staff are very accommodating and help getting you into rooms as early as possible. Ian at the front desk was top notch and although room wasn't ready because of early arrival actually helped me find a 12:30 Mass down the street. Had a bite to eat for lunch at hotel( lovely meal). Then Ian called that room was ready and gave me a great room. 
Truly always professional at The Shelborne. Some of the other reviews always state its long check process. I have personally found the opposite. People have to understand that all flights get in from US early morning and no hotel can have that many rooms turned over that fast.
I travel extensively Globally for my job and always enjoy coming back to
Shelbourne!
Thanks Shelbourne  Staff!",5,2015,09,20
207,A ONCE OFF for Afternoon tea in the Shelbourne,"We availed of an afternoon tea here on a Sunday. While the ambience and service was top notch the food would not have me rushing back. The sandwiches were very good but as I didn't like the scones or desserts I would have eaten more than the tiny portions given. I don't know if I should have been expecting our Irish -famed, fluffy, warm scones straight from the oven but these were so remote from this description and could never replace them. They were left on the plate. I looked forward to the desserts which were so blown up on the website but again neither my husband nor myself liked them. Some if not most seemed to have a  synthetic taste and indeed the mousse base had the disc which is usually part of these that are artificial. So foodwise afternoon tea wasn't an enjoyable experience at The Shelbourne. I regret this as it had everything else to make the experience a sense of occasion",3,2015,09,20
207,Excellent Afternoon Tea,"We were a party of twelve ladies at a pre-wedding event. The presentation of food was very good - we would have preferred more savouries and less sweet cakes (these were offered as take aways in pretty boxes). We nearly all had different beverages and all orders were dealt with efficiently by the friendly staff. The background piano music was appropriate in such comfortable surroundings.
Very enjoyable- thank you!",5,2015,09,19
207,"Classic luxery, great location but, renovations hampered trip.","I stayed in the Shelbourne for five nights in the glorious Figgis suite. The room was decorated perfectly. A box of Irish butlers chocolates greeted us on our stay and there was all things that were needed in the room. 

Shelbourne is what I would consider one of the best hotels in Dublin yet, several factors (that I would carefully consider when booking) came to light. 

1) At present there are renovations going on. We were in a suite at the front and part of that price for that suite is the views over Stephan's Green. We were deprived of those completely and rudely awoken at 9am every day. There was no apology or compensation. I felt that it would have been appropriate for breakfast to be free or something like a complimentary drink each night. Because of this I feel that at present until renovations are over I would possibly book another hotel central but, without the noise and hassle (try the westin or westbury). 

2) I am a young traveler, I don't feel the need to dress up to stay in a place I am paying for. Yet, the lobby staff and breakfast staff seemed really snooty to me. The cleaning ladies in the morning were lovely polish women that I really liked and we had wonderful chats. I would have preferred them in the lobby! I don't care really how people look at me or treat me but, if I want to wear a raincoat and dr.martins while going in and out don't look at me funny. I don't need people to know what is in my bank account to get the same service as other people. 

3) This is suppose to be one of the best hotels in Ireland. It has clothes of the legendary Grace Kelly on view. The food is sourced as much as possible from Ireland. It has great history in the country yet, the waiting, bar staff and lobby staff tended to be eastern European or another country that wasn't Ireland. This was a little disconcerting again. The concierges were Irish but, I felt a little strange to be in an Irish hotel with Irish history being served with people for whom English was their second language. This did slightly impede service as well. 

4) The breakfast service was quite poor in comparison to other hotels I have stayed in. It was awkward. The breakfast was your a typical European breakfast menu. But, the layout was awkward to maneuver and had many guests stumbling over one another. 

On the other hand this hotel is simply the most elegant and beautiful building I have stayed in. The food and drink there is utterly amazing. The price is very well suited to the service that you are getting. The room service is so indulgent, fast and delicious. It was a great base to walk to all the wonderful things in the city. It also was extremely clean. Everything worked perfectly (sorry the lift was a little slow but, it added to the romance of the place). People staying there were really happy to. You could see that. 

All in all I would recommend it BUT not till the renovations are over if that room is effected by them.",4,2015,09,19
207,Wonderful Hotel,"It is centrally located.  Clean and spacious.  Staff are wonderful and friendly.  Boutique hotel.  The concierge is friendly and acknowledgeable.  Highly recommended.  Pubs are close by, all within walking distance to the hotel.",5,2015,09,18
207,Great Location,"Beautiful, historic hotel in walking distance to great shopping and nightlife.  Jazz brunch was great!   When we were there they were restoring the façade, and I am sure it will be even nicer.  Great service as well.",5,2015,09,16
207,"Upsell everything, as if on commission","Good location, heritage property, somewhat cramped due to renovation (understandable as it is going through renovation).  I am Marriott Platinum which entitles me to free upgrades, and I was not offered any complimentary upgrade beyond what I had booked.  Instead, there were couple of options presented with a price, and when I asked the person to check with Manager on the complimentary upgrade, he returned with a lower price as the best he could do.  Later that evening I called to order breakfast for next morning as we were to leave early, and I was told that I will have to pay for the kids as the complimentary breakfast (Platinum benefit) was for for me and 1 guest.  Again, I asked to check with manager as I had not had this experience at other places, and he returned on the phone in few minutes with ... surprise!! ... a reduced rate for breakfast., and manager was tied up elsewhere to come to the phone.  I told him sternly that I am not impressed and would like a call back from a manager next evening as I was going to be out for most of the day.  Within a minute I got a phone call back from the manager and she told me that she would not have any issues accommodating the kids as they were very young (which is what my experience has been elsewhere).  
Even though it was a good stay overall, these two experiences in general left a bad taste in the mouth, and this is not typical of what I expect from a premium Marriott property.",3,2015,09,16
207,Central Location/some staff not very helpful,"Beautiful location -adjacent to Stevens Green, close to Grafton Street, and Temple Bar area. Our room was HOT!! The first night we tolerated it, but complained the next day. The engineer said they were having trouble with the air on that side of the building.We were moved to another room after waiting for almost 3 hours! (missed a dinner reservation with friends). After all of this--a very hot night and a long move--only 40 euro was removed from our bill.",4,2015,09,16
207,Great Service & Great Location,"Beautiful old hotel located in the heart of the city. Service was outstanding.
Located across the street from St Stephens Green (Park) and a block and a half from Trinity College. The main pedestrian shopping street (Grafton) in town was less then 2 blocks away and Temple Bar was about a 10 min walk.",5,2015,09,16
207,An amazing experience!,"What an amazing experience last night... 
I was enjoying a tea in one of the bars downstairs when suddenly music started playing, for a moment I thought it was a CD player but no, it was a singer called Sean Boland singing live in the background...
undescribable expereince... I enjoyed it so much that at the end I asked him if there were beds made of his voice.. :) Really nice!",5,2015,09,16
207,"Historic, but showing it's age","The Shelbourne is a beautiful hotel, at least that part of it I was able to see.  Unfortunately the entire facade was covered by canvas during my three night stay, as there appears to be restoration work underway on the exterior.  The rooms were well appointed if somewhat small and with uneven flooring, while the bathrooms were spacious.  The shower is unfortunately in the half glass style, which in every incarnation I've encountered does nothing but increase the likelihood of water splattering to the floor and its users being unnecessarily cold.

Our experience with the hotel's service was somewhat mixed.  When we arrived we were checked into a room that clearly hadn't been cleaned.  The front desk quickly moved us to one that had, but our issues with house keeping continued the next day when our bed was made with clothes that been rested on it still in it.  The front desk offered us two free breakfasts as compensation, which was reasonable considering their expense.

Located a short walk from shopping on Grafton St and many major sites the Shelbourne's location is difficult to beat, but if you're looking for a consistent level of service with slightly more spacious accommodations, more reasonably priced hotels might be a better choice.",3,2015,09,15
207,"Perfect Location, Perfect Room, Perfect Staff","I cannot say enough about the Sherbourne Hotel, Dublin, Ireland.  The rooms are well appointed, the location is perfect for walking the city or jumping on the Hop On, Hop Off tours, and the staff was magnificent.  The restaurants were very good, and the hotel has a genealogist on staff to assist with searches for ancestors.  In fact, our session with her provided us with corrections to earlier attempts and put us on the correct path for discovering heritage.

Stay here!  It is perfect for Dublin touring.",5,2015,09,15
207,Mmmmm?,"We had very high expectations of our 2nd visit to Shelbourne hotel which unfortunately was our downfall!! However we were very disappointed that these expectations weren't met following the TV programme and general feed back from other guests although we had a lovely weekend we came away feeling that unless you're staying in a suite there really was nothing spectacular about it! We had to change our room because we were allocated one overlooking the delivery yard filled with beer kegs and the noise of air conditioning units was dreadful, this room was adapted for a disabled person which meant no bath and actually the bathroom was in a very depressing state!!! Although we were moved quickly the next room was nothing to write home about. I think it took about 6/7 mins to find it from reception!! We had just spent the previous week travelling from Derry to Cork and up the Dublin staying in four 5 star hotels saving what we hoped the best for last, but this was not to be!! Breakfast was very nice but like someone else said very cramped,bed very comfortable. The Irish rugby team were staying in the hotel that weekend so that added a little bit of glamour but other than that a mediocre experience!",4,2015,09,14
207,THE BEST!!,This is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in. The service was tops. We had an issue with the Internet but a customer service manager was on top of it.  The restaurants and bar are  excellent.  There is plenty of staff to help you and they are very courteous.,5,2015,09,14
207,Afternoon tea,"What a lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon, good friends, champagne, so many varieties of tea and coffee. The staff are friendly and the excellence of their training shines through. The theme for the afternoon tea is based on Grace Kelly. The sandwiches are not the run of the mill. All served on different bread they included smoked salmon, goats cheese, ham mouse and egg. The scones were delicious and the deserts were to die for. Perfect as a special treat or a girlie get together.",5,2015,09,13
207,Everything we expected,"The Shelourne is everything you would expect of a hotel which is iconic for a stay in Dublin. All comforts provided, with rooms modernised without losing their characteristic charm.
Staff most attentive, and every request promptly attended to.
Excellent location",5,2015,09,13
207,Grand old dame,"It's long been an ambition to stay here and have to say it lived up to expectations. Lovely refurbished room, no faults! Pleasant welcome in lobby and directed to check in, very attentive and booking made for The Saddle Room for a Saturday evening. All very pleasant.",5,2015,09,12
207,Historic and luxurious,"A lot of complaints of slow service here. Yes it was slow to check in / out, get drinks, be brought to our table etc. but I quickly figured out that everything moves at a different pace in The Shelbourne!! 

It's such a beautiful building and has been decorated and maintained to perfection. Our room wasn't huge, but was plush and quiet. Had a good night's sleep.

Breakfast was good quality with a nice selection but the service lacked some of the charm and friendliness of our dinner service the night before. Far too clinical and rushed. Tables in the middle of the restaurant are very close together - not my personal preference to hear other couple's conversations or for them to hear ours. 

Relaxing in The Lord Mayors Lounge after breakfast was by far the best thing in our stay. Watching the world go by St Stephens Green with a cuppa, and reading the papers in such surroundings was truly first class. Highly recommended.",5,2015,09,11
207,Wonderful hotel - can't wait to go back!,"Having lived in Ireland for many years (although not presently) and having been in and out of the shelbourne on plenty of occasions (but never as guests) we were really excited to go and experience what it was to stay there.

I was slightly apprehensive having seen some of the recent reviews but have to say that our stay met and exceeded all of our expectations.

The room was on the small side but beautifully furnished, check in was smooth and very welcoming and we were helped with our bags by the great floor staff.

Our stay just went perfectly from there - from the ease of the location to the service in the bar everything was just excellent.

Particular mention goes to breakfast which is another wonderful hour or two enjoying the hospitality of the hotel. We were served by a french (I think?!) girl with dark hair on both mornings and she was just excellent - is was as if we were out for a meal in a really good restaurant.

I used the gym on both mornings and it is very well equipped for a hotel with modern weights etc - again cannot be faulted. Had I a little more time I would have used the pool which looks great.

Overall 10 out of 10 for the shelbourne and we can't wait to return.",5,2015,09,10
207,"Beautiful building, slow service",This hotel is fantastically located and the interior has been done to a high standard. There is a buzzy and busy bar on the ground floor that is definitely worth a visit. Unfortunately there didn't seem to be enough reception staff and the current works and drapes covering them detract from the beauty of the building itself. A bit disappointing for the price ,3,2015,09,10
207,Beautiful and Elegant,"I only stayed one night here, but it was well worth it. The staff were amazing and very friendly. I loved their spa and fitness area. Sauna, Steam room, swimming pool..the list goes on. Had a drink in one of their bars, it was pretty pricey (not surprising) but I wouldn't go there again, It was more for an older crowd and reminded me of being in my grandmothers house.",5,2015,09,09
207,Fabulous Service,"Got to Ireland early in the morning, and the staff did an excellent job getting our room ready early for us.  The décor is beautiful.  You cannot do wrong by staying at this hotel across from St Stephens Green.",5,2015,09,09
207,Great Location,"Stayed here two nights last month (August, 2015).  Great location close to Temple Bar district and near the city center.   

My wife and I stayed in a Triple Room with our 17 year old daughter.  The space was large.  No complaints there.  The bathroom was well appointed with good counter space, something which is rare in Europe.  Service at the hotel was very good.  We ate at fine dining one night and the food was wonderful.  My daughter is a Vegan and the kitchen was able to accommodate.

Really nothing negative to say about the hotel.",4,2015,09,09
207,"Emblematic hotel, extremely average service","This is quite a landmark, a lot of personalities have stayed here in the past, including Princess Grace of Monaco, JFK, Bono, etc. We spent here two nights. Hotel is very nice, nice lobby. We arrived around 7.30 p.m. Check-in took a while, and it was quite annoying as our kid was feeling sick, we finally were shown to our room. We had booked the JFK suite, (it was the suite were the president stayed). The suite is quite nice. The bed was comfy, bathroom big, living-room spacious, they arranged a rollaway bed for our kid. The bedroom also had a door that opened to the hallway and it was quite noisy each morning (due to some very boisterous neighbours), they woke me up at 7 a.m.
When we left our room at around 10.30 in the morning we put the Make Up Our Room sign. We returned at 3.30 in the afternoon just to find out they hadn't service our room... We called the front desk. I don't think this is acceptable for a 700 Euros per night suite...
Room service was swift and plenty of options, they served good oysters and a fair range of wines by the glass.
Breakfast was good, not impressive, not so many options, but all right and fast service. The hotel is situated near the city centre, anyway Dublin isn't a big city and everything is within walking distance.",3,2015,09,08
207,As expected,"The Shelbourne is a fantastic hotel as you would expect from a hotel with such a long history of sustained quality.
The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Dublin right on St. Stephens green. The Lobby is well laid out and nicely decorated. The rooms are big and very comfortable. Pool and the gym are great, the Spa is fantastic giving a great range of treatments.
The Restaurant provides top class service and beautiful food it is worth staying here for the breakfast alone which is the best I have ever seen in a hotel. 
The main plus about this hotel is the staff, in the restaurant on reception or in the spa/gym the staff in all of my dealings have always been fantastic, welcoming and friendly.
Alwasy a great stay",5,2015,09,08
207,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I have stayed twice at the Shelbourne before giving my review as my 1st experience was extraordinarily bad - which I accept was misfortune but it was how the hotel dealt with it that was the issue. 
I believe that they are amidst an interior upgrade which I would say is greatly needed.
If you are looking for 5* and dislike musty old dated decor then this is not the hotel for you.
The breakfast was appalling, I have had much nicer (Monart and Aghadoe Heights come straight to mind) - I do not expect to have to queue up in a dark restaurant with no natural light for my breakfast, it was like a cattle mart! Nothing out of the ordinary offered. Felt like I was eating in a dungeon with my stainless steel, cutlery - and if you ask for gluten free you are made to feel like it was a hassle!  
Would I return - NO!    
They are though in a great location.",3,2015,09,07
207,Outstanding hotel,"Right on the edge of St Steven's Green, and close to Grafton Street, this is an outstanding hotel.  The room was first class, and the service matched.  The dinner is too expensive, and not very good, but the breakfast is top notch.  It is right across the street from the Hop-On/Hop Off busses, and very convenient to the main city.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful experience in Dublin.",5,2015,09,06
207,Top spot. Top hotel,"Great stay. Staff were very good. But the Best features of this hotel are its historical building and location right next to Dublins best walking area and bars. It rains a bit in Ireland, so you want somewhere warm, walkable and close to the action. This does it on all three counts. If it's wet out, the two famous and beautiful bars in the hotel will keep you happy. Many Dubliners come to the hotel to drink because it's famous. If you like to walk or jog you're  beside a nice park. If you like to shop it's two minutes to Dublin's best shopping streets. The gym is old school but perfectly useable. Recommended. ",5,2015,09,06
207,Absolutely fabulous,"Visited with family for a get together. All three rooms upgraded and treats in one room for us to enjoy. Fantastic service. Rooms clean, spacious and luxurious. Dinner was great with attentive staff in a lovely dining room. Within minutes walk of Grafton Street and just across the street from Stephen's Green park. Will be back and recommend to everyone for a special treat!",5,2015,09,03
207,Great hotel - centrally located,"Very nice, clean hotel centrally located in Dublin. Staff is very nice, helpful, & friendly. 

If you are coming from the U.S. - my suggestion is to get a room the night before you arrive to ensure you will be able to check into your room when you arrive from the airport about 7:30am. 

They will do their best to accommodate - however don't blame them if a room isn't available !

207,"Overpriced hotel, undergoing renovation, staff hit or miss","Just returned from a trip with my parents to Ireland to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary and was really disappointed in the Shelbourne Hotel.   First the good points, the hotel lobby is beautiful and welcoming.   The staff all were pleasant and helpful at check-in and I had pre-arranged some items (wheelchair delivery for my mother, early check-in, in-room amenity, etc.).  The hotel was aware of these things and the items that didn't involve the hotel directly were all in place.

The check-in process was excruciatingly long.   Part was because they were looking for a room that was available, but even so the process seemed slow and disorganized.  The complimentary glass of lemonade while we waited was a nice touch.   

While they were able to accommodate any early check-in (mind you it was only 90 minutes early) for one room.  We were not able to get our other room until way after the posted check-in time.  No apologies…just we are busy.   

The biggest disappointment was the room.  I booked an upgraded room and paid dearly for the Heritage Premium King room and the entire hotel was going thru an exterior renovation.  The view was of nothing but scaffolding and to make matters worse my room was right at the ladder so all the workers gathered in front of my window 8am-5pm waiting to go up and down the scaffolding and using my window ledge to hold their items.  I had to keep my blinds closed the entire stay due to the heavy traffic.  I would expect the hotel to mention this on their website, in any of the 5 emails I sent back and forth about the special stay I was trying to create for my parents.

Never once was it mentioned they were going through a renovation and maybe i would want a cheaper room.   I also ordered an amenity for my parents that never arrived -- fortunately they never billed me for it either but obviously the money wasn't the object.  

Also, the telephones in my parents room didn't work.  One night i was out running an errand for my mother and tried calling her room and she never answered and I kept asking the operator to ring her again, and was told she is not in her room she isn't answering and I assured the operator she indeed was in the room as I just left her and she is either fallen or is dead.   I asked them to send a note up to her and they said they would turn the message light on but were not staffed to send someone to the room!

A word of note, this is a very OLD hotel which is fine and I like the old-world charm but if you have mobility issues like my mother, this is not the hotel for you.  The floors are like walking through a fun house at a carnival -- not a level floor anywhere -- hallways, rooms, even the bathroom.  Was very difficult to manoeuvre when you have balance issues.

Finally, I brought all of this to the attention of the manager on duty the first night we arrived and she assured me she would call me and she said she would call my room.  I never heard from her again.  I asked for her again at checkout but she was not working and the current manager on duty was ""busy.""   

I tried to do everything correctly -- call ahead and arrange for my special requests, make sure staff knew of my mother's mobility issues, tried to work with them to make the stay special and this hotel was almost going out of their way to make the stay the disaster it was.  They clearly have no regard for their guests.",3,2015,09,03
207,Stunning Hotel,The Shelbourne Hotel is one beautiful hotel in a perfect location overlooking  St James's Green. From the first minute leaving the taxi the staff were attentive and very welcoming. The fruit punch and homemade bread on arrival was a lovley touch. The room was very inviting and relaxing. We ate in the restaurant  the first evening. The lobster cocktail was delicious followed by the chataubriand steak - amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Shelbourne. Dublin is a welcoming and beautiful city.,5,2015,09,03
207,Trip to beautiful Ireland,The Shelbourne Dublin is a truly beautiful hotel. Everything is first class. Many celebrities have stayed there and are still staying there. The hotel is very accommodating as we arrived at the hotel around 7am after a very long flight and they gave us our room early which was very much appreciated. We had a deluxe king with a balcony which was very nice.,5,2015,09,02
207,Holiday ,"Great hotel, good service, beds comfortable, restaurant good , the breakfast spread was very good. Location is ideal for shopping . Not sure if it's good for family. We will definitely be back for tea in the lounge. Even though they are renovating there was no inconvenience. ",5,2015,09,02
207,"Lovely hotel, great location, undergoing renovations","The staff is very accommodating and courteous.  The hotel is undergoing major renovations so you have to be prepared for not being able to see out the front windows to St. Stephen's Green. Also, while I was on the side that had already been renovated, a friend was in a suite on the other side which had not been. Her room had stained carpets and really looked like it was in a different hotel as compared to my room.  They did move her to another room, but unfortunately, while it was nicer than the first, it was still on the side that was undergoing renovations.  So, if you are planning on staying, I would insist on either being on the side with the renovations or ask for a discount for the rooms if not renovated.  You really can't tell when you are walking down the hall if it is the renovated side or not so at least they are doing it in a very nice fashion.
The bars are wonderful and the breakfast is very good also.",4,2015,09,01
207,"Top class staff, Top class service","Visited with my wife for a two night stay. It was simply fantastic from start to finish, the check in was excellent and the room very very nice.. Breakfast on both mornings was simply delicious.. Stayed on a number of occasions and it just gets better & better. When picking up the car after checkout there was a bottle of ice cold water waiting for me in the car which was a nice touch.. ",5,2015,09,01
207,Wedding weekend,"We spent 3 nights here for the wedding of my partners neice.The whole experience was wonderful.All the staff are very friendly and obliging and extremely attentive.Our room was very spacious and well appointed and spotlessly clean.
The Wedding reception was also back at the Hotel and was superb and sumptuous in every way and totally magical.I cannot find fault in any way and hope that one day I may make a return visit to this fabulous Hotel and wonderful city.",5,2015,09,01
207,DUBLIN BUSINESS TRIP,"I can't say enough positive remarks about the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin.  From the rooms, to the service, the lounges and lobby, the restaurants...this hotel is the best of the best! Great location to parks, shopping, tourist attractions.",5,2015,09,01
207,"Clearly the best hotel in Dublin, even when it is covered for restoration.","We have stayed in the Shelbourne before, and most of the other 5 start Dublin hotels.  This time was special, my wife's birthday.  I booked a Herritage Park View room, as the view over St Stephens Green is spectacular.  

The hotel has been recently refurbished to a very high standard, and has a feeling of quality and opulence.  There is a very good restaurant, a great bar and a vibrant cocktail bar/brasserie.  The staff make the hotel even more special, they are all very well trained and eager to please.  

Our only issue was the view, which was completely obscured by muslin covering the window from the outside, whilst work was being undertaken to restore the facade.  I would understand, but I had paid a premium for the view.  A very capable and charming duty manager quickly resolved my complaint with an appropriate adjustment to the rate and a bottle of bubbly for the inconvenience.  In my view, you can judge a hotel as much by its approach to dealing with complaints as any other facet.  

Highly recommended, without doubt the best location in Dublin, within easy reach to everything.  Perfect.  I look forward to seeing the restored exterior.",5,2015,09,01
207,Superb,Just stayed for 2 nights and from the moment we arrived all the staff were charming and so helpful. The horseshoe bar was buzzing the whole time. The buffet breakfast was delicious and we loved the fact you could ask the chefs directly to cook anything extra you wanted.  Our room was charming and well equipped and the bed was so comfortable.  Also the hotel is in a great position being only a 2 minute walk to town.,5,2015,09,01
207,Terrible stay - Cavalier and unresponsive management to Antisemitic incident,"I would like to preface my review by stating that I have already reached out to management and I have been disappointed by the cavalier response with nothing more than platitudes in response to the serious issues outlined below. As management clearly does not take this issue seriously, I thought the travel community should be aware.

I arrived at the Shelbourne around 9 AM on July 9th after an overnight flight and was disappointed to find that the hotel was actively undergoing construction. I checked into my room upon arrival as I had booked a room for the prior night to ensure immediate access to my room to get some sleep before my meeting that afternoon (pre-confirmed late check-in before arrival). I was excited to be ""upgraded"" to a suite, however, upon arrival at the room, I immediately discovered that this room was not truly an upgrade. There was construction being done on the hotel's exterior directly outside of my room and there were workers loitering directly outside of my window (pictures attached). I was unable to go to sleep as the workers were making noise, thereby making the extra paid night useless. 

As an Orthodox Jew, I then proceeded to don my prayer shawl and phylacteries for my morning prayers only to find the construction workers congregating outside of my window pointing at me and mocking/taunting me through the window. This gross invasion of my privacy made me feel threatened and extremely uncomfortable within my hotel room. Management has essentially pointed all blame for this incident at the outside contractor and has refused to give me any update on their investigation into this matter.

I proceeded to the lobby to request a new room and I was informed that I would not ordinarily have received such a room but that there were no other rooms available and that I should be satisfied that my early check-in was accommodated (when in fact this was not an early check in as I had paid for the prior night in the hotel as well). My request for a different room was denied.

Beyond my horrendous experiences above, I also would like to point out that my room's wall paper was peeling and had chipped furniture. All in all, this was hardly what I was expecting from such an internationally renowned hotel.",1,2015,08,31
207,"Beautiful and elegant Dublin Hotel on St. Stephens Green, entitled concierges","We stayed for 2 nights this past week at the Shelbourne on St. Stephens Green in Dublin. It is a beautiful and elegant old hotel currently undergoing a face lift of the facade, a favorite over the years of many famous politicians and artists. Our suite was beautiful and well appointed, and very comfortable. We enjoyed the Horseshoe Bar and the morning breakfasts, which were excellent. We were puzzled, however, by our several interactions with several different concierges, all of whom were unhelpful, treated us as if they were doing us a favor to speak with us, and who failed to answer our questions or facilitate WiFi access.

We had a superior customer service experience several days later down the street at the FitzWilliam.",4,2015,08,30
207,Excellent Hotel.,Stayed here at my wife's request.  Everything was first class in an older building.  The room was spacious with a comfortable bed.  The restaurant was ok but not truly great.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Will be coming back to the Shelbourne.,5,2015,08,29
207,Classy yet comfortable hotel,"Loved this place.  Old european charm with a pleasant freshness.  Staff was very accommodating.  Location could not have been better.  This hotels offers a very nice full breakfast for 50% off to guests that pay in advance so make sure you take advantage of this opportunity.  To top this off, they offer made to order organic fresh juice such as carrot, kale, cucumber and apple.    The beds and pillows are some of the best I have encountered.  For those of us who have health challenges, these are perks that are priceless.  The concierge was wonderful.  The only problem is that you get so spoiled staying here it ruins you for other properties (especially other Marriott properties as you expect the same.)",5,2015,08,28
207,Once again at the Shelbourne,Third time staying here in 6 years. Only gripe was room not made up on one day at 4 PM but otherwise the expected friendly and warm service.  Made to order Breakfast was the finest in Ireland and a break from the usual 'Full Irish'.,4,2015,08,27
207,"Lovely Hotel, Cold Service","On our last night, a Saturday, of our vacation we booked a heritage king room to relax and enjoy Dublin. During our time traveling around Ireland the Shelbourne had fallen in to the conversation and we were told amazing things about this historic hotel. 

As a Marriott Gold member, check-in was smooth and very welcoming.  The front desk could not have been nicer -off to an excellent start.  However, the entire property is covered in scaffolding and was never communicated until our arrival.  Your room's window being sealed shut with opaque plastic seems like something that would be at least a foot note during booking. A note, chocolates and water were a thoughtful extra to compensate for lack of any natural day light. It should be mentioned, no work was happening and noise was not at all an issue. 

The room and bath were grand and lovely - truly five star. Baggage delivery, room service and turn down were all excellent.  

The lack of five star review, besides the scaffolding, was the service in the lobby.  The gentleman at the front door, the bar staff and concierge were cold, unhelpful and generally snobby.  I'm a New Yorker - I'm used to attitude - this people could put you in tears. We had decided to start our night with a drink at the hotel. On a Saturday evening, there is not A SINGLE SEAT available anywhere. Not only is nothing available, there is not one hotel employee willing to assist in any way. After our futile search for a drink, we decided on trying for a casual dinner.  The completely uninterested concierge provided us with a print out for pizza. wow thanks.  Upon exiting and entering the hotel, you are greeted with blank stares and fighting against the rain to open your own door. 

I spent the rest of the night in my room, preferring not leave and only interacting with the housekeeping staff - who's friendliness was so refreshing it was a shock. 

Breakfast the next morning was lovely in the Saddle Room and almost redeeming.

Stay for the amazing room, if you can ignore the service.",3,2015,08,27
207,Lovely relaxing stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the Shelbourne. Check in was prompt. Our room was beautiful and had everything we needed. The food and service in the restaurant was great and the breakfast in the morning was nice. On breakfast the only thing i would say is that the buffet area is quite cramped, especially when breakfast is busy.",5,2015,08,27
207,Lovely stay at the Shelbourne,"Just back from a trip to Dublin and decided to treat ourselves in the Shelbourne. It certainly was a treat. The hotel is worth a trip alone for the history but the service and warmth of the welcome is what you will go back for. Being at the centre of town was fantastic and being welcomed the minute you walk in is really nice. The bar staff were great, friendly but not over bearing. We were met by smiles again at breakfast and the buffet was great with lots of choice, we skipped the hot breakfast as the buffet was more than enough. Will go back again to have the afternoon tea,as it looked quite an experience.",5,2015,08,26
207,Beautiful Inside Scaffolding Outside,"First let me say that there are some wonderful staff members here. Joanna and Thomaz (spelling?) were outstanding in customer service. Unfortunately the gentleman who check me in looked stressed and it was about 10:30am. I asked for an upgrade due to being platinum status. I paid for a Premium Heritage room so I didn't reserve budget accommodations.  He said he couldn't give me a park view room but HE had already picked out a lovely room for me. The person checking in ahead of me was my flight attendant. Her husband and son sat in front of me in the plane. I watched them go up the elevator allocated for the park view rooms. What I'm getting at is when I entered my room there was a rollaway made out for a 3rd person. There were just 2 of us. So flight attendants seem to get priority. No mention of my platinum gift upon check in. I had to ask Joanna the next day and she took care of the item being overlooked. 

There is only one plug in in the room for powering up electronics from the states. The adapter that I was given after asking was not correct so I gave up and just dealt with it. Even though I'm sure the room was not chose especially for me, I have to say that it was lovely and roomy and the shower was awesome. However, I had to keep curtains closed due to looking out at an office building that was very close. They had huge windows and I could look right into the offices so I'm sure they could have seen me as well. 

The breakfast was adequate but nothing to write home about. Actually it was pretty crowded to get items off the buffet. No toaster but if you ask they will bring and the wheat toast was the best I've ever had anywhere. I received 2 (that's it) free drink coupons in lieu of no Concierge Lounge. I thought this was rather cheap on their part. I stayed 6 nights. 

As everyone has said, you can't beat the location. 

In closing I'd like to thank Denis at the Conceirge desk for helping me with plans to see a castle on the other side of Ireland and this had to be a day trip. The castle was about 40 minutes out of Galway and Denis had connections in Kinvara to set us up with a driver and it was a holiday so not particularly an easy task. Thank you again Denis.",4,2015,08,26
207,Always a pleasure,"Without fail, the shelbourne never disappoints!

I love being this side of Dublin and opposite Stephens Green, a really relaxing park, good for destressing and people watching. Shopping in Grafton Street and side streets is fun. So hard to resist the fashion! I wish I could always stay at this hotel!!!
I recommend the inclusive brekkie to start the day. Checkout is a fab time at 12.00.",5,2015,08,25
207,Outstanding Wedding Night Experience,"Last week we got married in the Dublin Registry Office and chose the Shelbourne as the venue for a lunch and overnight stay. Without much hassle at all, I made the booking and informed the Guest Relations team that we were coming. Upon arrival we were given a beautiful private area table for lunch which was perfect for our intimate gathering of 8 people. The food was perfect, elegant and delicious and the menus were personalised. The service was flawless. When we checked in to the room we were informed that we had been upgraded and the room was stunning. Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries..rose petals all over the bed. An absolute masterclass in service and hospitality and an unforgettable experience.",5,2015,08,25
207,A piece of Irish heritage and world class service in the heart of Dublin,"We recently stayed 3 nights in the Shelbourne and fell in love with this hotel and the people that work there.  The Irish Constitution was written here (you can still visit the room and even have a meeting here) and during the 1916 uprising, it was right in the cross fire coming from St. Stephens Park which is just across the street.  Our experience started before we arrived when Keith, the great concierge, made reservations for us at all the restaurants we wanted to enjoy.  He was available every day to answer questions with a smile and give us direction on many of the sites in the area.  Brian, the friendly and helpful doorman was great to give directions and hail cabs for us.  All the staff were very well trained and extremely friendly.  We felt like we were special guests in a very fine home. The breakfast that was part of our stay was excellent.  There was a huge buffet or we could order a la carte from the menu - all included.  The flowers in the public areas were works of art and we enjoyed not only the Horseshoe Bar for an after dinner drink and the larger bar that has some of the best mixologists in Dublin. The location was excellent - only two blocks from the shopping street: Grafton and is across the street from the beautiful St. Stephens Square and within walking distance of many great restaurants and pubs.  Undoubtedly, a great hotel.",5,2015,08,23
207,"Some exceptional features, some ho hum.","The Shelbourne is a very lovely property in the Grand hotel style. I was surprised at the lack of amenities in the Spa change rooms. Shampoo etc in the showers but no extra towels, combs or products for the guests. This was very unusual versus other such properties. The young woman who did my massage and facial was excellent however, and made up for the locker room. We had High Tea and in contrast to the warning signage about no children and formal dress code we were distracted/interrupted by a small child running around (with hot tea being poured everywhere). I am thinking this was an exception but although the staff looked worried they seemed reluctant to act. Beyond that the decor, the rooms and the overall ambience were very nice. Have stayed in much nicer places for similar money. If you like this type of experience and you are in Dublin you will still enjoy it, just be prepared for the inconsistencies",3,2015,08,23
207,World Class Hotel on St. Stephens Green,"Just came back from Dublin and a stay at the gorgeous Shelbourne.  The staff is courteous, the room was well appointed and the location is ideal.

207,Amazing,"A beautiful, old hotel in the centre of Dublin. The staff are wonderful, very helpful and friendly. The breakfast very good quality and plentiful. Will definitely be returning. Thank you to all for making our trip so special and memorable",5,2015,08,21
207,Tired Old Has Been,"Unfortunately, The Shelbourne, which has been an icon in Dublin history, is today a poor excuse for a Renissance Hotel. The service is poor. The rooms currently have scaffolding and sheeting over the windows .  The rooms are small and the beds are lumpy. Breakfast is chaotic and my order was misplaced and not served despite pre payment . Their current guest relations executive, Melita Kovacevic, is unprofessional, condescending, and a poor excuse for a representative of this fine hotel chain. 
Until they get their act together, I  would recommend staying elsewhere.",1,2015,08,20
207,Awful,"I had an awful stay. Very smug and arrogant staff. Old stuffy hotel...needs airing in the corridors. Very bad check-in I should have left right away!
Sad colour scheme in the rooms, more 4 stars than 5 stars. Breakfast chaotic and poor quality buffet.
Currently undergoing refurbishment so no views just internal office views. Concierge not able to advice an old traditional pub in Dublin and sent me to some modern Davie place on Duke street. Stay elsewhere!",1,2015,08,20
207,Classic hotel in great location,"Great hotel in Dublin with lots of history and tradition. A lot of rooms overlook St Stephens Green, very central. Nice atmosphere and buzz to hotel.

Close to all major sights, shops and bars of Dublin.",4,2015,08,20
207,Stunning hotel in city center,"Very nice hotel with big rooms and great breakfast. At the entrance you has a few restaurants / ball rooms, which give a feeling of an old high class hotel and it lives up to the expectation. All along you will find quality - specially in rooms. Breakfast is to die for with so much class. Sad i could stay only for a night but will surely come here again.",5,2015,08,19
207,Under cinstruction,"We visited the Shelbourne in early August. The entire hotel is under construction. When we checked in to our room, there was a man outside working on scaffolding. Not a great view! We would have had a view of St Stephen's Green but it was blocked. Staff told us it would be that way through November.

The hotel staff were very attentive. Clearly service is a priority. The entire feel of the hotel was deluxe. 

We did the afternoon tea. It was expensive but a nice experience. We took the leftover treats to our room. It was too much to eat at one time. 

The location was great. Easy to walk to lots of destinations. Hop On Hop Off bus was right outside. ",3,2015,08,18
207,only problem with the place is i had to check out,we  had a 3 night stay here for our 15th wedding anniversary  check in was sort and sweet all our stuff was ready for us due to mobile check in room was on the 8th floor king size deluxe room very roomy and well maintained . hotel itself is stunning one of the finest i have stayed in .breakfast was also top class so many options available .we had the 3 course meal in the saddle room it was amazing as well the manner around the hotel is always pleasant and happy like i say in my title the only problem i had was leaving such a great place ,5,2015,08,18
207,Family Rugby Weekend,"This is without doubt one of the best hotels in Ireland.  The service from the moment we checked in until we checked out was faultless.  The staff were helpful and friendly without being overbearing.  The room was spacious spotless and well equipped.  Although we did not have our evening meal in the hotel the menu looked superb and on my next visit to Dublin I will certainly be eating in the “Saddle Room”.  Their breakfast is excellent and suits all palates.  The only small downside was the view from our room, which looked out into an interior courtyard but this did not in any way spoil our stay.",5,2015,08,17
207,"5 Star location, thats about it.","I was very disappointed with my nights stay in the Shelbourne. When I booked my room over the phone, the one question I asked was  'do I have a nice view', I know the hotel faces onto St Stephens Green, so when the lady on the phone said ' the view from the room was beautiful', I was delighted.  To arrive at the hotel and be led to a room that faced a brick wall with barbed wire topping the wall, was appalling. I complained and was moved to another room which looked onto a scaffolding placed against an internal hotel wall, also very disappointing.  I was then told that all Twin rooms are facing the same wall/barbed wire wall.  If I had been told this when I booked the room over the phone, I would not have booked and paid just under €500.00 for the pleasure of looking out at brick walls.  The staff are all smiles, but unfortunately I feel the service is very disingenuous.  We did have a very nice Afternoon Tea, but other than that, an extremely disappointing stay.",3,2015,08,17
207,Great Hotel,"The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  The service was excellent.  Food was the best, especially breakfast.  The only complaint was the room had no view - only a central courtyard; also they are renovating the outside so no rooms had a view.  Nevertheless, the inside was beautiful and everything was first class.",5,2015,08,16
207,Excellent,"No words to describe staff,food,decor,hospitality,location and all round 5star experience only Excellent.This is hands down the best hotel in Ireland. Special thank you to Eamonn Casey and all staff.DM",5,2015,08,16
207,Wanted to love it.,We stayed two nights and booked two connecting rooms.  We were upgraded to two rooms with two double beds so we wouldn't need the roll away bed (extra $$).  The rooms were beautiful but we were woken up but a dripping sound at 5:30am.  Apparently the air conditioner was leaking from the ceiling.  I told the front desk about it.  They didn't seem too concerned or apologetic. Not what I expected from a 5 star hotel.  Breakfast was just ok.  Although the location was perfect we might try the Conrad next visit.,3,2015,08,16
207,Had a delightful afternoon tea experience!,"On our recent visit to Dublin a friend and I stopped in to the Shelbourne hotel for the Grace Kelly afternoon tea. We walked in and signed up for the 5 pm sitting. Beautiful tea room - lovely flowers, friendly staff and live piano music. The tea selections are delightful and the sandwiches, scones and desserts are scrumptious! I opted for the optional glass of champagne. Great tea experience!",5,2015,08,15
207,AMAZING old class hotel at St. Stephen's Green,"BEAUTIFUL hotel located in the centre of Dublin. Excellent location, just moments from various sights such as St. Stephen's Green and Grafton St. Service overall was phenomenal, minus my experience at No 27 Bar. The day I arrived, I went to No 27 Bar and was initially served by one bartender, but it seemed as if he was done for the night and was replaced by another lad. This new bartender lacked the skills and knowledge to be a bartender in this caliber of a hotel. My glass remained empty for quite some time as he was busy socialising until I had to get his attention and request another glass of wine. In fact, I looked around the bar and the other patrons had empty glasses as well. The breakfast served at the Saddle Room was spot on with the choice of the breakfast buffet and/or ordering from the menu. The service by my server, Wilfredo, was perfect. Little things like refilling drinks without asking and providing prompt, efficient service goes a long way. The rooms have nice features such as robes, slippers, nice products in the bathroom and have recently added new windows, which keeps out outside noise.",5,2015,08,14
207,Poor service and management ruined our stay,"I was really looking forward to our stay in what I thought was one of the ""top"" hotels in Dublin. Check-in went pretty smoothly, although the lobby definitely didn't look 5 star to me, a rating this hotel somehow lays claim to. But upon getting to our 1000 euro a night suite, I realized the windows were all covered with scaffolding and green plastic. Indeed upon further  investigation, a very large part of the hotel is covered with scaffolding and plastic. I called down to the desk expressing my dismay at my very claustrophobic-feeling room, and basically I got a lot of bad attitude and surprise that I could be disappointed at having no clear windows. I was shocked by this attitude.

I went downstairs to speak to a ""manager"" and got more of the same. In fact he claimed the hotel fully disclosed the scaffolding on their website. I asked him to show me where. He could not. At this point I expected at least an apology and I very justly felt a room rate reduction was in order. All I got was silence and blank stares. In frustration, I went back to my room, and unfortunately I had no option to change hotels that weekend, as Dublin was very full.

The next day I asked to speak to another ""manager"". She promised to get back to me on this issue, as I straight out asked for a Rate adjustment on the room, but I never heard back from her. I also tried emailing a manager email address that appeared on Trip Advisor, but no response. Never in my many hotel stays have I seen such a lack of concern in responding to a guest's complaints.

So basically, the hotel is lying when they fail to disclose the major work going on in the premises. Possibly it is disclosed on some back page of the website, but I can't find it, and neither could the hotel. When you are paying big bucks for a hotel room, you deserve to have information on whether there is construction at the hotel. The Shelbourne doesn't give you that option. Frankly, their main interest seems to be in squeezing every last euro out of their customers, whatever it takes. Never really seen such poor service in even a two star hotel. An apology or even a plate of cookies would have made me feel better, but they didn't even make a small effort to apologize in any way.

Another complaint--the concierge. Our bags  were lost by British Airways. The front desk at check in told us to inform the concierges, and they could help us locate our bags. This could have been a huge help to us. Instead, what we found was that the concierge was just monitoring the BA website, as we could easily do ourselves. They seemingly had no contacts with the airline. My experience in other 5-star hotels is that they have people in the airlines they can call to ease the way when difficulties arise. Not the Shelbourne, apparently. Also, had to give our lost baggage information to several concierges there, as they didn't bother to pass it along between themselves. Frustrating!

Breakfast at the Shelbourne was very unappetizing, although some of the breakfast staff were nice. The breakfast room was quite a strange warren of rooms.

And a very big complaint about the tech facilities at the Shelbourne. Wifi in our suite had a very poor signal in the living room. And even in the bedroom, wi-fi dropped repeatedly so had to sign in at least a dozen times a day. 

The business center technology was very outdated so even printing a simple document was an ordeal. Windows XP, anyone? The business center was littered with peoples' boarding passes that clearly had taken ages to print, and people just couldn't be bothered to wait anymore. Nice view from the business center, which miraculously had no scaffolding, but poor outdated equipment.

I really wanted to love this hotel, but right from the beginning it became clear the hotel didn't care about me. The lack of honesty and service at this high price was appalling to me. Terrible way to run a ""5-star"" hotel. Go elsewhere.",2,2015,08,13
207,Ireland 2015,"My daughters and I arrived in Ireland 2 days later than our original schedule due to many Delta Airline issues.  Once we arrive to the The Shelbourne the staff made it worth our way.  We absolutely loved it!  Access to everything was just right there, Hop On Hop Off tour bus, restaurants, and shopping.  This was a surprise trip for my daughters, and they loved it!  The Hotel Concierge - Keith was amazing!  We really had no exact travel plans, and I just went to the desk and asked for guidance. He and the bell staff were so nice, they convinced me to drive.  Driving was amazing, to see the country was the best.  They helped us coordinate room, and an itinerary.  We were open to anything, and they knew exactly every place my girls would enjoy and have fun.  They were spot on!!!!  Thank you being a part of creating memories that will last a lifetime for me and my daughters!",5,2015,08,13
207,Beautiful Shelbourne,"I had a one night stay here last week it was fantastic. I had won a prize of dinner bed and breakfast for two at this glorious historic hotel. Myself and my husband enjoyed the hospitaly of the shelbourne and it was unforgettable. A comfy - smallish room, toward the rear of the hotel had a huge bed and a lovely bathroom. Complementaty bottled water, treats and the morming papers  were deliveref to the room. We had a lovely dinner in the Saddle Room and a couple of drinks in the Hirseshoe Bar. There was also time for some shopping in Grafton St earlier and a stroll in St Stephens Green. An early morning swim in the pool was followed by a hearty breakfast a all in all a wonderful stay in my native City !",5,2015,08,13
207,Perfect 5 stars Hotel,"In 5 stars Hotels, you can expect 3 stars service sometimes, and 3 stars food and so on.
In this hotel, the recption was just perfect. accomplished all my special requests (as I have special demands) and the gentleman (and colleagues) were just perfect with a big smile in their lips and hearts.
The morning call on the third day was just more than warm. It made my day.
Breakfast staff were very punctual and doing everything requested in a great way.",5,2015,08,13
207,5 Star Luxury at this iconic Dublin Landmark,"From the front door Porter to the daily turn down service this hotel delivers top notch service with personality plus. Still the place to stay in Dublin, perfect location across the park and close to museums and shopping.  Our room was a good size, nicely furnished with a large bathroom-nice toiletries.  I had issues using the wall charger and an engineer responded with minutes to fix the problem.  Impressive.
Daily breakfast was wonderful-beautifully displayed with an a la cart option.  I loved the honeycomb presentation.
Bar #27 is the best spot in town for people watching, a great lunch or to meet friends for a drink
Don't miss afternoon tea served in the Lobby-an oasis of civility in the bustling city.
I highly recommend the Shelbourne to anyone looking for a true Dublin experience",5,2015,08,12
207,3rd Time There This Year!!!,"The Shelbourne is one of the reasons we go to Dublin. 
You cannot visit Dublin and not stay there. 
You owe to yourself to experience The Shelbourne at least one in your lifetime!!

The Service, The Spa, The Food...5+ stars

207,Luxurious Dublin Hotel!,"We went to Dublin as two couples in our forties and stayed for two nights (Saturday to Monday) at The Shelbourne. What a fabulous five star experience. The staff are just as you would expect, attentive and polite. Everyone is made to feel like a special guest. The decor is opulent and very decorative. 
The rooms were wonderful and spacious, again the decor was beautiful, and the beds were very large and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spacious too and the toiletries provided were Elemis! Lovely! 
The Horseshoe Bar is a great place for a pre-dinner (or post-dinner) cocktail!! Lovely drinks and reasonably priced for such a top class hotel in the heart of the city. 
Our breakfast was included in the price of our stay and there was nothing to fault. There is a buffet self service arrangement for hot and cold food, all of which was lovely. On the first morning I chose form the A La Carte, which was also included, and had the Classic Eggs Benedict. It was gorgeous, eggs poached to perfection and the Hollondaise was perfect. We didn't use the restaurant for an evening meal so I can't comment on that but I would imagine it's just as fabulous as everything else. 
The Shelbourne really did make our experience in Dublin extra special and I would definitely return! 
Also, as a foot note, if there's racing at The. Curragh during your stay I would definitely recommend that you go. What a great fun day out! I've never been to the races before and we all had great fun. It's a race course for everyone and you don't have to get dressed up to the nines to attend, although some people did. There's a play area for children, and a barbecue which served great food as well as a restaurant. And none of that snobbery about who  can go in the champagne bar, etc. 
Get a taxi from the hotel to Heuston Station. The first stop on the Limerick train is Kildare, €19 each return, and once at Kildare there is a free shuttle to the race course which brings you back at the end of the day. It only takes five minutes. Entry is between €15 and €20 depending on the event, but offers can be had if you look online in advance. 
And, for a first attempt at betting, we came home with more money than we went with! 

All in all a fab weekend in Dublin made extra special by the wonderful experience of The Shelbourne Hotel.",5,2015,08,11
207,Excellent service in a great location,"First - this hotel is wonderfully situated on St. Stephens green.  Close to both Trinity College and the Grafton street shopping district.

The first thing you notice is the doormen and the charming decor.  You are greeted by staff who take your luggage and bring you fresh lemonade as you wait to check in.

Rooms are your average upscale hotel - but the service is not.  My husband had gotten quite sick on our trip and when I went down to our free breakfast and inquired about taking up a tray for him, they graciously took an order and had it delivered to the room.  When I called the desk asking for the location of an immediate care facility - they offered to send a doctor to the room for a very reasonable rate.  He was there within an hour!

The service here helped make what could have been a miserable experience almost tolerable.  Well done!",5,2015,08,10
207,Amazing Hotel,We stayed in the Shelbourne this weekend as a treat for a friends birthday.Excellent service throughout our stay from the fresh lemonade and carrot cake whilst checking in to the wonderful Peter who upon finding out about the birthday got gifts delivered to our room.Nothing was too much bother and I congratulate the hotel on all their wonderful staff who definitely deliver the best at all times.Cant  wait to come back.,5,2015,08,10
207,Grand but crumbling,"The Shelbourne has a formidable reputation as one of Dublin's foremost luxury hotels. It says a lot that it has played host to significant moments in Irish history, including the signing of the first Irish constitution and has seen many notable visitors, including John F. Kennedy. This huge historical reputation sets the bar very high for the hotel.

The first impression of the hotel to any visitor is one of opulence. The location - on the corner of Stephen's Green - is perfect, and the architecture of the hotel is magnificent on the inside and out. There are currently works to revamp the hotel's exterior, meaning the facade is covered in scaffolding; the only disruption we encountered was a builder walking past our window, which was corrected by closing the curtains.

After being checked in by the friendly (if slightly stiff) staff, we walked into a beautiful room. Every detail fitted in with the luxurious nature of the hotel, from the ornate lamps to the artwork. The bed was big and has to be one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.

Although we were delighted with the comfort and opulence of the room, there were two flaws. Firstly, the television was slow and fickle. We were impressed with the size of the screen and range of channels, but the remote control was often unresponsive and the features to connect it to a mobile phone seldom worked. Secondly, there was an issue in the bathroom. We loved the deep bath and big shower, but we noticed on our second night that the light fitting had filled with water. We immediately called reception, who sent a repairman very quickly. He drained it and said there was a problem with the air conditioning aggregating waste water, but that this was fixed. Unfortunately, the problem recurred overnight and the following morning, water was leaking from the light onto the floor. This meant that we were unable to use the light at all and decided not to have a shower or bath due to our safety concerns.

While we were very impressed with the hotel overall, the reputation and expense of the hotel meant we expected the room to be perfect. My three-star rating may seem rather mean considering my general contentment with the hotel, but I feel it has set its own dazzlingly high standards and by these standards, the flaws and failings that may seem trivial in another hotel struck me as more problematic.",3,2015,08,10
207,An Amazing experience right in the heart of Dublin,"Great Room. Great Location. Great Service. We stayed 5 nights and it was flawless. You can feel the history in the hotel, but the staff does not rest on past laurels. From giving us valuable travel tips to treating us as if we were Princess Grace herself I can not recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2015,08,09
207,Perfect location,"This is a lovely older hotel within walking distance of many historical sites (Trinity College, Christ Church Cathedral, etc.) as well as near restaurants and shopping. Our room was comfortable although a little warm and our view was of the construction currently taking place at the hotel. We didn't spend much time in our room so not a big deal for us. We did love the shower - a rainhead shower with wonderful water pressure. The staff were very friendly and helpful and handed us umbrellas as we went out to explore the area. This is an elegant hotel with world class charm and service. If we had been in a different room, we would have given five stars.",4,2015,08,09
207,Old fashioned service and great location,"Couldn't fault the place, rooms comfortable, staff delightful, food and drink top notch. Maybe avoid the somewhat overpriced breakfast in favor of some nice breakfast places around St Stephens green. Saddle room should not be missed for dinner. Will be back!",5,2015,08,08
207,Elegance and luxury in Dublin,"Upon arriving here you know immediately you are in for a wonderful stay.  The lobby is reminiscent of old world elegance and the staff can't do enough for you.  The rooms are furnished with antique repro furnishings, the linens are crisp and white.  The marble bath features a fabulous soaking tub plus stall shower. Elemis products are used.  I didn't visit the spa, but it is an Elemis spa so I would guess it's also first class.  The tea lounge has the best scones and cappuccino I've had in years.  It is extremely well located, opposite St. Stephens Green and steps from excellent shopping and restaurants, museums, Trinity College . I hated to leave.",5,2015,08,07
207,The center of the universe as our friend calls it. So true,We stayed there so we could be close to St Stephen Green. One of the nicest experiences I've had. Beautiful rooms. Great location. Really fun bar (the one on the left). The spa was also very nice. Pool just right size. Work out room had all the latest machines.only draw back was the wait for check in and check out. Not enough lobby space for older people to sit while you wait.,5,2015,08,07
207,ELEGANT AND TIMELESS LADY,"The Shelbourne is in easy reach of most sights of Dublin, On arrival you are warmly greeted by the Liveried Doorman,then passing through the revolving door into an  elegant, if not understated  main lobby, where you are taken to reception .

Check in could not have been more painless, We had my Stepdaughter and Son In law joining us  from Florida , the reception even found a deluxe room with balcony which they could have immediately ( 8:30 am ) rather than the usual check in time of 3:00 
pm

We had a deluxe balcony room on the 7th floor, however, the room didn't offer a view although in fairness this was explained at the time of booking, if a view is your thing then I suggest that you take a room to the front of the hotel overlooking St Stephens Square, albeit this will cost you more 

The room was again, elegant, comfortable and beautifully furnished,with a dream of a extra king size bed, heat a/C is independently controlled, Also and I think this is really note worthy, Above the desk you will find electrical sockets for the UK / HK next European and, finally USA .. so dont worry about hauling all of those adapters, The Shelbourne has though ahead...The toiletries are by Elimis so no expense is spared, Robes and Slippers are also provided as is a night time turn down service.. ( Faultless )

We had a meal in the ( Saddle Room, an intimate hotel restaurant with some separate booths, the service was seamless and attentive although not obtrusive  throughout 

We also had meals in the No 27 Lounge and Afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors lounge. and no matter wherever  you dine or, drink, in the hotel the service is impeccable as is the food 

Lastly, However, I want to say a special thanks to Mia Minkovitch and, Josephine 
( Bonaparte ) from the N0 27 Lounge also to Peter in Guest Relations and to Brian our liveried doorman and last  but by no means least, Mary ( Rosemary ) for organising my Step Daughters Birthday cake and the chef who prepared it.. It was perfect..for making our seven night stay and our Daughters / son in law 4 night stay such a wonderful and memorable stay..this list does not  however, exclude all other members we came in contact with they were all great ......We'll be back...!",5,2015,08,07
207,Short holiday ,We spend 3 nights in August ( me & my wife) we did enjoy our stay at the hotel . Service was excellent. Room very comfortable & clean. Food is good .

207,Fantastic all around.,"This was our first stop during our trip to Ireland to get married. The staff upgraded us to a suite and left lovely little gifts for us in the room. The quality of the rooms, the service, and the restaurant is top-notch. If you want to be treated right, this is your hotel.",5,2015,08,05
207,Amazing stay in a top class hotel.,"Had a fantastic night in this hotel. Mentioned on the phone when booking that it was a surprise for my mum's birthday and they had a beautifully decorated plate of treats waiting in our room. Staff treated us as though we owned the hotel and the food was absolutely fabulous. Waited a while to get into the breakfast room but it was our own fault for coming down late, however the manager brought us newspapers and tea while we waited. Absolutely fantastic experience and cannot recommend enough.",5,2015,08,03
207,"Deep Historical Roots, Modern Amenities, in the Heart of Dublin","This stunning landmark property sits in the heart of Dublin, and reflects the most beautiful of Georgian architecture and posh accommodations in the city.  We actually chose this hotel because it was a Marriott property, and Marriott is a client of my company, so we try to patronize their hotels wherever we go.  At the time, we did not know that this hotel boasts a virtual who's who of history as its guests. From Princess Grace of Monaco to the John and Jackie Kennedy, many an important historical figure or celebrity has graced their halls.  The hotel has gorgeous architecture. I could just sit in the Lord Mayor's tea room and stare at the ceilings, fireplaces, and various appointments throughout.   From the marble foyer to the neoclassical sculptures out front, the place is just stunning.  The rooms, restaurants, and amenities have all been updated and modernized, and refacing work was underway when we visited. Service in the restaurants was a bit slow (we had to ask a few times for things), but the food excellent and the concierge a true Irish expert.  We plan to stay here whenever we visit Dublin  Loved it.",4,2015,08,03
207,Rich in History,"This hotel has an amazing history.  However, it felt as though they were relying on that history and not so much on the present.  Our room was not serviced two of the three nights we stayed there.  We had to ask for clean towels.  The staff was not all that friendly which was really different from the rest of the people in Dublin who went out of their way to be kind to visitors.  This isn't a terrible hotel.  It just isn't what I would have expected for a five star hotel.  If you love history though this is a place to consider.",3,2015,08,02

Outstanding attention to detail and quality delivered to the customer! The staff here are on top of their game! Though quite expensive , you pay for what you get! Above 5 star luxury and  it is quite an experience. If you ever get the chance to stay here or even have afternoon tea or a pint in the famous `Horseshoe Bar` then i would recommend it highly even as a treat.

207,Dublin and Shelbourne comes up as #1 city and hotel!,"We started our 15 day vacation in Dublin staying at the Shelbourne. We were also went to 4 other countries and about 5 other hotels. The people of Dublin and especially the Shelbourne win our vote for best service, best restaurants, best people, friendliest, and just making you feel welcome while being sincere and gracious the entire time! The Shelbourne dinner restaurants and breakfasts were superb. I had the best risotto (caramelized onion and green onion) at the main restaurant at Shelbourne. The room was bit smaller...but the people of Dublin and of the Shelbourne made up for it with big hearts and smiles! When we arrived they offered us water or lemonade. Concierge was helpful and made good recommendations. The service at breakfast was exceptional and there were plenty of options! I will be going back to Dublin and the Shelbourne!",5,2015,08,01
207,3 nights ,"Incredibly beautiful and historic. Professional, helpful staff. Alan from concierge was excellent in helping us book excursions. Jack at the front desk was a gem getting us settled in.

207,Tour of hotel,Highly recommended tour of this elegant  five star hotel. Visited with a small group of girls who loved the luxurious surroundings and access to private suites. Our guides Paul and Dorrine were very welcoming and between them had a wealth of knowledge of the history and social relevance of the Shelbourne to share. Their obvious pride in their workplace made this a special and enjoyable experience .  Anne + six ,5,2015,07,28
207,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful service-an authentic Irish experience","We stayed here two nights and I can honestly say I've never been so spoiled in my life. The service was impeccable, the room was beautiful and so clean. The bathroom was lovely with granite counters, rain shower and a swimmable tub. And the breakfast was the best I've had in a LONNGGGG time! The Irish people are so welcoming and like to give tips and we enjoyed every second we stayed here. If you find a decent rate-don't bother looking anywhere else-just book. 

It's in a perfect location too. Right on Stephen's Green-a beautiful park for wandering and only a few minutes walk to Grafton street for shopping and the bus from the airport comes right outside. Make sure you have a drink in the hotel bar and check out the pool! 

Oh and if you need any other reason to stay-they have a little museum room that shows who has stayed there-Grace Kelly, JFK and Obama...",5,2015,07,28
207,Many room options,"This hotel is beautiful and has a long history. My advice is to spend the extra money and go for the more expensive rooms. The staff treat you according to what type of room you book and by this I mean everything from their greetings, to explaining the facilities of the hotel, how they treat you in general and even to where they sit you for breakfast. The cheaper room guests are placed in the back room annex. Disappointed that the majority of the staff are not Irish, instead Eastern European. Overall, our experience was below average.",3,2015,07,27
207,Beautiful,"A rich history for a hotel, stayed her two nights, really enjoyed our stay, loved that the hotel brought in a piece of history to some of the rooms. Would recommend this hotel again to anybody. Staff were lovely and the food-a bit pricy- was exquisite. ",4,2015,07,27

207,Not Worth The Price,Yeah it's nice total rip off we used marriot points so it was cheap but other than that very expensive. The rooms are nice and comfortable the bar is good too can get full quick restraunt is nice for breakfast and  lunch. Also the staff are respectful. Good place if you have the money.,4,2015,07,24
207,Solid experience,"Older hotel that could use updating. Room was spacious but a bit tired.  Good free wifi. Great, central location with many pubs and local attractions within walking distance. Friendly, helpful staff. Breakfast was included but was average at best",3,2015,07,23
207,Some Issues,"Have stayed a few times at the Shelbourne mainly because of location and nice busy bar. We always take a cheaper room but cheap is still €250+. On this recent occasion we were upgraded to a larger room. The room looked out on a building site. The only window was sealed with tape from the outside and could not be opened. Covered in dust obviously. The room itself was fine. So I am thinking is my €250 better spent elsewhere and I think it possibly is. Previous rooms were very small. 18 sq metres.
What really annoyed me on this occasion was a visit to the bar for a drink before going out for dinner. We ordered 2 glass of white wine. The barman spilled the entire contents of one accidentally over us. We were drowned. He gave us tissues and we dried our clothes and emptied our shoes ! He replaced the glass of wine and charged us for both ! We mentioned it to reception before heading out and later when checking out. On both occasions we were met with apologies (which were a bit well practiced, not genuine)  but no gesture of goodwill. I have friends who would have had a free weekend out of it ! We paid up and left.",4,2015,07,22
207,Beauty and Luxury,This is a beautifully maintained hotel established in the 1800's...being a Marriott the beds are so comfy you never want to get up. There is a very nice gym and breakfast is excellent. The larger of the two bars is the place for locals to see and be seen.,5,2015,07,21
207,Birthday surprise,"My gorgeous wife took me away on a surprise birthday weekend to Dublin.

What a pleasant surprise when we arrived at the Shelbourne Hotel. The staff are excellent and they make sure that your stay is pleasurable. 

We ate at the hotel over the weekend and the food was spectacular. The rooms were absolutely gorgeous and made for a fantastic birthday weekend 

Our cab driver was fantastic and full of Irish charm. Just wish I could recall his name.

Absolutely Brilliant",5,2015,07,21
207,Excellent,"Excellent in all ways. Staff very helpful and friendly, room had everything you need to make your stay comfortable and service was seemless with attention to ever detail. Really enjoyed the cocktails and the afternoon tea was the best I have experienced. Will definitely return",5,2015,07,20
207,Luxury in Dublin,"My boyfriend and I recently visited Dublin for a quick weekend trip, and spent a night in The Shelbourne. I should preface this with we had just completed an extremely rainy 2-day bus tour of the countryside of Ireland, and had spent the previous night in a hostel in Galway. Needless to say, we were really looking forward to the Shelbourne. Upon check-in, the employee checking us in was so accomodating, even bumping us into a nicer room since it was later in the day and we were clearly freezing cold and miserable. The room itself was beautiful, and most importantly, the shower was wonderful. It was a bit expensive for our taste, but was worth the splurge this time. Thank you!",5,2015,07,20
207,Afternoon Tea what a delight,Excellent afternoon tea what a delightful setting. Room truly elaborately furnished with added touch of pianist playing throughout your sitting. Food delicious and superbly presented. Staffs respectful efficiency outstanding.  Only one unfortunate noticeable downside I would like management to consider is increasing the length of time provided between each sitting. Ladies do like to chat.  They take the time to present themselves impeccably dressed for what is an afternoon event and to be able to relax over your treat would be very much appreciated.  I feel so strongly about this that I would have to reconsider if I would go back or consider giving a gift to someone because of the limited time at the table.  1hour 30 minutes is definitely not sufficient time. Sorry.,5,2015,07,19
207,Great Hotel!,"This is a beautiful hotel.  Breakfast was great and very nice, and the bed was comfortable.  The service was very good as well.  The staff was very nice.  You have to walk about five minutes to get to the shops and so for that reason it is a peaceful place to stay.  I like how they show who all the famous people that have stayed there including Princess Grace. It looks like a perfect place to have a wedding. This hotel should be ranked in the top 5 in Dublin as opposed to the top 20.",5,2015,07,17
207,Top Notch,"We started our tour of Ireland here, and a more gracious start, I can't imagine.  We arrived in the wee hours yet they found us a lovely room and got us situated long before expected check in time.  I needed a current converter and the concierge was quick to accommodate.  Breakfast was amazing...tea was lovely and the bar (while we didn't get a chance to visit) was reported to us by other locals as the place to see and be seen if you should care to meet any celebs or local politicians.  All, in all, a wonderful stay. Lots of history, beautifully appointed, and excellent location adjacent to beautiful Green Park and shopping on Grafton Street.  City hop-on-hop-off tour buses queue up directly across the street.",5,2015,07,16

Very welcoming staff, always ready to assist and the hotel is beautiful, the rooms nice and clean and furnished to a very high standard, the breakfast buffet offered an excellent choice and the restaurant was beautiful! Quality of food great and High Tea an experience in itself !! It is close to the city centre, theaters and restaurants within walking distance - all in all - absolutely superb!!",5,2015,07,16
207,Magnificent hotel with historic notability!,"Stayed at the Shelbourne in May and it was a truly lovely experience. The room was spacious and well furnished and the bath tub was a deliciously relaxing experience! 

We had specifically booked the Shelbourne to do a bit of ghost hunting as legend has it as a haunted location. Although many of the employees claimed to be unaware of any supernatural presence, several were more than happy to share stories of ""Mary"", the child ghost said to inhabit the residence. Unfortunately we didn't experience any paranormal visitations but the stay was a memorable experience none the less.  

The house cocktail, known as the 27 was amazing, dangerously tasty and potent! The service was excellent and the staff is professional yet friendly.  We also enjoyed roaming the floors and viewing rooms of historical importance.  The location is surrounded by pubs and restaurants and St. Stephen's Green across the street is stunning. I would highly recommend the Shelbourne and look forward to returning.",5,2015,07,15
207,Elegant but not without fault,"My friend and I stayed here for a concert recently,we are both mid forties.We found the gentleman in reception to be a little pretentious but I'm sure this will change with age and experience.The location of this hotel is ideal for shopping,sightseeing and going to matches or concerts.I love it's history and general elegance.Our room was lovely with two double beds and very nice shower products.I did expect a Nespresso machine but instead there was a basic kettle and instant coffee.Our beds were not turned down that night  but what was most annoying was that our clock radios alarm went off at seven in the morning which we didn't set.The coffee at breakfast was very poor so bad that we left the hotel and bought one at the cafe down the street.",4,2015,07,15
207,Charming hotel with a superb location,"This place is top notch.  Really friendly and helpful staff.  The hotel itself is gorgeous.  The best part about this hotel though, is its location.  You are right near St. Stephens Green, several pubs, and shopping.",5,2015,07,14
207,Great 5 * hotel but 1 *Customer Service,"Recently, stayed at the Shelbourne with a large party.  Hotel was lovely and service while we were there was great.  However, upon returning home I realised I had been over charged by a significant amount.  I contacted the Shelbourne repeatedly for 2 months and I found the reception staff plus the front office manager not only unhelpful but very reluctant to accept responsibility for something that was their fault.  Eventually, after many tiresome phone calls and emails I had to personally go into the hotel with my bank statements in order to be refunded.  Very disappointing and unsatisfactory service for what is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.",2,2015,07,13
207,No view,A old hotel that has been renovated.  No view from room unless you call looking into an office building next door a view.  Great location in Dublin across from park and walking distance to Temple Bar area.   Good restaurants on premises.  Staff very friendly and attentive,3,2015,07,13
207,Holiday at the Shelbourne,"Elegant hotel. Very comfortable.
Great service. Rooms are very nice.  Walking distance to many fun bars and restaurants.  Interesting visual in the reception area of famous people who have stayed at the hotel.  Food was very good. Dress is business smart. ",4,2015,07,12
207,Amazing hotel with brilliant facilities ,"I stayed here with my family, with adjacent rooms. Great room size, clean, modern and equipped with television, mini-fridge and a safe. Standard things for a hotel. The bathroom was pristine and nice. Breakfast was delicious and varied. The pool and spa were especially pleasant. All of the staff were attentive and welcoming. The hotel is situated in the middle of the city so it was convenient for walking round Dublin. 
A brilliant visit and would love to come again!",5,2015,07,12
207,Truly fantastic experience,Truly fantastic experience.  The service is amazing. The staff are so friendly and welcoming.  It is a 5 star plus experience. Rooms are beautifully decorated. Bathrooms are spacious and luxurious. Check is staff are so professional and well trained.  The breakfast is wonderful with lots of choices and again great service. I valet parked my car and it was ready for me at the allotted time yet no pressure on me to move it. A bottle of water was placed in the car for my journey. Extremely quiet hotel and city centre location is very handy for dinner and entertaining. I will be back. ,5,2015,07,12
207,"Good, but less 'historical' than one might expect...","My wife and I stayed here for two nights to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary.

The good: every bit the 5 star hotel experience, all the staff were excellent, and we were upgraded to a Deluxe room with a balcony (but no view). Room was a good size, bed very comfortable indeed, linen very high quality. Good free WiFi.

The less good: we booked the Shelbourne hoping for the experience of staying in a historical hotel from the Georgian era (as I am sure many people do). However, the historic front of the hotel contains a very small percentage of the bedrooms (those branded 'Heritage' and charged at significantly higher rates). The vast majority of the rooms are in the sprawling '60s (I would guess) buildings hidden behind the front of the hotel. 

The rooms here are really like you would find in any modern 5 star hotel; relatively low ceilings, obviously no period features, indistinguishable from any of the many other 5 star hotels we have stayed in around the world. 

This is a nice hotel, and one I would return to. However, if you are looking for a 'historical' stay you might be disappointed. There seemed to be little of the historical character one might expect; we were constantly very conscious that we were staying in a Marriott hotel.",3,2015,07,11
207,"Perfect location, food, service, rooms and hospitality.",Not a bad word to say about this astonishing hotel. Extremely pleasant staff and the food was divine. The bed was one of the most comfortable I had ever slept in and it had everything we needed. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone.,5,2015,07,11
207,Lovely and Comfortable Hotel,"The Shelbourne Dublin is a beautiful, historic hotel.  The rooms were clean and comfortable and the restaurant food was good.  We had some very nice cocktails in the hotel bar.  The location is extremely convenient - most everything is within walking distance.  Will definitely be back.",5,2015,07,11
207,Wonderful experience,Went for afternoon tea - this was a fabulous experience from start to finish.  We were welcomed into the room and we were given a lovely seat by the big bay window.  The staff were so friendly and welcoming.  The food was gorgeous and so well presented - loved the Prncess Grace Handbag and Scarf.  I highly recommend the afternoon tea for a special occasion.  We were made to feel really special and I couldn't commend the attentive staff highly enough.,5,2015,07,11
207,One night stop over in Dublin,"The start of our holiday in Ireland began with a one night stay in the Shelbourne Hotel. We opted for a bit of luxury and were really pleased we did. 
On arrival we were greeted by very friendly, courteous staff who went ut of their way to make us feel welcome.
Our room was excellent, the bed really comfortable and the bathroom spacious and spotless. One little niggle, there was only enough toiletries for one person.
The location is perfect for touring Dublin city centre and is quite and peaceful at night.
We were however, extremely disappointed with breakfast. When you consider the charge is over 30 euros per person you might expect it to be reflective of the price. We were surprised to find that virtually all the cooked food had run out. We waited for it to be refreshed and gave up after about 5 minutes. What was available was cold and not very appetising. Now we understand that there are peaks and troughs with guests arriving at their leisure but for the cost per person we felt it should be a lot better.
Having said that we did enjoy our stay and next time we will forgo the breakfast in the hotel.",4,2015,07,11
207,Traditional Dublin hotel in a great location,"We had great expectations for this hotel, having watched the TV documentary and what with it being a Dublin institution. Arrival was very pleasant, with valet parking at the door, and check-in was friendly and efficient. We stayed in a Heritage Premium room, which was in all honestly smaller than we'd expected and our 'view' was onto an office block but it was beautifully decorated and offered all the usual mod-cons. We were somewhat surprised that although we'd paid 450euro for the room, we were advised that our package did not include either the nightly turn-down service or complimentary newspapers delivered to our door, which we thought was a bit of a poor show; both for the price of the room and the fact that this is a 5-star hotel. As our package was room only and breakfast was 29 euro per person, we decided to eat at the Starbucks just a few feet from the hotel instead, so we can't comment on the hotel breakfast (NB: we enjoyed a quite acceptable breakfast in Starbucks for 12 euros, all in). Staying at The Shelbourne was definitely an experience and it was interesting to see the museum, and learn about the hotel's history, and I understand the bar is the 'place to be' to rub shoulders with Dublin's glitterati. However, we felt a bit deflated by the whole experience and definitely weren't 'wowed' by our stay. With so many great 5-star hotels in the city, I'm afraid we won't be staying at The Shelbourne again. It's probably aimed more at Americans and tourists coming from outside of Ireland, and I can see how that market would be more appreciative.",3,2015,07,10
207,Best Hotel in Dublin,"When I walked into The Shelbourne I was greeted with champagne: surrounded by food, drink, and hospitality; and immersed in history including info on the celebrities that had visited there.

Unfortunately, my first day at The Shelbourne Dublin was darkened by every traveler’s worst nightmare: our suitcases had been lost during our transit between Paris and Ireland. When I told the hotel personnel of my woes, they contacted the airport and proceeded to monitor the status of our missing valises for the next two days until they had been found and retrieved for us. On top of that, we had arrived earlier than expected so our rooms were not ready. Instead of having to wait in the lobby for a lengthy period of time with three jet lagged teenagers, they gave us a room for the day as a  “waiting room”.  My husband and I were relieved to have a place to put our carry-on bags; the kids, however, promptly went to sleep.

We had two rooms a double and a king size.  The rooms were very spacious and comfortable.   

The hotel has many great places to dine and relax. One of our favorite was The Lord Manor Lounge with it's afternoon high tea and delicious meals.  Some of my other favorite places in the hotel to dine, drink, unwind, and relax with a nice cocktail were in No. 27 Bar & Lounge and the Horseshoe Bar.   Both are very popular with fashionable locals and attract a smart crowd as the word day winds down.  What a fun bar!

The Shelbourne Hotel has a longstanding history of being one of the best five star hotels in all of Dublin, and I would have to agree.  It is centrally located across from St. Stephen’s Green and is within walking distance to Grafton Street for some shopping.

I would definitely stay here again, next time we are in Dublin.  You can read more about my stay on my site.",5,2015,07,09
207,"Short break, but so worth it","we recently had the pleasure of staying in the Shelbourne on an overnight treat in Dublin. The hotel is ideally located for shopping, sightseeing, relaxing...whatever brings you to Dublin. The staff were so welcoming and polite. The bar food is excellent and the breakfast was one of the best we've had to date. All in all there is a very relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel, where everyone from the doorman in, welcome you with a smile.",5,2015,07,09
207,Great breakfast buffet ,"We had a wonderful weekend here. The hotel and rooms were very impressive. We had dinner in the restaurant and enjoyed the buffet breakfast. It was all very good. Nearby parking and close to everything, The staff were very helpful too. I would stay again in a heartbeat !! ",5,2015,07,08
207,My favorite spot for weekend brunches,The 37 bar is such a great fancy place. Food is good and the best of these brunches are the jazz bands playing. Thanks to them for playing 'ain't gonna kick in the head' at my fiancé's request! A must do!,5,2015,07,08
207,Wonderful staff and great hotel,"Arrived with party of 11, pouring rain, doorman greeted us with umbrellas and got us to the door without getting soaked. This is why I stay at the Shelbourne, great caring people.....we are spoiled there...love the beds, so wonderful altering flying from USA to Dublin.....",5,2015,07,06
207,"Very nice hotel, with a touch of class...","This gem of a hotel was hiding behind scaffolds and construction, but it truly was a lovely stay.  My husband and I had adjoining rooms with our friends and it was positively wonderful.  The room was elegant and comfortable.  I was really impressed with the Grace Kelly display in the lobby.  A museum inside the hotel...  The on-site restaurant offered a decent breakfast.  The staff was so friendly and accommodating.  I enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it.",5,2015,07,06
207,"A beautiful room, the perfect location, AND you get to use your Marriott points","Completely as advertised, just a short walk to the theater and great restaurants, the perfect location to stay a few days in Dublin.  Located across the street from the park, it was a great place to be able to have as your base of operations while you take your walking trips to the Guinness brewery, local shopping, or the city sights.",5,2015,07,06
207,The grand old lady of St. Stephen's Green,"Always a great spot to meet and chat, have a quite coffee, organise a quick business meeting, or just the tip-of-tongue suggestion as to the best place to meet.
I virtually lived at the Shelbourne from October 1986 to April 1987, and as such have been a great observer of all its changes and improvements since then. A place of great nostalgia, scenes from significant movies, and a place of national historic significance. A really important place.
The service ..... does it live up to its historic responsibilities, I have to say a mostly, it certainly does. Is the quality of food presented consistent with the hotel's desire to satisfy its customers...... yes it certainly is.
A truly European hotel in one of the most excellent Dublin settings. The grand old lady of St. Stephen's Green is THE place to visit, at least once while in Dublin, that is if you are not staying there.
Very highly recommended, indeed.",5,2015,07,05
207,Wedding in Style,"I attended a wedding here on the 3rd of July and we had a ball. The food was delicious, the staff amazing and the atmosphere electric. I have to say the night was thoroughly enjoyable.
Towards the end of the night I discovered I had lost a diamond from my engagement ring. Logic dictated that it was gone forever but I suppose I thought that I should mention it to the banqueting management on the off chance someone spotted something shiny when cleaning. Danny was so nice, he took my number and said he'd keep an eye out for me. I went home believing that I would NEVER hear from him again. However the next evening I received a call from Danny stating one of the staff had found it!!!! 
What an amazing turn of events. I collected it today and I just want to sing the praises of all the staff there especially Danny, Thank you so much you helped my find a priceless piece of my life x",5,2015,07,05
207,Well looked after,"Took a while to realise that if something was not available then all you needed to do was ask and it would be done.
Valet parking was ace.
Hotel very comfortable, but next stay will be in a Queen room ",5,2015,07,05
207,A wedding beyond all expectations!,"How do you start when something is perfect? I am the mother of the groom. My son and daughter-in-law were married at The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin on June 21st, 2015. From the time the venue was being considered, to the time the happy couple checked out of the hotel the day after the wedding, we reveled in a six star experience. Cathy O'Shea was our dedicated Wedding Consultant and from 18 months prior to the wedding, she was informed, patient, cheerful, reassuring and anticipated every need. She perfectly co-ordinated the other vendors so the wedding flowed seamlessly.The ceremony and the reception and the dinner and the dance and the mid-night supper were all held in the group of rooms called The Adam and Deirdre Suites.The menu tasting, seven months before the wedding was a splendid event in itself. The in-house florist created a spectacle- there was an audible gasp from the guests as they entered for dinner. The ceremony, also held in The Shelbourne Hotel, was conducted by a Humanist Celebrant, Eithne Dempsey. There wasn't a dry eye. Beautifully executed and with total professionalism, and held under a mind blowing floral arch lovingly designed and created by the in-house florists. The couple had hired Celtic Wedding Entertainment, a division of The Irish House Party. Eighty-eight guests from seventeen nations took to their feet, after having been presented a mouth watering dinner delivered with flawless service. I could expound further with superlatives - the photo in the couple's suite that greeted them when they finally did make it to their room, the bagpiper greeting them as they returned after their photos, the sheer elegance of The Shelbourne Hotel itself. When something is perfect- well it just is. I would shout it to the highest rooftops! You will not go wrong if you choose The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin as your wedding venue.",5,2015,07,05
207,Gorgeous hotel,"We were on a company trip this last week (June 25-July 3) and spent three nights at the Shelbourne Hotel. The hotel and our room were beautiful, bed extremely comfortable, staff treats you like royalty. Only downside was that our room looked into an office building - but we were not in it except to sleep so really not an issue. Located near wonderful pubs/restaurants, shopping, park across the street.",5,2015,07,04
207,Great Service,"Hotel is in great location, food is excellent and staff are very helpful.
Top quality hotel and to top it all Elemis products in bathroom (my absolute favourite brand) Lobby area smells amazing and you can buy the scented candles.",5,2015,07,03
207,5 Star Heritage Hotel in Excellent Location,"A beautiful historic 5 star hotel opposite Stephen's Green Park in an excellent location for a visit to Dublin. This hotel offered everything expected of a 5 star hotel. The service was excellent, the room and bathrooms were spacious and well appointed and the breakfast was very good. The gym and pool where of an especially high standard for a hotel in a large city. This is important to us as we like to maintain an exercise regime on holidays.  As with all 5 star hotels, if you can afford it, it is probably worthwhile opting for something other than the basic rooms which although luxurious are often rather small with dismal views of lane ways or alleys.  On this occasion I was part of a group and did not personally make the booking but I think we had a deluxe room which offered a spacious bathroom and bedroom with larger bed and a bright and cheerful view of an inner large courtyard area. This was perfect for our stay as we spent most of our time out and about. However if I returned I may decide to upgrade to a room with a view over the park. As others have mentioned there was work being done at the hotel and one of our party had workmen outside their window all day. This would not have bothered us but if you wanted to sleep in or sleep during the day or even spend time in the room then the noise and privacy aspect would have been an issue. The entrance areas to the hotel were beautiful and I would have liked more time to spend in the bar or having afternoon tea. Dublin is a great city to visit - history, ambiance, great food and bars and easy to get around. We only spent 3 days in Dublin so only scratched the surface. But can recommend the Guinness Tour (if you are like us you can skip through the tour pretty quickly and enjoy the fantastic view and free Guiness (so much better than the Guiness I have tried in a can) on tap in the rooftop bar overlooking Dublin), the historical walking tour and the literary pub crawl.Although we are in our 60s we enjoyed live music in the Temple Bar area - particularly the Quay Bar. If you can make an advance booking for dinner at Chapter One Restaurant - a one Michelin star restaurant - with delicious fresh food and a lively atmosphere - not too pretentious - probably the best meal we had over a month period in Europe including 3 other Michelin star restaurants (see separate review). If you are a coffee tragic like me I can recommend 3Fe for very good coffee. We decided to come earlier and spend an extra night in Dublin. As the Shelbourne was booked out we stayed at Buswells Hotel a short distance away. Obviously not as luxurious but a very comfortable hotel that would provide a good value for money place to stay when visiting Dublin. Do visit Dublin and if you can stay at the Shelbourne hotel - it will add that special touch to your visit",4,2015,07,03
207,Very Nice,"The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin was beautiful, the staff very nice and helpful, and our rooms/bathrooms gorgeous.  My only complaint was our view was of construction people walking by our window on the second floor and hammering from 8-5:00.",4,2015,07,02
207,Fab,Beautiful hotel and very friendly staff. Felt very welcome from moment we arrived. Wish we had more than 1 night. Very clean and amazing bathroom. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to treat themselves,5,2015,07,02
207,Totally 5 star worthy,"The people there was so kind and friendly, they welcomed us as soon as we got to the door. The hotel itself has so much history and is in the heart of the city, across from the Viking splash, St. Stephan's park and near Grafton street, and more. This hotel is totally 5 stars.",5,2015,07,01
207,Gorgeous Place,"Was only in Dublin for two days but spent a lot of those two days in the Shelbourne
Fantastic place, great atmosphere, high quality food and drink and very good staff.
Had a brunch with drinks there one day and then cocktails the same evening, then the following day had more drinks in the bar followed by the afternoon tea.
I had arranged the afternoon tea for my partners birthday - the quality of the food and drink was excellent as was the complimentary birthday plate presented to him.
Brunch was gorgeous - my partner had the mussells and I had eggs benedict, both delicous.
A number of bottles of Moet were also consumed - not the cheapest but very appropriate for the decadent surroundings
Was staying at another 5 star hotel round the corner and wished I had been staying at the Shelbourne - will do on our next visit to Dublin",4,2015,07,01
207,"Fantastic, even during renovations","I took my 22 year old son and his girl friend on a two week vacation through Ireland. 
We started in Dublin and stayed at The Shelbourne, for three days. 
We flew into Dublin airport, and were advised to buy a pass for the jump on jump off bus for three days around Dublin. Passes can be purchased at the airport and include a pass in to Dublin City on the blue bus, from the airport to a block from the hotel. It was a much cheaper option than taking a taxi. 
We were met at the front door by a lovely doorman in a top hat who took our bags and arranged a luggage trolley. 
We were welcomed and escorted to the front desk. 
Check in was quick and easy and while getting our keys we were handed delicious beverages. Very welcoming touch. 
This hotel is first class, we noticed the renovations as we walked the block over. 
Our room faced out to an area where work was being done, but we never heard a sound. 
We were there during the bank holiday weekend. Arriving on a Thursday afternoon. Our room was ready and our luggage was brought up. 
Our room was well appointed with two queen beds. Extremely comfortable. Converters for USA phones, curling irons, hair dryers and computers. 
Wifi was free, and we googled to find great Restaurants in the area. Bathroom was spacious. Extra towels and shampoo were provided. 
The kids used the gym a few days. I did not although, I did go look at the pool area. Very nice. 
I did not use the spa either as we were out most days. But, talking to other guests they said, it was well worth the money. 
We had delicious sandwiches at the bar the first evening and then went out to walk around the city. The hotel is conveniently located across from St. Stephen's  Greene. Shopping, Restaurants, clubs, pubs, tour buses. 
Later we went for a steak dinner at Marco Pierre White. Very good. (See review) 
And, afterwards walked to a club where we had drinks and danced. 
Upon returning to the hotel we had Champagne in the bar with a few guests. 
Day 2- was spent visiting the Guinness factory. And, the Dublin Zoo, and Phoenix Gardens. Plus lunch at a quaint pub. We also tried to see the prison, but the tours did not fit our schedule. 
After some brief shopping we ran into a young man that told the kids the Foo Fighters were in town. We looked into tickets only to find out it was a sold out show. 
Then another young man recommended they try the Forbidden Fruit Festival. 
The kids knew some of the bands and DJ's 
So they purchased tickets to go later the next day. 
We had dinner that night in the hotel. I highly recommend the fish chowder. 
Kids loved the burgers and chicken sandwiches. 
We then asked the front desk for casinos, as we enjoy a bit of gambling. 
We were directed to a gaming hall a few blocks away and we walked over. I would not recommend that place to anyone. It was a small place with shabby interior, shakey tables, and rough looking characters. 
We left after a few minutes, but not before paying an entrance fee. I was surprised we were directed to this place by the Shelbourne. 
We actually grabbed a cab and the cab driver took us to another casino that was so much nicer. Clean, with security. 
We played for two hours. No real luck and went for drinks. 
Day3- was spent shopping and then the kids got ready for the concert. I was going to do the High tea in the hotel, only to see a sign that required formal wear. 
Since, I had not packed anything fancier that black slacks and a few blouses, I decided that I did not have the right outfit, so walked around the hotel. Had a glass of wine and walked around St Stephen's Greene until dinner time. 
The Resturant at the hotel was packed. I asked a hostess for a table and she said,""Oh, you may sit anywhere the tables are meant to be shared."" 
Since it was mostly groups I did not feel comfortable just sitting at a table with strangers. 
So, I waited in the lobby until the rush slowed down. I witnessed a beautiful wedding party coming in and once again engaged the hostess in conversation. I told her about wanting to have high tea, but did not have formal clothes. She replied,""Oh, they just do not want people in track suits"" 
I was so upset I missed the opportunity to have the experience, just because of a sign that is not property worded. (That needs to be changed) 
day 4- we packed and had breakfast and checked out of the hotel. Another quick process. The luggage was brought down and loaded into our car for our trip to Donegal. 
All in all, this was a fantastic hotel and I will definitely be back. 
We loved it.",5,2015,07,01
207,"High Profile Luxury, Currently Under Scaffolding","The Shelbourne has an excellent location, next to St. Stephen's Green, and within easy walking distance of nice shopping and restaurants, as well as Trinity College. An old Dublin institution (the Irish constitution was written there), it has become a bit of a tourist attraction.  If you want a more quiet and discreet location, consider the Merrion.  

We stayed in Room 442, which was gracious and very large, positioned over the main entrance.  It is one of the only single rooms (as opposed to suites) on this side of the hotel, clearly a prime location.  It gets a little street noise but nothing bothersome.  Happily, there were no sounds at all from the rest of the hotel - very well sound-insulated.  The room offered thoughtful touches (fresh flowers; mother-of-pearl inlaid soap dish; effective blackout curtains; Nespresso coffee pod machine, etc.). 

The hotel was under scaffolding, which apparently led the management to sell large blocks of rooms (those associated with the scaffolded areas) at a discount.  While we were having afternoon tea, a tour bus group arrived, and the staff lined the lobby to greet them, applauding the travelers down a red carpet.  This scene took about 20 minutes to complete.   

I wouldn't dine at the hotel; dinner was very expensive but service was spotty and slow.  The wine list and decor in the dining room are lackluster (large sections are windowless).  The unfortunate dining room (which doubles as the breakfast room) is offset by a gorgeous bar and an ornately elegant tea room. The hotel also offers a spa, a barber shop, and a small museum of its history.",4,2015,06,30
207,Wow hotel with gorgeous view of park,"We had a beautiful and spacious corner room with a view of St. Stephens Green park.  Extra sitting room and large closet.  Request a room with a view of the park.  Walking distance to great shopping, restaurants and sightseeing.  Superior hospitality, beautiful old world hotel with modern amenities.  Great restaurant suggestions from Concierge.  Yummy breakfast.  Friendly staff.  Currently undergoing some renovation.  Request a room away from scaffolding.  Quick dry cleaning and laundry service.",5,2015,06,30
207,Great location,"This is my second time to stay here both times great service, love the bar great buzz and lovely bar food.The location is brilliant and first time we stayed was around Christmas and the hotel was decorated beautifully.room was lovely and staff very helpful.",5,2015,06,30
207,Elegance,A wonderful hotel in the heart of Dublin opposite St Stephens Green Park and close to the shops.  You are welcomed warmly and there are always staff on hand in the entrance area to assist.  Room was very comfortable with a very large bathroom and well furnished.  The only downside was the scaffolding outside as there are currently works going on on the hotel facade - the works did not however disturb me but could if some needed an afternoon nap.  Excellent breakfast and well appointed Gym.  Will definitely return.,5,2015,06,30
207,Ideal spot. All worthy of the praise.,"I messed up reservations at The Mark. My bad, but likely our gain. To be in a town such as Dublin in a new, modern hotel seems like we would have missed something. The old world character of the Shelbourne as well as the fine hospitality was wonderful. Our rooms had no views, but no matter. ",4,2015,06,28
207,Great hotel location,"The best thing about the hotel is it's location to shopping and restaurants and tour buses pick up right across the street.  The hotel is historic and along with that comes historic decor and rooms.  It is very important you choose or ask about your room location.  The first night we stayed there we got a room on the first floor at the back of the hotel.  The view was of an alley next to a pub so we heard kegs being moved around and garbage trucks all night when the window was open.  The air did not work and since we couldn't open the window, it made the room very hot.  We got moved to another room in the front of the hotel the next day with the air working and actually got some rest.  The bathroom sinks were slow to drain.  The hotel staff is very helpful and friendly.  The afternoon tea is a nice experience to take advantage of.",3,2015,06,27
207,Princess Grace afternoon tea,"10/10 !  Yum savouries, delicious patisserie, scones light as a feather. Impressed with the teapot warmer. Great service. Piano music super. Lovely ambience. 
What more could 2 gals ask for?! 
Hence my 5stars !",5,2015,06,27
207,Beautiful Classic Hotel,What a beautiful classic hotel.  Our room was absolutely beautiful and the service was great.  The location could not be better - right in Central Dublin.  The food in the restaurants was delicious and we loved the main hotel bar.,5,2015,06,26
207,Very disappointed,Having stayed at the hotel before I decided to book a long weekend in April for our wedding anniversary. I booked the hotel way back in November and stressed in the e-mail that it was a speical trip for us. Our room was fine but our meal to celebrate our anniversary in the saddle room was dreadful. Our food was bland and the service was so bad I had to get up from our table to serve our own wine. I was then advised that the hotel did not have the dessert wine we wanted. We made our concerns known when we checked out and they took the price of our wine off the bill. The hotel made no effort to make our anniversary speical despite knowing about it. I very much doubt we will return which is such a shame.,2,2015,06,26
207,"Great location, service and historic, too!","I had a chance to stay there on my last day in Dublin. It was perfect (and I don't use that term lightly.) Nice welcome. Good, fast efficient check in. Solid directions to where I was going in the morning. Room was great. 

I had an early appointment out of the hotel that clashed with the start of breakfast. Ordered breakfast for 6 AM (slight, but fair delivery charge) and it arrived right on time. 

Room very comfortable. Hotel is 191 years old. Check it out.",5,2015,06,26
207,Beautiful old hotel with excellent service,"The Shelbourne is a wonderful place to stay in Dublin across the street from beautiful St. Stephen's Green, one of our favorite city parks in the world.  The hotel has very nice and comfortable rooms, some with good views and others without, with excellent amenities.  Very nice tea and good dining in the hotel, although our favorite place in the hotel is the Horseshoe Bar.  Like many 5-star hotels in any city, The Shelbourne has its share of snooty guests, but we always find the staff to be welcoming and helpful, which is one of the main reasons we like to return when we are in Dublin.  Good but not a great location for dining and pubs, but Temple Bar is a short cab ride if you don't want to walk 10 minutes or so.",5,2015,06,22
207,"Nice hotel, but overall disappointing on this occasion","Stayed here at the Shelbourne a few weeks ago, for a weekend. It is a nice hotel and has the reputation as being one of the Grand Dame hotels in Dublin. The room was comfortable, but I must report that I had some disappointing experiences. I stay in hotels all the time for both business and leisure and felt that this hotel could have better lobby/foyer facilities for overnight guests. I decided to explore the hotel on the Saturday afternoon. I usually like to relax in the lobby or the bar. Both bars were full and there were few available seating areas for guests staying in the hotel. When I went to explore the Lord Mayors lounge, that too was full of patrons having afternoon tea. I know it is a famous meeting spot for locals during the day, but given there was nowhere to go, other than your room I eventually ended up leaving the hotel and heading down to the Westbury Hotel. I didnt return to the hotel until late that night as I went to the theatre after the Westbury. The next morning at check out, I was charged for dinner and wine in the restaurant erroneously. Given I didnt get the opportunity to spend time at the Shelbourne other than to sleep and have breakfast, this came as some surprise to me. I had to persuade the reception staff that I did not have dinner in the restaurant, they eventually realised that another guest had given a wrong room number and did remedy the situation. I always believe in giving praise where praise is due. I also stay in hotels on a regular basis. However, while the room was comfortable and breakfast excellent, overall, I have to stay that it was a disappointing experience on this occasion. ",3,2015,06,21
207,really lovely,real luxury here everything about this hotel top notch greal location fab food service exceptional all in all out of this world we would definite go back we ate here lovely food in great surroundings idyllic the whole area around the hotel is great ideal for good walks less than a mile from the city centre,5,2015,06,21
207,World Class,"We stayed at the Shelborne Hotel in Dublin for four nights for a wedding at a location on Stephens Green.  We traveled here from New York and this was our first visit to Irleand.  The hotel was amazing.  Beautiful building, impeccable cleanliness and maintenance and the location was perfect for shopping and sight seeing.  There is a tour bus stop right in front that loops the city and is easy on and off.  The entire staff were gracious, friendly, and professional.  The rooms were spacious and very comfortable and beautifully decorated. I have stayed in all the New York landmark luxury hotels including the Waldorf, Plaza, Palace and others many times over the past 20 years and really feel like the Shelborne was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever enjoyed.",5,2015,06,20
207,Tea time in the bar. ,"This was my second trip back to the hotel bar for afternoon tea.  Last year I saw the TV show the had done all about the hotel. So I needed to see it for myself.  
     I really enjoy the atmosphere of the hotel and the bar area.  I just order tea and a dessert. ( it is a cake that is to die for).  It looks like a tiramisu but it coffee flavored.  Highly recommend it.  It will add a photo.  
     I find everyone in the hotel very pleasant.   I will continue to go back whenever I am in the country.   ",5,2015,06,19
207,A wonderful hotel,"For me this is one of the most impressive hotels in the world. From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty. The staff are attentive without being over bearing. 

Check in was swift and painless. I was standing waiting my turn as a few people were checking in at once when an older couple pushed past and went straight up to check in. No fault of the hotel but maybe the doormen could have told them to wait behind me for their turn? While I waited I was given a really lovely glass of homemade lemonade to taste.

Our room was amazing!! We had a newly refurbished premium heritage room and as my photos show it was stunning. Thank you so much to Peter in guest relations for his help in organising our trip, you know all you did. At the last moment I asked for a fridge, it was organised at once with no issue. 

Breakfast in the saddle room is possibly the most luxurious breakfast I have ever had. If I had one complaint I would say the Shelbourne eggs Benedict is far too big, 1 egg and piece of steak would be loads, the taste was amazing though. The pancakes and bacon was fab. I would also say as a coffee drinker the coffee at breakfast isn't great and let's down everything else. In this day and age I expect freshly brewed coffee not percolated coffee that has been sitting a while. That said the coffee pots are so pretty maybe it'd be a shame to lose them.

The Horse shoe bar is very relaxing. We had a lovely couple of hours in there on our first night. 

The cost of parking is a bit crazy but all else is value for money.

Overall spend the money you won't regret it. It's a fab hotel, steeped in history and they are so willing to help with anything you need. Take 10 minutes to visit the in house museum it gives a great insight to the hotel and Irish history.",5,2015,06,19
207,Anniversary Celebration,"A uniquely service oriented hotel, The Shelbourne is in the hub of Dublin. Every need and every want is catered to. To recognize our 45th anniversary, Peter Cooke  of customer relations ,sent lovely sweets and sodas on a Happy Anniversary decorated plate.  At this hotel you can actually get a LIVE person for a wake up call or phone number. The staff was of great help when my husband left his phone, heaven forbid, in a cab!! Life is wonderful at The Shelbourne.",5,2015,06,19
207,Lunch in the Bar ,"While the service is spotty and slow, the ambience and food is worth it.  Sit in the window and watch the world go by as you enjoy a smart lunch in style. Start with oysters on the half shell, although they also do Rockefeller; and move on from there.  A burger and the Grace Kelly salad are terrific. 
And just sit with your beer and wine for an hour and rest your feet a while.   ",5,2015,06,19
207,Was a bit disappointed ,"I stayed here two nights and upgraded my room to a suite and was not that impressed. I have stayed in nicer Marriotts in the U.S. that weren't as expensive. It was nice don't get me wrong but I don't see the 5 Star rating it has. Breakfast was ok, nothing great about it, the Internet was extremely slow, and the television (which I don't usually watch but did while here) had scratches and black spots on the LED s reen which made the viewing kind of bad. I would recommend a B&B instead.",3,2015,06,19
207,Mother and daughter's journey for preparations for wedding in September.,"enjoyed The Elegance and Grace Afternoon Tea today made all the more special with the wonderful and beautiful service from Imelda,Adam and Lenka. Polite and always with a smile. Wonderful. Louise &. Linda.",5,2015,06,18
207,Luxurious and Central,"Friendly hotel staff, luxurious bedrooms, prime and central location within walking distance to nearby malls.  Heritage building with one the BEST breakfast dining you can find in Europe.

We were surprised with a really huge marble bathroom.",5,2015,06,16
207,"Fabulous stay, but ever so slightly disappointed","The Shelbourne is one of those iconic places, that you've dreamed about staying in - plush, indulgent, extravagant and normally out of my league, however, got the opportunity to stay recently, and I think I feel cheated by the experience, but that's primarily my own doing.  I had such high expectations, reality fell somewhat short.
Arrived in style with a limo transfer, what a treat!  Door man took our bags and escorted us to reception, which, if you're wandering in yourself, is a bit hidden.  And there we waited for more than 10 minutes to check-in.  And the room wasn't ready, which was fine as we were a bit early and we were happy to go and have a drink in the bar.
The bar is delightful, the table staff are pleasant and friendly, but the bar staff are slow and not exactly friendly, they weren't rude either, just a bit surly.  It wasn't a busy weekend when we were there, maybe 5 guests to 1 member of staff, yet we still waited ages for a barman to take our order.
Room was adequate if small for Irish standards, 4-star only, with good linen, complimentary shampoo etc, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Plus, as this is an old building, the room was quite a trek from the lifts.  
Had lunch the next day before leaving, it was fine, but sadly nothing spectacular and it's expensive for what you're getting.  Service for Sunday lunch was better than the previous day and the live Jazz was good.
There is nothing wrong with this hotel, I love it! It's old, a bit quirky, a bit posh, a bit grand but I didn't leave there dreaming about my next stay.  Dublin has a plethora of good hotels, and there are several that would be better, which makes me sad.",4,2015,06,15
207,Excellent,Spent one night at the Shelbourne and left relaxed and very content. Fine bedroom with huge marbled bathroom and plenty of toiletries. Best oysters I have ever tasted at the bar and excellent breakfast. Noel Sainsbury,5,2015,06,12
207,What a wonderful old lady.,"I was part of a large group that stayed at the Shelbourne at the end of May for a work conference.  Everything about the hotel was wonderful from the service, to the food, to the ambience and the Horseshoe bar.  We all loved our stay",5,2015,06,12
207,Excellent Full Service Marriott ,Had an excellent stay on points back in November when I was there for the Ireland v South Africa rugby game. The hotel is located in the middle of Dublin so you are never far from something to do. The staff is attentive and the rooms are superb. We will definitely stay here again when we are in Dublin.,5,2015,06,10
207,A beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin!,"This was my favourite overnight stay on a recent business trip to Europe. From start to finish the hospitality shown by all the staff was world class. Even though it's a very old hotel, the rooms are modern and very comfortable. The food is slightly on the expensive side but really good in quality. Recommend for anyone travelling to Dublin for a touch of luxury.",5,2015,06,10
207,VERY GOOD,"The hotel was excellent however I was very disappointed in the room size. The room did not have a bath and there was very little storage space. i felt that this room was better suited to single occupancy and not for a couple.

207,First night in Dublin,"Wow, absolutely stunning Hotel.
First class all the way. Beds are so comfy I did not want to get out of bed in the morning. Had drinks and fish & chips in the bar, also very nice. Pub was crazy busy. Our room was on 8th floor and we enjoyed the breakfast in the club lounge. Would recommend this hotel to anyone that is not on all fixed budget.
Cheers",5,2015,06,09
207,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"This was a lovely warm and comfortable hotel in an excellent location. During check in, we were offered homemade lemonade. Our room was easy to locate and reasonable close to the lift. We had to leave very early next morning before the restaurant served breakfast but breakfast was available in our room for a small extra charge and that worked well.
      ",5,2015,06,09
207,Afternoon tea,"Booked afternoon tea with my daughter here a couple of weeks ago. It was a wonderful experience  great service and attention to detail a lovely old world feeling in the room beautiful food and teas topped off with a glass of divine champagne . It was a very special occasion . Lovely piano  
Being played in the background . down side would be that you only get a one and half hour slot for your tea 
If meeting with an old friend I would need much longer to linger over afternoon tea
Notwithstanding highly recommend 
My daughter promises to pay next time😇",5,2015,06,09
207,"Lovely, convenient location","My husband and I stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights.  We got to Dublin around 11 AM after an overnight flight from the US, we asked if our room would be available.  The room was not ready; the front desk said that they were very busy and would call us when the room became available but in no case later than 3 PM.  We were able to leave our luggage in a back area.  Needless to say, the hotel did not call us.  We were pretty tired and so around 3:30 PM we went back to the hotel to ask about getting a room.  The room was ready and they could not understand why nobody had called us.  We asked for our luggage and found that someone had moved it without telling the front desk staff.  A few very anxious minutes.  Then one of the two bags was found.  More anxiety and then the last bag arrived at the room.  The rest of the stay was finew, although on our second day there, we returned to the room at 4:30 PM and the room had not been serviced.  All the staff were very nice, particularly the concierge, Mitch, who arranged for our dinner at two excellent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.  The room, particularly the bathroom, was very spacious.  We had dinner at the restaurant on our first night there; food was excellent.  Ditto the complimentary Irish breakfast each morning.  Location was great in that you could walk to lots of things.  One more negative: no free wi-fi.",4,2015,06,09
207,Luxury and understated too.,A surrprise and the most pleasant one indeed.  Easily one of the most luxurious hotels I have stayed in.  Staff very attentive.  Breakfast superb. I felt I was special.  Room only lacking Internet radio to keep me in touch with home but that is possibly an excessive demand.,5,2015,06,09
207,Wedding Anniversary,After staying here for one night myself and my husband have promised ourselves we will make a stay here a yearly event. From when we walked in the front door we fell in love with the place. There is too much to list but the room was fabulous (though no great view) and we loved both bars. Well worth a stay if you want to treat yourself.,5,2015,06,09
207,Absolutely Top Class,"This was my second time visiting The Shelbourne and it was just as good as the first. This really is a top class hotel which is full of character and is oozing with class. The service is second to none and you are made to feel really special from the second you check in.

The rooms are very well appointed and are decorated to a lovely standard. Our bathroom was huge, almost as big as the room and again was faultlessly appointed.

I highly recommend the Jazz brunch at the weekend as well as the afternoon tea which was pretty good, although we were made to wait a good 10 minutes past our reservation time before we could actually sit down. Breakfast was also a real highlight with a large buffet as well as A la carte included in the price. 

Location wise, the hotel couldn't be better. Right opposite St. Stephen's Green and only around a 5 minute walk to Grafton street. Best of all, it is no distance at all to the legendary O'Donoghue's pub. 

A highly recommended stay and I will definitely be staying again in the future.",5,2015,06,09
207,afternoon delight on a friday,"we have been trying out different afternoon teas, we booked for 2.45 and arrived early, and where seated upon our arrival. we decided to have prossecco which arrived in lovely clean glassware( im a bit of a freak when it comes to glassware) the afternoon tea itself was just divine. Freshly made sandwiches and pastries just as you would expect from the shelbourne. Service was efficient and unrushed and most importantly our server who I didn't catch her name was friendly and smiling.
 I would thoroughly recommend this afternoon tea

207,Honeymoon ,"Gorgeous hotel right in the heart of Dublin. Beautiful rooms and very clean. The bar had great food and excellent service. A highlight for us were the doorman Brian and Damian. They helped us plan our trip around Ireland, obtain wifi and solid advice for what to see and where not to go. They really made our stay memorable. Thanks you two! Would definitely stay at the Shelbourne again!",5,2015,06,08
207,Nice bar,Did not stay at the hotel but did go into the bar for a drink. The décor is lovely and staff are friendly. Food been served in the back ground did look good although expensive. Drink a little more expensive too than the average bar. Free nuts given :) It is a nice place to go to see how the 'other half' live and have a chat. Worth a look.,4,2015,06,07
207,Sooooo disappointing !!!,"I've wanted to stay @ the S B for so long but could never ever afford it until now .. Where do I start?? .. Check in was a long - draaaaawn out process & when we finally got to the room it was OK & our view was ' scaffolding' yea just a crisis cross of metal (as building seems to be an on going thing) However determined to enjoy this much rated hotel we decided to go to the bar to sum for a snack to sum it up staff are so uninterested & would rather txt on the quiets & as we found if your not tipping continuos then service is really bad eg:: we sat @ the bar for nearly an hour waiting on a wee table jus so we could grab a snack & when the 1st became free we hurried over only to be told it was ""reserved"" & to add insult to injury 1 waitress stood over it while another fetched a ""reserved"" sign which took easily 10 mins for her to get ... Unfortunately We did have dinner ... But I really don't have all night to go into detail but to sum-up based on my experience all I can say is try some where else to spend your hard earned cash ... This hotel isn't wort a 10th of the price it cost ... There's soon much better !!!!!!!!!!",2,2015,06,05
207,Sort of a puzzle palace,"Nice enough, with comfortable rooms, but more doors, stairs, doors, turns, alcoves, doors, hallways, doors, etc. than I have seen in a hotel in a long time...  Guess this is character?

Good location across from Stephen's park and a great place to jump onto the hop-on-hop-off buses through Dublin City Center.  Ok restaurant on grounds - but lots of alternatives within a few blocks.",3,2015,06,04
207,"Great Hotel, Wonderful Location","Stayed here during May 2015 on a tour of Ireland.  What a fantastic hotel! The room was very tastefully decorated, the staff were very pleasant and helpful. We didn't dine at the hotel as there are many good restaurants within walking distance or a 5 minute cab ride however we had breakfast each morning which was 10/10. The atmosphere in the bar makes you never want to leave it! The location could not be better, situated on St Stephens Green in the heart if this fine city. Memorable!",5,2015,06,04
207,very relaxing,Stayed here for a night for my birthday this year with my husband. It was just fabulous from the moment we stepped out of our car. Everywhere we went the staff were asking if they could help us. There was a mix up with the room which they changed and apologised about straight away. The bed was so comfortable and a robe was provided too.The breakfast was amazing. They had everything and a menu too. I have always wanted to stay here and it lived up to my expectations but be warned it is expensive! The only down side was that the swimming pool was freezing.,5,2015,06,04
207,Great business hotel,"Great location and nice place for a business stay. Comfy beds, plenty of on-site dining and drinks options, friendly staff, they were extra helpful in dealing with luggage and storage issues. Would hop back over any time!",4,2015,06,03
207,"5- star old-style "" Ritz""-like hotel","This is the epitome of class. Newly renovated with doormen in tuxedos and impeccable service. Rooms are roomy and plush with new bathroom tiles and plenty of space. Best location in Dublin across from St. Stevens Green within walking distance of Grafton Street shops, Book of Kells and Temple Bar. Take a double-decker tour bus across the hotel to see the city and old prison. Eat at ""Fire"" two blocks away. Looks like a modern disco outside but huge cathedral ceilings with stained-glass in restaurant upstairs with great food and tux waiters (waiter Deep was the best). Price is not outrageous. Also recommend dinner in Shelbourne at ""27"" for light fare - very reasonable.",5,2015,06,03
207,1st class,Stayed here at dublin many times this was by far  the best hotel admiterly not the most cheapest but we got a good deal from booking .com  on a b~b basis .£280.00 for two nites .The hotel is grand through out the rooms fantastic the service was nothing was to much trouble breakfast had a vast choice and good produce .Used the conceiage for a trip and again very pleasenent The location is great for grafton st and the other tourist spots are only 10- 20 min walks away di the viking splash tour this time good value for money .Will be going back to dublin again soon this year so  will defaintly use again.One tip use the air bus from the airport 20 euro return not the cabs they will stitch you up  get off at kildare st for the shelbourne 5 min walk around the corner  go on spoil yourself your love it and its history .,5,2015,06,03
207,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful location","This hotel is both historic and recently remodeled.  So the hotel even has a small museum of the many famous guests who have stayed here, but the rooms are modern and up to date.  The rooms have many details showing an incredibly intelligent design.  For example, 2 light switches by the door control almost all the lights in the room -- but there are duplicate sets of those 2 light switches next to **both** sides of the bed, so each guest can control the light banks.  Each side of the bed also has a separate reading light so one person can read late at night with minimal impact on the other person trying to sleep.  The blackout curtains have a valence on the top and sides, so they really work.  There are extra electric outlets to charge mobile electronics at the top of the desk and also by the tops of each nightstand.  There are plenty of drawers in the closet, in a free standing dresser, and the nightstands.  The bathroom had a continuous fan that was loud enough to be a white noise source to block out sounds, but not so loud as to be disturbing.  The heating and air conditioning had **analog** knobs for hot and cold that were easy to use, unlike the weird electronic digital controls in some modern hotels.  The bathroom amenities were quite nice, about the only problem was that the shower controls were a bit confusing.  There is excellent free WiFi.

The hotel is in a great location central to the city and opposite a beautiful park.  The staff was great -- we arrived on Mothers' Day (in the USA), and they arranged for a plate of chocolate strawberries in the room on arrival for my wife.  Sadly, the strawberries disappeared before I thought to take a picture of a beautiful presentation.",5,2015,05,31
207,"Mixed review...first rate room, second rate concierge.","Just a wonderful room, ultra clean and comfortable (we enjoyed a suite with two rooms and adjoining bath), very special accomodations indeed!  Yet, perhaps due to the ongoing construction outside we found the climate control in our room to be quite noisy, a small problem that we ignored.

What we did not like was our experience with the concierge desk.  The first night after we arrived we were looking for some guidance from the concierge on where to walk for a nice pub or bistro meal...the fellow on duty was engaged in a personal cell phone conversation that we were clearly interrupting, he finished his call and rapidly gave us directions to a tacky area of Dublin sporting Hard Rock Cafe and TGIF among others.  This concierge spent about thirty seconds with us and immediately returned to his cell phone.  I'd suggest this fellow be reassigned to an area of the hotel where he won't interact with guests?",5,2015,05,31
207,Afternoon tea,Fantastic experience! Food was delicious. (Princess Grace menu)Staff were so friendly and attentive. Special praise to our waitress Imelda who was excellent. She was so sweet. Will definitely be booking in again!,5,2015,05,30
207,Afternoon tea.,"A memorable experience for all the right reasons. Wonderful hospitality from Niall and Niamh (thank you both) gorgeous food ,beautifully presented in a lovely setting.Looking out on St Stephens green in May sunshine. I have to say it was well worth it and I didn't eat until the next day so well fed too!",5,2015,05,28
207,"Lovely hotel, great location","Had stayed here in 2012, and was very happy to return. 
Our booking was with a balcony request, but no such room was available when we arrived for a five night stay. Front desk staff were most helpful, and did manage to find us a satisfactory room for the first two nights, then a perfect one for the rest of our sojourn.
Some rooms are very small, which can prove quite awkward when the boss and his wife found themselves in a small linen closet while my husband and I were cavorting in a large bright space!
Awesome breakfast, served in room or downstairs. 
Hopping bar, especially crowded at the weekend. 
Perfect location, St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street shopping, Museums, and great food all within a stone's throw. 
Delightful stay, hope to return.",5,2015,05,27
207,Classic hotel and fantastic service. ,"The Shelbourne, retains a classic feel and an elegance of a former age. The hotel has all the modern amenities but maintains a classical charm. 

We stayed for one night on a visit to Dublin. We were kindly upgraded to a suite. Which was wonderful. The room was spacious. The bathroom was great. 

The staff at the hotel are polite and helpful.

The swimming pool is also beautiful. And a real surprise in such an old iconic hotel. The whole  leisure centre and spa are beautiful. 

Would 100% recommend anyone stay here when visiting Dublin. ",5,2015,05,27
207,A lovely hotel,"The hotel has friendly staff, a lovely relaxed atmosphere and the beds are really compfy. It's right in the heart of the city and it lived up to it's name. The breakfast ws plentiful and the cocktails were great!",4,2015,05,27
207,A Night at the Opera,We were going to see Madam Butterfly in the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and decided to stay in town at the Shelbourne Hotel. A lovely experience but for one small matter. At breakfast we were shown through the half empty dining room to the bar to eat. Comfortable for pre theatre cocktails but not for breakfast. It appears this hotel reserves the dining room at breakfast time for parties of 4 or more. Disappointed.,4,2015,05,27
207,"History, location and a great concierge","The  strains of modern Irish history (Constitution written here; military position during the Easter uprising), the faded scents of refined times gone by, and the excellent location on St Stephen's Green all combine to make the Shelbourne the perfect base for exploring Dublin.  Despite suggestions that becoming a Marriott property had resulted in pro forma service, I found the staff to be delightful.  We arrived to an unexpected landslide of visitors (in March?  Who knew?), but the overwhelmed staff at reception quickly sorted our room and whisked us out of the melee.  Later Kevin the concierge recommended a terrific fish restaurant nearby, and made several helpful suggestions for the next morning's wanderings. 
From the Shelbourne it's just a quick jaunt to the National Museum...perfect when your companion has dropped after a long day, and you simply must see the historic treasures!",5,2015,05,27
207,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here recently for two nights and it was a thoroughly enjoyable stay - the hotel is luxurious, the rooms immaculate and beautifully decorated and oh so comfortable.  The bathroom facilities were excellent and with really good quality Elemis toiletries provided.  A fantastic stay in a great location opposite St Stephens Green.",5,2015,05,27
207,Fastastic hotel in the heart of the City!,"The Staff is incredibly attentive! Very courteous and professional. The lemon water and biscuits in the lobby are a nice touch. Lovely, well appointed rooms, that are spacious and quite grand. Super location as well!",5,2015,05,26
207,Comfort and one of the best Afternoon Tea experiences,"The location is just perfect, very close to parks, museums and shopping (the wonderful museum of archeology with its stunning Ireland's gold collection of prehistoric gold is just around the corner). The rooms are comfortable and spacious. The staff is amazing ( they upgraded my room on arrival), the adjecent spa offers an amazing facial, the Elemis Biotec Sonic Skin Radiance, highly recommended!
Another not to be missed experience is their signature afternoon tea, entirely dedicated to Grace Kelly with pastries fashioned after her famous Hermes Kelly Bag, foulard, pearls etc...delicious and fabulous!",5,2015,05,26
207,Great Historic Hotel,"The Shelbourne is hisroric building built around the Victorian time and is full of history.  They have a televison in the lobby that shows many of the movie star, diplomats, Heads of States, etc, that have stayed there and may even show which room they were in.  It is very close to historic sites, shopping, restaurants, and pubs.  It is just across the street from Stephen's Green which is a beautiful park through which you can take a casual or romantic stroll.  My wife and I have stayed there twice and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys staying in historic locations.",5,2015,05,26
207,not the Merrion,"I love the Merrion, but the last time I was in Dublin it was booked, so I decided to stay at the Shelbourne with it's lovely exterior and St Stephen's green location.  The hotel is very nice and has lots of charm, but the service and room quality were so much worse than the Merrion and all for the same price point.  
There were a lot of glitches with check in, the the sink in my room didn't drain.  I called and then asked the front desk and was told they would look into getting it fixed, but they never did (I don't think anyone even looked at it) during my 2 day stay.  Then at check out, there was an extra 600 euro bar tab on my room which they removed but didn't apologize for.
The full Irish breakfast isn't as delicious as the Merrion either.  I would say the best way to enjoy this hotel is for a drink in it's beautiful and busy bar, but sleep somewhere else.",3,2015,05,26
207,Pay the Money,"I went here for my first two days in Dublin. I felt like a queen. Spend the money. I have never been in a nicer place! The breakfast was divine. The service spoiled us like we were Barack and Michele. There were top hats, famous actors staying there. Beautiful furnishings. Free banana bread inn the lobby bar each night. Divine.",5,2015,05,25
207,"One for the ""Bucket List""","We recently had the pleasure of an overnight stay in the Shelbourne Hotel.  From the minute we arrived at the front door, until we left the next day, we were treated like royalty.  The staff here go way above expectations of service.  On check in, we were given a refreshing glass of fresh lemonade, and because our stay was for a special occasion we received a Complimentary Room Upgrade.  Our room on the 6th floor (651) was beautiful - large comfortable bed, huge bathroom with excellent toiletries and soft towels.  We had dinner in the Saddle Room restaurant, some lovely choices on the menu, and each course presented in style.  Although it was Friday evening and busy, we had plenty of room around our table, and didn't feel in anyway rushed.
Following our dinner we spent a very enjoyable evening in Bar 27.  We even got to see the Constitution Room.  Breakfast the next morning was gorgeous - there was such a huge selection, from cold meats and fresh fruit to freshly cooked hot buffet choices.  Tea/Coffee were served to our table.  This is definitely a hotel for that all important bucket list, the only downside was that we had such a short stay.  There's a great buzz, especially for Afternoon Tea in the Lord Mayor Lounge, (this is on my next to do list) If we get the opportunity we will certainly stay again.  Thank you to each and every member of staff for making our stay so great.",5,2015,05,25
207,outstanding place to stay,"this hotel has everything you could possibly wish for, wonderful welcome, all the creature comforts and then some, outstanding location, world class restaurants, the best place to stay when in Dublin on business or pleasure. If you want to eat in restaurants are first class or you can stroll and eat in some of the best eateries in Dublin. Have a jog in the park before your busy day. Then the breakfast that will help you face even the most challenging day.",5,2015,05,25
207,Very helpful staff - superb location,"I stay here reasonably frequently and couldn't find a room online, so I emailed the hotel to see if they could help and although they were busy, they made a reservation for me, so we were off to a great start.  On arrival, they upgraded my room (it's getting better) and my room was one of the few with a balcony on the 7th floor.  It was to the side of the hotel so the view wasn't a great one, but it allowed me to sit outside and do email etc. until it got too cold.  The room was a refurbished one (maybe they all are now), so it was more modern than a year ago.  The location was handy for me as I had to meet a couple of people in Grafton St, which is a very short walk away.  I stayed for a couple of nights and didn't have any sleeping issues.  I didn't use any of the hotel facilities as I was out most of the time, but really appreciated the extra effort that they went to in order to make my stay a pleasant one.",5,2015,05,24
207,Afternoon Tea At The Shelbourne Hotel,"Our experience this afternoon was everything we anticipated and more.
Adam, Kelly and Joanna couldn't have been more attentive. It was mum's 70th Birthday, we (8 of us) were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived until we left.
They went the extra mile and more from serving us special dietary requirements to a special visit to the Grace Kelly Suite and a history lesson in the Constitution room.
A wonderful memorable experience for our family, one we hope to repeat in the near future.
Thank you so much
The Devlin family",5,2015,05,23
207,The Shelbourne is all service and style!,"We arrived at the Shelbourne by default really as we had booked into another hotel that we were very unhappy with and moved across St Stephen's Green to The Shelbourne. We were welcomed with breakfast and an early check-in to help make up for our previous bad experience. The staff could not do enough for us. Our room which was all understated elegance was perfect, an exceptionally comfortable bed, spacious room, beautifully appointed bathroom with excellent toiletries. The room and the hotel generally offered every comfort possible. The breakfast was delicious, and the main restaurant offered a superb menu and wine list. The oyster bar served the freshest and tastiest Galway oysters we have ever had. The Shelbourne is an outstanding establishment, we could not find fault with this hotel if we tried. Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,21
207,Shelbourne Dublin,"Lovely hotel, conveniently located so that we could walk to most of the things we wanted to visit.  The room was perfect, staff excellent.  We would most definitely stay here again.  Hotel has so much history, we wish we could have stayed more than one night.",5,2015,05,21
207,"Welcome to The Shelbourne, Lads!","What a fantastic hotel. The history was interesting. The breakfast was a fabulous way to start the day.  We almost spent too much of our time lingering over the fabulous breakfast that we were often late leaving!  One day we did a early morning train tour and they packed us a fabulous bag breakfast.  We stayed in a very nicely decorated ""original"" room while another person in our group had a newer room- which was still nicely done.  The housekeeping staff was excellent. My kids looked forward to the nightly turndown just to see what the staff would do with their stuffed animal.  And they left extra candy so we had no fights :-)",5,2015,05,20
207,Charming and elegant hotel,"This hotel is in a great location, near good shopping, food and sights. I never heard any noise from the streets below so it seems to be mostly away from the party areas. It's a 15 minute walk to Temple Bar area. 

The staff is superb, with a quiet attentiveness similar to what you find at 5 star restaurants. The room is stocked with little touches like water bottles, nice bath robes, slippers and an umbrella (just wait, you'll need it). Another unique aspect was that several of the rooms are marked with the names of famous people that stayed there (I was near the JFK room and the Earl of Shelbourne ).

The bed was very comfortable and the shower and bath we're nice. Excellent toiletries as well. 

There is a spa on site as well as an old fashioned barber with hot towel shaves downstairs. 

Lastly, you can even come for high tea in the afternoon (about 40 €). I saw a few weddings been photographed here; it is a high class location. ",5,2015,05,19
207,Beautiful Hotel and Phenominal Attention to Detail.,"Stayed here for two nights, during the Dublin Dance Festival. Beautiful hotel with an amazing double room. Room service was on par. Asked for a car and they quickly provided. Amazing value for money! Food was also high quality!",5,2015,05,19
207,A Gem of Renaissance,"We enjoyed a small family lunch in the restaurant of the hotel on Sunday last.   From exiting the car outside the hotel until returning to it, we were treated with excellent courtesy and service.   The porters outside, in particular Brian, was most helpful in assisting my elderly mother, both into and out of the hotel.   On arrival, our table was ready and all staff we encountered were very helpful, pleasant and welcoming.   Both the service and quality of the food was faultless, and we had a most enjoyable afternoon.   Many thanks to the staff for a great experience.",5,2015,05,19
207,Falls short of the mark.,"We have had a nice experience at the Shelbourne. Everything is solid at this hotel. I would give it the feel of a Ritz, or a Four Seasons with some limitations. You can see that they strive for the mark but just don't exactly get there in all areas. I would recommend this hotel to a friend but, I'm not all that excited about it.",4,2015,05,19
207,"Dublin , what an experience","Beautiful, excellent hotel 
Rooms are spacious , bathroom very nice and also spacious 
Room service quick
Great breakfast 
Efficient staff at reception and waiters 
Best position in Dublin , central to everything opposite beautiful park
Strongly recommended",5,2015,05,19
207,Great Location,"Wonderful stay. Location across the street from St Stevens Green, a beautiful park in Dublin and a short 2 blocks from Grafton street. Grafton Street is closed to traffic and lined with shopping, eateries, and unique looking buildings.  
Also, a beautiful shopping center at the end of the street from the hotel and across the street from the park. 
You can get to Temple Bar walking down Grafton and towards the river, not to far away from the hotel. Temple Bar is the scene for Dublin, a bar/restaurant welcoming all and a good vibe among the patrons and the employees. 
Shelbourne is a Marriott and service was great and breakfast was wonderful. Would recommend this hotel for service and location. ",5,2015,05,18
207,Best stay ever,"Superb five star hotel, Dublin's best. Staff are wonderful, friendly, courteous, efficient, a perfect balance. Great accommodation, good food, great cocktail bar, and good facilities. Very central for a comfortable Dublin stay.
Probably our best-ever hotel experience.",5,2015,05,18
207,Very kind and accommodating!,"The staff at the Shelbourne were all amazing!  Any questions we had were answered, any problems we needed assistance with were solved, and the entire experience was completely enjoyable! The location is wonderful, also, right in the midst of everything - entertainment, transportation, shopping, and dining.",5,2015,05,17
207,Gorgeous Hotel,"What a lovely hotel - from the minute you walked through the doors it made you think you were somewhere special. It was very buzzy being a Saturday afternoon, lots of people coming and going in reception and coming in for the afternoon tea which looked sumptuous!
The hotel has a wonderful restaurant called the Saddle Room and the bar just off reception was wonderful - a perfect place to have a cocktail and people watch. We had a 'grace kelly cocktail as that was the theme running through the hotel that weekend - even the afternoon tea had this there. apparently there is a suite in the hotel where Grace kelly stayed.
Everywhere was immaculate with beautiful flower arrangements on display. The hotel spa was fantastic, it smelt exquisite and you can choose candles that suit your personality - a lovely touch.
This would be a fantastic experience for a mother/ daughter treat or a ladies get together!
The hotel is ideally situated for everything in Dublin with lots of shops nearby and a park opposite.
Quite the best hotel in Dublin.
The hotel is very well located",5,2015,05,17
207,Extraordinary!,"We arrived in Dublin after a rather unpleasant overnight flight, feeling more than a bit tired. It was the perfect hotel to arrive to. The staff was incredibly polite and helpful, and the hotel itself impeccable. The hotel has several food and bar options, each very well done. The Saddle Room had a wonderful breakfast buffet and al a carte ordering and the food top notch. The room was ornate, neat and clean. Complimentary services included a nice polish of the boots. Located in downtown Dublin you are very close to Grafton Street and Temple Bar. A total 5 star stay.",5,2015,05,16
207,Wonderful Staff,"Last minute decision, on Tuesday evening, to have dinner in The Saddle Room. Had  Starter and Main Course from the Pre-Theatre menu. Food was delicious but have to say the staff were wonderful. Really appreciated the kind gestures. Thank you",5,2015,05,15
207,"great hotel, great location","This is a Sheraton hotel, so we were using some points for 1 room, and paying for one.  Traveling with our teenage daughter and her friend.  The hotel was able to locate their room right next to ours.  Our room was huge.  Robes, great marble bathrooms.  Very historical hotel.  pictures of famous guests on the walls.  Their concierge recommend 3 fabulous restraunts and found excellent seats to Riverdance for us.",5,2015,05,14
207,Engagement surprise,"I thought I had submitted this review a number of months ago. My then boyfriendn , now fiance proposed to me during afternoon tea in the Shelbourne in late January. On the day we were looked after unbelievably well by all the staff but in particular, Adam Kirwan. Delightful sandwiches to start followed by unbelievable scones and cakes; by far the tastiest afternoon tea around. Nice surprise for us on leaving also, we'll definitely keep coming back!",5,2015,05,13
207,Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for 5 nights and it is a beautifully appointed hotel with a classic look. The staff is attentive and very polite, providing great service. The gym/work out facility is far better than most hotels and it has a large and spacious locker room with private showers. The Saddle restaurant served a delicious breakfast and dinner. Try one of the breakfast juices/smoothies. They were quite refreshing. One disappointment was that our room was not available after a long transatlantic flight. The staff did graciously use the shower facilities while we waited. One suggestion I would offer is to add more seating in the reception area of the hotels. There are only a couple of seats. Our room did experience some noise during the night coming from somewhat of a recycling center at the rear of the hotel. I was extremely pleased with the staff for providing fragrance free lotion when I had a small reaction to the lotion provided in the room.",4,2015,05,13
207,Flawless!,"This place never ever ceases to amaze! On this trip I planned to propose to my long suffering girlfriend. From Peter the guest relations manager to Iain on reception and the team in the Saddle Room restaurant this coup was achieved! 
Having told the team of my plan we were upgraded on arrival, the restaurant manager provided the girlfriend with her wedding invitation right on cue and upon our return to our room, the bed was covered in rose petals and a bottle of prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries was strategically placed - this was complimentary .
This stay surpassed my wildest dreams and whenever back in Dublin I will not dare to stay anywhere else.
Totally flawless!",5,2015,05,13
207,Negligent service - even worse complannts procedure,"Few days in Dublin became 3 nights pain & hell which continued long after return home.
Biggest problem - poorly dealt with & took 3 days to deal with problem, mattress not turned - 8 for mths! And actually worn saggy.  A good company would offer full refund and compensation for injuring someones back - not Shelbourne Dublin - After a lot of haggling, they offered a 'complementary night and 3 course dinner' reduced to just B&B on email AND when ever we try to take them up on it surprise surprise they have lost the documentation and ooops! it is all fully booked AGAIN! Don't trust them!   After waiting for email reply to emails sent last Tuesday and since, from Dublin Shelbourne AND posting some information on f/b I have now had an email from the guest relations manager. It says that after all this work I have had to go through to get justice on this issue all, he is prepared to do is offer one night's B and B. AFTER THREE NIGHTS OF HELL and months of seeking redress! I would have accepted the one night dinner and B and B if it had been available the first, or second, or maybe the third time, I tried to take it but having started the conversation with 'you have offered me a free night to compensate for problems you caused', each time it was apparently 'full'. This time I phoned, I asked about availability first and of course there were rooms available. Now I am really pissed off with all the time and energy it has taken to get to this point. I think a full refund is in order with compensation for the treatment I had to have for my back once I got home and for the loss of enjoyment for the holiday I didn't have!
You say you phones Tuesday. Why not email as I was required to do?
This is now one very dissatisfied customer",1,2015,05,12
207,spent two nights on april/may 2015.,"A truly great hotel. The only negative would be how very small is the reception area with just a round table with four very uncomfortable chairs. After a transatlantic flight I don't expect to find a room waiting, but it would be nice if there was a nice lobby to rest and await your room. Aside from that, everything else was first class. Nice thick fluffy robes and slippers, courtesy water and nice toiletries and very centrally located.",5,2015,05,11
207,Birthdays Treat,"My wife had arrange a visit to Dublin with an overnight stay at the Shelbourne. We arrived early for check-in thinking we would have to store our bags, only to be told by a very pleasant member of the reception staff that our room was ready for us. It was immaculately and beautifully presented. After a restful nights sleep we enjoyed a tasty breakfast. On checking out reception staff suggested storing our bags with them while we perused the shops prior to our homeward journey. Throughout our short visit the staff could not do enough for us. ",5,2015,05,11
207,Simply Delightful,"Enjoyed a Champagne Tea here and enjoyed every blissful minute of the experience.
From the warm welcome to the scrumptious food to the unparalleled service, it was simply a delightful experience.
The service could not be faulted, the setting oozed flair and elegance and it will certainly be a destination for future visits.",5,2015,05,11
207,"Lovely ambience, enjoyable experience but pricey","Came here for morning coffee and scones and had a good experience. Cappuccino and latte were excellent, strong coffee, perfect milk and the scones, whilst tiny, were served with jam and cream and were very good indeed. Spent a couple of enjoyable hours chatting over these and never felt pressured to move until lunchtime, when we were gently, but very friendly, asked to vacate our table. We did not mind paying the somewhat expensive bill and felt we had had a treat on a Saturday morning. Highly recommended.",4,2015,05,11
207,High Tea at the Sherbourne,"We got there a little early and went to the small museum. We watched famous faces of those who heave stayed at the hotel on a video. Keith, the concierge, took us up to see the Constitution room because we had time. He was very knowledgable. High tea was lovely. We had elegant little sandwiches that were very tasty. The desserts were little works of art. Our waiter,Matthew, was very helpful. This was my first experience with high tea. He let us take our picture with him after tea. I had a marvelous time.",5,2015,05,10
207,Best afternoon tea ever,I was treated to a surprise birthday afternoon tea In The Shelbourne and it exceeded my expectations beyond belief.... It was my first afternoon tea and it started a new craze I just adore..... The food was simply Devine and the service was beyond exceptional.... 10/10 and will certainly be back....,5,2015,05,10
207,Sisters weekend away!,"The hotel is wonderful and well situated in the centre of bustling Dublin! Accommodation and food are five star!! All staff were really nice except for Saturday night in the bar when most of them looked and served like they didn't want to be there! In fact one of the girls could have turned milk sour with her stern face! Notice to Shelbourne bar staff, smile and say thank you to the customers who are  paying  €27 for two cocktails! A frown is not acceptable!! ",4,2015,05,09
207,Lovely hotel great location,"Hotel is beautiful, view was not great just looking at back of other rooms.  Large soaking tub with shower, very clean nice marble, and the room was very quiet. The shelbourne  has a fabulous breakfast. They are remodeling the outside so some noise and scaffolding is set up, but it was always quiet in our room.  Great location to walk to grafton street, temple bar district, and Christ church. Great service they let us check in early, held our rental car out front while we checked out, and very prompt with cab calls. The staff were very helpful.",4,2015,05,09
207,Fantastic Hotel,"I stayed here with my wife for a special occasion over the May weekend. The hotel is absolutely wonderful. It manages to keep its traditional charm, merged with modern facilities. Plus the history of the hotel is really interesting.

We had a room over looking St Stephen's Green. Rooms are a decent size with a good bathroom and a very nice shower. WiFi connection was pretty decent as well.

Location is great, just a short few minutes walk to Grafton Street and directly across from the lovely Green.  

I used the valet parking which was efficient and decent value at €29. 

Special mention to the guest relations team, they really made our stay special.

If you want to stay somewhere special in Dublin, then the Shelbourbe is the place to stay.
",5,2015,05,08
207,Wonderful hotel,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel in December 2014 for one night B/B. From the moment we walked into hotel until we checked out on the following morning we were amazed at how well we were treated by all the staff,they just couldn't do enough for you and it wasn't a put on they were genuinely the friendliest hotel staff I have ever came across. The hotel is wonderful really comfortable bed and the room even though a bit small was very comfortable.the breakfast was amazing with a huge choice. We have booked this hotel again for the weekend before Christmas this time for 2 nights B/B and there are 3 other couples all family members booked in for the same weekend and all on our recommendations so I hope they enjoy the experience as much as we did last year.I would highly recommend that if you get a chance to stay at the Shelbourne hotel in Dublin take it you won't regret it for the little extra it costs you get a lot of pleasure in return.tip try and book around Christmas the hotel is decorated to a very high standard and there is a great atmosphere the City .Tip check out the travel websites you can get good deals.",5,2015,05,07
207,I used Marriott Reward Points and got the worst room in the hotel.,"The Shelbourne is a beautifully grand old hotel that has modernized its rooms. I found, however, that if you use Marriott Reward Points, you are guaranteed to get the worst room in the hotel! Ours was one that faced a courtyard with construction going on directly across from us. Construction workers walked on scaffolding and made noises from early morning until late afternoon. To gain any privacy, we had to live in the room with the drapes drawn constantly, let alone if we wanted peace and quiet, we would have to leave the hotel.

The front desk staff were helpful but could do nothing about the deplorable room.

I received an email from Mr. Antonio Adams of Marriott Customer Care today. He said that I have the ability to tell them not to give me a shoddy room when I make the reservation, but that it is still up to the hotel manager to determine which room to give a rewards customer.

I firmly believe it is a Marriott policy to give the worst rooms to customers using Rewards points.",2,2015,05,07
207,Very nice hotel,"I stayed here for one night in March 2015 on business.  I checked in around 7 pm and was upgraded to a one-bedroom suite. The suite wing even had its own private lift.

The suite was absolutely huge, totally wasted for one person.  In fact, the living room was so big it had a lot of empty space.

The bedroom was also very big and had two double beds. Likewise the bathroom was large, with separate bath and walk in shower.

I haven't given this hotel 5 stars because the walls are VERY thin.  I could hear the guest in the next room talking on his phone as if he were in the room with me.  Also I could hear footsteps of the guests in the room above.  I am a light sleeper so I asked whether they had earplugs, which they unfortunately didn't, although the staff did offer to go out and buy some for me.

The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance to shops and restaurants. I would stay here again if I was in Dublin for either work or pleasure.",4,2015,05,06
207,Lovely hotel...,"The only fault I found with the Shelbourne is they got our breakfast wrong and didn't include the bacon in our order of the Shelbourne pancakes to our room. Being a bit worse for wear from the night before, we didn't have the energy to ring down to reception - had we done so, I'm sure they would have fixed the problem without hesitation.

Other than that, perfect service, very obliging when we asked for a late checkout and only too happy to help in any way they could. Would be happy to return and look forward to doing so",4,2015,05,06
207,"Magnificant Hotel - Ideal Location (Toronto, Canada)","An elegant hotel with impeccable yet polite and unobtrusive service located in the heart of shopping, excellent restaurants, tourist sites and short walk to Trinity College. We loved our stay at this hotel and certainly would return!",5,2015,05,06
207,Maybe the best Renaissance we've stayed in,"Probably because of the recent (and ongoing?) remodel, but the rooms are gorgeous; not sure what type we had, but it was just a King room; don’t think we were upgraded this time as they were full. Lovely marble and granite; spotless furniture and linens. Beds extremely comfortable and feather free is not lumpy. In room coffee and water. Large enough bathroom, although the tub is a bit high to step into for the shower. They have the new style safe to fit large laptops, but attached vertically to the wall so not to take up too much room. Plenty of closet space, a desk/chair and lounger. Views from the rooms may not be much if you’re on the interior, as we were, but you still get light and can see the sky – it’s also quiet (from street noise) on the interior. Hallways may have steps and changes in level because of the connecting old buildings. The lobby is beautiful, however there is no real place to lounge – they do offer a small “reading room” up the stairs but it doesn’t have any clear windows (they’re opaque) for natural light. There are several nice bar options; one requires full business casual dress at a minimum. The breakfast is great – the options for eggs (omelet, benedict) and pancakes/French toast may be a better bet than the buffet scrambled eggs and meats, but there’s a large selection of fruit and breakfast cereal, yogurt, juices; opt for tea instead of coffee. Wish they had a concierge lounge for Marriott Rewards users – instead we received a drink ticket for wine/beer in the bar (only one ticket each and we were there a full week). Staff were all very friendly and helpful, though we didn’t use them much. Seems to be a popular place for tour groups – always full lobby and buses waiting outside. Did not use the fitness center or spa – couldn’t even find the fitness center the one time we tried, but with so much walking, really never had the opportunity to use. I love being on St Stephens Green – perfect location and so many fabulous restaurants around (pubs, too), plus the Hop on Hop off bus stop is right across the street.  If this place is full or too pricey (keep watching – they fluctuate the rates with anticipated occupancy and they’ll vary from 200E to 700E for the same room, same time frame), try the Fitzwilliam.",5,2015,05,06
207,Sophisticated Shelbourne,"The location is good, the hotel  has a good restaurant, opposite of the street is the flower park which is worth a visit, also next to the hotel at Stephen’s Green are good meat and seafood’s restaurants.
At the moment of writing renovation on the outside was taken place, which gives noise of the workers, if you like to sleep late, take a other hotel.
The other negative part of this hotel are the exorbitant prices, from various websites I have seen prices up to 700 euro for one night, for Dublin which is a second or third layer city, much to expensive.",3,2015,05,05
207,May 1st Stay,This is one of the nicest hotel I have ever stayed.  From the history to the service and decor all was top notch.  The location is wonderful.  This Old Grand Hotel has history and has been well maintained with even more on going upgrades and renovations.  This was a special vacation (my wife and I were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary) and they mad it a very special occasion!! From the time we approached the door to the time we left we truly were made to feel special be the entire staff.  When return to Ireland this will be a must place for us to stay.  Hats off to the entire staff.  Thanks for the fabulous stay!!!,5,2015,05,04
207,Excellent hotel great location,"Excellent hotel within the very centre of dublin - stayed the one night in a Suite facing the St Stephens Green.  Room was large and very clean, breakfast was plentiful with a large selection to suit all tastes. There are two bars and a residents lounge - prices are on average with other bars / restaurants nearby

Overal would highly reccomend",5,2015,05,03
207,Comfy with an Ideal Location,The Shelbourne staff was helpful and always had a smile.  The rooms were comfortable and inviting after a long day of sightseeing.  We walked everyplace from the hotel were within 10-15 minutes of all the major attractions.,5,2015,05,03
207,The welcoming class,"Have visited this hotel twice in last 2 years. This is the classiest hotel in Dublin by a long mile. It oozes Irish charm and professionalism The restaurants are very good, the afternoon tea is an institution, as is sitting in the foyer on a Saturday night and watching the people of Dublin stroll by.
After a weekend in Dublin , the house cocktail is a great pick-me-up!
In Dublin I either stay with friends or in the Shelbourne period.",5,2015,05,02
207,My Favorite in Ireland.,"Fantastic hotel with lots history and great reputation which they live up to. Costly due to standards and quality deserved reputation.

Top quality food and drinks.
Super staff.
Will be back.",5,2015,05,02

207,Lives up to its great reputation,"We had a great deal for a weekend staying at this classic Dublin institution. Room was tasteful and very comfortable, with good free wifi. Breakfast was excellent. Jazz brunch in the bar was first rate. A great place to stay in Dublin, especially if you can get a good rate.",5,2015,05,01
207,Great place for lunch or formal tea,"We were not staying at the Shelbourne hotel but we went there for tea. I had read on line that it was a great place for a fancy tea but unfortunately the review I read online failed to mention that "" proper dress"" was required. It looked lovely and elegant but we had jeans on do we went to the bar and had lunch. The bar was elegantly appointed, varied and reasonably price with a very friendly efficient wait staff.  The iconic hotel is across the street from St Stephen's Green, which is the Central Park if Dublin.",5,2015,04,30
207,Will definitely stay again,"Only stayed for one night but the overall experience was first class and far exceeds other hotels I have stayed at in Dublin. Check-in was smooth, room spotlessly clean, comfortable bed and service was great. History oozes out of the walls. Yup - excellent.",4,2015,04,29
207,Great Afternoon Tea Treat,"Our Dublin-based family invited us to join them for high tea at the Shelbourne to celebrate my birthday. Such a treat. 
We loved the surroundings, especially the floral exquisite floral displays, and the tea itself was sumptuous. There was a great range of savoury items and the pastries were outstanding. Alas we'd feasted on the delicious open sandwiches so efficiently - they went so well with the champagne- that we could only manage to sample a few of the gorgeous sweet delicacies. However our lovely waiter came to the rescue and, sensing our disappointment, boxed up two selections for us to enjoy at our leisure. I wish I could remember his name - he was so attentive and really got into the party spirit.

Highly recommended.",5,2015,04,29

207,Small Rooms,"Charming, helpful staff, great location. Room was spotlessly clean, good quality bed linen, and the bed was comfortable. All things I'd expect from a hotel in this price bracket, but the room was tiny! The bed was just a double, there wasn't space for a bigger bed, and the door from the corridor opened directly into the room. There are better value hotels to be had in Dublin.",3,2015,04,26
207,Excellent Service,"We have excellent service while staying here for a few days. From the moment we pulled up to the moment we left we were amazed by the kindness and attentiveness of that staff. The room was a great size and very plush. There are great restaurants and bars located in the hotel and were very reasonable.

My favorite aspect of the hotel was the location. It was right across from St Stephen's Green and was in walking distance of almost everything including dining, shopping, and museums.

Great hotel and wonderful staff! We will be returning.",5,2015,04,24

207,The Best of the Best,"When you arrive at The Shelbourne a sense of royalty sets in and  polite staff reinforce this everywhere you step. We have upgraded to suites several times and the bigger king rooms are fantastic. A phone call can supply you with ice or anything you may desire.
My wife and I enjoyed afternoon tea; which is a MUST do!
The front desk personnel, Anne, Sarah, and many others are among the best in the hotel industry!!!!",5,2015,04,22
207,Great Hotel in Awesome Location,First visit to Dublin and thrilled that we chose this hotel.  The bars and restaurants are great.  The hotel is full of history.  This is a great hotel in Dublin.  Wish they had a club lounge for  Rewards Members.,4,2015,04,22
207,Stunning,We unfortunately only stayed 1 night at this hotel however from the moment we arrived we were impressed.  The building is beautiful and in a great location.    Our room was ready when we arrived which was earlier than the typical check-in which was fantastic.   We had drinks at the bar and the staff was very accommodating.  ,5,2015,04,21
207,Shelbourne Dublin - Excellent hotel,"This is a luxury hotel, well situated for easy access to Dublin sites, shopping and restaurants.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  The hotel room was spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable.  Would recommend this hotel for short and long stays. ",5,2015,04,21
207,Real Service in the Heart of Dublin,"I stayed at The Shelborne in March '15. I arrived prior to lunch and they didn't have a room available (not surpring as check in was after 15.00). They took my bags, registered me and arranged to call me when my room became available. This freed me up to take a look at Dublin for a while. Before I ventured out, a quick beer and lunch in the bar. The food was good, not great, but the menu was varied and would suit most people and not hugely expensive. Often in 5 star hotels you get spanked by the cost of the extras, not here.
When I got back from my exploration, my room was ready and my bag already delivered. It's the small thing that make it special and not having to queue to get a bag from the concierge is one of them. 
The room was fairly good but the view was across the flat roof to some scaffold. Not quite what I expected but on investigation, there was a note explaining the building work and whilst it would have been good to have known in advance, I'm not sure it would have made a difference to me booking. 
Evening dinner was spectacular. Starting in The Horse Shoe bar with a pint of The Black Stuff (it does taste better in Ireland) and then to the restaurant. Service with a smile, attentive but not overbearing staff and fabulous food. It's all you can ask for. 
Breakfast was just as good, the buffet is eye wateringly attractive and the selection is vast. 
With the Euro being weak, the price for this much class in a city centre is incredibly low. Choose The Shelbourne for its staff, it's class and its location, on that order.",5,2015,04,20
207,Nearly perfect,"Fantastic buiding , beautiful common areas , good bar & the other bar & restaurant looked excellent . Very charming service . Spa & gym was top notch & virtually empty. Even my 'cheapest' room was a good size & luxurious : huge shower , plus helpful stuff like tea/coffee & ironing. Great location. Breakfast was high class.
To find a criticism is difficult ; bed was perhaps too hard & the wifi service was patchy.",5,2015,04,20
207,Another wonderful stay in the Shelbourne,"My little Godmother and I stayed in the Shelbourne last weekend and from the moment we arrived the service was superlative. Peter and his team made us most welcome, our wonderful room with views over the Green was luxury itself and the friendly staff and their eagerness to help with any request made our stay memorable. Thanks again!",5,2015,04,20
207,Front desk not up to scratch for 5star,"Stayed in the Shelbourne on the 11/04/15 had a pleasant stay overall but there was some disappointing factors unfortunately. Checked in at 2 o'clock but our room wasn't ready so felt we had to leave hotel as we weren't directed to an area where we could relax and wait and felt uncomfortable hanging around in the lobby. Apart from the afternoon tea room there wasn't an area for residents to do so.The girl that checked us in was not welcoming at all, there was no natural conversation from her and was all very business like. When collecting the keys after 3 o'clock to the room there was a queue at the front desk which was frustrating but a lovely member of staff came down to us and looked after us which was greatly appreciated. The room was lovely but so disappointed it was an adjoining room which wasn't mentioned to us and could hear everything from the guests in that room, it really took from the experience while in the room as could constantly hear the guests next door. Had a pleasant evening in the saddler restaurant and the bar, all of the waiters/waitresses and bar staff were lovely. 
Overall had a pleasant stay and is a beautiful hotel",4,2015,04,19
207,Excellent Service,"I stayed at the Shelbourne with a friend over St. Patrick's Day weekend. From the moment we dropped our car for valet, until the moment we checked-out, the service at the hotel was impeccable. If we had a question or needed something, the staff of the hotel were quick to respond and solve our issue. The check-in and check-out process was quick as well. The rooms were in excellent condition and beds were comfy. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone willing to splurge a little whilst in Dublin.",5,2015,04,19
207,Amazing!,"This was probably the best hotel we stayed in on hour 14 day tours around the UK and Ireland.  This hotel is nothing but class!  We were received by very friend staff.  The rooms are very comfortable and decorated classic and classy.  We slept amazing well even thought the room was a little warm.  When we go back to Dublin, this will be our hotel of choice as it's a great location to everything!",5,2015,04,18
207,Perfect location and perfect hotel.,"I did a lot of research before my first trip to Ireland and finally decided to stay the first three nights in Ireland at the Shelbourne Inn. I couldn't have been more pleased. Perfect location for sightseeing and strolling around the center of Dublin. The hotel is really lovely and the staff make you feel special from the time that you arrive. The service was very friendly and helpful. It was always a delight to come back to the hotel at the end of the day. The room was a good size by city standards and the décor was very tasteful, well appointed and comfortable. The beds and pillows were great. My son and I had a very comfortable room. The only downside would be that the view (although over the roof tops from our room) looked down into a kind of dreary wasted space between the floors. It was nice and quiet, but I would recommend that the do some nice plants and flowers down in the empty space, so it doesn't look like you are looking into an alley or empty lot. Best breakfast buffet overall we had in Ireland. Lot's of selection in the buffet, fresh fruit and juices and made to order breakfast as well. The afternoon tea is really delightful and highly recommend. Even if you don't do tea, have a pastry and a hot chocolate, coffee or tea in the downstairs drawing room. The pastry chef here is superb. If I had stayed longer, I would have put on 10 pounds for sure. My fish from room service was not so good, but I understand that the restaurant has very good cuisine. You can walk to the museums, Trinity College, Book of Kells, the City Centre and there is a delightful park right across the street. The hop on hop off bus stops right across the way and down the block (good to get an overview of Dublin and then decide where you want to visit more in depth). Unfortunately, we were in Dublin around Easter, so many things were closed on Good Friday (only day of the year they don't sell alcohol), but I highly recommend the Guinness beer factory tour (even if you don't like the beer) and the Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin. The Gaol (jail) tour has lots of very interesting historical value, including the events surrounding the Easter Rising. The docents are terrific.  We were only in Dublin for 3 nights, I would think 4 nights minimum (including the first night to acclimate to time change) is necessary, 5 nights would be better. The Shelbourne itself has a fascinating history. It also has a great wine list, even the wine by the glass (good New Zealand Pinot) and the concierge was very helpful. The ladies in the tea room were very attentive. The doormen all looked like models. I don't think you can go wrong here.",5,2015,04,18
207,Elegant hotel with stiff competition around the corner,"The Shelbourne is a lovely and elegant hotel. The rooms are nicely appointed. The staff is efficient. The location is perfect.  We enjoyed our stay.  However, just around the corner is the Merrion, arguably the best hotel in Dublin and at a fraction of the price. The Merrion differs in the it has a quaint aspect, its smaller, and the rooms are bigger, particularly the bathrooms. The biggest difference is that the Merrion is more family and less the business crowd at the Shelbourne. Either is an excellent choice. We use Marriott rewards points for our stay at the Shelbourne.",4,2015,04,18
207,Amazing!!,"Attended a wedding in the Shelbourne and stayed the weekend... amazing!! Everything about this hotel is perfect, the staff are brilliant, super friendly and couldn't do enough for us! The most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed in, can't wait to return!!",5,2015,04,18
207,Excellent in all points,"Excellent service by very friendly and efficient staff. The rooms are big, beautiful and very comfortable. Charming park for a walk right across the street, and walking distance to the touristic part of the city. The hotel offers an absolutely fantastic breakfast to start the day.
The only point for improvement I would suggest is the wifi, which is quite slow.",5,2015,04,17
207,Beautiul and historic,"I really enjoyed the Shelbourne.  Its a beautiful place with an excellent choice of options to eat and drink at.  The staff was excellent and all the bartenders were very friendly.  

I chose it for its quality and location and I was not disappointed, I hope to return soon.",5,2015,04,16
207,Just wonderful!,"When you walk up to the Shelbourne Hotel for the first time you will feel as though the clock has been turned back and you are walking into an elegant era.
The building, the restaurants, the staff, the rooms all lived up to the hotel's reputation. If you can - book it - it is worth it!",5,2015,04,15
207,Frustrating Internet Connection,"If like me you need wifi always & quickly give this place & it's overpriced drinks a pass . It's got some bIzzare system where you have to enter four words & then get a special pass or something ! It's like getting into Fort Knox ! It's  called bit buzz or something and is a disaster . Arranged to meet people & could not access my emails .
It's like going to the most expensive pub in the world & having to ask for a key to use the toilet.",3,2015,04,15
207,Guests not catered for,"I sent the following letter to the Shelbourne on 8 December 2014 and still no response - perhaps an indication of how guests are treated ... My ratings for the hotel reflect this.

The General Manager

Further to my recent stay at the Shelbourne Hotel (6 December 2014), I feel that I have to voice my extreme disappointment regarding my experience. 

I arrived at the hotel on Saturday around 1.00 p.m. and, as expected, my room was not ready; this I can totally understand because it was well before the 3.00 p.m. check-in time. However, what I didn’t expect was to have absolutely nowhere to go to sit and have a coffee after a long drive to reach the hotel. Surely there is somewhere for residents to sit? I appreciate that the hotel depends on the custom of non-residents to keep it in business but your existence is primarily as a hotel and you should make some arrangements for residents. As a result, I and my husband were forced to go elsewhere.

The saga continued on Sunday when we decided to check out before noon to allow good time for staff to service the room. We went for a walk and came back to get a coffee and lift our luggage – again there was nowhere to sit…

In reality, I paid for a room and breakfast, not the ‘truly remarkable’ stay as stated on your website. Thankfully I had booked the Lord Mayor’s Lounge for supper so at least we did get to experience another part of the hotel, but then again, a non-resident could book to eat there too. On the whole, I definitely did not get value for money and did not feel that I was a guest in the hotel - a ‘truly unremarkable’ stay.

I have stayed in the Shelbourne many times so I know it is a busy hotel. However, I am concerned to note the preference being given to ‘outside’ business while residents are left, literally, out in the cold.

I would appreciate a response at your earliest convenience.",2,2015,04,15
207,"Great accommodation, location, and facilities","The hotel decor is beautiful, and I appreciate the history behind the building.  With that being said, the layout of the hotel is somewhat of a maze.  We had a deluxe room that was newly renovated with a king bed on the 2nd floor.  It was an adjoining room, and the walls were quite thin. It was incredibly easy to hear the alarm clock or tv of those in the room attached to ours.  That was the only downside really. The bed was quite firm.  I had no problem sleeping (perhaps the pubs helped), but simply noting this in case others have a strong mattress preference.  Our view was of a garage behind the building.  That also didn't bother me much because I wasn't spending my days there.  The pool, gym, and saunas (steam and dry) were very clean, well maintained, and incredibly relaxing.  It was a little difficult to the pool and gym in the hotel from the 2nd floor - again, seriously, this hotel is a maze if you are on that 2nd floor wing.  

Also, we had breakfast included in our stay which was a huge plus.  The buffet included lots of fruit, bread, cereals, juices, as well as hot eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausages, and puddings.  Additionally, you had the option of made to order items such as pancakes, eggs benedict, 3 egg omelet with hash browns, etc.  The breakfast was extremely filling and allowed us to explore the entire day in Dublin.  We only needed a snack during the day and then enjoyed our dinners. 

Last, the hotel is located right in front of a hop-on/hop-off stop - making it extremely convenient for both bus riding to sites that are further away like Jameson, Guinness, and the Jail.  Sites that are within walking distance include Trinity College, National Museum of Ireland, St. Stephen's Green Park, Merrion Square Park, National Concert Hall, Grafton Street, and even Temple Bar.",4,2015,04,15
207,Easter break,"My wife and I visited the Sherborne over Easter for six nights, it was everything you would expect of a five star hotel, from a refreshing glass of lemonade whilst we booked in to the friendly service of all the staff, the self service breakfast was fresh and plentiful with a good selection of hot and cold, our room was on the sixth floor and was very comfortable , as it was Easter the bars were very popular and always busy,we would certainly visit this hotel again on our next visit.",5,2015,04,14
207,"Great accommodation, good service but has its flaws","Shelbourne day/night 1

Arrive day the Shelbourne, expecting great things. Arriving early we had to wait for our room to be
prepared, nothing unusual here. So spent about 3 hrs in the Lobby bar having drinks and a small bite to eat.
This proved to be very pleasant, food was good and not overly overpriced.

Staff very diligent and accommodating.

We had a booking at the Saddle room, where we had high hopes, but were a little let down by the starter of a Lobster Cocktail. The Lobster was KILLED by the over abundance of the cocktail source.  Was not a good start,
however the main course of Rib Eye was excellent followed by a wonderful Trifle desert. Do not have high expectations of this being a Gourmet Restaurant. While the  staff are attentive and friendly there is a total lack of food etiquette. Bearing this in mind the children were treated really well.

Our evening was greatly marred by a wedding reception/disco resulting in the chandelier shake with the THUD of the base vibrating the rest of the room. So if your staying at this hotel ensure there is NO wedding taking place during your stay or at least ensure you are roomed in the opposite wing of the Hotel. 

We ended up being accommodated in a another room for the night, traipsing across the hotel around midnight in our dressing gowns and what we could carry.

Ask if there is wedding going on and if so stay away from the East wing if there is.

It must be said that the Manager, was exceedingly pleasant and understanding of our plight.

Shelbourne day/night 2

Breakfast, was fantastic. Fresh orange juice, full Irish, fruit etc. Staff again very helpful ad attentive.
Dublin center only few minutes walk away. So an excellently located Hotel.

Left note for the room to serviced. Returned around 4pm to discover room was still not done. Had to call reception,who again were very helpful arranging an immediate correction. 

Visiting the Gaiety or Concert hall is a must for kids assuming something suitable is on,we had good fortune of seeing  The Wizard Of Oz.

The evening started off with kids ( one assumes ),  above our room, what seemed/felt like performing acrobatics. Again called reception who were again very attentive and dealt with the issue promptly.

At this point either we were being pedantic, or we were having one of those MONDAY holidays/breaks.

day/night 3/4

Again the staff very courteous and helpful. The room service is a little lacking. Had to call to have our room serviced, this  was going past 3pm.
 The Oyster bar is excellent. Never had Oysters but, if you have not, then the Diablo will be a perfect introduction for you.
The breakfast is exceedingly well serviced. Staff helpful and diligent with etiquette.
We ate out at Marco Pierre White for the early bird, between 6 and 7pm, menu which we found to be of good value. About 5min walk

We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and will undoubtedly be back.",5,2015,04,14
207,V disappointing front desk efficiency....,"Stayed on Saturday 11th April 2015, just one night. My room was a gift so it was pre-paid & a king room

When my daughter (5) & I arrived at around 1.00pm on Saturday, the book-in area was very busy & it all seemed a little chaotic (I assume this is a busy time with people booking out also). We were given a complimentary glass of lemonade & some homemade banana bread so that was a nice touch

However, there was considerable confusion when I booked in - there was another reservation with the same surname, the other person I believe had two rooms booked so it took quite some time to figure out that I was a different person. The lady who took my reservation (Goshi) disappeared into the back (never telling me why) so I was left standing there wondering what was going on.

Another kindly gentleman, Eamon Casey, did come over & ask was everything alright? Goshi re-appeared to say that the room was not ready but we could leave our luggage so we did & we had some refreshments in the Jazz Bar (which was lovely, albeit very expensive!)

We went back to book in at 3.00pm & again, the confusion about my reservation continued – ‘did I have two rooms booked?' 'No, your room is not pre-paid', 'are you xxxxxx person?’. I’m a PA to a large multi-national (that uses the Shelbourne a lot) so I deal with hotels all the time & I have to say, I have never encountered such a frustrating check in!! Goshi (for it was herself again!) again disappeared into the back & eventually came out to say that my room was ready, she had been checking with housekeeping (all she had to do was tell me this, instead of disappearing). 

She had originally asked if I wanted a king bed or two double beds so I said the King would be fine as my daughter would most likely sleep with me. However, when we got to my room, there was a double bed & a pull out bed in there? 

Despite the room being a little cluttered with the un-necessary bed being present, the rest of the room was beautiful & the remainder of our stay went off really well. The staff are in the main, exemplary & very friendly & welcoming

Unfortunately when I went to book out, I had the same frustrating experience! Again the questions as to which person I was, I was told that no, my room wasn’t pre-paid & that there was a valet charge added & that I had two rooms! I had no car with me & only had one room! Goshi (yes, third time lucky!) eventually figured it out but I have to say, I was so disappointed……I was never asked if I had enjoyed my stay & I felt like she just wanted me gone & out of her hair! 

It was my first overnight visit to the Shelbourne & we were so looking forward to it, so I was upset at the manner in which I was dealt with. 

The hotel is truly beautiful so I hope I do get to go back again & have a more seamless check in & check-out ",4,2015,04,14
207,the weak link at this hotel is the front desk..,"We arrived from an overseas flight early on March 25th for 5 days.  This was our 3rd trip to Dublin and Ireland, and decided we would try a different location for a change, from our usual The Merrion.
  
The Shelbourne is a very busy hotel in a very busy location but seems to be able to handle the flow. We knew our room would not be available this early, but the front desk assured us that they would call to let us know when the room would be available....we are STILL waiting.... as a previous reviewer complained.   
We returned at 3:00pm and checked in.  We were not offered a map, introductions to the hotel or any recommendations from the front desk and....  they were not welcoming at all.  
This was not a very good first impression.

Our room was a refurbished room along the side of the construction. The bathroom was ideal and spacious but the bathroom window would not close and we called for someone to come up and look at it.  A great maintenance chap came up and could not fix it either, so he had to take it off completely and re-install it...with that completed the bathroom was now not so cold and we did not have to view the scaffolding. There was also no dresser to put your things away in which we felt was odd.  There was a drawer above the bar and the 2 night stands, these were the only drawers.  In the closet there weren't any side shelves to lay things on either....in a word there was no storage, accept the closet with hangers !

During our stay we dined twice at the Lord Mayor's.  Although a busy room, the service and food were good. We had made reservations also at Bar 27, not knowing how noisy it was.  Our table was situated in a dark corner and unsuitable to us, so asked if we could dine elsewhere in the hotel and were moved us over to The Lord Mayors room.  
We also enjoyed drinks in a quieter Saddle Bar before the Michael Flatley show at the 3.

During our stay we enjoyed the ambiance, decor and friendliness of the staff.  Also, the close proximity to shopping, sites and restaurants/bars etc. was a bonus.
.  
On the Saturday of our stay we both became very unwell and could not go down for our last breakfast on Sunday.  Upon checkout my husband settled the hotel bill first, then mentioned that we both were feeling very unwell and did not make it down to the last breakfast.  We dined at breakfast and dinner at the hotel on Sat. and did not eat out of the hotel that day. 
The man at the front desk/check-out did not even want to hear about it, and didn't ask how we were now.  He naturally thought that we wanted a deduction for the breakfast, which was included.  But, my husband only mentioned this, after we settled the bill, so this was not the case.
The arrival at this hotel was not welcoming or friendly by the check-in / front desk and the departure was another story, so we will not be returning to The Shelbourne in the future, but return to The Merrion.

The young man (Lukas) that assisted us with our luggage to our room was so helpful 
Upon check-out another young man brought the luggage trolley up to our room for us and walked us out right to the cab (he knew I was unwell) with an umbrella over our heads.  
The girl that so graciously took our photos in the lobby was so sweet, as were all of the staff. 

The very weak link at this hotel is the front desk.",3,2015,04,13
207,Simply amazing,"Stayed here with my husband over easter weekend.  Our standard room was beautiful, sumptuously furnished and appointed.  The service was excellent, with all the staff equally concerned about our comfort.  Restaurant and bar were wonderful.  Best Dublin hotel we have stayed in.",5,2015,04,13
207,Mostly An amazing experience,"We stayed at The Shelbourne for 3 nights to catch up with friends who live in Dublin.
Having previously stayed at other high class hotels during past visits we felt it was time to return to The Shelbourne after 12 years.
The Shelbourne has an  Impressive foyer  and amazing restrooms! Generally ornate and traditional splendour. A Little Shelbourne museum and rolling screen display of all the famous, royal and celebrity who have stayed at The Shelbourne add to the wonder of The Grand Old Lady of Dublin.
We had a very Expensive glass of savignon blanc - (not as chilled as I would have liked :( ) so slightly disappointed -   in the horseshoe bar  - but this improved in bar 27 - very very nice wine at just the right temperature
All The Staff were very attentive and we were made to feel very welcome - we were  met at the taxi - bags taken , lemonade while checking in. Information about the surroundings and a walking map given.
Rooms were great ,lovely toiletries , very comfy bed - but the views not so great - building work in progress - a letter on the dressing table did apologise for this and hoped it wouldn't make our stay less enjoyable - Luckily we didn't spend a lot of time in our rooms ! But I do think a nice view is important if you are paying a premium rate for a room - that in itself may prompt us to look elsewhere next year on our return to Dublin.
The Food at breakfast was exemplary.  Buffet style but a large choice - very tasty. Busy at times though,  and it did feel a bit like a cafeteria waiting for your turn.
During our stay we ate at the bar 27 and the restaurant too  - again staff very attentive and food very good ( obviously more expensive than a restaurant in town ( including the Trocadero!) but not a surprise.
Worth staying at The Shelbourne just  for the experience and to say you have.",4,2015,04,12
207,Excellent location and hotel,"We loved our stay at the Shelbourne.  The location was perfect for any destination, as the buses were all located just outside, including the Viking tours, and taxis were always queued to take you wherever you wanted.  Restaurants & shops, including the temple bar area are only a short walk away.  The kids enjoyed the pool, although the hours are limited.  Breakfast was great as always, and the bar & tea areas were great.  At breakfast, I mentioned it was my daughters 10th birthday, and after a wonderful day of exploring we came back to a very nice birthday plate for her in the room.  We went out for dinner, but came back for dessert.  They got quite busy at night, but they found a nice table for us to celebrate our daughter's 10th birthday, and they did not disappoint!  .  Special thanks to the staff/piano player for making it memorable!",5,2015,04,12
207,Great location. ,"Cons: rooms not as spacious as other queen/king rooms we have stayed in. Restaurant and bar are ok. More free movie channels needed for the TV for those nights when you want to just curl up in bed and watch one in the comfort of the hotel room. 

The gym and pool - standard. Small and the pool area didn't look too enticing. 

Spa - went to have a look as my wife was considering this but there was a cue and I couldn't be bothered to wait, so I am not sure. Probably best to call ahead. 

Very minor complaint in that our child's own pillow was thrown in with the other laundry and was subsequently not recovered. But was kindly given contact details for the manager who tried his best to sort it out.

Pros: pleasant, professional, informative staff. Breakfast is a good. Their shelbourne pancakes are special. Order from the their menu. Perfect location - walk to town and St Stephens green. Taxi ride to the zoo. Close to restaurants. 

Delicious pistachio ice cream and home made cookies from the room service. Our room service ""tradition"" of pizza and club sandwich on our lazy day  was not as fresh and as tasty hotel before but not so bad at all, our child enjoyed the pasta and kids menu.

All in all a lovely hotel. If I was coming back to Ireland I would stay here again and recommend this hotel to family and friends. 

",4,2015,04,12
207,Amazing Stay!,"Three friends and I stayed in The Shelbourne recently and had a fantastic experience.  It was our first time visiting and couldn't wait to arrive, the hotel didn't disappoint!  Everything was seamless from the valet parking to check in, they had kindly considered my request for an early check in and our room was ready when we arrived.  The room was fabulous, ornate and tastefully decorated as well as being very comfortable.

We didn't eat in the hotel but the bar was lively with excellent service.  Overall the staff in the hotel are really superb, nothing is too much trouble, particularly the kind doormen with their umbrellas!

My only negatives would be I think water left in a bedroom should be complimentary as it is in most hotels, 5 euro for a bottle was slightly excessive!  Also our rate didn't clarify it was room only when I booked it, we only discovered this when we went for breakfast, which was 30 euro each so we didn't bother having it.  It would be helpful if the rate in the confirmation email stated room only upon booking.  Again it wasn't an issue as such I just would have selected B and B if I had realised when booking.

Overall we had a really lovely time and would highly recommend it.",5,2015,04,12
207,A Wonderful Treat,"My teen-aged daughter and I booked for a night to celebrate my birthday and I tentatively asked for an upgrade (our booking was mid-week). Imagine our surprise when we were upgraded to a suite on the 5th floor overlooking St. Stephen's Green. Everything was first class - the espresso machine, look-like-new bath robes, Elemis bathroom supplies, and lots more.  My birthday started with an espresso in our sitting room reading the Irish Times (while my teenager slept) and was followed by breakfast of Eggs Benedict for us both- just perfect!
My only suggestion for improvement would be to have the Guest Information Book proof-read for misplaced apostrophes and typos.  The welcome letter from the Manager contains one of each, and more follow!
Before heading home we had a quick meal in the No. 27 bar.  Excellent!  A wonderful treat!",5,2015,04,12
207,Choice but invaded with people when we went,"We wanted a quiet glass of champagne - we enjoyed the flutes but plenty of persons of an (un)certain age monopolised the space, and the noise levels for early evening indicated the alcohol had been flowing...

That said they were friendly - but if you want a quiet drink in choice surroundings in 5 star comfort - you might just take a look in first.

Parties abounded.",4,2015,04,12
207,Disappointing,"I am a Marriott rewards traveler and a Diamond Hilton member. We had opportunity to stay at the Shelbourne and the Hilton Kilmainham this trip.   We did use rewards points for both stays.  In fact I had 3 rooms for both stays.  The Shelbourne front desk staff on Saturday April 12 early afternoon was so pretentious and not welcoming.   It was like they didn't want to put any effort into our stay because it was rewards points.  The gentleman didn't offer anything about the hotel and accommodations.  He didn't even point out the elevator.   

Later we asked another desk staff about late night dining.  Although he was pleasant he didn't offer much or go out of his way.  Heck I goggles trip advisor and found several options when he declared there weren't any.   The staff at the Hilton was a 10!  They went above and beyond and made this staff looked like they belong guarding Buckingham palace.   I would give them 1 star but the hotel it self was very nice with great beds and bathrooms. ",3,2015,04,12
207,Lovely Hotel with Amazingly Comfortable Beds,"I stayed at The Shelbourne Dublin over Easter in 2015.  The hotel staff was very helpful in directing me to a restaurant that was open on Easter Sunday.  Although, it was tough to even leave the room as the bed was so comfy!  I highly recommend staying at this hotel while in Dublin!
The bathroom was a little small, but there was a nice desk in the bedroom that was fine for setting toiletries on to stay organized.",5,2015,04,12
207,No concept of customer service,"In a 5* hotel when things go wrong normally the hotel will exceed the customer's expectations in putting them right. No so in the Shelbourne when my room was not cleaned. There is no delight in returning to a room at night where the bed has not been made up and wet towels in the bathroom have not been replaced.
   A 5* hotel, on a complaint being made, will not ask the guest, as did the Shelbourne, 'What do you want us to do?' and then add insult to injury by offering a derisory compensation.
  I object to being placed in a position where I have to complain about a service that I have paid for and has not been delivered. I expect hotel staff to be keen to retain a customer rather than haggling over profit. It would be nice to deal with staff who are empowered to make decisions rather than having to refer to a manager who can not be bothered to meet a guest face to face. 
  My stay at the Shelbourne was spoiled, not so much by the failure in house keeping but the manner in which the matter was handled - absolutely no concept of customer service.
Friends who arrived at the hotel at check-in time found their room was not ready decided to take a stroll and asked for a text message to let them know when the room was ready. They are still waiting. A 5* hotel? I don't think so.",2,2015,04,09
207,Exceptional!,"Definitely the best service I have ever received in a hotel from being welcomed by door staff on arrival to being escorted to our car by concierge on departure! This is the only time that I have truly experienced 5* service! The attention to detail at the Shelbourne is exceptional, rooms are fully equipped and beautifully designed with soft furnishings (warm homely feel), front bar is very inviting, health spa is not be missed and the breakfast is outstanding - standard of food is excellent and definitely no concern about being hungry after. I would suggest this hotel to anyone and am looking forward to returning :)",5,2015,04,09
207,Simply excellent,"Every corner, every thing, everything has been taken into account by the staff. Most important stuff: the position is very good, from here you can visit everything and you are at walking distance from the center.",5,2015,04,08
207,Dublin's Premier Address,"We spent a most enjoyable weekend in the Shelbourne. From the moment we arrived we were treated as honoured guests. We would thoroughly recommend the Afternoon tea - with Champagne of course and also the Jazz Brunch on a Saturday Afternoon. While viewing the small Museum I wondered out loud how good it would be to see the Constitution Room. A member of staff overheard me and next thing I knew. as if by magic, we were whisked up to the Constitution Room. Unfortunately I didn't take a note of the lady's name. We will be back!",5,2015,04,08
207,Charmed by the Shelbourne,"Had some hesitation after reading some complaints about prices, but found cost to be similar to other big cities.  Maybe this is unexpected in cozy Dublin.
The Shelbourne is elegant and formal in appearance and attitude but cordial and welcoming to guests.
Four nights here provided time to find fault but none was discovered.  The room was beautiful, clean and spacious.  Breakfast in the restaurant each morning was a tasty and elegant start to the day.  The location is splendid for walking to the major Dublin tourist sites and the transit to and from the airport was quick and direct by taxi.",5,2015,04,08
207,Luxury and History in the heart of the city.,"Being from Dublin I have been to the Shelbourne many times over the years for food and drinks, before and after its current renovation. It holds great memories of some really happy times. We have always loved the hotel so when we decided to get married in the city centre there was only one place we wanted to stay.
Our room was beautiful, not the largest by five star standards but beautifully appointed with the best quality furnishings in the bedroom and the luxurious marble bathroom. We went for the park view and it didn't disappoint. Waking up on a sunny morning looking out onto Stephens Green is a great way to start any day but especially your first as a married couple.
Staff were very courteous and professional from the efficient check-in process to late night drinks in the lounge. One small quibble only, the member of staff we spoke to at breakfast was very unsure what options there were for coeliacs, and wasn't rushing off to find out either. That aside we had a fantastic stay and look forward to returning for our first anniversary next year.",5,2015,04,08
207,Sadly won't be back,"5* price and 3* service. The bar is unbelievably slow and when you ask staff they tell you to wait your turn. Not especially child friendly either although a very very kind and friendly concierge did give the little girl in our party a beautiful free teddy when we were asked to leave the bar because children are not allowed, despite the fact it was very very quiet. Overall felt the tiny room was overpriced and positives like room service and concierge service are brought down by generally poor and slow service in the bar and restaurant. Have stayed in this hotel many times in suites over prime time events and decided to book a standard room for a last minute break. I have to say my experience has been much better when I have stayed in a suite but sadly I will not be back. We also due to unforeseen circumstances could not make our stay the first night we had booked. Staff refused to discount our rate at all or to give us a voucher to use at another time. Despite us spending almost €800 after a one night stay... Understand their policy but we were a bit miffed especially as we would stay there quite frequently.",3,2015,04,07
207,Great hotel and location,"This hotel is one of the best in Dublin.It has a superb location and well trained staff. It is five star and therefore the prices match that.
There is a great main bar in it which is always very busy . Not a pint of Guinness house really you need to go to a pub for a good one which are near by.
Overall it is excellent .",5,2015,04,07
207,Lovely Easter weekend!,The Shelbourne service was outstanding! We loved everything about our stay--and our boys especially loved their suite on the sixth floor. Our bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever had at a hotel---I'd like to buy the sheets for myself:) I was quite sorry to wake early to catch a plane! The location provides easy access to Dublin attractions. Can't wait to visit again in the future.,5,2015,04,06
207,Beautiful hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel with great service. Everyone is friendly. We didn't feel awkward arriving in jeans from our adventure trip through Ireland, although we definitely needed to dress better to eat in the restaurants and have tea. The rooms are very clean, bedding wonderful, and bathroom well-stocked and a good size. We found this was one of the few hotels in the city that allowed 3 adults in a room, so it actually cost us less to stay here than booking 2 separate rooms at another hotel. Breakfast was included in our rate and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a large spread with a variety of delicious options. Enough that we rarely even needed lunch! 

The location of the Shelbourne is wonderful, just across the street from St. Stephen's Green and a 10-minute flat and scenic walk to almost everything in Dublin. 

The only reason I'm giving this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is that the hallway linen closet was just outside our room (282) and the maids noisily opened and closed the closet at all hours and congregated and talked in front of it, waking us up at times. The view was of an ugly office building and had anyone been in it, they easily could have watched our every move. And the recycling center was just outside, so we heard the clanking of bottles all day long.

Request a different room and you'll be happy!",4,2015,04,06
207,Superb visit to this unique hotel,We dropped inn for Afteroon Tea and had  a wonderful time. Imelda was our waiter and she looked after us as if we were royalty. The service was five star plus. The food was truly exceptional and the atmosphere so beautiful. Thank you from three ladies who look forward to the next time.,5,2015,04,06
207,Didn't want to leave!,"Had an amazing night here Saturday night, amazing service from the minute we arrived. I'm heavily pregnant and we were kindly upgraded at check in. Valet parking is so handy and the bonus is the next day after you check out you can request your car for later in afternoon or evening and there is no extra cost, great if you're not finished exploring the city.
The bed was so comfortable, complementary chocolates, water and paper were great, bath in the suite was amazing. Handy to know for the ladies is the shampoo and conditioner is nice and a decent hairdryer too which is always good!
Unfortunately we didn't dine in the hotel but I did have a non alcoholic cocktail in the horseshoe bar, it was lovely and reasonably priced!
Overall the nicest hotel I was ever at in my life and will definitely be returning!",5,2015,04,06
207,Grand Historical Hotel with mod all mod cons,"The entire experience exceeded my expectations.  upon check in guests are offered a glass of homemade lemonade, which was a nice touch.  I had a room overlooking an internal courtyard on the third floor near the elevators, which turned out extremely quiet. The room was large and had an ample sitting area, work space and super comfy bed.  The gym was well equipped, the only complaint being it is really hard to find.  There is also an amazing 25m indoor pool.  Breakfast buffet was amazing, one can also order anything from a la carte menu as part of the buffet which is unexpected.  I ordered room service two nights which was extremely efficient.  There was a mistake with the booking which had me checking out a day earlier than my long flight home to Australia, but luckily that was fixed when I double checked check out date a day ahead.",5,2015,04,06
207,What we'd hoped for,"We booked to stay at the Shelbourne over Easter as a treat for a special occasion, and we weren't disappointed. I emailed the hotel to tell them we were celebrating - they upgraded us and provided a welcome gift and a personalised card in the room. Iain the receptionist who checked us in was knowledgable and personable and other staff were very efficient. Overall, a really positive experience and a great base to explore Dublin.",5,2015,04,05
207,Amazing stay,I had a wonderful stay i stayed in the Charles Stewart Parnell suit on the 29th of march it was an amazing room that looked over Stephens green  it was extremely clean i felt very welcomed by all the friendly staff the whole stay and if i had any enquirers the staff would do their best to help  the food was excellent in the saddle room!,5,2015,04,05
207,Love love love this hotel...,Had a wonderful stay. Beautiful hotel. Great comfy beds. Super big bathrooms. Staff are amazingly good in comparison to most hotels I've stayed in within Ireland. So helpful. They little museum is brilliant. ,5,2015,04,04
207,Spoilt anniversary,"Having stayed in dublin many times in the last few months, I thought I would book the shelbourne as somewhere different to stay for our anniversary. Whilst the building itself is gorgeous, filled with luxurious antiques customer service is what lets this 5 star hotel down. No turn down service is offered ( unless you pay for it) even if you place a ""please service my room card"" on your door.  Even when placing a call to enquire about this service I was told that because of the room I was staying in we weren't entitled to such a service. Upon reminding the manager that I was booked in for my anniversary she asked who I had told this to.  Surprise surprise the hotel were informed upon booking and upon check in and no little touches as requested were provided. After checking in there is no real customer service offered, you are forgotten about once you have obtained your room card. We will definitely not return here but will be back again to our usual hotels, the fitzwilliam and the merrion to name but a few, where customers really do matter.",1,2015,04,01
207,Lunch in the Shelbourne,Myself and my husband decided to treat ourselves for our wedding anniversary by having lunch in a The Shelbourne. Wow what a treat! We felt we were really well looked after. I was pregnant at the time and the bar staff made a real fuss over me and even made me a special mocktail! The food was delicious and the surrounding and service were second to none.  My husbands birthday is coming up and I am thinking of splashing out and treating us to a nights stay it was that impressive! This time I can even have a REAL cocktail!,5,2015,04,01
207,A Touch of Class ,"Just book it, we had a fabulous time, not one complaint, everything from the doormans advice on car parking, the check-in, our room, the breakfast, the bars, the ambience, to the checking-out was just a touch of class!  Have a great time!  You lucky thing!  ",5,2015,03,31
207,Shelbourne is Top Shelf,"The Shelbourne is a lovely historic hotel in the heart of Dublin, well situated with a park directly opposite. 

From the minute you arrive the decor is plush and wonderful taking you into another era.

When we checked in the front desk were unable to find our booking which had been made through a third party. The staff were outstanding and did all they could to retrieve the booking. Once we showed them the confirmation even though they were extremely full that night they still found us a room and they were apologetic, when it obviously was not their fault. The welcome and service was first class. 

The room was fantastic, Wifi was free, the beds incredibly comfortable and luxurious. The bathroom spotless and with again and olde world meets modern decor, respecting the history of the building. Th sonly issue was the fan in the bathroom could not cope with the steam, but a very small price to pay.

Breakfast was extremely good. A wide choice of cooked food as well as fresh fuit and breads in a buffet style or a la carte if you prefer. The freshly squeezed grapefruit juice was wonderful! 

The dining room was a series of rooms which also added to the enjoyment inasmuch as it was busy but it did not feel busy as there were five to six tables per interconnected room.

In the evening the lounge area was very pleasant to relax in and service was swift and courteous, with a selection of drinks and food available. 

As for outside noise, I have to say we heard none. 

This is a beautifully restored property that has respected the history of the building. The service at every turn was of the highest standard and everything was as good as one could hope. Well worth a visit if you find yourself in Dublin.",5,2015,03,31
207,Disappointed with room but otherwise fab,"I have just returned from a 1 night stay at the fabulous historic Shelbourne. I had an afternoon champagne tea with 5 friends to celebrate my birthday and 3 of us stayed overnight as a treat.  I had my own room and I have to say i was disappointed with it. It was a disabled access room so there was no bathtub and the view was of a yard wall with barbed wire. The bed itself was very comfortable. 
Outside of the room the staff were amazing and courteous and the afternoon tea was fabulous with attentive staff topping up our cups before we even noticed it was necessary.  We could not eat all the food so a little carry box was provided to us all so we could enjoy our treats at another time. There is a very special feel at the Shelbourne, and it's location in the city can't be beaten. I would love to go back for a 2 night stay sometime to really enjoy everything this hotel.jas to offer, but if I was given the same type of room I would definitely speak up.  ",4,2015,03,29
207,Great hotel and space in the heart of dublin,"We only had a few day in Dublin, and this hotel provided easy access to everything.  Great accommodations and staff.   Walking distance to many great spots.   The rooms were spacious (at lease by European standards) and the bathroom had a shower (which was a blessing after coming from a hotel with only a bath in Italy!).",5,2015,03,29
207,"Outstanding location, magnificent breakfast spread","This charming and stately hotel is right on St. Stephen's Green, though my room was a bit on the small side (not unusual for an older building). The breakfast spread was just great, and the staff friendly.",4,2015,03,28
207,Beautiful afternoon tea,On Tuesday 24th March myself and two friends enjoyed afternoon tea in The Shelbourne Hotel Dublin. The food was delicious and the service from member of staff Ivonna was excellent. Little wonder the afternoon tea here is so popular. I also spoke to another staff member Adam Kirwan and simply mentioned that we would have preferred more savouries than sweet items. This preference aside we had a lovely experience - an oasis of calm in a busy world.,5,2015,03,27
207,Amazing,"This hotel really is special as they say. As you walk in, it's a whole different world inside here. It's possible to feel the history of this hotel when you stay here. The food and the staff are wonderful. I like the energy  and the facilities. Love the spa area...so peaceful and relaxing! Also, the view is beautiful. The location is the best you can get in Dublin. Super recommend this hotel!",5,2015,03,26
207,Superb.,"The whole place oozes class; staff were polite, helpful and professional. Room was large, clean and well maintained. Breakfast was excellent with a large choice. Bar was atmospheric if slightly more expensive than local pubs (to be expected). Location was fantastic, Dublin is not a large city but here you are in the middle of it.",5,2015,03,26
207,Birthday treat,"Having followed n loved the tv programme on this hotel, my boyfriend surprised me with a stay over here for my birthday. The room looked beautiful and I was surprised by how big the it was. The bed was absolutely beautiful as were the furnishings, felt really special. However, the view was awful, overlooking a yard with only windows and walls to look at and the window was very dirty on the outside. The window frame was also cracked but it didn't affect the heat within. The bathroom was huge but the handrail on the wall at the bath had a dribble of rust running down the wall and the tiles on the side of the bath were very uneven especially were they met the floor. Bad finishing. The bar in the room in more expensive than the bars in the hotel and  there are tea making facilities but no biscuits offered to go with the tea which was disappointing.I had expected more to be honest. The evening meal was outstanding as was the service and the breakfast was by far the nicest I've ever eaten, we ordered from the menu rather than opting for the buffet...the pancakes are to die for. Staff were all excellent including the bar staff. Really enjoyable experience",4,2015,03,25
207,Superb stay. Old school hospitality at its finest.,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriend's birthday and I must have mentioned it when booking (perhaps they asked, can't quite recall). When we arrived to check in they immediately informed us that they had upgraded us to one of their nicest suites. The room was wonderful, overlooking Stephen's Green, and I have to stay it really made our stay very special. For an old hotel, it is kept in immaculate condition. The location is superb, with excellent restaurants and great bars on your doorstep. The hotel bar too is very popular and great for a pre-dinner drink. 

The breakfast, though there was a fairly big queue to be seated & we had to wait 10 mins, was superb. One of the finest we've ever had. 

All in all we left very impressed. I was sceptical before arriving that it might be a little too stuffy & dull (we like really good hotels, but also to have fun) but I was wrong. We'll definitely stay again.",5,2015,03,25
207,Excellent Service,"I was at this hotel for only 2 nights, but the service is what one would expect from the finest 5 star hotels. The room was also beautifully appointed with a spacious bathroom. There are repairs going on in the courtyard, so if you want to sleep late that could be a problem if you are in an interior room. The bar is nice and active. Overall great experience.  ",5,2015,03,25
207,Only lunch but will be back,"Visited for lunch with friends 
Had a selection of oysters would recommend to anyone some cooked some not
Exception quality, service and a beautiful setting
Almost forgot the great singer and his band fantastic experience 
Will be returning",5,2015,03,24
207,Why can't I give it more stars,"Never mind afternoon tea, we actually stayed here. My wife booked a bargain including the breakfasts. This hotel is amazing. Prime Ministers have stayed here. We had our own lift to our room, o.k. The view was not great, but we were staying in a hotel of sheer opulence. The staff were great, they will do anything for you. The room was over the top. Did we need such a writing desk? The breakfasts were whatever you wanted. I had the Irish Breakfast, plus fresh fruit each morning, white pudding, black pudding, sausages, eggs, beans, mushrooms, toast, what colour? Coffee, fruit juice. No need for lunch. Brilliant experience",5,2015,03,24
207,Best place to be in Dublin,"I am an American who currently lives in Dublin.  I have stayed at this hotel as a guest  while living in Dublin for a girl's ""getaway"" and also for aweek with my family whilst visiting from Belgium where we were living at the time.  I now frequent the lounge bar for a great place for a midday cup of coffee, a perfect lazy lunch on the weekend or a glass of their fab rose prosecco anytime.  I also have had high tea several times and have enjoyed some pints at the horseshoe bar with out of town visitors. I love the Shelbourne.  If you are visiting Dublin stay here. You will pay a little more for the location and the ambiance in the public spaces but it is worth it!  If you stay elsewhere be sure to grab a drink in the lounge bar.  It gets really busy so go at an odd time- say 3:30 for early drinks on a Friday or go midweek.  If you are staying in Dublin for a few days stay here and pay the extra amount because there is simply no other hotel that can give you the same experience in Dublin.",5,2015,03,24
207,Great room and convenient location..,"This is a beautiful hotel, convenient to everything.  The afternoon tea, bar and restaurant are all very good.  A very comfortable and easy place to stay when in Dublin. The staff is very courteous and helpful.  We will be back this summer.",5,2015,03,23
207,Drinks in the bar,The shelbourne is one of my favourite places for drinks or afternoon tea. I was in the bar on Wednesday for a glass of champagne to celebrate my big birthday with my mum and 4 year old and 6 month old . We could not have been made feel more welcome by the staff there. A special mention to Kate who could not have been nicer to my little ones. She was fantastic and made us feel so welcome. She even offered to take the day off and babysit on our next visit !!  Looking forward to my next visit already !,5,2015,03,21
207,Luxury and old world feel in the heart of Dublin,"Marriott has done a nice job of keeping the old world grandeur of a classic hotel, while modernizing the rooms and facilities.

The staff was very helpful and friendly. We arrived early and the front desk staff acknowledged my Marriott status and offered to store our luggage and contact us when a room was ready. We asked for a quiet room and we were given a perfect room for our needs on the top floor at the end of a hall. There wasn't much of a view, but we preferred quiet over view.

The breakfast in the Saddle Room was solid, offering a wide variety of hot food - eggs, sausage and the like, as well as pastry, fruit and yogurt.

The concierge was helpful in setting up a cab to the airport and suggesting restaurants in the area.",5,2015,03,21
207,The Best Hotel In Dublin,"This is my wife's favorite hotel in all of Europe. The hotel is right a cross from St. Stephens Green, 5 minute walk to Grafton Street and 10 minute walk from the Temple Bar district. The Hop on Hop off bus is right across from the hotel. We stayed in a Heritage Room which is a little bigger than a standard room. The hotel has good food and 2 bars. ",5,2015,03,18
207,Mr Lee,"Came to Dublin for my birthday on St Patrick's day for 2 days stayed at the  Sherborne have to say one of the best hotels I've stayed in ,very friendly staff, the food out of this world. If you go to Dublin and have chance to stay here do it worth every penny. Thanks Sherborne a renaissance hotel. ",5,2015,03,17
207,"Had to wait 3+ hours for room despite reservation and ""early check-in"", bathroom was moldy","My husband took me to Ireland to celebrate my birthday, and wanted to stay at a ""5 star"" hotel for the occasion. 

Despite letting the hotel know when making our reservations that we needed early check-in, we had to wait 3+ hours in the hotel lobby for a room to become available. After flying several hours from the U.S., we were very exhausted. To have to wait so long for a room and for the staff to be unapologetic over the issue got things off to a very bad start. The main girl we spoke to truly did not seem to care.

Our room was smaller than most hotel rooms, and the view was of an unattractive concrete building. A few times during our stay there was quite a bit of noise due to their glass bottle recycling. 
The high points were the decor and the bed (very comfortable). 

The bathroom had mold in multiple areas - in the shower, and on the casing between the door and shower. Some of it had even rotted away. 
At no point during our stay (9 or 10 days) did they remove the mold. It was disgusting. They cleaned the bathroom every day, and this was something impossible to miss (see pictures). For such an expensive hotel, these issues are inexcusable. Mold is something you might expect at a 1 or 2 star hotel, but 5 star? No.

This was our first trip to Ireland. We may return, as it is a beautiful country...but will definitely not stay at The Shelbourne again.",2,2015,03,17
207,As expected,"Luxury hotel with everything you would expect. The jazz brunch is a good time if you like some low key live music and the breakfasts are great! What was particularly impressive was their willingness to amend their meal times around our flights and deliver a hot breakfast to our room very early in the morning free of charge.

Top hotel.
",5,2015,03,17
207,Great and gracious,"Beautiful location. Perfect and friendly check in. Unexpected upgrade to suite in this Grande Hotel which rooms are well maintained and very clean. Excellent beds and nice amenities. In public area's, bars and restaurants friendly staff makes you feel at home in a beautiful setting. As I was very impressed with almost everything in het hotel, the breakfast buffet was only on par. Width and depth of buffet was average but fine for the average traveler. Very much looking  forward coming back.",5,2015,03,17
207,A very memorable hotel,"My wife and I stayed here in early Feb 2015 for a weekend break.  The hotel exceeded our expectations. The building is steeped in Dublin history and standards have certainly not been compromised now that it is part of the Renaissance chain. The bars, rooms and standards of service are at the top end of five star.  We had one of the very best afternoon teas ever, booked on impulse after a chat with a lovely lady called Imelda, who recommended we should try it. We're so glad we did. We had a lovely table by the window and Imelda looked after us so well. Adam was also on hand during the tea and they made us feel so welcome. The selection of sandwiches and cakes were delicious and very original, a real highlight of our stay.

Our room on the sixth floor was very spacious and had stunning views of the park and mountains. 

From the time we arrived until we left the team could not do enough for us. Check out the hotel's mini-museum and I would also recommend the Reuben sandwich in the main hotel bar, superb.  We will definitely be returning to this great and superbly well run institution.",5,2015,03,15
207,One of the Best Hotels in Dublin,"I stay in hotels all over the world and most are just hotels. The Shelbourne Dublin is NOT just a hotel. It is an exceptional 5-Star hotel with service and quality that is way above average! The hotel is itself, a landmark and all the rooms are updated. The staff goes beyond expectations to make your stay exceptional. Breakfast in the Saddle Room is an excellent buffet with the ability to order eggs as you want them. Also, when traveling, i try not to eat in hotel restaurants. The Saddle Room in the hotel is also an exceptional restaurant (see separate review). I honestly believe it is one of the best hotels in which I have stayed.",5,2015,03,14
207,Truely 5 star,"Myself and my daughter spent a wonderful two nights here and could not find anything even slightly negative about it. The Hotel itself is amazing, perfectly located, beautifully decorated,full of character and well worth a visit.
From reception, restaurants, bars and complex this Hotel has it all and more. If you have never been, make plans to visit next time in Dublin.
The entire staff throughout are a credit. So professional and beautifully presented. Other hotels could learn from them. So compliments to your department managers  who are well worthy of praise and recognition.
On a final note We want to especially thank Pamela Nolan in reservations who sorted out an issue with our reservation. Such a pleasant and helpful lady. Thank you Pamela.!!!!
We will return and recommend this magnificent Shelbourne Hotel to all our friends.",5,2015,03,12
207,The Best of Everything,"Do not think about staying at any other Hotel if you are visiting Dublin & want City Center location. The Shelbourne has everything! You can walk to may historic sites, it is across the street from a fantastic park, St. Stephen's Green, a must see on its own, a unique park right in City Center, shopping  on Grafton St. close to the Lucas- the easy transportation line which allows you to ride safe & easy throughout Dublin, incredible food served  for every meal at its restaurants. Breakfast is an awesome buffet, & a historic bar that you will not want to leave & be sure to treat your self to dinner in the Saddle Room. The rooms are spacious, luxurious -updated w/ amenities but have old world charm. In addition there is Spa on premises as well as gym & pool. Last but not least is the attention to detail & customer service. The staff is willing to do whatever it takes to make your stay enjoyable. The management at this property deserves serious praise for training of staff, it shows . I visit Dublin 2-3 times annually and will stay no where else.",5,2015,03,10
207,"For location, service and luxury this cannot be beaten ","Had a truly wonderful stay at the Shelbourne in March 15 for my fiancé's birthday. The hotel is perfectly located for Dublin's attractions, the staff are friendly without being over the top, and the rooms are beautiful. 
Highly recommend Bar 27 on a Friday or Saturday night to start your evening. Food and cocktails amazing!

207,"Afternoon Tea ,","Had the most wonderful afternoon tea today . Wonderful staff who make you feel so special . From the minute we entered the exquisite tea rooms we were made to feel so welcome . The sandwiches and pastries were divine and the scones and clotted cream , what can I say !!! . It's €35 or €45 if you decide to have champagne . The staff continually refill your coffee/ tea . So friendly and if you can't finish all your cakes , they give you them to take home in a most beautiful box . I would recommend the shelbourne , best afternoon tea I have ever had . They also informed us , they also do an evening tasting by the executive chef . Definitely will try this .",5,2015,03,09
207,Fabulous Hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights over weekend. Fantastic hotel. Rooms are gorgeous. Everything about hotel is very luxurious. Had a lovely lunch in bar with lovely wine.

207,Great hotel and great location,Really nice hotel in a great location - you can walk everywhere. I dont recommend dining or drinking at the hotel since the food and beverages at all the restaurants were extremely over priced. There are lots of great restaurants and bars within  walking distance.,4,2015,03,09
207,Everything you would expect from a 5 star,"The staff have faultless service from the doormen to the waiting staff. 

Beautiful Jazz brunch yesterday in 27. 

Location is perfect for wandering around Dublin with all the buses stopping right outside and also a taco rank. (Beware some of the non local drivers who will really try to rip you off)

The room was lovely, nice Elemis toiletries. Beds are turned down each evening

Pool etc is nice but I must say my personal disappointment is that there is nowhere to relax near the pool. So you are either in the pool, sauna or steam room or you have to leave, some loungers would make the area much better.",5,2015,03,09
207,THE place to stay!,"The Shelbourne hotel hit all our tick boxes for a long weekend in Dublin, from the superb location opposite St. Stephen's Green, to the warm, friendly service we received from all staff throughout our stay.Frankly, we were at a loss to understand some of the ""grumbling"" reviews - must be sport for some people! We stayed for two nights in a third floor Queen room which suited us perfectly, taking advantage of the excellent facilities including the well appointed pool and spa. Dining was a pleasure.  The buzz in the Number 27 bar and lounge (great for people watching!) during the evenings is fantastic and very efficiently managed by the staff . The hotel itself is 10-15 minutes walk from some excellent bars and restaurants as well as some of the major Dublin attractions such as galleries, museums and places of historical interest. We have no hesitation in recommending The Shelbourne and will definitely stay here again. Many thanks for a perfect break!",5,2015,03,07
207,"Great location, traditional luxury","When being driven to the hotel via taxi we were told the shelbourne was one of ( if not the) best hotels in Dublin. On the whole, it did not disappoint. Our room was large and the bed comfy, plus the bathroom was very spacious and with a sense of luxury. Staff were polite and the concierge very helpful. The only issue we had was with breakfast where we were made to queue then wait in a packed adjourning room till space was available. Having said that the breakfast was worth the wait, you had a choice of buffet and to order off the menu. Hotel was well placed next to the lovely st Stephens green and grafton street. Decor is very stylish with touches of old school glamour. Really enjoyed our stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. It may be pricey but you can see where the money goes and a nice touch of luxury and comfort on a city break",5,2015,03,07
207,Good old fashioned service !,"Stayed over the Ireland/England rugby weekend & the whole place was buzzing. Great atmosphere with a fantastic array of characters.
Hotel is grand with lots of high ceilings & service is incredibly friendly but faultless.
We got an upgraded room which was spacious & comfortable with a decent sized bathroom.
Small niggle was housekeeping waking us up at 9 on the morning we were due to check out when check out time is 12.
Excellent choice of food at breakfast .
Highlight was drinking in the main bar - not cheap but the current exchange rate helps.
Got to be one of the best hotels in Dublin.",5,2015,03,07
207,Pure luxury in the heart of Dublin,"Stayed here for a weekend in January with my husband. The location of the hotel is fantastic, short stroll to nightlife and shops. The hotel is very old style luxury, with all the mod cons you would expect of a 5 star hotel. My only complaint was that on the Sunday morning when we went down for breakfast, we were seated in the bar to eat our breakfast. I understand that when the hotel is full that they use this as an overflow area, however I would have preferred to have been offered the choice of waiting for a table in the  reastaraunt or being seated straight away in the bar. Other than that it was a fabulous experience and will definitely be back",4,2015,03,07
207,Did not stay here - but the oysters and vibe was fantastic,"Found my friends here having oysters and a cocktail or two for lunch.  Nothing was better than watching the proper crowd file in and out - yes I am American, but am 50 and just enjoy life and those around me.  Bar staff was very friendly and informative.  Not expensive for the delicacies we enjoyed shell by shell - followed by a pint or two.  My wife had a wonderful conversation with a proper gentleman, cane, hand watch, and all.  Joined in and the conversation was great - so enlightening on the different sub-cultures within the town.

Note to others:  If Sunday, turn left as you walk out of the hotel and find the park with the Oscar Wild, a nice array of original paintings for sale.  And what ever you do - do not miss a pint at the Ginger Man.",5,2015,03,04
207,Excellent location and top class  service,"Stayed here for one night to celebrate a birthday. The room was very well located, looking over the Green and  there was no traffic noise etc. The food at breakfast was  varied and very well presented.  The bar was full on the Friday night and you have to be in early to get a seat!  The standard of service and attention to detail was excellent. Look out for the beautiful flower arrangements.- they had the most beautiful hyacinths tied with little ribbons.",5,2015,03,04
207,Old Time Elegance,"I was here for a night with my daughter, we were treated very kindly at check -in and they have a beautiful flower arrangement at the entrance to the hotel that they are very proud of, the room was very nice, a little on the small size, was very quiet didn't hear a soul the bed was comfy with quality bedding, and the bathroom was a bit small also, but everything was spotless and well kept.  I ordered a bread pudding from room service in the evening and that was very good and was brought to my room in 10 minutes.  The Hotel is located across from St. Stephens and is walking distance to the center of town, we walked everywhere, may I suggest the brazen face, a 500 year old pub, has a lot of character, a bit of a walk though, the Irish coffee was wonderful.",4,2015,03,03
207,Simply the best,"We have just returned from a truly fabulous weekend in Dublin. The city was alive with an incredible buzz due to the rugby clash between Ireland and England. We stayed three nights at the Shelbourne and can not recommend it enough. The staff were all excellent, nothing was to much trouble and the level of service was quite frankly up there with the very best. Considering the number of very inebriated  people that congregated in the hotel over the weekend you might have thought the staff would buckle under the pressure. They did completely the opposite and embraced the feel good factor that came with beating the English!! We used the lounges, the bars and the restaurant and enjoyed all areas. The dinners were excellent as were the breakfasts. This is without doubt one of the best hotel experiences we have encountered and we have encountered a lot! You must give the Shelbourne a go in fact use it as an excuse to visit Dublin, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Well done team Shelbourne, we will be back in November to celebrate a Dublin girl's (the other half) birthday. We can't wait. See you then.",5,2015,03,03
207,Romantic Wedding Anniversary night,"My husband booked this wonderful hotel for our anniversary. He booked in earlier and when asked what the occasion was, he was very pleasantly suprised to receive a lovely token ""decorated plate with sweets"" delivered to the room. While our room was small, it was very tastefully decorated and had all we needed. Staff were amazing and treated us like royalty...thank you for that !
We will be back there for a wedding in August and really looking forward to the style, service and warm welcome.",5,2015,03,03
207,Beautiful Hotel with lovely staff,"Friends of mine were staying in the Shelbourne and we went in to have dinner with them in the Saddle Room restaurant.  This hotel is absolutely beautiful, their room was divine, two gorgeous beds with a bathroom 'to die for'.   We all headed down to the Saddle Room for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed a fab dinner.  There is a great selection to choose from, I myself had the Sweetbreads to start, then the steak which was cooked to perfection and finished with delicious ice cream.  The others had various other meals, all of which were fantastic, overall really impressed with the restaurant and the staff are a joy, looking forward to returning.",5,2015,03,03
207,Excellent stay,"Outstanding hotel... excllent service, beautiful rooms, incredibly comfortable beds, charming ambience and amenities, great food (breakfast), strong wifi. The hotel is situated directly across the street from the beautiful St. Stephens Green park, and walking distance from many of Dublin's sights, pubs, restaurants and shopping. I would absolutely return and strongly recommend.

Only con - health facilities not quite up to par compared to the grandeur of the rest of the hotel... limited towels, no slippers, mediocre service....",5,2015,03,02
207,Treated like Royalty!,"Well where do I start, the beginning, a very good place to start! From the sec we drove up to the front of the hotel, very excited to arrive at what was to be a beautiful, luxurious and wonderful experience! Are we celebrities, no, are we royalty no, did that matter.... Absolutely not!To be greeted by lovely door men, who brought our bags to check in, where we were given, lovely refreshing glasses of lemon! Up to the room, I do wish there was a camera to take a pic of our faces, the smiles, the gasps, the awe factor! We have stayed in 4/5 star hotels, not too often just as treats, but this really went up above and beyond! The room was stunning, not too warm not too cold, just perfect, the bed, just like home, at 2.30pm I couldnt wait to go to bed! Everything was spotless! Off to dinner that evening and then to arrive back, the bed turned down, lovely mat on the side of the bed with your slippers, ready to say good night, and a nice touch with a good morning for when you got up! I know the advice was to arrive early for breakfast, as it was a busy night, but, we arrived at 9.45, straight into our table, with every type of breakfast at your finger tips. Check out was so comfortable, with the option, to just leave your card and walk, something I rarely like to do as I like the personal touch! A must do in the hotel, is take a few minutes and go in to their museum, a little room that you could spend hours in going through the history! The highest praise has to go to the staff! I have, in jobs before,dealt with the public, and it is very hard to have a bad day go into work and smile, but each and every person in there, must have a wonderful day, and enjoy their job as each greeting and smile was to perfection, flawless and with one ounce of being false! Every request was jumped to and and adhered to with perfection! This is the most wonderful hotel in the world,where you may not be royalty in name or blood, that didn't matter, they made you feel like that for every second of your stay! This is an experience not to be missed and we so look forward to our next stay in the hotel! Only negative was that we had to leave!",5,2015,03,02
207,A genuinely five star experience,"The Shelbourne has long been on our list of ‘must visit’ hotels for some time, so it was with much anticipation that we headed in to test its bold claims of merging “traditional splendour and contemporary convenience”. We were not disappointed! The service from the moment you step through the front door is obviously top class and not in the least bit forced. It is obvious that you are dealing with a team of people that understand what five star service actually means. The food presented for both lunch and breakfast was superb. We dined for dinner elsewhere but such was the quality of food, we must return for dinner sometime. The bedroom was among one of the smaller rooms I have experienced, but nonetheless was beautifully furnished and decorated and suited our single night stay. A longer stay may have been uncomfortable – but you are in the very centre of a capital city. A thriving atmosphere was to be found in the bars in the evening and with the heart of Dublin within walking distance…what more could you want?",5,2015,03,02
207,Top spot,"Grand luxurious hotel with all that you need.Well maintained room with very comfortable king bed with every facility.Breakfast is gigantic in selection available including real honey from the dangling comb.Staff and service without fault ,Good location with large range of restaurants nearby and and easy walk to shops/parks and attractions.",5,2015,02,28
207,Family visit,"My family and I stayed at the Shelbourne last weekend. We all know the beautiful building, its stunning location and it has all you expect from a 5 star hotel. However imo its biggest asset is its staff, they are incredibly helpful and not at all pretentious. 
Left my phone in the car - no problem we'll drop it up to the room
Curious kids with loads of questions - even though it was very busy, they were extermely polite and engaging
Special breakfast - no problem
We look forward to our next visit.",5,2015,02,28
207,Overpriced and vastly overrated,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights with 4 adults staying in 3 rooms. We stayed from a Saturday to Tuesday.
I had never stayed at the  Shelbourne and it was for a special family occasion.
The only thing that is great about this hotel is the location. Beyond that it disappoints and it is costly disappointment. 
Firstly if you are driving to the hotel you should get a prize just for getting to the front door-there is a tortuous one way system and no proper parking bay. There is no onsite car park. So stress from the get go trying to just arrive.
The rooms are nicely decorated but nothing special. Two of our rooms were numbers 365 and 465-both were at the back and facing another building. In-between is a generator of some sort with a constant buzzing noise. We had to change both rooms after the 1st night. Neither of these rooms should be bedrooms. I have no doubt they are constantly complained about...but they put the punters in there regardless. When we changed rooms they never indicated whose luggage they had put in which room and confusion ensued....chasing each other for the ""correct"" room keys. Totally slovenly lazy attention to detail. Both TV remote controls did not work properly -probably batteries not checked. More annoyance.
The foyer is like a market esp at weekends....as this hotel is a popular social meeting spot. So noisy and chaotic.
The rooms had a ""letter"" stating that the breakfast room is ""very busy"" between 9.30-11.00AM and could we please consider having breakfast outside these times or ordering it from the room. It seems the Shelbourne wants you to get up early on your well earned hotel stay to avoid stressing the staff or alternatively you can opt to pay even more for breakfast (it is currently €29 per person in the dining room) by having room service. There was a large queue after 10AM for breakfast. Not acceptable in a ""5-star"" hotel. Total nonsense.
The front revolving door is almost a human catapult. It is small and cramped and moves too fast. 
In short the Shelbourne is living off it's name. It is labelled 5-star but it is not. It is an average 4-star hotel. I'll never stay there again as I can do better elsewhere.",2,2015,02,26
207,Afternoon Tea,"I had Afternoon Tea on Saturday in The Shelbourne and can't recommend the people, location and service enough.  This is a really unique experience, worth every cent for the sheer luxury, service, elegance, atmosphere, and of course, food!  There seemed to be a general understanding among the staff in the Lord's Mayor Lounge, where tea is served, that this was a special occasion for all of us and great care was taken to make sure the only choice we had to make for the 90 mins was to add a glass of champagne with our tea, tough one.  Have to say a huge recommendation to Adam, who kept checking in on us – and all the other tables – and although he was obviously busy, he was happy to chat with us and hear our memories of the Shelbourne, which was a nice touch.

A few items to note – book well in advance, there are limited slots and these tend to fill up, I booked 7 weeks in advance.  There are different prices for the classic tea and champagne tea, so check that out in advance.  We didn't manage to finish the food so we asked to bring everything away which was no problem, and a lovely takeout box arrived with our leftovers.
Also, the 90 mins do roll by fast, so make the most of it, it’s a lovely experience and a great treat for anyone special in your life – went down a hit with my mother in law I assure you!",5,2015,02,25
207,Brilliant Weekend,"Stayed her for a couple of nights. The hotel is in a superb location. The room was lovely and overlooked St Stephen's Green. Staff were attentive and very helpful. Breakfast at 10am on  a Sunday can be a tad busy and we a had a short wait for a table, but the staff had organised things very well.
My one slight complaint was that I was told at reception that Wine and Chocolates would be delivered to the room as the trip was to birthday celebration. These never turned up. Didn't want to make much of a fuss over it as they were complimentary and it would seem a tad churlish to moan about it. Other than that the stay was superb and would happily come here again.",4,2015,02,25
207,A disappointing end to a stay in The Shelbourne,"I gifted my parents with a night over in the Shelbourne recently to celebrate their return to health following a run of illness throughout the winter.   
They were looking forward to kicking up their heels and relaxing in the heart of the city at this city centre institution where they (probably) wouldn’t have chosen to indulge in themselves.  
Although it’s now owned by a worldwide chain, the Shelbourne is still Dublin’s most iconic and well known hotel.  
It has welcomed statesmen, movie stars, rugby squads and regular civilians throughout the years and meeting friends for drinks or afternoon tea at the hotel is a much loved Dublin custom.
I pushed out the boat for a heritage room overlooking the Park and breakfast was included for approx. €300, not cheap but it was an occasion.
My parents were in raptures on arrival and enjoyed checking out the luxurious bedroom, living room area and bathroom which looked right out onto the green.  Water was not complimentary which they did find odd, as did I, at that room rate.
The décor was old fashioned, gracious, a little faded but not shabby.  The enormous black wide screen tv delighted my Father but jarred with the rest of the décor.  The beds were super comfortable but surprisingly, a lot more street noise than one would have expected reached the 5th floor of the hotel making for a not entirely uninterrupted sleep.
Staff at reception were helpful and friendly on check in but they did comment on the amount of time spent waiting to check in and indeed on any other time they were at reception, it was difficult to get anyone’s attention.  When they did manage to do so, the staff were friendly and willing to help.
They did not eat at the hotel for dinner on this occasion but said the breakfast spread was extensive and first class.  They did comment on the long queues to get into the breakfast room in the morning and how some other guests got tired of waiting and left to eat outside.  They also felt pressure not to linger at breakfast because of the crowds still waiting outside waiting for them to finish.
I had made contact with the reservations department in advance to organise payment in advance and I believed that this was confirmed and the guest relations department had been notified.  
However, I was beyond disappointed to get a call from my Father first thing on Saturday morning alarmed that they had received a bill and invitation to use the ‘Express check out service’ before they checked out.  
This one breakdown in communication between the Reservations and Guest Relations departments had the unfortunate effect of pretty much ruining their entire stay.  I assumed that the assurance and confirmation that I received from the hotel that my parents’ stay was taken care of and that they weren’t to see a bill meant that this is what would happen.  It did not.  I totally understand that mistakes happen in the running of any hotel, however in the case of a hotel with the name and 5 star rating that The Shelbourne enjoys, I don’t understand it.  It cast an unfortunate pall over their stay and if I were to repeat the exercise and set my compass to find a 5 star hotel experience in the city centre, I have a feeling that true north would not find itself at No. 27 St. Stephen’s Green.",3,2015,02,25
207,Great Location,"This hotel has possibly the best location in Dublin.  If you are looking for a hotel that has character this is the place.  The rooms are not the most modern or the biggest but you can forgive that for the location.  The staff are friendly and the food is very good.  

You don't have to look to far for lively bar where you can have a great pint of Guinness or a Mojito.  If the budget stretches that this far, you certainly get value for money",4,2015,02,24
207,Very nice stay,"Had a very nice couple of nights at this hotel recently, very helpful staff nothing too much trouble. I only stayed B&B, room very comfortable and food at breakfast was first rate. Would certainly revisit.",4,2015,02,24
207,BIRTHDAY WEEKEND..,just home from a two night break at the shelbourne. Had a great time and most definitely return.  every thing about the hotel was top quality from the reception staff  on our arrival to the restaurant staff. We were very surprised to have received a lovely bottle of wine and chocolates sent to our  room complementary. The room was brilliant and cant wait to return to this great hotel..,5,2015,02,24
207,Sour taste,"I booked this hotel as a treat for my sisters birthday. We were staying 2 nights and really looked forward to it. As I had booked through a third party website, I rang the hotel to confirm my booking. I was told it was a queen room, but could be upgraded for a fee to a twin room. I arrived down to pay my bill and ask why the fee was there twice on the bill. A lady called kinga, brushed me off , that the fee was per night. I explained to her that I had time and date of my phone call and that per night was never mentioned. She shrugged her shoulders and said she would remove it as there was a mid understanding. I was mortified.  She was so rude and be littling after spending over 500
Euro in drinks and food. I told her there was a lot f noise and music on the Saturday night, but she brushed it off as dinner noise. I told her it sounded like a ball or wedding. She has no interest. She didnt even make eye contact or asked if we enjoyed our stay. Add to that, we waited 25 mins for breakfast, I really was disappointed. I come from a business family and the 1 thing we were always taught, was ""
The customer is always right"". Even if she didnt agree with my issues or concerns, it would have been nice if she listened or empathised. Sorry shelbourne, you let me down.",2,2015,02,23
207,Elegant and relaxing stay,"I recently stayed at the Shelbourne for 4 nights in early February. The Hotel is very well located and within an easy walk form a number of major attractions including Grafton Street, the Book of Kells and a range of museums and galleries. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff very helpful assisting me to overcome some credit card problems on check in. The bars are fairly crowed but it was usually possible to get a seat and have a drink ora meal. The breakfast was included in my room rate and was great. The only disappointment I had was that I had requested a room with a view and received a room with a view of a wall.I have booked to return to this hotel next year for my 60th birthday.",5,2015,02,23
207,where's the coffee?,"I stayed at the Shelbourne at the beginning of February.  The hotel is gorgeous and the service is very good. We had called ahead to say we would arrive very early in the morning (6am) and they were ready for us - lovely after a long plane ride.  However two things were disappointing: first, the lights were not coordinated so that every time I wanted to get up at night I had to walk all the way over t the door to turn them on.  Secondly, and disappointing, there was no coffee in the room.  I realize this is Ireland, but since it's Renaissance, American owned and 5 star I would have expected a Nespresso. Instead there wasn't even instant coffee in the room.  Aside from that, the location is great, breakfast is included , and there is a Starbucks down the street. It also has a great bar which seems to be a meeting place for the city - very nice.",4,2015,02,22
207,Really special...,"Just superb from the moment you walk up the steps.  Bunches of fresh hyacinths perfuming the lobby,  a lovely welcome from Elena on the front desk, beautiful room, huge comfortable bed, freshly squeezed breakfast juices. Twenty four hours spent here left us with the feeling that we had been on a week's holiday!",5,2015,02,22
207,Superb staff & location but a few niggles,"Historic hotel, central location, well-appointed rooms & tasty breakfast. However, we had to queue for breakfast and there was a shortage of seating in general around the communal areas. I wouldn't like to visit in peak season. Enjoyed the ambience but it's not cheap.",4,2015,02,22
207,Mary & Stewart,"We were in Dublin for a 21st birthday on Valentine's day so we searched places to eat and I was a bit worried about the other reviews saying the service wasn't good, we decided to take a chance and try it anyway, we are glad we did, the food,service and ambiance was great. We ate in the Saddle Room and our waiter was called David. He was friendly and professional and the service was excellent, we would certainly recommend The Shelbourne Hotel  if you are looking for elegance as well as good food and service, can't wIt to go back.",5,2015,02,22
207,Fantastic! Business or Pleasure,"My first stay at the Shelbourne was in April 2013. While I didn't find the room amenities anything special per se, the service was outstanding and the amenities were what you would expect for the price of the room: upscale. I was surprised to have someone knock on my door in the afternoon asking if they could tidy up the room and give me water and chocolates. A follow up visit in December 2013 was also exquisite. I had a slightly better room (view and size of room were better). My latest visit in October 2014 was my favorite. While the actual receptionist probably didn't recognize me she had looked up the records to show I had stayed on two other occasions. She asked if she could upgrade me to a suite for free, which was helpful since my brother joined me for this trip. I don't normally experience this level of service at Marriott's!

On top of the fantastic service and accommodations, it goes without saying that the location is splendid. I doubt there is a hotel in Dublin that can match the Shelbourne.

This place is very special. I don't normally intend to bring my family to any of the hotels I travel through, but the Shelbourne is truly exceptional. My next time here I plan to have them along with me.",5,2015,02,21
207,"""It's The Shelbourne Experience"" 5*","The Shelbourne Hotel Dublin....the name says it all! 5 Star+... you pay for what you get! Service, food, drink but it's the Shelbourne Experience!!! Located in the centre of Dublin overlooking Stephens Green, walking distance of Grafton Street! Excellent Value for the Experience! A must stay in Dublin!",5,2015,02,20
207,Elegance in Dublins heart ,"My Wife, my youngest daughter and myself stayed here for 2 nights. We were made feel very welcome and the staff are phenomenal, a true credit to their company. Only downside was having to go look for butter at each breakfast sitting, only a small thing but most people do require butter with bread/toast. ",5,2015,02,20
207,Pricey But Worth It For Atmosphere,"The Shelbourne Hotel is located just a 5mins pleasurable walk to the start of Dublin City's Shopping thoroughfare. The great atmosphere is apparent the minute you enter this hotel and the main bar sucks you in for a quick drink before checking in!  The Horse Shoe bar is ok but the ambiance is far better in the main bar.  Be aware that drinks prices are high in this hotel compared to the bars/pubs locally. The bedroom we had was a Queen Room and this was a cosy affair with the bathroom being a little on the small side for two but we only stayed the one night....would recommend a larger room for more than 2 nights.  The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable, the only thing to say is that the air con was very noisy!  I have had breakfast in the hotel before and on that experience I would recommend sniffing out the plentiful cafes for your Full Irish....it's far cheaper and you get served it rather than have to fight for the best rasher in the serving tray!!  The Shelbourne is a hotspot for the celebrities so you may be lucky on your visit......",4,2015,02,20
207,A little bit of Luxury......,"I have just returned from my brothers wedding meal which was in this hotel. We were a small party.....only close family but from the time we arrived to the time we left we were treated as if we were the only people there. Doireann and two other lovely staff members (who's names l didnt note, sorry!)looked after us in the bar. They were professional and efficient yet made plenty of time to make us, our four year old and 7month old feel special. We then moved to the restaurant where an area had been reserved for us and were again looked after by excellent staff....(sorry l forgot the names here too!). The food was beautifully presented and cooked to perfection. They left just enough time between courses for us to enjoy our food but not so much that we felt forgotten. The whole evening was so relaxed we found it hard to leave. This was my first visit to the Shelbourne Hotel......it wont be my last !",5,2015,02,19
207,lovely place for a drink,"before or after a meal on a sunday, we love to go in here for a drink- it always makes the day and the people having the drink feel a bit more special! havent had the opportunity to eat here yet but I hope to in the near future!",5,2015,02,19
207,Great service and food at the lounge,"I went to the shelbourne with my girlfriend to have supper last night and found a great experience. The service was impeccable. Gezin, vyoletta and anka really know how to look after guests and made us feel very comfortable. The food was amazing as well. Good sized portion for a light dinner. Overall a great dinner. I highly recommend.",5,2015,02,19
207,Fabulous,"What a treat the Selbourne is a fantastic place,bustling,bright and busy, with friendly staff in every area you visit. Afternoon tea is an amazing experience. Overall, treat yourself to a stay in the Shelbourne or just a drink in the horsesshoe bar. It's a fabulous place ",5,2015,02,19
207,Splendid Shelbourne,"My friend and I always stay at The Shelbourne and simply love it. The staff are always happy to help. Nothing is too much trouble. The team in The Lord Mayors Lounge are very attentative without being intrusive. Two members of this team that should be commended are Adam and Rachel. 
The beds are heavenly. The food is superb. The Spa is luxuriously decadant. We always leave our 'Shelbourne bubble' looking forward to our next stay.",5,2015,02,18
207,Our new favorite hotel,"After a few days tourng Ireland we thought we would treat ourselves to a night at the Shelbourne at the end and it was a excellent choice. First of all we had a hire car so where do you park it? Easy, we drove straight up to to front door and gave the keys to the doorman to valet park. It was even cheaper than finding a local car park. The traditional style of the hotel was everything we hoped it would be and more. The room, a Heritage room, was beautiful, large and luxurious. The hotel is in an excellent location and it is very easy to walk out to shops and restaurants. In the morning we let the conciege know that we would like our car at 1000 and then went and enjoyed a lovely breakfast before checking out. Then all we had to do was walk out and there was our car right outside the door. Fantastic service. This is our new favorite city centre hotel.",5,2015,02,18
207,JUST AMAZING!!!,"We stayed here for a long weekend and just loved everything about this grand hotel. The staff was great, our room was beautiful and spacious, the restaurant for breakfast was yummy and delightful and you cannot beat the location!!!
We cannot wait to come back!!!",5,2015,02,18
207,A really great hotel but watch those inhouse drink prices add up!,"Stayed here for two weekend nights with my wife as a present for her birthday. I was really impressed with this hotel overall but being originally from Dublin, would have expected no less. Relaxed atmosphere. Old world decor and charm. Central location. Lots of professional, courteous and attentive staff. A breakfast up there with the best I have partaken of in any hotel worldwide. Our room was compact and bijoux which suited our needs perfectly. I can recommend a stay at the Shelbourne. 

However, by way of a balanced review, two matters................................

1. There was an 80th birthday party on the second night of our stay. The party attendees flooded the hotel proper in both party reserved and unreserved bar and lounge areas to the detriment of other paying guests, not just ourselves. This manifested itself most acutely next morning with a queue and wait for breakfast seating, although late checkout was offered to mitigate the delay. Is there no function room available for this type of event? The words capacity management came to mind. Maybe we were just unlucky on the weekend we chose to stay?

2. The price of drinks is bordering on the ridiculous even for Dublin. We paid €13.50 for a glass of house red wine measured to within an inch of its life and nearly €8 for a pint of lager. We kept the receipt as a future conversation piece! There was a Jazz band playing so maybe there was some form of undisclosed cover charge? In the heel of the hunt, we paid a total of €135 for a handful of sit down drinks over the weekend. The minibar remained untouched!",4,2015,02,17
207,"Bad Value, poor facilities","We stayed in The Shelbourne Hotel on December 17th last. One could only describe the foyer and reception area to a train station with a massive crush for the last train. Staff were doing their best, porters were most attentive, but the entire process was rushed and unpleasant. We dined elsewhere that night and returned to The Shelbourne for drinks at 10 pm. The Horseshoe bar is not designed for comfort ! The Bar opposite was full of a rude, arrogant, and rather rough clientele. The bedroom is the smallest, darkest bedroom I have ever been in. The bed was luxurious, the bed linen also, but a claustrophobic room with views out onto a flat felt roof. The shower ensuite is not of adequate size for comfortable use. On the morning of the 18th, we were asked to leave the lounge type room at the front of the hotel at 11am to facilitate setting up of tables for afternoon tea for the general public ! Thus leaving nowhere to sit, and one of us suffers from a restricting disability. In tandem with that, on the morning of the 18th December the disabled rest room was locked, and a staff member refused to open it. My husband had to endure an excruciating walk down a steep flight of stairs to the restrooms. There were several staff on duty in the dining room. Their function seemed to be to guide guests to their table, then point them to a buffet to get their own breakfasts. We observed one elderly guest struggle to the breakfast serving area and a member of the public have to assist her to carry her breakfast tray back to her table. This was the most expensive hotel we have ever stayed in, and the most uncomfortable, worst value for a few hundred euro ever obtained. We certainly will not be going back.",1,2015,02,17
207,Birthday cocktails,"Called in to No 27 for birthday drinks. The 1st bar man was courteous but not overly friendly. He served us and to be fair the cocktail was amazing. It was one of the specials for February. We then got served by Josh. I mentioned it was my partners birthday and he arrived with a lovely plate of macaroons and happy birthday piped in chocolate. Thank you Josh..that was 5 star treatment and much appreciated.

207,The Only Place to Stay,"Unbeatable location and impeccable service are just a few hallmarks of this legendary hotel. Every element of this hotel is close to perfect. The breakfast is well proportioned and good. The vintage rooms take you back to a great time. And, the location is just central to everywhere in Dublin you need to visit.",5,2015,02,15
207,Classic grand hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night on business and it displayed all the charm and ambience of the old style grand hotel. The service was good, the room was good, if at the more compact end of the spectrum, and the service was all very good. One of the few hotels that I have stayed in on business that I would return to for pleasure.",5,2015,02,15
207,So Much Potential,"We visited Dublin the last 2 days of our trip to Ireland.  The hotel is beautiful and is in a great location.  It was very old but maintained well enough.  Checking in and out was efficient and painless.  The bell staff were polite and helpful.  The wifi was free for us and the signal was strong and fast enough.  I don't know if it's free for everyone though.  Logging in was easy enough, but we found it necessary to login randomly throughout our 2 night stay.  The room we stayed in was one of their less frills room but met our needs.  There is an outlet at the desk that accommodates 125 watt electronics. There wasn't an outlet in the bathroom though that would accommodate a hair dryer - just an outlet unique for European shavers.  If you want more space you'll need to upgrade and pay quite a bit more.  The room was next to an office building and parking lot.  We expected this room to be without a view.  Their website made it clear this room type would not have one.  We left the room to see the city.  And the hotel's location made it very easy to walk to the plethora of small restaurants up and down the street where the hotel is located - St. Stephen's Green.  This is the name of the city's largest park immediately across the street.  West a block was the shopping area on and around Grafton Street.  A 15 minute walk North of the hotel is the pub crawling part of town known as Temple Bar area.  The narrow cobblestone streets have been there for a very long time.  We walked all around the hotel area, including Temple Bar, but didn't go into any of the pubs.  It was our mission that evening to locate a quaint Italian Restaurant close to the hotel that served Chicken Parmigiane, Penne Pasta with Vodka Sauce, and Meatballs.  We never found the little restaurant we had hoped to find.  We did start out at Peploe's Wine Bar though.  We're thinking we should have stayed there for dinner because the wine choice seemed infinite and our appetizer to hold us over was delicious!  I understand that this wine bar is THE place to go for the locals, especially busy on a Friday night.  The potential I'm referring to for the hotel is the restaurant and bar food and service.  I do believe someone else referred to this in their review too. Believe what they said in their review.  My suggestion is to stay at this hotel in a room that fits your budget, but eat somewhere else.  We don't regret our stay though.  We did our homework and got what we expected.",4,2015,02,15
207,Afternoon Tea ,"Had afternoon tea here on Friday 13th and was left in no doubt as to the fact it's a 5 star hotel but none of the pretentious snobbery that can sometimes be associated with places of such a great reputation. Service was prompt and courteous and everything was explained. The food was excellent, small portions but lots of them and we were stuffed leaving. Our tea was always topped up and never left 'stale', the teapot was refilled with fresh tea 3 times during our visit.  It's not cheap but it's well worth the money. ",5,2015,02,15
207,Terrible nights sleep,"I stayed here for one night for a business trip and picked the Shelbourne for its central location. I was upgraded to a deluxe room and was pleased that it had recently been renovated.  The room was a good size with 2 double beds. I ate out and finally went to bed around 11. At 1.30 the family in the adjoining room returned, and preceded to have a very loud conversation. At 2.15 they turned on the TV, switched to a music channel and turned up the volume. I called down to the front desk, and they said that they would ask them to be considerate. However I found myself having to bury my head under the pillow to get any sleep. I can't blame the hotel for this, apart from the fact that the walls could be more soundproofed. Everything else was OK, but it ruined the stay. ",4,2015,02,13
207,a must,"From start to finish our stay at The Shelbourne was 1st class. On our arrival we were upgraded and I must say the room was magnificent. It had obviously undergone a recent majeover as the smell if fresh paint, not overwhelming, and wallpaper paste was evident. The staff were all nothing but courteous and friendly from the Doorman to Bar staff and everyone inbetween. Although a bit pricey The Shelbourne is an experience everyone should indulge in. We'll definitely be vack.",5,2015,02,12
207,afternoon tea,"We had a delightful afternoon at tea on a Friday afternoon.....we found that the manager, Adam Kirwan, was very pleasant and helpful.....our waitress, Katarzyana Szpicha, was a joy.  She even packed a few goodies to take home.  We loved it......it is a memory we cherish",5,2015,02,11
207,Delightful afternoon tea,"Having been disappointed with a previous visit and contacting Barbara my friend and I paid a return visit for afternoon tea . What a great treat . A total different experience . Thanks to all . Will return. Service was excellent , food very appetising .
",5,2015,02,11
207,One just cannot surpass perfection,Right from the very moment you enter the hotel by the rotating doors with the doormen already welcoming you to the hotel the experience is just extra special.  The bar with its splendid ceilings and fireplaces gives a lovely ambiance.  Afternoon tea is something of a treat but make sure you book in advance.,5,2015,02,11
207,Afternoon Tea at it's Finest :-),"What better way to spend an afternoon in Dublin then relaxing in the comfort of the Shelbourne hotel enjoying a sumptuous Afternoon Tea. Fantastic service, amazing food - Classically unstated elegance... The icing on the cake came in the form of the Amazing Birthday surprise served as we were leaving... We've tried the rest and can say without hesitation, The Shelbourne Hotel is most Definitely, The Best... Our only regret is not taking more notice of the Maître De & our servers names so we could thank them individually for their attention to detail... Thank you all for a delightful afternoon - we will return & will spread the word :-)",5,2015,02,10
207,Bad visit - shocking lack of follow up.,"I stayed here over Christmas 2014 with my nine year old daughter - review posted previously . Sadly the stay was a three star stay with 5 star prices  - €980 for two nights!

I raised all of the issues with the Manager of the Shelbourne via letter six weeks ago and again in a follow up email two weeks ago.

Shockingly for a hotel of its supposed caliber, ALL of my correspondence has been ignored.  I don't want a free stay and in fact i have no intention of revisting The Shelbourne, but I was hoping to at least receive an apology for the poor service we received  instead of a ""please contact us via Trip Advisor"" message that I saw after I had posted my review.  

This is not the Shelbourne I knew of old, but some new, chain with apparently awful customer services.
I began my career in customer service and am utterly shocked and disgusted not only by the terrible service received over Christmas but by the continued refusal to address the letters of complaint. 

I know that there was 100% occupancy over Christmas but that there were not enough staff rostered to cover customer requirements.  I also know that there was traffic chaos to such an extent that the Garda Siochana were  called on a number of occasions to allow buses to pass. Cars were mislaid from the valet garage etc etc. 

The television series detailing the five star service,  showing staff measuring cigars with rulers, filling rooms with roses for an engagement etc seems to be reserved for extremely wealthy customers who repeatedly stay there. For others like me who pay the exorbitant price of €980 for two nights for a three star service however,  it seems that service levels don't reach quite that high. I have no doubt that the customers featured in the television series would have been far from pleased to wait one and a half hours for breakfast,  over one hour for a wine cooler, an hour plus to check out and a further half hour waiting on a mislaid car. ",1,2015,02,10
207,60th Diamond wedding / Family celebrations,I would like to say that everything about our two night stay here was exceptional.  I had read some reviews before coming down and was beginning to get a bit worried. But all for no reason..our parents were given a complimentary suite instead of a deluxe room. They were overwhelmed by this as were we. I had e mailed the Guest relations Manager to see what they could do as a nice treat for my parents....after all it's not everyone is lucky to reach such a milestone in their lives.  We had our family meal for 16 people in a room off the Saddle Room restaurant and it was just perfect for the size of our group. Breakfast was excellent and the staff were all very friendly and helpful...,5,2015,02,10
207,Best bar in the world!,"The Shelbourne oozes classy history and charm.  Good food, good service, good facilities in a magnificent location on St Stephen's Green, close to all the great bars and restaurants.  And it has it's own great trophy, the best bar in the world.  The Long Bar.  A Dublin must!",5,2015,02,10
207,Timeless Classic !,"From entering this hotel until departure you are made to feel at home and nothing is too much trouble for the staff.
The place exudes class and finesse. The bars are excellent as is the food in the saddle room restaurant, whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner. 
In reality, although Dublin has loads to offer, there really is no reason to leave this place if you don't want to!
Can't wait to return next month for another weekend! Well done Shelbourne!!!",5,2015,02,09
207,Couldn't be better,"We are just back from The Shelbourne and I had to write this as I reviewed the hotel once before.

My wife and i stayed here for one night around the same time of year last year and while we had an amazing time in the hotel a less than ordinary room let us down. The last time I did book last minute so I feel that would explain the room. This time though we had a perfect 5Star room. very spacious considering its a city centre hotel, comfortable and quite. Everything else  I said about The Shelbourne last time remains standard, amazing breakfast, lovely staff, lively comfortable bars, just pure class

This really is a true 5Star hotel and we can't wait to come back again.",5,2015,02,09
207,Beautiful ,Stayed here with my husband last Saturday night.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful.  They very kindly upgraded our room as it was my birthday and I am heavily pregnant.  The staff are very friendly yet professional.  We will definitely be back.,5,2015,02,09
207,Great location and service,The Shelbourne Hotel's location on St. Stephen's Green places it at the heart of the shopping and cultural  area of Dublin and make it ideal for a short break in the city. If arriving by car I suggest that you avail of the valet parking as this ensures secure parking without the headache of finding an accessible garage and at €25 for the night is not outrageous. The parking attendant and the receptionist were friendly and we found ourselves in a well appointed room with all the necessary amenities. As the room faced in to one of the adjacent office blocks there was no view and little or no street noise.The superb bed ensured a good night's sleep. While we didn't eat in the hotel we found the bars to be somewhat disappointing as we had expected a lot more character and drinks prices are pitched at the upper end of the spectrum. Would we stay here again? Quite possibly.,4,2015,02,08
207,Great Irish hotel!! ,"Stayed here on Sat 7th Feb for one night. 

Apron arrival greater by reception and a glass of hot apple cider! 

Got a upgrade which was really kind of them. 

Great room, with great views plus it had everything we needed.

The best bit is the bar & lounge.

Sunday afternoon is jazz brunch, great way to spend a afternoon with a few good cocktails and chilling out! 

Will definitely be back even if it's just for the day!

Well done to everyone!  ",5,2015,02,08
207,Absolutely fabulous,Just stayed with group of friends absolutely fabulous from check in to check out staff could not do enough for us cannot wait to go back. At check in a good few of us were upgraded which was lovely touch. Hot juice and cookies at check in the little things make a difference highly recommend! !,5,2015,02,08
207,Fantastic hotel and fantastic service,"I have been in Shelbourne and I had a lunch in the Saddle Room Restaurant in the 5th of February and I have to say that I was very surprised to see the service provided by the all staff members, very professional and they prove the standards and quality of service and the Hotel is just amazing.....🌟💫
I have to say that I have been in other hotel 5* but there service was not very well presented but Shelbourne it prove the 5*
Well done
😊",4,2015,02,06
207,Legandary Hotel,"Stay regularly in this hotel during my time in Dublin. It is recommended and known by most people from Ireland. The hotel itself is a old building. It is also known as a luxury hotel with relatively higher prices. However you will find it to be unbeatable by any modern hotels in Dublin. The highlight of stay is the breakfast where you have a great range of choices with very high quality. It is just located next St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. I will highly recommend it, even to be the first destination in Ireland.",5,2015,02,05
207,The Shelbourne Experience,"As two best friends celebrating our birthdays, this year we decided on lunch at this wonderful  hotel. It began with a lovely warm Irish welcome, we proceeded to the dining room where the staff  pampered us. The atmosphere was so relaxing. The food Excellent, every mouth watering bite.It totally topped Angelina's Paris lunch. 
So for a girls special day out, no flights, no fuss, just step into the Shelbourne Experience.
A Special thank you to the waiter who brought us macaroons on a Chef's  Birthday plate.",5,2015,02,05
207,Perfect Dublin location,"Spent a very enjoyable 5 nights at the Shelbourne in September 2014. The location for visitors to Dublin can't be beaten. You're right in the centre of everything and all sights and attractions are easily accessible, most within walking distance.

The hotel was undergoing renovations at the time of my stay, but this didn't really impact apart from trying to get from the hotel to the fitness centre. The pool was wonderful and the fitness centre well-equipped. The spa looked great and I wish I had had more time to use it!

Staff were welcoming and friendly (apart from one rather snotty concierge) and the rooms are comfortable.

The hotel's history is fascinating and the little museum is well worth a visit.",5,2015,02,04
207,"Right in the centre of town, fantastic pool and fitness centre","This historic hotel is located right in the center of town on the park, within easy (and I mean easy) walking distance of the museums, shopping and the Temple Bar area.  The rooms are traditional and spacious, and the service superb. The one thing I noticed is that the room attendant totally respected the ""do not disturb"" sign - which is surprisingly rare. This is really appreciated for guests with transatlantic jet lag.   But the one thing that sets this hotel apart for me was the pool and fitness centre. This is a proper 25 meter pool, good for doing laps. It was never crowded, with a high ceiling and filled with light during the day. There is a great sauna and mint scented steam room as well.  Thank you Shelbourne for adding this wonderful modern fitness facility to a landmark property.",5,2015,02,03
207,spa day in hotel,"Myself and my two daughters went for a spa day in the Shelbourne Hotel.  We went for a swm in the health centre but had to leave due to the cold atmosphere and the cold water.  Left immediately to seek out somewhere warm.  Disappointing!!  The beauty salon was average, and the prices were expensive.  However, was sat in the relaxing room facing out to the green drinking fruit juice and it was beautiful.",3,2015,02,03
207,Awful Service,"This is a beautiful hotel with great amenities and a prime location, but I would never go back because the staff was so unwelcoming and unfriendly. We were here one day and night and came went several times and literally not one staff member even said hello to us the entire time aside from check in. We thought we might be treated better because my partner is a Starwood Platinum preferred guest who stays at Starwood hotels often. Nope. We got a room that was as far from the elevator as possible with a view of a car park even though the hotel was clearly empty. So much hate for this place.",1,2015,02,03
207,A Special Place,"We three arrived on Friday 2nd January 2015 - my wife and I plus 2 daughter - one of whom is in a wheelchair. We were in a queue for 30 mins before we got checked in. The average time it took to check in people to each room was 15-17 mins- why in this day of computers does it take that length of time per check in? Our check-in time was even longer as the suite I had booked several months before had mistakenly been allotted to another customer. However the receptionist was very apologetic about the matter and gave us a better suite. There was a constant queue to reception all Friday and most of Saturday which meant it was difficult to pass from one area of the hotel to another. It was overcrowded all weekend and it was nigh impossible to get a seat in the Horseshoe Bar or the Main bar in the evening. The hotel was recently renovated and updated - so we expected the room for our daughter to be excellent as it had been refurbished to suit a wheelchair. What a disappointment for her. The bed was about 18 ins higher than the wheelchair - so she could not transfer from chair to bed. It was incovenient to get into the bathroom due to position of door. While the bathroom was fitted out very well with a new wet room and low hand basin, all the mirrors were at height well above wheelchair level. I just wonder what the architect was thinking of when he drew up the new plans for that particular room.It is however still a very special place to stay but they need to quickly sort out the check in procedures.",4,2015,02,03
207,Another Wonderful Stay in the Faultless Shelbourne,"Thank you, yet again, to all the wonderful staff at the beautifully luxurious Shelbourne Hotel.

This time I was lucky enough to enjoy my stay in one of their most beautiful suites which overlooks St. Stephens Green.  

You enter from the exquisite hallway into a beautiful sitting area with its large flat-screen TV, comfortable couch and armchairs, beautiful décor and nespresso coffee facility.  

From here you are led into a very large bedroom which has two double beds, another large flat-screen TV, more than enough wardrobe area with shoe-shine, ironing board etc.

Finally, the beautiful bathroom which is off the bedroom area with its lovely large shower ... or, you can enjoy a salts bath - salts kindly provided for your convenience.

All three rooms have a very large window which overlooks the green.  

It was a blissful stay and I found it really difficult to check out on Sunday morning.

Staff, service, food, quality, cleanliness, space, atmosphere ... all exceptional. 

While this hotel has very high standards, you can 'be yourself' and enjoy the pleasure of staying here or even visiting.  By no means should anyone feel uncomfortable here - the hotel is in no way 'stuffy'.

Thank you again and I look forward to my next visit.",5,2015,02,03
207,not quite up to 5 stars,"We had after noon tea in the shelbourne to celebrate our daughters 12th and 13 th birthdays. There were 2 mums and 2 kids. After some confusion in what menu was available for the children when booking and dealing with a very rude receptionist on the phone we finally got there. Unfortunately all in all the experience did not quite live up to the 5 star status this hotel has. Whilst the room and ambience was beautiful, the service was a bit hit and miss and the specific children's afternoon tea ( a Paddington one) in my opinion didn't really have children's taste buds in mind. Whilst the finger sandwiches were lovely and the hot chocolate good (although it didnt come with marshmallows as stated on menu) There were a number of very rich cakes made with dark chocolate which frankly the children found too rich (and I would consider these children young foodies!). Quite disappointing.",4,2015,02,02
207,Special Shelbourne,"I don't typically like older style hotels but the Shelbourne might be able to convert me. A fantastic location, just opposite St Stephen's Green and literally five minutes to Grafton Street. It's a slightly awkward walk through to reception towards the back of the hotel but our welcome was warm and check in was efficient. Our room on the 8th floor was great - quiet as we'd asked for, and warm 
and luxurious with plenty of space. Lovely Elemis bath products. The gym and pool are a little fiddly to get to (different
corridors/lifts) but once there it was well organised and functional. Breakfast wasn't just breakfast it was an occasion. Buffet style in parts but also with a la carte options included in a B and B stay. Truly outstanding service and quality. Tip - grab a booth seat as you go in on the left. The Bar was great, buzzing and fun. We arrived about 2130 and it was moderately busy, by 2300 it was packed. There is no free parking so these costs can quickly add up. All in all a really, really great stay with wonderful, charming people. The Shelbourne - Irish hospitality at it's best. Can't wait to go back. ",5,2015,02,02
207,Guests are not a priority here,"Extremely disappointed and a little angry if I am to be completely honest here. This is the Shelbourne after all. A five star hotel publicised at length recently for its attention to detail and 5 start service. Well accommodation wise maybe (bedroom was very nice). Service and facilities? Definitely not. After queuing 15 minutes (!) to check in, we came down from our room to relax in the hotel and planned to have a coffee and light lunch. The bar was full so we went  across the lobby to the lounge. ""Sorry, this is reserved for afternoon tea guests only"" No room at that inn so we went back to the bar. There were no available tables but a couple were leaving and beckoned us to their table whereupon a waitress pounced on us, saying there were people ahead of us, also waiting. No problem, I said and politely asked where we, as residents, could go in the hotel to sit down, get a cup of coffee and have lunch? Try the horseshoe bar we were told and on getting directions we once again traversed the lobby to find that said same bar was closed....and this is what really annoyed me...the opening times were listed on the door, opening at 3pm.......so why did that waitress send me there at 2pm when she knew well enough it would be closed? What was I, an inconvenience? What is the point of having five star accomodation when no priority is given to residents? It seems that the walk-in trade may be more important and this hotel clearly does not have the capacity to facilitate both so would-be guests reading this review, you are paying for a very expensive bed but will have to take pot luck on the service. To follow on.....returning to the bar that night, again no seats available so we perched on a windowsill and waited for our better halves to return with our drinks.....and waited.....and waited. My partner returned fuming, holding a very dodgy looking pint of guinness  which he said he had to order twice and then is was just pulled and set down on the counter in front of him. What 5 star hotel employs bar staff who cannot pull a pint of guinness properly? Next morning, after informing reception their super-duper electronic check out system did not work.....we again said we would have a cup of coffee before embarking on the journey home..........sorry, bar closed and afternoon tea only being served in the lounge..................(Stayed 31st Jan)",3,2015,02,02
207,Amazing Hotel and Wonderfull Staff,"Shelbourne has a class. The staff are amazing, the service is sublime and the food is great. One of their managers is wonderfull "" Stephen Hanley"". I just want to say Thank you for  bringing this class to Dublin! Amazing Hotel!!",5,2015,02,01
207,Not what I expected !,"Our children gave us a surprise voucher for an overnight stay, dinner and breakfast so we decided to avail of it Sun 25 Jan 2015. On arrival we were very impressed, our room was on 3rd floor it was really nice. We went for dinner which was again lovely but not memorable.
We were surprised to see our itemised bill on the floor
The following morning given that it was a gift , but there was no mention of the voucher.
We queried this at reception and were asked for our voucher. We explained we had given it to the lovely young receptionist the night before, she asked us what was her name? What did she look like? Before she even looked in her files for the voucher. I couldn't believe it !! It was sorted eventually but at no point was there an apology and I felt this was far below the standard you would expect from a top hotel.  
The breakfast was a disappointment. We went down at 9.30 To find it so disorganised, we were walking constantly up and down, there was a queue of people standing at breakfast counter waiting on eggs to be cooked. By the time we sat down, we had to wait again for a waitress to bring out tea/ coffee and toast. In the midst of this the smoke alarm went off, on 3 different occasions we were given different instructions, by the restaurant manager and the waitress to follow a porter, to sit down, to leave again .. It was a false alarm but at this point our food was cold. Despite this , it is a beautiful hotel and in a fantastic location but I think we were just unfortunate on the day.

207,The best of the best,Had a most wonderful supper in the Shelbourne. Such a dream occasion. Felt and was treated as though I was a Queen. The food was so well presented and the staff were so attentive but not intrusive. The Piano player was so delightful and added positively to the evening.,5,2015,01,31
207,A dream on The Green…(and no need to ‘tread softly’!),"It was a dream come true for us to stay at The Shelbourne in December (2014). The big Dublin “Failte” began at the front door (itself a local icon) as half of Dublin seemed to be tumbling in past the friendly doormen and the other half tumbling out to take in the lights of Grafton Street or the Christmas Market in front. The welcome continued with a glass of mulled cider and shortbread while, despite the obvious busy-ness, the wonderfully calm Receptionist organised a beautiful room for us. Recently decorated - as it seems the Shelbourne is undergoing a tasteful and appropriately discreet facelift befitting such a grande dame of Ireland’s capital city- it offered luxury and space as well as peace and quiet to sleep off the evenings out in the excellent restaurants, bars, cafés and shops on the doorstep.

Afternoon Tea was booked out for our weekend but it certainly looked the business! Mind you, the huge choice at breakfast would certainly keep anyone going for the day. Spending a little time in its own historic bars, or chatting to the Concierge brought alive some of the Shelbourne’s place in history. The highlight was visiting the Constitution Room where dreams were made real on paper for a nascent Republic. (The little Museum in the Foyer is also worth a visit if you like Irish History.)

Once again, the staff are an essential part of the ambience and welcome. Everything was “no bother”. They - and the Hotel itself - manage to make an environment already “alive, alive oh!” with Christmas parties and celebrations in one of Europe’s most vibrant cities feel at the same time like a stay at a wonderful Country House.  There were peaceful nooks and crannies for residents while the flowers and Christmas decorations everywhere were simply magical. 

It was a special occasion for us, a dream which has now become a lovely memory, and we made the right choice in The Shelbourne. She remains a leading light in the many charms of Dublin’s ‘Fair City’.",5,2015,01,30
207,Top Class Stay....,"Rooms big, bathroom stunning, breakfast fantastic, staff polite & helpful, great meeting facilities & in a great location in a great city. Yes it is slightly expensive & probably a 4 star but with all of the above & a gym etc you get what you pay for.",4,2015,01,30
207,2nd time lucky,"If you check my earlier reviews you will see I have a less than favourable review previously of this hotel.
We were given a gift of 2 nights last weekend and have to say we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
Room was excellent (we were upgraded following our earlier problems) which I have to say was excellent customer service. 
Staff were great, always a smile and nothing too much bother.
Thanks to the customer service the hotel has gained back a guest who will stay again instead of losing one following previous experience.
A great stay. ",5,2015,01,28
207,Superb,"Service, Quality attention to detail second to none. The location was perfect the staff were excellent and the room was ideal. Afternoon tea was a pleasure. The facilities around the hotel are excellent with St stephens green for a stroll ,the hustle and bussle of the shops on grafton street, the local centres and the variety of places to eat and be entertained outside of the hotel. The walking tours of Dublin take in some historic locations close to the hotel.

207,5 stars for a 5 star hotel !,"Everyone should, if they are so lucky stay in the Shelbourne at least once, the hotel is gorgeous, a true Dublin gem! The staff are most helpful & friendly. The rooms are big spacious & pure luxury. The pool/leisure centre is very nice, & the hotel has so mush history attached that its so worth the visit just to know who stayed there. The breakfast area is very spacious & has a fine selection to suit all tastes. It even has an inhouse barber shop!!",5,2015,01,27
207,Careful telling the cabbies you're staying at the Shelbourne House!,"Some of them may punish you with a few extra kilometers to run up the meter, as recompense for the incredible experience you'll have here.  [You're being deposited at one of the premier hotels of Dublin and, as much as I made mention each time I was left here, that I was staying on a Marriott Rewards redemption, it didn't seem to help!]

So, being here on a Rewards Redemption, there wasn't any scarlet letter on my chest that said I should get something less than the treatment of the cash paying guest staying in a suite.  Those on staff who knew I was here on redemption treated me as well as if one of the cash paying guests.

Here are some of the fine points of the hotel:

1.  An embarrassment of riches-- 3 members of ""Les Clef d'Or"".  You can search ""Shelbourne"" at the Irish chapter of Les Clef d'Or: http://www.goldenkeysireland.com/members/ and get an email address, name to personalize requests, and pictures to place the name to the face.  Anytime I am in a hotel and have special needs, if I'm in a leading hotel, I search for the golden key on the lapel and make a bee line to that concierge.  One of these gentleman got me a hard to get ticket to a play the day of my arrival on short notice, had it delivered to my room, and the charge added to my bill for the ticket.  USE THE CONCIERGE SERVICES BUT SEEK OUT THE GOLDEN KEY ON THE LAPEL!

2.  Unbelievable location for being on foot, and first class facilities.  Trinity College and the Book of Kells perhaps 12 minutes walk away.  National Archaeological museum perhaps 5 minutes away. [Go see the bog men!  They have several and the displays are fascinating.]  Temple Bar area maybe 20 minutes away.  Great shopping 10 minutes away.  A great theater 5 minutes away.  Fine dining steps away outside, or in the hotel.  An incredible indoor pool, gym, sauna, steam bath.  And, out the front door, across the street, St. Stephen's Green. 

3.  Related to unbelievable location, getting good information is always fantastic, so, when one of the destination experts for Dublin, http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/members-forums/Professor_Sparrow, had responded to a forum posting I had made in advance of my trip to Dublin and suggested PaddyWagon tours for day trips, his information was spot on.  I took several.  All were great.   But an extra benefit from staying at the Shelbourne is it is well situated to that pick up point at the Tourist Office on Suffolk Street . . . where you will find some good information!  So, you definitely need visit that office for materials you can find that will inform you on things you will not find in guide books.  Here's a link:  http://www.visitdublin.com/dublin-a-to-z/details/dublin-discover-ireland-centre-suffolk-street/73794/.

4.  Staff in all departments were excellent.  My room was being serviced on check-in by a lovely soul, a middle aged woman from the Philippines.  Don't remember her name.  But, she was simply so kind and gracious.  If housecleaners had a membership organization like Les Clef d'Or, she would be president!

5.  Small touches that prove you're in a leading hotel of the world, not just Ireland, like this one:  take your mail to the front desk, and you'll find that you do not have to pay for the postage.  I sent 5 or 6 letters and post cards home during my 5 nights stay here, on two occasions, and each time was refused my offer to pay for the postage.  It's an amenity for staying here.  Now, if I were trying to ship a box of gifts, I'd like to think they'd refuse; but, the service is remarkable that they did what they did.  

The Shelbourne experience is to be experienced, not read.  I'll be back this summer, if all goes well, and hope to share that experience with my daughter who plans a summer art program in Ireland.",5,2015,01,26
207,"Overrated, 4 star at best.","Highly disappointing and it is not 5 star, although the prices are very much 5 star. The room was tiny, you could not swing a cat. While understandably a historic hotel it looks tired and dated. Someone needs to get the revolving door seen to - watching people getting in and out via this small rickety door was comical, including my own entrances and exits. Staff are good and welcoming - although requesting a vase to the room for a bouquet of flowers seems a tall order by the grimace and 'I will see what I can do for you' response from the concierge. The horseshoe bar is tiny and pitch black. The other bar had half of its capacity booked out for an 80th and as such there was no where to sit for residents. In my honest opinion the hotel is not a 5 star, is massively overpriced for what you get, the rooms (our room) was so small it was not even funny, many of the staff are good, some we found hard to understand their accent and we found them abrupt and lacked an understanding of Irish hospitality. I would never stay here again and I would not recommend it. This Marriot hotel let me down. It will be The Westbury Hotel as usual next time.",2,2015,01,26
207,Superb Hotel,"This hotel is the best hotel I've ever stayed in.  The staff are so helpful, the rooms are spotless, you feel so welcome.  When we arrived we were greeted outside by our name and brought inside by the concierge who was brilliant.  They called around to our room to see if everything was okay.  The food was brilliant.  All in all I would highly recommend the Shelbourne hotel as a place to stay in luxury. ",5,2015,01,25
207,TRUE PERFECTION,"Stayed one Night 24th January.
From start to finish everything was 5 Star Quality. Special Thanks to all at reception. Esp. Kelly & Sarah. Food was amazing for dinner, breakfast was truly out of this world. Shelbourne Pancakes just taste of heaven. Both myself and wife had the best anniversary ever.
Thank you all. Highly recommend.",5,2015,01,25
207,Disappointed,"Stayed at Shelbourne last night as a birthday surprise. Stayed here a couple of years ago as well so was looking forward to visiting again. Whilst the room was nice, I was let down in a few areas especially given the 5 star status and price of rooms. We had a drink at the the main bar at 3pm after checking in and the girl who served us could not even tell us what bottled beers they had when we asked. Then she went to find out but disappeared for 10 minutes and we could not see any staff despite the bar being full of patrons. This seemed pretty unusual given there were around 10 staff in reception as we arrived. That evening we sat in the residents lounge for a few drinks but despite there being 5 or 6 staff in there, it was impossible to get any of their attention to order a drink or indeed a second one despite the lounge being quiet. They seemed to spend more time chatting and fluffing cushions than spending any attention in residents. Finally we had pre paid our breakfast the night before but gave up the fight when we saw the queues and 20-30 minutes wait to get a table. There were 5 or 6 staff milling around like busy bees but none of them addressed us as we stood at the top of the queue for 5 minutes. We overheard them speaking about the wait and decided to go elsewhere for our breakfast. Lastly we tried to go into the residents lounge for a coffee at 11.30am but were told we couldn't as all the tables were set up for afternoon tea. When I asked the staff member if there was any other lounge we could go to, she said we could go in the bar but it was not open yet. I have to say between the combination of inattentive staff in the bar and residents lounge and the whole breakfast experience, I would not be rating our experience as 5 star and would certainly not pay the room and drinks prices again.",2,2015,01,24
207,Romantic Break,"Just had a delightful break to celebrate my wifes birthday. The hotel was  everything that I would expect of a five star Hotel. 

We stayed in their newly refurbished rooms which was oppulent and tasteful. 

The  staff were knowledgeable which one would expect. However, a special thanks to Ian at the concierge who came up with a couple of great restaurant recommendations.

Before I forget, the late checkout time of 12 was a bonus.",5,2015,01,24
207,disappointing stay,"We stayed for 3 nights. We had hoped to stay in the confines of the hotel for dinner but we were unable to book dinner in any of the restaurants on any night. No prior notice was given that advance reservations would be needed which many hotels suggest during busy periods. I could have booked a few days in advance had I known it was required.

The service in the bar was very poor. Bar staff avoided eye contact and we ultimately had to find our own table when two parties jumped the queue despite waitresses promising us the next table. I made it known to one of the managers when I checked out and was told they would email me but I have yet to hear anything. For the first time in my life I sent an email of disappointment to the general manager.

The room and its facilities were top notch but I do think hotel guests should get priority in the restaurants.",3,2015,01,24
207,Lovely hotel,Stayed here for business last week and cannot fault it. Have stayed a few times before and this is my go to hotel in Dublin. It is in a great central location and really rather grand. I will be back without doubt!,4,2015,01,24
207,Lovely ,"We stayed around the middle of december. The hotel was extremely busy with a good atmosphere. Decorations were  lovely in the entrance. Room very clean although small and the bathroom smaller again, this was expected for a dublin city hotel. Breakfast we had delivered to the room probaly not the best idea in a compact room☺ a very enjoyable stay overall. ",5,2015,01,23
207,The Shelbourne - Grand Old Lady on the Green has a secret,"The Shelbourne presents history, a distinctively Irish welcome and attention, from the first moment to the last. The Shelbourne's face and heart are local, national and Irish to the core. The pace and touch are Dublin itself. We stood in line to register and everything slowed down - not because the service was poorly managed but because each person was treated individually and attentively, without rush or pressure, because each person is welcomed as if no one else were there. And that takes time. I can't recommend it highly enough, unless you are still rushed and distracted.

Having lived in Dublin for years and returned for a longish stay, I learned a secret. The No. 27 bar pulls the best pint of Guinness in town. I tried many through the years. I don't know how they manage it. But hands down, the best pint is in the Shelbourne. No joke. Try it and see.",5,2015,01,21
207,afternoon tea,"after having afternoon tea at the westbury for our wedding anniversary earlier in the week we super indulged by having another one at the shelbourne hotel yesterday!
beautiful grand venue - slightly spoilt by the 500 delegates conference they were having , most of the deals seemed to have been done in the lobby and oyster bar from what we could overhear. despite that the afternoon tea was amazing.
good selection of teas - i started off with the chai - and my husband had the irish breakfast. different to the westbury in that they keep it on a candle burner so the tea can be quite strong by the 3rd cup. small teapots so tha you can keep trying the teas. unlike the westbury, didnt have any hot chocolate on the menu. again were very accomodating to our dietary requirements
sandwiches included egg mayo and hummus on french bread, goats cheese and tomato, smoked salmon. all delicious and could ask for more.
then the desserts were brought out
warm buttermilk scones  - plain and fruit
warmed fruit bread - came with strawberry jam and devon clotted cream and butter
not as soft as the westbury (which i prefer) but tasty all the same. fruit bread scrumptious
we didnt have the sherry trifle but had extra coffee praline crunch and carrot cake
the carrot cake could've done with walnuts. coffee praline pyramid was soft and chocolatey and coffee-y and massive. banana macaroon was huge but bit too sweet for me. my husband devoured his. we were defeated by the tea so had a few bits packed for us to take away - great idea.
hubby had mocha which was great and the latte i had at the end was good
service unfortunately  was a bit slow
nice touches included fine decorative bone china and a proper butter knife
i would still go back there and highly recommend it as the surroundings really make it special despite my own food preferences. would definitely consider staying here too",5,2015,01,21
207,Special treat so go ahead,Our second time in this lovely historic hotel. Again very busy so bars not always comfortable or easy to get a seat. Room was recently refurbished and of a very good standard. Again breakfast was a bit hectic and don't like the idea of standing waiting for egg order. Still for location its history and lovely staff it wins.,4,2015,01,20
207,Elegant Afternoon Tea and Supper in The Lord Mayor's Lounge,"As a special treat for our silver wedding anniversary we had champagne afternoon tea in The Lord Mayor's Lounge. What an experience it was, just wonderful. The staff were attentive and polite and friendly and put us at our ease straight away. The champagne was served in a beautiful modern flute and was served with the savourys four tasty topped different types of breads and toppings (delicious). There was a vast choice of teas, I went for Earl grey and Eddie had coffee and our cups were filled constantly throughout our tea. Then came the three tiered cake plate with the most delicious fancies. There were chocolate pyramids, banana macaroons,trilfes, a fancy carrot cake and also hot scones and fruit bread. A bowl of jam, cream and butter completed this dream dessert plate. I have to say we made a good effort to get through it but were beaten in the end.They do offer to pack up anything you leave so you can take it with you, which is very nice of them. 
While we were there we were told about the Suppers nights available in The Lord Mayor's Lounge. At only €30  per person an included a glass of wine. We returned on a Thursday evening and tried it and it was excellant. As they explained it is only supper so do not go expecting a big dinner. You get a big choice of three course and they all come out together served individually on a hot platter. You also get a large bread basket with several types of lovely bread. Just to give you the idea of it. I had a shrimp cocktail a surf and turf steak and a bowl of prfiteroles in chocolate sauce.Eddie has salmon and crab mousse, Steak with onion rings and bearnaise sauce and also had the profiteroles.  All of it was delicious. Highly recommended.",5,2015,01,20
207,Nice historic hotel,"Great hotel for history, an imposing building in a great location. We stopped early December for 3 nights starting with a Saturday. Only down side was it had two great bars but getting in was difficult never mind getting a seat. Loved the experience of this historic hotel though.",4,2015,01,19
207,Absolutely stunning hotel,"Everything about this hotel was perfection. I had booked two nights for my fiancé's birthday and contacted the hotel beforehand to see if a Birthday plate could be arranged. I received a response from Barbara straight away, who was friendly and very professional. Not only did Barbara arrange a complimentary plate with delicious cakes, she also arranged an upgrade to a beautiful suite. Such an excellent, accommodating member of staff. We requested an ice bucket and some champagne glasses which were also promptly delivered to the room.

The decor in the building is classic and so well maintained. The bars are very popular and serve amazing cocktails. Everything was quick and efficient, from check in to check out. The turn down service is great and a really nice touch. The location is also excellent, directly across from St Stephen's Green and a minute's walk from Grafton Street.

Cannot wait to return to this truly five star hotel.",5,2015,01,19
207,"Afternoon tea, beautiful but a little rushed","We enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea here. The surrounds made the experience very special. Food was lovely & service was very friendly and attentive.
Only con would be the limited time you have for the experience. We were told when we sat down (having booked it weeks in advance) that we had to be finished within 90 mins for the next sitting.

Understandably the hotel is busy for afternoon tea with lots of people waiting for their booking, but at almost €50 a head for the champagne tea (one glass) I don't think it should be so rushed.
We would have liked to stay at least another 30 minutes and if asked I would have had more champagne.  (Timing allowing).",4,2015,01,19
207,Too busy in Dec!,My husband and I stayed here as a treat in December for one night B&B. Fantastic location. I was a little disappointed with the charge of 25euro to have our car parked but leaving it on the street in the city center clamping area was not an option. On arrival the place was absolutely packed and check in took quite a while. We got up to our room which was spotless - huge and really quiet. No view from room - just buildings but that was ok. We left to get dinner and do some shopping and returned. We went to the bar to have a cocktail. I had a pina colada and unfortunately I had to return it. It was very poorly made and tasteless - they hostess was lovely and replaced it with a mojito. Again very average/bland. I was disappointed especially seeing as they are so expensive. We had a dessert also - a chocolate souffle which was delicious. I have to say the bed was one of the nicest i have ever slept in - so so comfortable. The next day we went down for breakfast and we were asked to wait in the bar area. Not a long wait just five minutes. Then we went into a buffet style set up which i have to say was a little chaotic - lots of people bustling around and I felt quite rushed. I waited near the cooking area for my poached eggs and felt a little in the way. Definitely not a 5star breakfast experience. We then went for a swim and stayed in the water about 10minutes - the water was sooooo cold it was unpleasant and the towels we were given on entry were damp like they had already been used. Overall it was a pleasant experience but there were things that let it down. It is not cheap to stay here and I felt we had overpaid for what we had received. I would stay here again but at a quieter time of year.,4,2015,01,18
207,Luxury treat,Stayed in hotel in January for one night. Hotel was full and v busy but the service and attention we received was excellent.  We enjoyed afternoon tea which I would highly recommend. Will definitely be looking forward to my next trip here!,5,2015,01,18
207,5 star by name 5 star by nature,My wife and i spent a beautiful Saturday in Dublin staying at the Shelbourne what a beautiful hotel in a beautiful part off Dublin the staff are so friendly and theres plenty of craic to be had in the two bars they have the food is top class and what a breakfast also the restaurants and bars are great just within a 2000 yard radius off the hotel well worth a visit,5,2015,01,18
207,Perfect!,"Enjoyed lovely night again in the Shelbourne.  Booked two twin rooms for myself and my daughters and found we were up-graded with two beautiful rooms with inter-connecting doors!

The room was warm, cosy with everything you could want including  fluffy  bathrobes and slippers.  I found the huge single bed to be extremely comfortable and enjoyed a great night's sleep.  

We enjoyed a drink in the bar before going out for a meal.  Drink is expensive but it IS a 5star hotel!

The piece de resistance for me is the breakfast.  Along with the usual fruit, cereals and hot food  they have a lovely a la carte menu and I thoroughly enjoyed their delicious French toast.  Its also possible to order a latte instead of a pot of coffee and it comes exactly as ordered as I like it piping hot!  Staff at breakfast were extremely attentive and obliging.

Looking forward to our next trip to the Shelbourne already!",5,2015,01,17
207,One night stay,"We stayed here on our first night in Dublin. Whilst the hotel is very well located, we had to wait to check in and then the room we were allocated was very small with a view of office blocks. However it was clean although there was not a lot of room for two large bags for international travellers. Breakfast was adequate although slow. We took it in the bar where it was nice to enjoy the natural light. The staff were friendly but be warned, the hotel is very big. To get to our room we had to travel through a rabbit warren of small corridors.",3,2015,01,17
207,A Gem of a Hotel on the Emerald Isle,"I stayed in the Shelbourne for three nights in October 2014 with a group of friends. Ideally located across from St Stephen's Green it is a luxurious place that retains its Irish roots. Two great bars, popular with guests and locals alike, a great lunch and dinner menu and a typical buffet and a la carte breakfast choice made it a very pleasant stay! The leisure centre was well equipped and the staff were all very friendly. Not cheap - but we felt that we definitely got what we paid for!",5,2015,01,16
207,Nice to come back after 4 years,"This was my second stay at this beautiful and impressive hotel, I first stayed in 2011 and I promised myself that I would return here one day. I was excited to be back here and was welcomed with a newly renovated room with two double beds and some welcome water bottles and chocolates, which also came each evening. I was able to have a look at the famous constitution room and other historic areas of the hotel. This is a perfect hotel and the exceptional staff and management should be proud of this star in the Marriott family. Once again I hope one day I can walk through the glorious lobby again.",5,2015,01,16
207,Well worth a stay,"Over all my experience was excellent. On arrival staff were pleasant and helpful. The room was well laid out and well presented. Bags brought up to our room promptly and we got free upgrade without asking which always helps!! The room was large with all modern equipment, good Wi-Fi, flat screen TVs. Bath large with walking shower, and the room was spotless. Even with all mod cons it has still kept its huge character and history intact. 
We had breakfast in our room which again was on time well-presented and well cooked. 
Only issue I found was with trying to check out using your in room check out service , I found it slow and it did not give a clear message to say that, the checkout was completed , which meant I had to check at reception which kind of defeated the purpose. 
One other item which let them down a bit was the service in the Horse shoe bar, it was slow and the bar was attended for periods of time, and it was not particularly busy at the time either. This about 7pm at Saturday evening. 
Both issues I found where small but at the high standard set by this hotel I believe small things easy things like this let them down. Over well worth a stay, it’s expensive but its 5 star you pay for what you get and over all we got v value for money.",4,2015,01,13
207,wonderful stay,"Stayed in this hotel prior to Christmas and enjoyed it very much, this is a beautiful hotel with loads of charm and splendor. The staff were very pleasant and attentive throughout our stay. The room we had was beautiful very comfortable and large enough for us complete with loads of Christmas shopping. The room was quiet with an excellent air con system, large well equipped bathroom. We had breakfast the next morning in the Saddle room which was amazing it was a mix of self service buffet and table service. The location of this hotel is spectacular and the fact the new Christmas Market at Stephens Green was on only added to our enjoyment of our stay. Thank you Shelbourne and we look forward to staying with you in the future.",5,2015,01,13
207,Exceptional ,"This hotel is outstanding. The small things really make it. The staff are exceptional, friendly and more than helpful. Rooms are absolutely beautiful. Can't wait to go back. A special mention for Conor on reception and Adam working in the Lord Mayors room on the10/1/15 both excellent at their jobs. ",5,2015,01,13
207,Old World Charm,"What a beautiful, classic, historic hotel. The staff was very professional ( Maria at reception was particularly cheerful and helpful.). The location made it walkable to so many places, eateries, and the gorgeous St. Stephen's Green is just across the street.",5,2015,01,13
207,Exquisite in Every Detail - Don't Miss It!,"Do NOT miss the opportunity to stay at this absolutely gorgeous classic and accommodating hotel - an attraction in itself.  This just might be the most spectacular hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in and my favorite on our tour of Ireland. Accommodating and professional staff and a perfect location near St. Stephen's Green - your are close to museums and attractions, restaurants, pubs and shopping which are easy walking distance.   We had 2 rooms, both newly remodeled, and although different in design, the exquisite finishes were similar.  I loved the way the details were thought out with travelers in mind.  For instance, there was an audio volume in the bathroom, and the sconces on each side of the mirror and sink vanity, separate from the overhead light, had a dimmer so that you could set a low light for a romantic bath in the soaking tub or to leave the lights on low in order to easily find the bathroom in the night.  There were even bath salts in a mother of pearl dish with wooden scooper - so thoughtful and beautiful and the list goes on and on!  The recreation and spa facilities were amongst the best I have experienced with a huge pool (maybe Olympic length?) yoga/pilates/weight studio, and many different machines all around the perimeter of the pool  as well as steam and sauna rooms - spectacular, and the hours were very accommodating - 6 AM to 10 PM.  There were many public places that were finished in the most elaborate fashion, to sit and relax, eat, or grab a drink or snack at the bar, and a functional wood burning fireplace off the entryway with comfortable arm chairs.  This is a place I just had no desire to leave - highly recommended.",5,2015,01,11
207,Excellent facilities and highly professional staff,"I spent one night at the Shelbourne in early Jan 2015 and had a very positive experience. The hotel public areas are in very good condition and my room was a good size, clearly recently refurbished with a fantastic marble bathroom, effective shower and nice Elemis products. The gym is a bit tucked away but well equipped and with a reasonably sized pool which was a positive surprise. The food was excellent  both dinner and the very good buffet breakfast. Most of the time, I find that the food In a cooked buffet breakfast is not taken care of, the bacon is often uncooked and swimming in fat and generally unappetising for example, but not here. Among the best hotel breakfasts I've had.
In terms of front of house, the staff were very friendly, helpful and professional.
I would recommend the Shelbourne to anyone looking for a good quality premium stay in Dublin.
Thanks to the team for making it enjoyable too.",5,2015,01,11
207,Dublin at Christmas,Stayed at the luxury hotel and was treated like royalty.  Room was comfortable.  One issue was the bathroom entrance had an incline that was bad as a tripping problem at nighttime.  Restaurants were very good and not as pricey as one would have thought.  Area was lit up for Christmas and a walkers paradise with street performers on Grafton St and high end shopping.  Would go back again only on points again as it is very pricey.,5,2015,01,10
207,Dreadful experience,"The worst five star experience I have ever encountered!
 Stayed 2 days over the Christmas period for 2 nights B/B & 1 dinner. When we checked in we were told we had only booked Room Only  with 1 Dinner. No one came back to us to resolve the incorrect information and had to go down a second time to show evidence of the email confirmation. The second day went down again to reception and was told there had been an error on their system , but that it had been resolved and we would be on the breakfast list from now on.  Both mornings we were never on the breakfast list and embarrassed every morning we went down for breakfast.
There was no turn down service in the evenings, no bins emptied or fresh towels in the evening so you had to use the same wet towels in the morning after the night before.
No concierge offered to bring the cases up to the rooms.
Would not recommend the Shelbourne hotel to anyone after the experience we had!",1,2015,01,10
207,Great Christmas in the shelbourne.,"Myself my wife and 3kids checked into the shelbourne Christmas eve.we felt right at home straight away.the staff were so friendly and attentive to the kids.our room was a fabulous suite.the atmosphere was lovely and so festive in the hotel.family came an joined us Christmas day for a beautiful Christmas dinner.we got a few lovely extra treats in the room at bedtime.there was great attention to detail.we also enjoyed a complimentary drinks reception before dinner.my only negative remark I had ,was the lack of entertainment Christmas night,which was voiced by a few other guests we spoke to.all in all we really loved our stay.always 5star standards every time we have stayed with the shelbourne.",5,2015,01,09
207,Pure Luxury in Dublin City,"We had a one night post Christmas break at The Shelbourne and it was a magnificent stay, fabulous room and excellent staff and service. Particular thanks to the reception, car valet staff and concierge Denis O'Brien who was an encyclopedia of information about Dublin and made great recommendations for our stay. Rooms exceptional and beds the ultimate in comfort. Location was the best , just steps from shopping in Grafton St and 
fabulous restaurants. We will be back! ",5,2015,01,09
207,A good nights sleep:,The beds are so comfortable ; i slept for 10 hrs. straight. It showed up the shortcomings of my own bed at home which i will be throwing out when i get home. Room a bit small but WELL appointed and cozy. Bathroom sink a bit low.....  Great service at this hotel. Centrally located.,4,2015,01,09
207,Absolutely great,"Excellent experience, perfect up to the smallest details from arrival till departure, good location.
The room was great, big corner room with all assets and luxury we needed.
The beds are rather hard, not my thing, but that's the only negative remark I can make.
Breakfast was super, for 15€ you have a lot of choice.
Everybody was very friendly and nice.
Thanks for the great stay, we'll be back.",5,2015,01,08
207,Beautiful hotel,We were in Dublin between Christmas and New Year.  The Shelbourne is a very lovely hotel in the perfect location.  The service was excellent from the moment we emerged from our taxi and although we were very early we were able to leave our suitcases.  We realised there were weddings the whole time we were there so asked for our room to be as far away as possible from any noise there may be.  We decided to have breakfast in the hotel before starting our sightseeing which was lovely.We had decided to take our evening meals in the hotel but hadn't been informed that there was a set festive menu and not the al a carte menu we had seen on the website.  This was a little disappointing but it was too late to book anywhere else.  Saying that the food and the service was excellent.  My only other gripe was that there was nowhere comfortable to really sit and relax after a day sightseeing and have a cup of tea unless you had booked way in advance for the set tea in the lounge. We were eventually told of a room upstairs where they would bring us some tea.  After I had a very small polite moan about the bar where one could have snacks and a lighter meal on our second evening because it was always so full with people not staying in the hotel they very kindly reserved us a table.  Overall I would stay in the Shelbourne again but I think they allow too many non residents to use the lounges and bars.,5,2015,01,08
207,Heven,"Everything is so good. Attention to detail is tops.The staff are cortices and not over bearing.The whole building has a feeling of warmth..Still have to try the resturant but if its anything to go by the breakfast it should be fab,",5,2015,01,08
207,Great city break with children,"Lovely hotel in city centre, old wold yet all modern conveniences. Went for mid term break with grandchildren and they thought it best hotel ever. Has a small swimming pool lovely lounge area for afternoon tea which is a must,Huge big bedroom ,and super breakfast  and a great central location to meet friends .Staff so helpful.  Can't wait to go back again",5,2015,01,07
207,Lovely stay at the Shelbourne,"This is one of Dublin's top hotels, transcending quite a few generations. It's not just gorgeous, luxurious and comfortable, but has a certain historical significance and cultural resonance too. Put simply, we were just as excited to stay in the Shelbourne second time round, as we were the first!

The room was great - amazing bed, fantastic shower and beautiful tasteful decor. The view was null because we were overlooking the carpark, and I'd dock points for the lack of a bathtub. These two remarks are of course subject to what the customer might request on booking - we didn't mind at all really - the rooms are not huge, but this also is due to the Shelbourne's efforts to retain character (I'm assuming) - again, it didn't matter. 

We had a couple of drinks both nights in the Horseshoe bar. Service was great. The staff are just lovely. We progressed to dinner in the Saddle Room on the second night. There was actually a 21st birthday being celebrated there, but we were brought to a quieter part of the restaurant, which we appreciated. The food was spectacular, but we did pay for it - in or around  €140 for two glasses of wine, a shared starter (meant to be shared) and two main courses. The staff, again, were lovely and very attentive. 

The Shelbourne is lovely and they think of every detail - loved having the ""express check out"" opportunity on Sunday morning. It's definitely a weekend to build up to financially, but as a Dubliner myself, the hotel captures the imagination like no other and I am looking forward to staying there again.",4,2015,01,07
207,Bad Customer Service,"We visited this hotel last year and when we arrived we were not informed of the breakfast being included in our package.  I wrote to the manager and asked if they would kindly send me a make up of the breakfasts that we did not receive and paid for.  We were back in Dublin visiting family  and could have used them then.  We received a phone call saying we could use them the next time we stay there.   I wrote back again and asked for just the breakfasts that we had paid for.  I'm still waiting for them.  
Its the small details that make a place great.  A few breakfasts (which we already paid for) would not go amiss, the room charge is not cheap.  So this would have been a lovely gesture if they had just sent back a letter inviting us to join them for the breakfast that we missed.  
I have nothing good to say about the manager, whom the letters were written to.  The staff were friendly, but in my opinion it trickles down from the top..  Not recommending this hotel and most probably will not return.  Shame for the little courtesy they could have shown, this could have had a different outcome.  A vacation is memorable when things go right.  This went wrong and then again wrong with the manager deciding that they were not going to make this right.",1,2015,01,06
207,Special post-Christmas Treat,"Enjoyed a one-night post-Christmas stay here. The hotel was beautifully decorated both inside and out for Christmas, and had a gorgeous miniature Alpine village (complete with snow, a train, tiny people and even a cable car) in the reception area.  All staff were beautifully groomed, with impeccable manners. Check-in was slower than we would have liked, or are used to, and this was due to the volume of guests. We got one of the recently refurbished rooms, which apart from being very easy on the eye, was warm and cosy and had a well-stocked bathroom. There were even white bathrobes and slippers provided. Unfortunately the hotel restaurant was booked out for the evening we were staying, so we dined elsewhere in the city. The Shelbourne has a spa, including swimming pool, but we didn’t get to use it. Our bed was king size and very firm, but neither of us slept very comfortably, for whatever reason. The shower next morning was super though, and was most refreshing. Breakfast was absolutely fabulous in the Saddle Room, and the selection of food on offer was unbelievable.  They even had a honeycomb from which you could scrape honey for your morning toast.  There were fresh fruits of all descriptions, cold meats, cheese, pastries, and different types of bread, cereals, hot cooked breakfasts, and juices of every sort you could think of. We breakfasted at our leisure and  then sat in the big comfortable lounge reading the morning paper. One guest was having problems reading the paper and I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the staff arrive with a tray containing different strengths of reading glasses – nice touch! Not wishing to encounter delays similar to those at check-in, we used the express check-out facility, so we only had to pop our room key into the box in reception and be on our way. One final thing -  if you are taking your car, it is cheaper to park in the Royal College of Surgeons Car Park which is a stone’s throw away from the hotel.  If you pre-book online it will only cost €16 for an overnight, as opposed to €25 for the Shelbourne car parking service.  We had been informed by the attendant in the RCSI car park originally that the Shelbourne would validate our parking ticket at check-out and we would get our overnight parking at a reduced rate. Luckily we asked about this when we checked in. The lady who checked us in hadn’t a clue and went off for what seemed like an age, to try and find out what the story was. She came back and told us there was no such arrangement, so beware of this.",4,2015,01,06
207,Fabulous stay from start to finish,"Just spent 2 fantastic days and nights at the Shelbourne from 31st December until 2nd January, celebrating a wedding on New Year's Eve. The stay was just perfect from start to finish. Not only was the wedding one of the best ever but the hotel is stunning, with excellent service provided throughout our stay, from check-in to restaurant to bar service. The wedding meal was delicious and included a fantastic fillet of beef, perfectly cooked, which is not easy considering there were 170 guests. Breakfast was equally delicious, with a great choice from cereals, fruits and cooked Irish breakfasts so no need to go hungry! Having lived in Dublin previously and having seen the hotel before its restoration it really is an amazing transformation and is now easily a world-class hotel. If you like beautiful surroundings, amazing food, fantastic service with a relaxed atmosphere then run now to the Shelbourne. We will definitely be returning again soon!",5,2015,01,06
207,A Must Before You Die,"A must before you die is how we felt about the Shelbourne experience.  From the minute we walked in till the minute we left it was breathtaking.  For me is was like going back in time, the hotel oozed history, character and personality. The service was amazing and the staff could not do enough for you.  

Our room was small but ticked all the right boxes, decor, comfort etc however I had an issue with the noise of the air conditioning but I opened the window and it seems to stop.  We had a drink in the Horseshoe bar and again we were treated like royalty.

We got up early and paid the gym a visit and again they had all the right equipment, spin bikes, treadmill, cross trainer, free weights, weight machines, core area etc and the pool also looked the business.  Staff were helpful, changing rooms a cut above the normal.

We had breakfast and again it delivered, great range of fresh fruit & a freshly cooked breakfast if you so desired.  No complaints there.  

When departing Mr Cook took our key and said he would do an express checkout and again there were NO issues with the Visa Debit.  

Will I go back, without doubt, Top Drawer.",5,2015,01,06
207,Beautiful Historic Building - Great Location,"Beautiful Historic Building in a great location.  Rooms are very comfortable and blissfully quiet. Staff are really friendly and  welcoming.   

Had hoped after arrived on first day to have drinks/sandwich in bar but seemed impossible to get a seat and ended up leaving hotel to eat in restaurant nearby. 
Also disappointing to see queues for breakfast next morning, we took advice and had breakfast before 9 to avoid queue but that in my opinion defeats purpose of a luxury weekend break.  
Beautiful hotel, excellent location and staff but way too busy for my liking.",4,2015,01,05
207,The Magic of Irish Hotels,"My husband and I were treated to an overnight stay as a Christmas come Anniversary present from our son.  In the past I have eaten at the Shelbourne and have attended Formals, however this was our first time staying.  My hubby and I were bowled over with the quality of service we received.  There is a magic feel about this hotel; all helpfully created by the wonderful staff, warm welcome and decades of history that is streaming from the building. This is a five star hotel that makes you feel at home - MAGIC!!  I recently stayed at Ashford castle and sadly the new owners are eroding its Irish charm.  They need to a lesson from The Shelbourne.  We both hope to back very soon - planning a treat for our own parents next time.",5,2015,01,05
207,For a few Dollars more,"Go on pamper yourself for a few dollars more.
Excellent service, staff and comfort.
In the heart of Dublin and so much to do.
I honestly can't find a bad word to say about our stay there and it was no more expensive than staying further out and getting taxi's.",5,2015,01,05
207,Amazing wedding & wonderful stay,"Just been to a New Year's Eve wedding in the Shelbourne, it was amazing. I was so pleasantly surprised. Even though the hotel was a full capacity, it didn't feel like it was packed. All the staff were so professional, polite, friendly and helpful. They couldn't do enough for you, they made you feel like you were the only person staying there. The food was the BEST I have ever had at a wedding and it was the best steak I have had in a years. The plates & food was hot, fresh, juicy & divine. Their attention to detail was superb. Everyone at a table would get served at the same time, there was 1 staff per 2 guests, so the staff would carry 2 plates so make sure everyone would get served at the same time. It was impressive to watch the staff serving, so efficient and quick. It was a biggish wedding, about 190-200 people but they handled it so so well. We had the 'top' table in the middle of the room, an oval table, which meant all the family and friends were surrounding it. It was a great idea. Also the bride and groom would get up between courses and mingle around the nearby tables as all the tables were close to the mid 'top' table. We also stayed the night in the Shelbourne. The beds were so comfortable, firm and comfortable. The rooms were lovely and quiet. We had breakfast the next morning in the Adam Suite, so all the wedding guests that stayed over could have breakfast at their leisure in that Suite, it was a great idea as we had a nice long lazy breakfast on New Years morning. A perfect end to a perfect wedding.",5,2015,01,05
207,New Years In Ireland,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for 6 night with my husband and daughter. My husband who was born in Dublin suggested we stay there , We had previously stayed at Powerscourt (previously Ritz Carlton, Westbury and Weston.  We loved the rooms and enjoyed the history of the hotel. Really enjoyed talking to Denis O'Brien the Head Concierge.  Had a wonderful Spa treatment. Our only had not booked a head of time for afternoon tea and were not able to get in. It is a extremely busy hotel. The lobby seemed to always crowded. Plan to place it on our next trio to Ireland. Rockville MD",5,2015,01,04
207,Festive Afternoon Tea-Magical!,"My mother and I were at The Shelbourne recently for afternoon tea and we were absolutely bowled over by it all.

We thought it'd be a lovely way to spend some time in beautiful surroundings during the festive period.
The hotel was exquisitely decorated for Christmas with a gorgeous big tree lavishly decorated in the lobby and as people were coming and going, it was easy to see why this place is so revered.

It screamed elegance and luxury yet the staff were so polite and friendly.
We were seated in the Lord Mayor's Lounge and witnessed staff ironing the tablecloths, which we thought was so special. Our table was immacutely dressed and soon after we were seated, a waitress came to take our order.

We requested no mayonnaise on the sandwiches which was not a problem. I asked for Breakfast Tea while my mother went for Earl Grey.
The teapots came along with dainty cups and tea-strainers; the waitress poured the tea and my God, it was delicious!

Soon the tray of sandwiches came; chicken, ham, egg and smoked salmon.
We don't normally like smoked salmon but we ate every morsel presented in front of us.

When the cake stand came with all the magnificent-looking desserts, it was all we could do not to take pictures of everything!

Each dessert was painstakingly presented with love and care and they were all delicious too.
As each cake was rich, we became full quite quickly, but the waitress packed our food into lovely little boxes for us to take home, so we could enjoy the treats at home.

The service was five-star and we were made to feel very welcome; nobody looked down their nose at us (you think sometimes a five-star hotel would come across snooty, but not this hotel).
We spent a very pleasurable and memorable 90 minutes at Afternoon Tea and we said we'd never forget the experience.

We are going to book for next year and hopefully do it every Christmas to carry on a tradition.
Thank you, Shelbourne, for making a mother and daughter feel valued and special and for creating lasting memories.",5,2015,01,04
207,A cut above the rest.,"I went with my father for afternoon tea at The Shelbourne in December 2014. it was a brilliant experience in an unforgettable location. the staff are trained and work at a level that is like no other. I was very impressed with the service, food, drinks and atmosphere. I look forward to being at the Shelbourne again.",5,2015,01,04
207,excellent location not a 5* Hotel,"We stayed at the Shelbourne between Christmas & New Year for a 3 day break, The Shelbourne is in a excellent location on St Stephens Green, it is perfect for exploring Dublin, a central location but not a noisy location just along from Grafton St.
the service was excellent other than the bar, the Spa is very good, you are not rushed out after a treatment, you are left to relax in the relaxation area after with fresh fruit, sorbets & juice.
the breakfast was excellent service  and the food very good.
the only downside & issue that I would have are the bars, there are 2 x bars both were very very busy, even when we actually got to order drinks at the horse shoe bar, my wife's champagne was served straight away (only one choice MOET not very good for a 5* hotel)  I ordered a mojito, the poor bar tender explained that he could not make cocktails although they have a cocktail list on the bar. I had to wait 25 minutes for my cocktail to arrive! not the staffs fault more of a management fault. it seems that a lot of none residents seem to drink in these bars in the evening at the weekend, no residents priority. I guess that it was just down to the Christmas/ New Year period but then the management should know that this hotel would be busy over that festive time.
overall very good, would I stay again, No, purely down to the fact that there are plenty of 5* hotels in Dublin.",5,2015,01,04
207,"Amazing, Convenient, Beautiful","This is a luxurious, classic hotel in downtown Dublin. Great location, walking distance to everything. The service is exceptional. The food is very well done. They have a lovely spa which I didn't get a chance to book but from the brief tour I did, it looked very inviting. The breakfast in the main lounge is very delicious and the décor is breathtaking. I especially loved all the fresh flowers throughout the lobby and reception. Oh and they had these Clook Keen Atelier candles burning that smelled absolutely amazing. I actually bought one to take home with me. I'd love to know what the scent is so I can replenish them...I found a atelier in NYC that carries these. 

The rooms are just beautiful. What a treat after 10-days of doing small B&Bs throughout Ireland. No twin beds, but very comfy and cozy queen and kings.  

If you are doing a pub crawl, make the hotel bar the first stop as it's another famous pub in Dublin.

It's a pricy hotel, but worth it. If you can afford to splurge on a couple of nights, definitely do it. You'll save elsewhere throughout Ireland so it makes a nice retreat!",5,2015,01,04
207,Nowhere near 5 star quality,"I stayed with my family and friends here for 2 nights. We were very disappointed with the service in general. But what really got to us was the breakfast in the morning. We had to queue for over 30 minutes to get a table. When we complained we were told that if we wanted to avoid the queues we should come down before 9am. When we looked for the f&b manager, Mr. Casey, he was nowhere to be found. I don't know how this establishment can get away with calling themselves a 5 star hotel and seemingly this is an every day occurrence, especially when running near full. None of the staff seemed to have a solution or know what they were really doing when they should really open up all the adjoining rooms, i.e. the Bar, horseshoe bar, lounges and serve breakfast to the guests. By the time we got our breakfast,it was one hour after I left the bedroom. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels worldwide as I am a Marriott member. I have never had to do this in a 5 star hotel before. A big disappointment to me, my family and friends. I won't be coming back. Not good enough.",2,2015,01,04
207,Lovely Staff,"My husband & I stayed at the Shelbourne to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. Location is perfect, food was amazing & staff were really friendly. We also had an amazing massage in the Spa. We requested the rose petal turn down but didn't receive it which was the only disappointing part of our stay.",4,2015,01,03
207,Service,It was great to see Vera every morning serving breakfast.over the festive season. She was a very efficient and cheerful girl who always put me in a great mood for the day ahead. The Shelbourne is a fantastic hotel and a wonderful place to stay over the festive season and I would have no hesitation in staying there again. Compliments to all who work there.,5,2015,01,01
207,"Missing the ""wow"" factor","We booked the Shelbourne to celebrate the New Year as last year we stayed at The George in Edinburgh and was completely blown away with the hospitality of the Scottish! We were on the early flight to Dublin as wanted to get the most out of our 3 night 4 day stay in the city.  I was very excited to bring my husband as coming from an Irish background was looking forward to sharing the wonders of Dublin with my husband.

ARRIVAL

Upon arrival to the hotel which was around 10am as expected the room wasn't ready so we were told we could leave the bags and go out to enjoy our day! ( I had emailed the hotel prior to our stay advising of our early arrival in the hope we could get the room earlier but understand not always possible)

We received a call once the room was ready so we could return and check in.

ROOM

The rooms are very spacious and very well decorated was extremely happy with the deluxe room we had booked.

BREAKFAST

This is the meal I most look forward to when staying in luxury hotels as I look forward to the selection and sampling the local specialities. My mum is from Lietram where potato farls/scones are well known, this is a treat I was very much looking forward to at breakfast at the shelbourne as had checked the menu and they were on there.

Upon arrival to breakfast on our first day I looked around and couldn't see any, so I asked the waitress and she didn't have a clue what I was asking for.  I was very disappointed as its a local speciality that on all ""full Irish breakfasts"" is advertised.

We had found the boxty do had my treat of potato farl but was dismayed that one of the best hotels in Dublin didn't offer this for breakfast! The replacement is DEEP FRIED hash browns.

I asked again on day 2 breakfast to be told that the hash browns are similar...... Maybe to someone who has no Irish heritage but to me found that quite insulting.

I bought thi to the attention of the duty manager who listened but felt by taking the cost of breakfast of the bill would solve this.

I returned to my room rather frustrated that it's deemed ok to think by offering something free solved the disappointment.

The George in Scotland breakfast buffet had everything you could imagine to show off the local delights that the Scottish have for breakfast, sadly The Shrlbourne buffet breakfast is in no way any different to a standard English breakfast except no baked beans and they offer black pudding & white pudding.

ROOM SERVICE

I called room service to request an ice bucket & 2 glasses on NYE this took 20 mins to be delivered I called twice and asked would it be quicker for me to go to the bar to request.

OVERALL

The service and standard of the hotel is what you would expect but for me it's lacking the ""Irish"" touch and what would seem a very small thing re the breakfast I personally wouldn't return to The Shelbourne.  Refunding a cost is by no means a resolution to what had been raised, I would have liked to see that what's advertised for breakfast being available.  The duty manager said she would have the menus changed but upon my retun to our room the menu still offers potato scones!",4,2015,01,01
207,Great Service,We booked the Shelbourne as a one night getaway from the kids. Brilliant night due to the fantastic service. The room was very nice and the bed was prefect. We came back in late and sat in the residence bar which was busy and got one of the best club sandwich I have had in years despite being 3am. ,5,2015,01,01
207,Beautiful hotel in the perfect location,"We had a fabulous stay here over christmas. From the minute we arrived until we left the service was excellent. The bar and entrance area are very busy but this all added to the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. We were upgraded on arrival by Renata and offered hot apple cider, a lovely christmas touch. We had a lovely room, very comfortable and quite. The food, service and spa were all excellant. Would definately recommend this hotel for something that little bit special in the heart of Dublin.",5,2015,01,01
207,Lovely Christmas Stay at the Shelbourne,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for 10 days over Christmas this year.  We enjoyed exquisite accommodations, attentive service, lavish breakfasts and charming Irish hospitality.  This is truly an exceptional hotel.  We would recommend it to anyone.",5,2014,12,31
207,Jazz Brunch.....Must Do....,"As part of a recent birthday celebration, six of us decided to go to the Jazz Brunch in the Shelbourne. The only booking time is Noon on Sunday, and if you are not there at opening time, your table will be given away, so be warned.

The menu is imaginative and varied, with lots of breakfast-type choices as well as lunch-type options. also they offer a good choice of cocktails.

There is a lovely atmosphere at the Jazz Brunch......enhanced by the very good four piece band....
who are never loud and the volume allows for quiet conversation. The singer is particularly good!!

The Shelbourne has many facets to it.....all luxurious..... the Jazz Brunch fits right in !!

Don't Miss It.......",5,2014,12,31
207,Neutral,"Expectations were higher.  The food was very good, but both small in portion as well as over priced; the doors open for street patrons to come to the bar which makes for an absurdly crowded lobby; honestly the best part of my stay was chatting during the evenings with the security officer, she was such a bright and knowledgeable person.",3,2014,12,30
207,Historic property,This hotel has alot history and is very nice.  The location is perfect and close to Grafton Street.  We have stayed here mutliple times. The rooms are smaller but not tight but the bedding is extremely comfortable.,5,2014,12,30
207,Super cocktails,"My husband is from Dublin so we go back regularly to visit family.  When we have time, we like to head to the Shelbourne for a treat and indulge in some cocktails.  We are never disappointed.  This time was no exception.  We were back in Dublin the weekend before Christmas and after a disappointing lunch we decided to cheer ourselves up and headed to the Shelbourne.  Myself and one of my sister-in-laws had special cocktails off the Christmas menu which were to die for.  The price however is not quite so pleasing.  I got the first round (and the most expensive typically!), €61 for 5 drinks.  After that we went on to normal drinks, which were still expensive but it was Christmas!  The place was heaving by the time we got there, but we were very Lucky and a kind couple who were leaving alerted us to the fact and offered us their table, delighted so we were!  All drinks were ordered by the waitresses and waiters who were helpfully fighting their way through the crowds and therefore relieving us from the stress of having to leave our comfortable seats!
It's not necessarily somewhere you would be able to spend your whole night, unless you take out a bank loan, but it is definitely worth a visit to treat yourselves.
Afterwards, we wandered through the Christmas markets.  Perfect.",4,2014,12,30
207,Arrogant attitude,"We stayed in two rooms for three nights. The stay itself was pleasant, however after we left the hotel charged us double for one of the rooms simply by withdrawing from our creditcard after we left. Despite numerous attempts for dialogue nothing has happened yet - now after more than two months.",1,2014,12,29
207,great stay,"stayed in the shelbourne for 3 nights in december,the hotel is very busy.the room[double delux] very nice,clean,nice soaps etc etc.breakfast good,afternoon tea very good,evening meal good.staff are top notch & will go the extra mile to help you out as i said early on it was busy due to a lot of non-resident xmas partys on the go but i think this just added to the xmas spirit. a big well done to all the staff/owners of this brill hotel.the hotel is in a great location in the city centre.",5,2014,12,29
207,Great hotel but disappointed with after care,"Stayed here for me 25th Wedding Anniversary in October.  Booked through an online hotel site and requested a room on the first floor.  Got room where asked for but it was definitely not a 5 star room.  It was small and dark - the lights had to remain on at all times as it backed onto an office block.  Left luggage in room and went out to take advantage of hotels great location.  When we came back there was a tray with some ""stale"" drinks on it.  Friends had sent complimentary drinks and instead of checking whether there was someone in the room before delivery the staff just left them sitting in room - hardly 5 star!!  There was a small radio in the room which was lucky as the constant drone of the airconditioning units at the back of the hotel...we left the radio on at night to block out the noise. On check-in even though I had fully paid for our stay the receptionist took a copy of my debit card - which was fine as however I was horrified to find out that ""a hold"" had been put on €200 in my bank account (plus some other €10 deduction that no-one could explain).  ""The hold"" on my account was eventually lifted after 5 days.  When I pointed this out to reception at check-out I was told that it was a trainee who shouldn't have done this. I contacted the hotel on my arrival home as I felt somewhat disappointed especially as this was a very special anniversary for myself and my husband.  They apologised and asked me to give them a chance to rectify our visit by allowing them to give me their best rate on my next visit to Dublin.  I mailed their Guest Relations Manager on 4th December and again on 17th December but received no acknowledgement.  The hotel itself was in a great location and the food was great but all of the above left a sour taste for me. There are some excellent newer hotels in the same vicinity which we will stay next time.",4,2014,12,29
207,Average experience - Disappointing Christmas stay.,"The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin's city centre is infamous amongst Irish people.  With it's history and beauty it stands on the corner of St.Stephen's Green.  It is a stunning building and it was with huge anticipation that I took my nine year old to stay here as my husband was working over Christmas.  We had numerous and regular issues with patchy and poor service and what appeared to be under- staffing issues.  I note from some other reviews and indeed from anecdotal experience that service ""could have been more attentive"" and from my experience I could not agree more.
I paid 980 euro for a 2 day stay and for this I expected an outstanding service.  I did not get it.  
If you book at Christmas expecting a decent itinerary of activities for children, forget it or go to Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, or indeed in Co.Kerry where you will find a fully supervised and fantastic choice of activities for adults and children alike.
Some of the issues I had were;  over a one and a half hour wait for an ice bucket to the room, Christmas dinner squashed in between two larger tables with little of no festive details, in room service breakfast one and a half hours late on the morning of departure and a further one and a half hour wait between check out and actually leaving the hotel, and my car got lost too!
I held the Shelbourne in high esteem due to it's nostalgia, I went to school on St.Stephen's Green and have been visiting The Shelbourne every Christmas Eve for drinks since 1984.
I will never stay there again and will be keen to try other options for Christmas Eve drinks in future.
To end on a positive note though I cannot commend housekeeping enough, the room was spotlessly clean and the attention to detail - my daughter's toy dog left in the middle of her bed on her pillow - was fantastic. The housekeeping staff regularly checked in to see if we needed extra towels or other items.",3,2014,12,28
207,Very good in hotel in great location,Stayed here twice over Christmas. Staff excellent on both visits. Early check in on first stay and upgraded to a junior suite on my second stay. Breakfast is excellent and was included in the rate. Rooms are very high quality and upgrades since my last stay have made a difference. Great atmosphere at Christmas time and would highly recommend for a weekend stay in Dublin,4,2014,12,28
207,St. Stephen's Green Classic Hotel,"Classic hotel, now almost 200 years old, is located across the street from the highly picturesque St. Stephen's Green. My son and I had a great visit here last winter, having been recommended by friends. Although service could have been more attentive, it was otherwise perfect for us, within walking distance of all the places we wanted to see. ",4,2014,12,27
207,Exceeded Five Star Expectations,"We are a family of five booked in for a one night stay to sample the Christmas spirit. From the moment we arrived our every need was completely catered for. From the warm and professional welcome to the luxurious surroundings and superb food. We could not have asked for more. Definitely worth the cost and will return to meet ""The Lady"" again 😃",5,2014,12,24
207,A masterclass in customer service,"I stayed one night at the Shelbourne during the busy Christmas season. I arrived in the evening and the lobby was chaotic to say the least, with people arriving and leaving for various parties. However, I was escorted to the reception desk and greeted with a delicious warm cider drink and an equally warm welcome. 
My room was a good size with lovely amenities but whilst watching TV I was disturbed by a lot of noise from outside. I went to the window and noticed that it didn't close properly and that the catch had buckled where somebody had previously tried to force it. I called the reception desk and within 5 minutes I had received a call from the duty manager and a visit from one of the maintenance personnel to check the window. Five minutes later I received complimentary hot chocolate and biscuits and 10 minutes after that I was moved to a new, much quieter, room across the hall. The following morning, whilst checking out, I commented about how impressed I had been with the speed and efficiency of their response and was told that I would receive a free upgrade next time I booked a room there. 
Customer service seems so underrated these days and the team at the Shelbourne could give masterclasses. So impressed!",5,2014,12,23
207,Beautiful Hotel and City,Stayed at the hotel Dec 19-24. Great hotel just down the street from where the bus picks you up for day tours. Arrival was friendly and we were allowed to check in early. Rooms are wonderful and very clean. Cristina came every night for turndown service with bottled water and chocolate. She was a great hostess! Wish the breakfast had started earlier as the day tours usually leave before breakfast opens.,5,2014,12,22
207,Fabulous hotel but too busy to cater for residents,"We arrived at this wonderful hotel at half twelve at which point we couldn't check in as check in is from 3 which is fair enough.  When we arrived back at three we queued for over thirty minutes to check in and then we were told that the rooms were not ready.  We actually did not get our room until 5pm and during that time we were standing on a landing as there were no seats anywhere, then we finally got seats im the residents lounge.  Each time we went to the bar there was a 30 minutes queue for drink.  However once we got our room, two hours late, I must say they are spectacular,  very spacious clean just beautiful and the bathroom was stunning with beautiful rain shower and fantastic stock of beauty products. At 7pm we decided to brave the bar again and yet again we couldn't get in anywhere and despite the note left in the room from the team stating that the Lordmare lounge is a residents only place after 7pm the girl said that this was incorrect and we could not sit in there as it is used by public as a restaurant again we stood on the landing with drinks amd coats  in our hands and no seats or tables in sight. Not to mention having my drink spilled and having to re queue to get a new one ..eventually we got a seat in the reading area. Having said all that the breakfast next morning was amazing,  great selection of foods and top quality.  
I did enjoy this hotel but it simply cannot cater for the capacity of people in it. It is very expensive to stay and we had no where to sit for 6 hours and had to wait so long to get a drjnk as  a resident I did not feel looked after or appreciated I would reconsider staying here again.  Suggestions maybe have a section in the main bar for residents only or allow residents to reserve a seat or a resident  only queue at the bar. Thank you",3,2014,12,21
207,Dissapointing ,"I booked a two night stay to see a show on the first night and Christmas shopping the following day and still in residence. As guests of the hotel it was impossible to get something to eat prior to the show the first night, we were basically told ""tough"" head down town! Service here has lost its edge, twice we had to call a waitress to order breakfast and also remind her to bring the toast. Although we reserved a table in the lounge the second night, and it was blantantly ready, we were asked to come back 10 minutes later. We just did not feel like guests, certainly has ĺost its edge since we last stayed here so might try somewhere different next year!",2,2014,12,20
207,Pure luxury,"Arrived for a Christmas night away to find our reservation was wrong, but the manager on reception quickly sorted it out, upgraded our room and provided a complementary drink while we waited. Everything about this hotel is luxury and quality; the rooms, bars, staff, decor, couldn't be nicer. Staying at Christmas was even more magical. 

One of the best hotels I've stayed in, and I'm already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2014,12,20
207,Disappointing Christmas Treat ,"We recently stayed in The Shelbourne for a Christmas Mum & Daughter trip to Dublin - we do it every year & decided to stay there as a real treat.

We didn't book the room direct & got a great deal via alpha rooms.  The room we were allocated was tiny - absolutely tiny. My mother had stated in the hotel previously & booked direct & her room was far superior. 

We went shopping & were looking forward to coming back & having a drink & soaking up some Christmas atmosphere in the bar. Well what we came back to was a 5 star hotel lobby FULL of VERY drunk people. It was a disgrace & in my opinion should not be allowed to happen. I understand that the bar is very famous & have enjoyed many Christmas drinks in it but now as a resident paying good money to stay in the hotel it more than annoyed me. As residents we couldn't get a seat we were sent upstairs to a cold reading room with no atmosphere - we were not the important spenders - those in the bars were far more important.

When we came down to get a taxi to go to dinner the door staff had no interest in assisting us & simply pointed to the road. I explained that we were residents & still I got no assistance. I wouldn't blame them though as every person around was very drunk & im sure they were fairly peeved off at that point.

When we came back to the hotel at midnight - again the place was still heaving & if we had want to get a night cap we would not have been able to get a seat or service.

I will admit I didn't complain when checking out as I was treating my mother & did not want to make a fuss.

Never again will I stay in the Shelbourne during the Festive period - it is not worth the money when you can't use or enjoy the hotels facilities.",3,2014,12,20
207,Doubt we'll be back...,"We booked a 2 night break for the 4th and 5th of Dec. We had some lunch in the bar that afternoon, it was grand, staff were a bit slow and snooty (had to ask for menus etc). Room was small but nice and very clean. When we came back to the hotel both evenings the lobby resembled a very busy bar, it was bordering on uncomfortable, we had intended having a drink or bite to eat, but it was so busy that it was just easier to go up to our room. On the way into the hotel, we had to walk through about 10 people smoking outside the entrance. This hotel had no personal touches, no chocolate or welcome note etc that would you would expect from a 5 star (or a good 4 star). I would agree with previous reviews in that the hotel does not look after their residents when the hotel is very busy. Maybe next time I'll get to have a drink in the bar but I won't be staying here. For me it just wasn't worth the money, shame as it was a hotel I had always looked forward to staying in. ",3,2014,12,18
207,Excellent in every respect,"Having known the Shelbourne for more than 50 years but never having stayed there, I wondered if it would live up to my expectations. It did in every respect  -   courteous, friendly, welcoming staff; relaxed ambience; spacious, comfortable room; good swimming pool; excellent breakfast. And of course, superb location. Will return.",5,2014,12,17
207,December Visit,"Stayed in the Shelbourne for three nights in mid December the hotel was exceedingly busy with the lobby at times on the Saturday and Sunday resembling a rugby scrum and not a place for the faint hearted. Management are not taking enough care to provide a comfortable environment and space for their residents with the emphasis on getting as many members of the public through the doors to spend their money on afternoon teas and in the nice but very small Horseshoe Bar, For a 5 Star hotel the bedroom was tiny the ensuite facilities so small that a sliding door was fitted and the minute washbasin unusable. While the staff were doing their best to provide a high level of service we will not return and pay inflated prices for a less than 5 star experience,",3,2014,12,17
207,Terrific location and athmosphere,"I had a business/Shopping overnight here, great location, atmosphere, food etc. Bed cozy and room very comfortable ( high and front - view of St. Stephens green.  Only negs were small - we got an email offering ability to do certain extras ( e.g fruit basket ) which we ordered and  - we're still waiting, no sign.  and staff /facilities cater more for off the street drop ins than gusts - everything jammed, also we booked dinner in hotel restaurant but we were treated as if we were outsiders ( call day before asking us to confirm, no record of same at hotel reception etc..) but reservation was fine at actual restaurant meal, etc..was good. No wifi save bitbuzz.",4,2014,12,17
207,Probably My Favorite Hotel of ALL Time!,"I have stayed at the Shelbourne Dublin many times over the past 8-years and it NEVER disappoints, especially during the holidays.  The hotel itself is a landmark in an ideal location close to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  Plenty to do within walking distance if you can rip yourself away from the lobby on a Friday or Saturday night.  If you love to people watch this is your place.  

Aside from that, the hotel staff are wonderful and have always treated me extremely well.  The restaurants, bars and lounges are all superb, although quite often over crowded.  But you should expect that if you are staying at the finest hot spot in Dublin. Nothing beats a pint of Guinness in the Horseshoe Bar on a Friday night.

So come to relax, come to party come to enjoy the sights.  It's worth every dollar you spend for this unique experience.",5,2014,12,16
207,A Wonderful Christmas Experience ,"I booked Christmas lunch in the Shelbourne as a special treat for my friends and I. I have to say christmas atmosphere from the moment you entered the building was second to none, from the music in bar, the beautiful decorations in the hotel and the very attentive staff. 

We were warmly welcomed on arrival. The food in the restaurant was amazing but the service was outstanding. Which is one of the main reasons I didn't to write this review. Therefore, I would espically like to thank our waitress that day ""Vera"" for making our Christmas Experience one to truly remember. 

I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a slice of luxury in Dublin. 

",5,2014,12,16
207,"Lovely Spa Experience, Disappointing Hotel","I visited the Shelbourne last month with my mother and two sisters. We had booked spa packages, and my mother also booked a room in the hotel. I wasn't long inside the door of the hotel before I started questioning its five star status. To me, a hotel worthy of five stars should have five star service. Small touches would make such a difference. There was no one to greet us when we walked into the lobby. Our experience of the No. 27 bar was not good. Service was extremely slow, and inaccurate, and not especially welcoming. Our order was wrong, and it took at least another twenty minutes to correct this, even then it was cold! We went on to enjoy a facial and hot stone massage each in the spa, which we all agreed were brilliant. The spa itself was luxurious and comfortable, especially the relaxation room where we enjoyed a glass of prosecco after the treatments.
The hotel room was very small. The bathroom was tiny and cabin-like with a sliding door as there wouldn't have been room for a normal door to swing in or out. The room was fine, but in my view didn't justify its pretty significant price tag. 
Overall I did enjoy my experience in the Shelbourne, but didn't come away from it feeling delighted or especially impressed. I would go back to the spa, but definitely not the bar for its food or service.",3,2014,12,14
207,Two night stay in December 2014,"We looked forward to our weekend at the Shelbourne
Personally I was disappointing in the hotel in that inside was busy with no time for the guest
We booked a table for 2 on the Friday night at 8.30 and eventually allowed in at 9pm where we were made feel like the hotel facilitated us rather than being special. Our only choice of food was the supper where we got starter, main course desert on the one tray.
What was not forgivable was on Saturday morning when we wanted to sit down and read the paper for a few minutes we were in the way as the hotel wants to set up for afternoon tea. As it was December there was no place that guests could sit and relax in a 5star hotel",3,2014,12,14
207,Shelbourne overrated ,"We had our Christmas party in the hotel and my wife and I decided to extend a day and enjoy Dublin. They gave us a room with a view to their garbage area which wasn't great and there was constant noise coming from there. On top of that during all nights they had extremely loud music playing from the ballroom until 3am, so sleeping was impossible. Room service food was the worst, blame soups and the highlight a salad for 18 Euros that consisted of 3 tomatoes and a couple of green leaves and awful dressing. probably the worst salad I ever had in a hotel.

Overall the staff was completely overwhelmed with the busy Christmas time and the obnoxious crowd at the bars.

For 200+ Euros you must expect more, if I want noisy and badly trained staff I can go to a Best Western.

Don't think I would ever go back, totally overrated.

",2,2014,12,14
207,wonderful in every way,"Stayed at this hotel Thanksgiving week.   Definitely 5 star in all aspects.
Excellent location.   Easy walking distance to many attractions.   Hop on Hop off bus stop across the street.   Room was beautifully appointed.   We were not able to stay at this hotel the night of our arrival as they were totally booked because of a rugby match.   We stayed at a hotel a few blocks away.   When we checked in we told them our luggage was being stored at the other hotel.  Not a problem for them.    They sent a bellman over to retrieve our luggage for us.
Breakfast was plentiful.   Tea was peaceful and relaxing.   The bars do get crowded but that sometimes makes it more fun.   Staff in every area of this hotel were attentive and helpful.  We did find this is the norm in Dublin.    I would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,12,14
207,Fabulous Family Weekend,"What a wonderful hotel the Shelbourne is.  I brought the family along for the weekend and we were truly spoilt. My three young children were made to feel very special and the Christmas set up in the hotel was amazing.  Special thanks to Sophie Hird for preparing every aspect of our trip, Kinga for looking after us when we arrived, and of course the wonderful concierge Dennis who somehow managed to secure us reservations for dinner at the busiest time of the year.  Highly recommended!",5,2014,12,12
207,Horrible experience,After searching for sometime for a nice hotel to have Christmas dinner and to stay christmas night we picked this hotel for a family of two adults and two children. I booked 2 interconnecting rooms on sept 15 th. On a recent shopping trip to dublin on December 2nd we decided to go into the hotel for some lunch as we have never been in the hotel before and we were excited and looking forward to staying for Christmas. We went into the lounge but no tables were available so we waited for a couple of minutes to see if any came free. A table came available but as we went to go over to take the table what seemed like a manager said we couldn't have the table as he thought it was to be held for someone else and would let us know. There was no sign on the table saying reserved. We patiently waited for about ten minutes to get a reply from the manager but we were ignored. Eventually after looking at the empty table for over ten minutes I kindly asked a member of staff if the table was available for us to take and answered very rudely no and walked off. My family left the hotel  straight away very annoyed at how we were treated and have cancelled our Christmas stay reservation.,1,2014,12,10
207,Splendor,"A return visit after many years. Much renovated but still the old charm and glamor of a elegant city hotel. Room was OK (stayed in the cheaper end) but it was all about the easy access to the city and it's attractions. Great if you want a few days to be able to walk around a Dublin and don't want to stay in a ""any city"" hotel - this one could only be in Dublin.",4,2014,12,10
207,A lovely hotel in a great location!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Shelbourne for two nights in late November. Arriving in Dublin from the U.S. On a red eye flight, we were barely coherent when we arrived at the hotel at 9 a.m. Although our room would not be ready for a few hours, we were invited to relax in the Reading Room. The kind young man at registration arranged for our luggage to be held until we were able to check in. Upon check in, which was quite efficient, we were shown to our room by a personable bellman, who could not have been more helpful. Our room was lovely, spotless and beautifully updated. The bathroom was nicely appointed and very well lit. My only complaint would be the controls on the shower- hard to turn on and adjust. Other than that- we greatly enjoyed our stay. I highly recommend the Irish breakfast- so hearty we didn't need to eat again until dinner. The bar is intimate and the bar tenders are knowledgable and pour a great cocktail. All the staff are helpful and friendly. I look forward to returning to this centrally located gem.",5,2014,12,08
207,"Busy, noisy and a little dated rather than classic",The hotel looks impressive from the front and is in a great location overlooking the park and the main shopping street a couple of mins walk away.  Once you're inside it goes downhill a little.  It took us quite a while to check in as there were queues of people checking in at the same time which is never a great start to a weekend break!  We were then shown to our room which had definitely not been refurbished as I believe some have.  It was positively shabby in places and was sold as a room overlooking the park which was only true if you stood on a chair to look out of the attic windows! The wifi didn't work properly the whole time we were there despite my Partner's best effort to sort it through the hotel's IT expert. We also happened to be there on a weekend that the Irish rugby team were staying there and playing at home and whilst I understand that the hotel are proud of that they shouldn't put them ahead of paying guests who are totally inconvenienced by the fans and the chaos surrounding them.  There were quite a lot of unhappy guests who couldn't get in and out of the hotel properly at times and couldn't even get a drink in any of the bars because of the crowds of people.  I wouldn't stay here again as there are lots of fantastic hotels in Dublin now that offer a better standard all around.,3,2014,12,05
207,EXCELLENT ATTENTION,"December 1st my husband and I had lunch in the The Saddle Room for his 66th birthday. I had advised the hotel when booking.  On arrival he was greeted with a Happy Birthday. Excellent service and attention. As for the meal itself, the presentation and taste were absolutely superb. 
As we have dined here many times we were not surprised. Once moreThe Shelbourne Hotel lived up to its reputation.
Simply excellent.",5,2014,12,03
207,A real treat for lunch in a great hotel,I visited the Saddle room in the Shelbourne Hotel Dublin yesterday with seven friends. It was a great experience! We had  a lovely lunch. We were given a room off the dining room which is called the Lord Mayor's room. The food was lovely and the staff could not have been more helpful without being intrusive. We had a three course lunch for 27 euro which was great value for a five star hotel in the centre of Dublin,5,2014,12,03
207,Beautiful historic hotel,"This is a beautiful, very historic hotel in a prime location in Dublin across the street from an awesome park. It has a great work out area, with even a lap pool. Two good bars, but very crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, hard to get into. A great tea room, and the breakfast room with made to order egg dishes, juice bar and buffet as well as options to order by menu. I love this hotel and have stayed there for business many times. The staff is very friendly and helpful! It is also a Marriott property",5,2014,12,02
207,Honeymoon Hotel,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for our honeymoon this past November. The hotel is beautiful, Dennis is amazing, spa is great, and dining options are also amazing. My only complaint is that they didn't do anything special for my husband and I. I was hoping for a glass of champagne or roses in the room since they were aware it was our honeymoon. Also, the check-in process was a nightmare. We requested an early check-in and they said they had that but they would add us to a wait list they had written. Needless to say we didn't get an early check in, in fact we got a late check-in at around 4pm. 

I would recommend this hotel, overall it was a great experience.",4,2014,12,02
207,Fabulous,"We attended a wedding at the Shelbourne in November 2014 and stayed for the weekend.  The wedding was fantastic, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  Our room was beautiful. A fabulous hotel in everyway.",5,2014,12,02
207,I will return - again and again!,"The location is unbeatable,you can walk everywhere and if you cant walk, the Luas, taxis and buses are right at hand. Even better than the location is the atmoshere. Professional, helpful and elegant service in a romantic, beautiful environment. Rooms are comfortable with terrific beds. If you want a view, though, ask for a Heritage or Heritage Park room. Vibrant, elegant, fun- but not cheap! I love it so much that I have just booked my daughter's wedding there!",5,2014,12,01
207,More Like Henry Street Than 5 Star!,"Very disappointed with the Shelbourne. It felt more like a hectic cattle market than an exclusive 5 star hotel. Can't help feeling that the Shelbourne is getting greedy, saying YES to every event and forgetting to look after it's hotel customers. Arrived at 12 noon and could barely make my way through the lobby due to throngs spilling out from the bar and people queuing for afternoon tea. Had hoped to have a drink in the bar before dinner that evening, but it was so packed people were sitting on the window sills, on the floor .... more like a seedy nightclub than an exclusive bar. The room was fine, pretty average, nothing to write home about. When I was leaving, I left my bags with the concierge for a few hours. On my return, they could not find the bags - and asked me to check the baggage room for myself - the room was full to the top with bags, with no obvious order in place, and I was forced to search through them all myself. I couldn't find them - then another porter came to look and after a while discovered the bags - he looked at me accusingly, for not having spotting them in the first place. I really felt the staff were over-stretched due to the volume of people around the hotel - and the guests were merely a nuisance.

Overall feel the Shelbourne are taking on too many events and losing in the process any feel of luxury. Will not be going back. Seriously not worth the money.",2,2014,12,01
207,Dublin,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for two nights & for the most part as we would have expected the hotel was very good. Lovely room with a great en suite all the nice touches turn down service,chocolate on the pillow & slippers on a mat by the bed. Everything was beautifully presented even the paper appeared in a bag on the door handle. Breakfast was very good & the staff polite & plentiful. However there is no where for residents to sit after breakfast or while waiting for friends or even to just have a simple pot of tea. All areas are geared to making more money with the lounge laid for afternoon tea first thing in the morning & the bars also not available or suitable. Locals use this hotel which is great but provision for residents should be made. Bedrooms here are lovely but you don't want to meet friends there. We have stayed in some beautiful hotels but this is sadly lacking on the ground floor.",4,2014,11,30
207,Lovely afternoon tea!,"Went for afternoon tea with friends recently and we enjoyed our evening. The setting was lovely. The food was very good and of course the tea was lovely. The sandwiches were very tasty. They offered us second plates of sandwiches which was much appreciated! The scones and cakes were also very nice. Service was friendly.
One thing I found a little disappointing was the length of time they give you the table for. An hour and a half is a very short time considering how expensive it was.",4,2014,11,30
207,"Nice hotel, would return but has its problems that need fixing","Stayed for a weekend with my wife. We arrived late on a Friday and the reception and bar was packed as it's a very popular social location. The hotel is on a great location right by st Stephens green and the shops. Taxis are easy to come by outside and it's a perfect setting for everything you need. Our room was a deluxe, however point one, always ask for a room on the highest floor possible or not by the street. The windows are not well soundproofed so the traffic can keep you up. The bed wasn't great. It needed a new mattress and sheets that fitted properly. If either of us moved, you could here the bed make noises. The room us nice and spacious, tea and coffee and water etc. Good selection if TV channels and a radio for your iPhone (4 connection) to charge and plenty if sockets and free wireless. The bathroom was very large, bath and walk in shower although a little cold in winter. The main bedroom door isn't sound proofed well and you could here guests walk past along with the noise from the bar late at night (we were on the first floor.) Also the made needs to oil her wheels on her trolley, every morning at nine you were woken. The hotel has couple of bars, all very nice and great service, however be prepared, it's not quiet and if you like a good social science it's the place to be at. Staff worked hard to serve which was nice. They did create a lounge area for residents only but service was slow. I used the gym before, it's average and nothing special. On the first morning breakfast was great although be prepared during peak times, you will have to queue. The second say was terrible and ensure if you come across this situation. As it seems others gave, ask to be moved. When it's busy they create a make shift breakfast area in the bar. It has an empty feeling, it feels make shift, they only gave half the options for breakfast, I.e. No mixed. Juices, just orange, a job of water not citrus like next door., no skimmed milk (they have to get thus from the kitchen when asked) the cooked food is cold. Toast dumped on your table without ask brown if white, no tea of coffee until we had to find a waiter to ask and a manager that didn't seem bothered. This was discussing compared to what you get from the main breakfast area. When I mentioned this at check out, the receptionist didn't seem surprised at all. This really created a bad feeling on outlast day. In general the hotel gas a traditional feel with lots of history, check out the mini museum, and it's well looked after but with one or two rough areas, but to ensure you get the best of the hotel, make sure you drive for service and take control if your stay otherwise you could be left with the rough ends of what could be a very nice stay.",4,2014,11,30
207,Superb Hotel,"We travelled to Dublin recently and stayed at this famous 5 star hotel. It is located in the best position in Dublin overlooking St Stephens green. The hotel in this period building is beautiful but what really makes this hotel wonderful is it's staff from the doormen to the reception. I have rarely come across such genuine friendliness. Naturally as a 5 star hotel, it's not cheap but it's worth every penny.",5,2014,11,30
207,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed for two nights at the weekend. The lady who helped with our booking was very helpful. Check in was very quick with lemonade and biscuits. Room (double deluxe) was fine, although it is a bit of a maze to get to the rooms. Only downside was an air-conditioning unit from the adjacent offices hummed all night. 

Breakfast was fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We ate in The Saddle Room on the Saturday night. Our waiter was very helpful as we had to leave half-way through the meal to get to the theatre on time, so our dessert was served when we got back. 

I used the swimming pool - very nice and the spa staff were very helpful.",4,2014,11,30
207,Best hotel and location in Dublin,"On one side of St Stephens Green is what is undoubtedly the best hotel in Dublin, and one that is easily in contention for one of the top ones in Europe. From here, it was an easy and quick walk to any place in the city. The rooms have just been refurbished, and the hotel looks amazing. One of the rooms at the hotel is actually where the Irish constitution was signed in 1922, and this room can be used as meeting space by groups. The service was top notch, almost every time I walked through the lobby, I was greeted by name by the concierge or front desk staff.The hotel is luxurious and upscale, but also extremely warm and inviting. I loved staying here and cannot wait to return. 

The Aircoach from the airport dropped off right outside of the hotel, at the Kildare stop. It picked up on Dawson street, just one street over from the hotel. For 13 euros round trip, this was an easy and convenient way to travel to the hotel.",5,2014,11,29
207,Very far from 5 star quality,After looking forward for months to a night away was totally let down by the shelbourne experience. Door man and check in lady fantastic but when we got to our room was so disappointed . Stains on the chair in the room tiny bathroom with sliding door and no bath !!!! The little touches to make you feel like your staying in a 5 star hotel were missing no turn down service or even a little chocolate on the pillow which I thought were part of what they offered .I feel because I booked this off a Web site and may not have paid top price I got very poor quality room which I believe is totally unfair . Definitely won't stay again ,2,2014,11,28
207,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed in this hotel with some friends (a party of four). I would say, this is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in. It was just fantastic on all levels. The service, the staff, the decor and the food!!! Oh my goodness the food - well - I put on some weight in the four days we stayed there. The food was just soooo good!! The location of the hotel is also great. I can't wait for a return visit.",5,2014,11,26
207,Afternoon tea,An amazing afternoon tea experience in a wonderful Art Deco hotel with good friends .The service was excellent the food was fabulous and the piano player in the background added to the experience .It was my friends 50th birthday and at late notice the staff arranged candles and a macaroon presentation with a candle which was lovely .,4,2014,11,26
207,Luxurious stay at The Shelbourne,"We stayed at this wonderfully opulent, but extremely friendly hotel for the weekend.  We were welcomed by warm and friendly staff, who where so professional and a pleasure to talk to throughout our stay.  This is by far, the best hotel we have stayed in.  The room was luxuriously furnished but cosy and comfortable.  The buffet breakfast had an amazing choice and also offered a freshly prepared menu to choose from.  Location is faultless as many attractions are within walking distance, but still remains a very quiet and peaceful spot to relax in.  The staff are not pretentious and make you feel so welcome, they are happy to help with any matter and provide a seamless service.  There is also a small museum which is definitely worth looking at, so much history within those walls, it's very interesting.  We would love to stay here again the next time we visit Dublin.",5,2014,11,25
207,Great Hotel,The Shelbourne is one of my favorite hotels.  The hotel is in a good location within walking distance to Trinity and to Temple Bar.  The rooms are very nice and the breakfast is excellent.  The concierge was very helpful and a wonderful source of information.  He suggested a trip to Howth which was about 30 minutes away by train.  Howth is a very nice seaside location and it had plenty of activities to keep three teenagers entertained for the day.  Only negative was the hotel initially refused to give concierge lounge access to my family of 4.  The clerk told me that the hotel was following Marriott's new policy which limits lounge access to the elite member and one guest.  I had to contact the manager the following morning to have the situation rectified.  The manager was very nice and accommodated me without delay.,5,2014,11,25
207,Relaxing Drink,"Popped in for a quite drink recently. Great idea of hubby. Busy bar for early evening. We had a lovely cocktail and beer. Service was great and fast, which makes you like the place even more.  Very comfortable seating",4,2014,11,24
207,A supprise for my wife,"I booked this on a hidden gem site,knowing excatly what hotel was being offered!! I couldn't believe the bargin I got.I was in Dublin for a promotion interview and decided to make it a supprise for my wife.We parked at the other side of Stephens Green and as we walked passed the Shelbourne door I said"" we are staying here !"" What luxury from the fresh lemonade at reception ,the ever so plesant staff and the beautiful decor.We stayed in a deluxe king room which was fablous.There is a reason why this hotel is number 1 luxury hotel on tripadvisor.So beg,borrow or steal for a night of bliss.(I got the promotion,must have been the luxury treatment in the Shelbourne !!)",5,2014,11,24
207,Wonderful weekend in The Shelbourne,"Right from the moment we arrived the customer service in this hotel was up front and central. We were made to feel welcome and special. A big thank you goes to Kelly McGovern on the reception who took care of our needs and added that extra special magic! There was a minor mix up at the check in but Kelly rectified the problem seamlessly and was a true ambassador for the Shelbourne.

The room was fantastic, we had booked a Heritage Park room overlooking St Stephens Green however to our delight Kelly had upgraded us to a Suite! Sheer luxury!

We dined in the Lord Mayors Lounge on the Friday evening and again the service was impeccable with attention to detail shining through. All the staff we're a credit to the hotel and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was taken in the ""Saddle Room"" with the same high standards received. The food was top quality and overall the dining experience throughout the hotel, including in room dining, was fantastic.

Our main reason for the trip to Dublin was to watch the Ireland V Australia rugby game, so you can imagine our delight when we realised the Irish team were staying in the hotel as well! So we got to wave the team off to the game, see them win an exciting game and welcome them back to the hotel that evening.

The staff throughout managed to strike the balance between high standards whilst maintaining a homely feel that was relaxing and not overbearing. Once again big thanks to Kelly and all the staff at the Shelbourne we had a memorable weekend and we'll be recommending you to our friends. We WILL return!",5,2014,11,24
207,Warning!,"If you are considering this, or any Marriott hotel, be warned. Do not enter your PIN when asked for a credit card on cheching in. This is common practice here and allows them to bill you whatever they like. I booked in advance at an agreed rate (because of a poor previous stay here) but was billed double after I had left the hotel. They say that I must have agreed the rate because I authorised it by entering my PIN. Credit card companies will not help because the PIN was entered - even if this is before you see your room. If you don't mind queing for your breakfast, then it's OK, but there are reasons it's only rated #13 in Dublin (behind some 4* hotels). Don't expect any help from 'Guest Relations'. You're on your own.",1,2014,11,24
207,Another Honeymoon,Just back from a weekend here. We had a brilliant time. Flowers and chocolates in our room when we arrived. Such a historical and beautiful hotel. Staff were so friendly and couldnt do enough for us. Will definately be back again soon. Thank you to all the staff.,5,2014,11,20
207,Best in Dublin,"This hotel is one of the best in Dublin. Located right in the middle of the shopping area and night life it still remains a quite and relaxing spot. 
The rooms are quite big and nicely decorated. Staff is friendly and will do what they can to help. 
Probably one of the best meals I had in a hotel was here. 
Would love to go back.",5,2014,11,19
207,Magical,"I recently had afternoon tea with my sister at the Shelbourne. It was a lovely experience and I'd love to do it again. Everything was top notch, from the welcome we received when we arrived, to the choice of teas, the sandwiches and little cakes and scones. The attention to detail was superb and it was all served in a friendly, bubbly atmosphere. All the staff are friendly and professional but a big thank you goes to Violetta. I was home in Dublin for a weekend and my trip to the Shelbourne made it extra special.",5,2014,11,19
207,Lovely weekend but need to sort out Sunday breakfast!,"Lovely hotel, beautifully decorated, fine surroundings and very comfortable. Sadly lots of young trendies  use this as a drinking establishment during the evening and although not rowdy they tend to barge through the revolving door with no regard for who might be behind them, I feel the doormen need to get a grip of this! 
Also we suffered a farrago on Sunday morning for breakfast. The hotel opens its doors to non residents and it is obviously the go to place for a full English! Sadly, again, no regard is given to the residents of the hotel who pay good money for their stay! Upon complaint by letter the manager failed to respond and the response from the customer relations manager was appallingly written in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation and mixed font letters! Very poor!",4,2014,11,18
207,Disappointing Visit to No 27 Bar,"Love The Shelbourne Hotel, stayed here on our wedding night. 

However, on two recent visits to the bar area I felt like the magic was missing. I took my niece for an early evening drink to round off a traditional horse and carriage ride around the City but felt that the servers were not in any way friendly or warm, it was difficult to attract attention for table service despite loads of circling staff and I wondered if visitors to our city enjoyed the same lacklustre welcome at such a landmark hotel in a city famed for it's hospitality. 

On the other recent visit I paid handsomely for three glasses of wine and felt like an accompanying nod or smile from the bartender would have cost nothing and added to my experience. That said, I collected my mother from an afternoon tea in the Lord Mayor's Lounge in the past few week and the woman hosting was extremely warm and friendly and also pointed out the very good value Slate supper menu which looked appealing - so the famous hospitality remains, just not in the bar!",2,2014,11,18
207,A Grand Old Dame,"The Shelbourne Hotel is the epitome of luxury and a timeless institution, having been established in 1824. Great central location in Dublin, right on lovely St Stephen’s Green, and within walking distance of sights, restaurants and shopping. Even sights further afield, e.g. Guinness Storehouse, is a comfortable 30-minute walk or 10 Euros by cab. Ditch the car here, as parking is off-site and a stiff 25 Euros per day.

Hotel staff are outstanding, and seem to be everywhere in the lobby and public areas on the ground floor. Marble floor and columns present an old-world charm. Rooms are airconditioned and with good (free) wifi coverage. Comfortable beds and well-equipped bathroom with fluffy towels. The room we had was about 25 sq metres. There is a safe and iron/ironing board in the room. Watch the mini-bar though, as even moving the contents will trigger a charge. Generous buffet breakfast, with eggs cooked to order.

There is a small but fascinating museum in a corner of the lobby, containing memorabilia from bygone days, including guest registers that date back more than a century.

Haughty air abounds, but expected in a hotel of this stature. Pamper yourself in Dublin by staying in a hotel which, in my view, is one of the great hotels of the world.",5,2014,11,17
207,Impossible to fault,"Great hotel, fantastic location and absolute great facilities, rooms and most of all staff. A very big thank you to Marion and Eamon who helped us out with a big problem we had and for the continuous phone calls to the room and keeping us informed.  Cannot not fault this hotel and a great buzz around the place.  Xmas shopping accommodation venue a must. Great dinner and fabulous breakfast. No complaints great hotel , will return. ",5,2014,11,16
207,"Luxury , Opulence , & Convenience","Where to start. This is definitely the best hotel I have visited in Europe. Located on Sr Stephens Green , it is close to the shopping on Grafton Street , near the River Liffey , and within walking distance of Temple Bar - and right next to a buzzing Christmas Market. But it is not just located well . The service is immaculate from reception , to concierge ( a mine of information and help ) , the bar and waiting staff , the room service team , and the health club assistants. All staff are are smartly and traditionally dressed. Our room was not overly large but the bed was extremely comfortable , the en suite of the highest quality , and the furnishings equally so. Carpeting and wall decoration are consistent throughout and in neutral colours. We booked including full Irish breakfast which was buffet style with an extensive choice - and extended to chef cooked to order omelettes , fried eggs and poached eggs. I would highly recommend including breakfast with any booking ( just have an appetite) . For dining we chose the Shelbourne supper served in the Lord Mayors Lounge. We failed to read the introduction , so the concept of serving all three courses at the same time came as a bit of a surprise. The food again excelled, my chowder being replete with various sea foods and our filet mignons full of flavour and superbly tender. Mine was requested medium rare and was served just as I would expect - red in the middle , mainly pink , with a browned surface - marvellous.  The health club is very well equipped , the swimming pool excellent , with a steam room and sauna to use. Of course this is a top price hotel but in my opinion - worth it. As we left we found that the Irish International rugby team had been fellow guests - and as a bonus you may even spot a celebrity ( we did ).",5,2014,11,16
207,Genteel Sophistication,Sadly only stayed here for one night but that included a dinner in one of the private dining rooms. The entire hotel is a class act from the glass of lemonade when checking in to the well designed rooms. The dinner was good rather than outstanding but the ambience was amazing - a great place for a small private gathering. The following morning we grabbed quick coffees from the barista in the lobby and were off - I'll be back though,5,2014,11,16
207,Excellent City Centre choice ,"We stayed for a weekend including a visit to Leopardstown races, easily reached via the Luas green line from the northwest corner of St Stephen's Green.

The hotel itself has been sympathetically restored in line with its historic status, and is elegantly comfortable. We had a room in the ""heritage"" wing - the only gripe would be we were directly above where taxis wait for business. As they say in Dublin ""the compliments pass when the quality meet"".

Dinner in the Saddle Room was let down by perfunctory service (but we had been spoiled by previously dining at the outstanding Patrick Guilbaud at the nearby Merrion). However, the breakfast is well above average hotel quality.

Location is excellent for exploring this interesting city, and nicely away from the busiest pedestrian areas. We would certainly consider the Shelbourne above other hotels when next visiting Dublin.",5,2014,11,15
207,"Fantastic Hotel, Fabulous Service","We stayed in the world renowned Shelbourne hotel on Stephens Green, Dublin as a treat. This isn't a budget hotel. The accommodation was not inexpensive as was the good and drinks. It is very central in Dublin and is one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. The room is one of the newly refurbished deluxe rooms and was very beautiful. It wasn't a large room but was elegantly furnished and had all of the amenities you would expect from a modern hotel, but with a touch of class. The staff were both helpful and charming. They assisted wherever they could. The hotel is only a few minutes from most of Dublin's top attractions and we could not fault anything during our stay. We very definitely will return to this fantastic hotel. ",5,2014,11,15
207,Elegance in the heart of Dublin,"Luxury, style, attentiveness- sum up the Shelbourne Hotel. Beautiful, comfortable rooms, delicious food, lively bar and gorgeous new pool and gym facilities. I would highly recommend staying here if you are spending time in Dublin. You'll want to keep coming back!",5,2014,11,15
207,fantastic hotel,"My wife and i stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights for her birthday ( room 464 ) and the hotel was fantastic . The staff at this hotel make you feel so welcome. The staff really go out of their way to make sure you are well looked after, from the bar staff to the doormen etc i cant speak highly enough of them. The hotel should be very proud of their staff.Breakfast was very good , and the bar food excellent . The location is at St. Stephens green making it handy to get around Dublin. Fantastic hotel and cannot wait to return.",5,2014,11,14
207,Great value lunch,"One of Dublin's top hotels We recently as a family had  lunch in the Saddles Restaurant .  At €25.95 for a three course lunch this marked terrific value.  The food was top fare , the service was outstanding.  All in all I would recommend this iconic hotel for a lunch as a treat .",5,2014,11,13
207,Pure Elegance,"Love this recently acquired Marriott hotel!  The staff is efficient and knowledgable and accommodating.  The room was perfection (we had number 262).  A huge tub for soaking after a long day of walking around the city.  A separate changing area and large bedroom.  The linens were wonderful guaranteeing a good night's sleep each night.  Having chocolate and water delivered before bed was a special touch.  This hotel is in a great location - right across from St. Stephen's Park (beautiful), just down from The Little Dublin Museum (which was great) convenient for taxies and walking to Grafton Street for shopping and dinner.  We took the Wild Wicklow Tour and that bus had a pick up area right across from the hotel.  The pick up stop for Airlink to the airport is just a block away.  Also, for a healthy breakfast, KC Peaches is right near the hotel.  This place is steeped in history and is a class act.  Check out the video of which important guests have stayed there!  Not cheap but very, very special.",5,2014,11,11
207,Great way to begin and/or end an Ireland adventure.,"I took a multiple day cross country horseback trek with my daughter and some friends last August.  The trip was on the west coast, but we flew into and out of Dublin. We spend the first and last nights at the Shelbourne Dublin Hotel and had a fabulous time.  I took advantage of the spa on both evenings, and we all did the last evening.  Great way to relax tired muscles after 8 days in a saddle!  Staff was excellent - from the front desk to the concierge to the wait staff.  Dinner was exceptional - even after a week in Ireland where we became accustomed to exceptional beef and seafood. We were within walking distance of Trinity College and several other tourist destinations. Rooms were luxurious and comfortable.  Would stay again in a heartbeat!",5,2014,11,11
207,A Treat in Dublin,This hotel is a Marriott standard. It's right across the St. Stephens Green in the very center of Dublin. You could walk to the famous Grafton Street in 3 minutes and shop and dine there at your choosing. The hotel is of historical significance. I was upgraded to a first floor large room that has all the histories behind it with who and who once stayed here. The large painting at the front desk with a rich master and his poor old porter put things in perspective. The dining room at the second floor is also magnificent and the food was great. Can't find a better hotel in the city of Dublin.,5,2014,11,11
207,Old school hotel with a twist,"The Shelbourne is a hotel that is engrained into Dublin society and always been there for those wonderful events through history. My wife and I attending a black tie event on Saturday night here and we can only say it was with grace and  beauty that only the Shelbourne can offer.
I have not actually stayed here as its always been out of my price range so I can not comment on bedrooms, breakfast , hotel staff etc , maybe some day !",4,2014,11,10
207,Old Lady still pulls them in,I stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights during a conference.  Without knowing Dublin very well this seems to be a really great location and I was able to walk to most places and getting a cab outside the hotel was very easy.  The Hotel itself clearly has a wonderful history and charm but the place was so busy when I stayed that it was hard to  experience it.  The large public bar was constantly packed and  the lobby areas were always full with what seemed to be tour groups everytime I passed through - the staff seemed run off their feet delivering good service so the atmosphere is slightly frantic.  Room was very comfortable if somewhat over furnished  so not alot of space for my stuff and after two nights on the 5th floor I had to ask to be moved on my last night due to power plant noise off the roof which made sleeping impossible.  Reception moved me immediately with no quibble.  Wifi worked great and front of house team really friendly & personable so would stay again but not above the 4th floor!,4,2014,11,09
207,Perfection Shelbourne,"Excellent location, highly trained courteous staff, fabulous beds & bedding, pristine decor & surroundings, great gym, delicious food, always a buzz about the place, great history

Don't change a thing Shelbourne...",5,2014,11,09
207,Four star central Dublin historical hotel,"Treats you like royalty,first rate service,great location,across from St.Stephan's Green/Central Park,near shops pubs/temple bar,great restaurants,wow this is the place to stay...whether driving or not this is perfect for first time visitors or experienced travelers",5,2014,11,08
207,Plush elegance,"Stayed for two nights after a week in County Kerry. Our renovated deluxe room was plush with beautiful, elegant furnishings. The view was of an office building next door. The rainfall shower was relaxing. I could have stayed in there for hours after walking around the city. The staff were friendly and efficient. Breakfast was very good with plenty of options including delicious fresh fruit and pastries. There was always a buzz around the lobby area but it never felt chaotic. Would definitely return for the combination of location, comfort, and elegant surroundings.",5,2014,11,07
207,Luxury in Dublin,"Beautiful hotel. All the luxury and service anyone could want. The rooms are a little small for a top rated hotel, but remember, it's a classic, historical gem. Good location, great lounges and restaurant.  Don't miss the afternoon Tea in the beautiful Lord Mayor's Lounge.This hotel is loaded with history, check it out.",5,2014,11,06
207,Stylish and top class,My husband booked a night here for my birthday as a surprise. What a surprise ! From start to finish it couldn't have been better . Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in . It is in a league of its own in terms of luxury and above all service . Had a meal for family and friends and that was amazing  and everyone really enjoyed every aspect of it . Do not hesitate to stay here it's top quality and would return in an instant .,5,2014,11,05
207,Gracious living,Total comfort with old fashioned service with excellent helpful staff and very good food in a lovely atmosphere.    The room whilst not being spacious was very comfortable and cleaned perfectly whilst we were at breakfast.    The hotel was very central and within easy access to Grafton. Street shopping.     Staff very keen to be helpful and whilst money is easy to spend here it is worth it.,5,2014,11,05
207,Beautiful city center hotel with well-trained staff,"I loved my stay at the historic Shelbourne Dublin. Comfortable queen bed with Egyptian cotton bedding, soothing cream and gold colors, and marble bathroom. At the hotel, the Lord Mayor's Lounge was perfect for afternoon tea and scones.  An elegant calm room with fireplace, chandeliers, baby grand piano as a great Irish alternative to a noisy bar.  Easy walk to Grafton Street, which is a must-stroll. Right on pretty St. Stephen's Green. The level of service is exceptional by well-trained staff.",5,2014,11,05
207,World Class- What a Treat!,"My wife and I stayed here on 3 November, and from start to finish, the treatment and service were impeccable and absolutely faultless- comparable to and  better in many instances than many other iconic  5* establishments my wife and I  have stayed in worldwide over the last three decades.This visit was truly memorable

Firstly,and most importantly,  the staff- all friendly, smiling and so professional in such a down to earth manner - bags taken as soon as we approached the hotel.Wonderful receptionist who upgraded us to a Heritage park view room, which was just incredible. In truth , the positive experience and 'warm' customer feeling started from the very moment I contacted Reservations in the hotel to make the booking. Porters , concierge (delightful Dublin humour), reception ,housekeeping/ turn down, restaurant bar staff- all without exception smiling and friendly, all greeting us wherever we were in the hotel. They are a credit to the hotel and to the management who obviously must put a lot of effort into staff development and training of enthusiastic people - it shines through!

Secondly , the sheer comfort , opulence and  attention to detail . The park view was fantastic , and the Heritage room itself was just so luxurious  spacious and comfortable,with every conceivable amenity ,right down to the Elemis bathroom amenities / tea coffee making facilities and even an ironing board and iron tucked away.Obviously it had all the other amenities one would expect in a 5* hotel- bathrobes and slippers, minibar etc etc. The bedroom and marble bathroom have the 'wow' factor - so grand and so in keeping with its historic past- yet with every modern amenity.The bed, with Egyptian cotton and great pillows was so comfortable.

Drinks in the Horseshoe Bar, and  leisurely  breakfast in the Saddle Room consolidated the great experience.The hotel had full occupancy on the night we were there and yet, the air of quiet elegance permeated , particularly in the guest reading room , and of course our room.

Having attended innumerable functions-weddings , debs balls , dinners, charity functions etc  in the 'Old Lady ' of the Green for the last 35 years, it was such a crowning pleasure to actually stay here for the first time and to have such a truly exceptional experience. Thank you all very much.",5,2014,11,05
207,Not relaxing,"The good 1. Rooms and nice, clean, and wifi is fast
The bad 1. There is no lobby and if the hotel is busy, people just stand around
2. The bars at the hotel are very popular with the locals and are not relaxing if you want to just hang out.  I don't care about paying $21 for a glass of wine but when I am being pushed around by the crowds at the bar - there's a problem. There should be an area for guests only.
3. the Spa - I had a massage and a facial - the massage was awesome - the facial was standard for a hotel.  The layout of the Spa is one of nightmares where you have to walk up and down stairs to get to the locker back up to the spa lobby then back down to the treatment room. The spa hasn't been updated probably since early 1990 and it looks like Laura Ashley threw up in there.  Overall - for the price (maybe $200 euro) I thought it was more stressful than relaxing time.  FINALLY - I needed to jump on an important call in the middle of the night and stepped out into the hall so I wouldn't wake my husband and I got yelled at by the staff.  How Rude! I will never ever stay there again.",2,2014,11,04
207,Nice but not a 5 star experience,"This is the second time I've been to the Shelbourne. I was disappointed by my last experience so I wrote to complain. I was given a reduced rate to return so I did along with my wife for her birthday.
It is a lovely hotel but it is not 5 star as deficiencies were noticeable in room service (having to call twice to request items) and breakfast (waitresses forgetting about orders). Unfortunately they do not seem to learn from mistakes as the same errors happended on my first and most recent visits.
A lovely hotel with nice rooms and pleasant staff  but not a 5 star experience, it relies too much on reputation, you have to wait over half an hour to get a table for breakfast and not value for money.",3,2014,11,04
207,Your tables not ready go and have a drink,"Have to say the reason we are in this hotel is me and first impressions were very good we got a complimentary upgrade and room was amazing. There my amazement ended. We had booked to eat in the restaurant as it was my birthday. When we presented ourselves for dinner we were told quite rudely to go and get a drink and come back in ten minutes. We returned as instructed and were again told almost ready people were having coffee and almost ready, 15 minutes later we were told they were having dessert (at this point we were 30 minutes behind) it was also my birthday and has we had a long drive had booked table for a late meal. I think this was the only reason we waited, we were then put at a table that I can only say was in the waiting area so another ten minutes  later we got a table in the restaurant . Restaurant staff were polite but we were told politely but firmly that we should order quickly as kitchen was closing.

To summarise this did not help our mood and while the food was adequate my appetite was quite gone and I tasted nothing the wine was adequate but  overpriced. I suggest if you're going to quadruple the price of your wine you stick to more obscure wines and not those we have access  to easily.

On return to our room we were met with an awful smell but to be truthful I was so tired and upset I just wanted to sleep.

I really don't know what to say, disappointed seems trivial, I stay in dublin quite a lot and may I wholeheartedly recommend The Merrion a very understated but top notch 5 star establishment with staff that are so helpful it's like stepping back to another era ( you know when customers were important)  my advice stay there and pop into the Shelbourne for a drink or brunch when you don't expect a 5 star level of service. 

This was meant to be romantic and I apologise to my partner as none of this was his fault.

I will go back to the Jazz brunch its a fun way to spend a lazy Sunday but I will never eat or stay in The Shelbourne again.  I might add we never even got an apology.",4,2014,11,04
207,Missing the small touches for a 5 star,"We recently stayed 2 nights in the shelbourne. At check in the assistant did not offer us the standard complimentary cookies and lemonade, nor were we asked if we wanted a paper or the turn down service. Usually the turn down service is standard in most 5 star hotels and I was disappointed that this was not the case at the shelbourne. 
Our room was spacious and a clean good refurb. However again the small touches of a 5 star were missing. We asked for fresh milk for our coffee and an hour later it had not been delivered. This was unacceptable. 
On the Sunday morning breakfast was so busy we had to be placed in a drafty spill over room. We had to ask the staff three times for coffee. Each time the coffee delivered was cold. Various other incidents similar to this occurred. On the second morning breakfast was much better. 
The pool was a good size, and staff very pleasant. However refurbishment work was being carried out and additional signs indicating this should have been places at the lifts to save us walking around the hotel trying to find the lift to access the spa. 
I arrived home and realised I had left my phone charger at the hotel. I have emailed and telephoned the hotel and have yet to receive a response. This should be something which is easily resolved... 
Overall it was a great location, and good room, but not up to a 5 star standard by a long shot. There must be better hotels in Dublin, stay in those instead.",3,2014,11,04
207,Not a 5 star hotel,"Overcrowded and over rated! We had 2 interconnecting rooms. Nice but not cleaned properly. Could find hair on the floor everywhere.

The worst was that we had to queue in the lobby for 35 min to get breakfast! Absolutely outrageous! There are no lounge or any other area to seat and wait! Everywhere is crowded and noisy!! Not the feel you would expect for an exclusive 5 star hotel. 

Very noisy also at night when guests shouted in the corridor and we could hear loud music coming from somewhere. 

Was impossible to get dinner either as too busy. Never seen a place where guests can't even get a table. 

Hated the experience. 

",1,2014,11,02
207,Another refurb,"It has been a few months since I've managed to stay at the Shelbourne as it has always been packed and I was happy to be welcomed back.  I was checked in very quickly, and headed off to my room. I was surprised to see that the room had been refurbished, as it didn't seem that long ago since this was last done.  The room had a fresher, brighter feel to it than I remember.  I had a really comfortable 2 night stay, once again enjoying the proximity to the centre of town and the helpfulness of all the staff.",5,2014,10,31
207,Elegant Retreat in Dublin,"We had a very nice stay at the Shelbourne. Everyone at the hotel was exceptionally nice. Our room was very comfortable. We had plenty of space and we had a great night's sleep. 

The only caution is that we were on the 5th floor in the room adjacent to construction so in the afternoon and starting at 8:00am you could here the construction workers.

We had the breakfast as part of our reservation and we were very pleased with the food.",4,2014,10,31
207,Really very good,"Had mixed expectations but booked Elevator package at €259 per night including breakfast.
We were really impressed, period room was 100%, reception 100%, and the breakfast in the Saddle room was wonderful.
We got the impression that the whole stay was actually managed rather then let to chance and would recommend to anyone. This was booked on the hotels website as I get the impression that the 'deals' on the third party sites may not be so good.",5,2014,10,31
207,Tea for Three,"History alive!  The Shelbourne has had some incredible patrons in its 100 plus years of existence.  We didn*t stay there, too high for our wallet, but we had tea there.  Also very expensive but worth every penny.  We had champagne with the tea which made it even nicer.  The next day we were in a cab headed to our more plebian hotel when  we ran into a 50,00plus person protest march over water bills.  Our cab driver threw us out (not literally) near the Shelbourne.  We decided to wait it out there until the march was over.  We  explained the circumstances to the staff and prepared to wait it out at the bar.  She directed us to the quieter bar, brought us juice for my husband who is mobility challenged.  Three hours later, and with a life saving charge card, she returned and escorted us into a waiting  taxi.   The staff knew we weren*t patrons, but still ttook such good care of us!",5,2014,10,29
207,I could live in this Hotel,"This is an amazing hotel where you are really are treated to old school service . The hotel is steeped in history with an A list of celebrities who have stayed there. To name a few , JFK , Princess Grace, James Cagney and many more. It's situated in a fabulous location directly facing St. Stephens Green and surrounded by beautiful Georgian Architecture and restaurants. The rooms in this hotel are luxurious, extremely comfortable and very tastefully decorated with a very regal feel . You can even order oysters for room service. The food is sensational from breakfast to lunch , to dinner and afternoon tea in The Lord Mayors room. The lounge has a lively atmosphere with pianist/singer. I truly cannot say enough about this hotel it is a bit on the expensive side but absolutely worth every penny. I would love to retire and live in this hotel that's how amazing it made me feel. If your ever in  Dublin  you should treat yourself to a Shelbourne experience . ",5,2014,10,29
207,Shelbourne Hotel,IS one of the best 5 star hotels in Dublin . Really well located and a short walk from the shopping district . Has a lot of history . Has great options to dine at too . Many historical events have taken place here . Was the location where the movie Ek Tha Tiger was also filmed,5,2014,10,29
207,Great but....,"Beautiful property, friendly staff, great location.  Horrid internet access. 
They were doing construction so it was a bit loud during the day. But it is close to everything in this charming city.  Great gym and a lap pool so bring goggles.",4,2014,10,29
207,A Jewel on St. Stephen's Green,"Please read my profile for my biases.

I am a huge fan of the Renaissance brand, and with the notable exception of the Renaissance at London's Heathrow Airport (which doesn't deserve to be a Marriott hotel much less a Renaissance) I've had wonderful stays at these hotels.

The Shelbourne didn't disappoint.

Now it would be hard to rate my favorite hotel. One contender would be the Blackstone in Chicago (also a Renaissance hotel) and this hotel reminded me strongly of that property. A grand old hotel with modern amenities, this place is comfortable while being historic, full of attentive staff without being pushy.

See my pictures for how luxurious the room was. What you can't really experience is the feel and weight of the doors or how the floor has those little rolls and dips of any older building. Staying at the Shelbourne will make you feel special.

Now I am currently a Marriott Platinum member and so my experience might be different from someone without elite status with the brand. I was in room 536 and while one reviewer complained about how small their room was, mine was quite large with a huge bath. It faced the Green which offered a nice view, although there was a slight amount of additional noise from the road traffic. An amazing breakfast was also included in the Saddle Room downstairs.

The only thing wrong with the room was the temperature. I like my hotel rooms a bit cooler than most. In keeping with the style of the hotel, the temperature controls were brass knobs, and while I had it on the coolest setting the room never got quite cool enough for me.

In some hotels the temperature is set for the season: the air conditioning runs when it is hot and the heat when it is cold. So it may have been that only heat was active.

In any case, I was able to work around this by opening the windows when I went out for dinner. The windows appear to be original (I assume as a listed property they are limited in what they can change) but the management has installed a second set of glass behind them that keeps out drafts and adds another level of sound insulation. Open it could be noisy, but as I was out of the room I didn't care. I'd shut them before going to bed and slept just fine.

While not the cheapest hotel in Dublin, it was an amazing visit, and I hope I can return in the future.",5,2014,10,28
207,Great location - expensive,This is luxury.  The room service is terrific - fast and attentive.  The beds are so so cozy and comfy.  The hotel bar is the best. We loved Kate who took care of us every night.  She knew what we liked and made sure we enjoyed ourselves.  On the pricey side but worth it.  Stayed here more than 10 years ago.  Loved the room renovations.  Rest of hotel seemed the same.  The spot to be seen in the city!  Beautiful floral arrangements in lobby.,4,2014,10,28
207,Beautiful old world charm and luxury ,What can I say about this hotel..... Spent a wonderful Sunday night with my partner in Dublin and as a treat we decided to stay here. From the minute we checked in our every whim was looked after. The hotel just oozes class the staff are wonderful and the little touches just made our stay superb. It's a total hotel say no need to leave wining and dinning is worth a star it's so elegant. It's a hotel that always puts the guest first. ,5,2014,10,28
207,A Wonderful Old World Hotel,"I have stayed at the Shelbourne in the lead up to Christmas for the past two years and have stayed there for a wedding on another occasion. Each visit has been an experience in how luxury hotels should be run. The management and staff at the Shelbourne treat their guests as family, going out of their way to provide the best experience possible. 
I have booked to stay in one of the Heritage King rooms for the lead up to Christmas again this year before travelling on to see my family for the holidays. The Shelbourne at this time of year is the perfect accompaniment to the holiday season. I cannot wait to reacquaint myself with the Grand Old Lady on St Stephen's Green.",5,2014,10,28
207,An Elegant Oasis in the Center of Everything,"The perfect first stop on our 16 day tour of Ireland, the Shelbourne  was a welcoming retreat after our flight.  Its charm was accompanied by every modern convenience and the lobby, bar and restaurants offered wonderful options for dining and drinks at all times of day -- extremely helpful when adjusting to the change in time zones.  The staff was solicitous but never intrusive -- perfect!  The location was terrific for a short stay in Dublin, allowing for convenient access to Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, St. Patricks, the Archeology Museum and strolls to many pubs, restaurants and pubs.  We hated to leave!",5,2014,10,28
207,Amazing - High Tea ,"For my birthday I was treated to high tea at The Shelbourne. Don't know where to start, only by saying the service was amazing. The staff were totally professional, in line with the 5 star expectation, but also had a relaxed and informal approach when dealing with guests. Everyone we met was very friendly and helpful. The high tea itself was a wonderful experience and held in a picturesque room, where comfort and style go hand in hand. The selection of tea and coffee on the menu was extensive and very impressive. The handmade sandwiches were delicious and plentiful. The homemade deserts and baked goods were so fresh and tasty, could not be faulted. Will defiantly be back again to try something new.  ",5,2014,10,27
207,Lovely old hotel recently refurbished,"Beautiful and stately European hotel - our 3rd floor room was beautifully refurbished but did overlook a loading dock - even though it was a Deluxe Room the view was lacking. I attempted to email the hotel to advise of our early arrival but all emails were ""undelivered"" so upon arrival they were not prepared to give us a room till later in the day.  After a request to ""freshen up"" we were showed to the health club.  Suffering from jet lag and waiting for a room till 2pm in the afternoon wasted a good part of our 5 night stay in Dublin.  We enjoyed afternoon tea as well as an included morning breakfast each day in the Saddle Room.  Staff is polite and helpful.  I would give a five star rating if not for the problem with communications and the 5 hour wait for our room.",4,2014,10,27
207,What you can expect from a Renaissance hotel in Dublin,"The Shelbourne is the oldest hotel in Dublín, but recently refurbished. It is always full of people in and out, which gives the impression of a very alive establishment. Regardless this continuos flow of people, room floors are very quiet. The decoration style is that of a Georgian or Victorian period.
Breakfast buffet and a la carte is complete and of good quality.
The Concierge suggested us really good restaurants (Indian and Italian, in our case) and very helpful with anything we needed.
The staff is really really friendly (also with kids!) and made us feel like at home.",4,2014,10,27
207,Where do I began.,"We have traveled all over  the world and stayed in many beautiful hotels,  but the Shelbourne Hotel is an absolute statement in elegance and service.  The staff at every level goes above and beyond to make their guests feel very special.  From the moment one arrives , to be greeted by the doorman in top hats and tails , along with well trained staff to help your every need during your stay, makes for an outstanding experience.  This establishment is a testament that businesses should never lose sight for their quest to provide their customers with extraordinary service.  We will definitely be back.  Take note this establishment has been in business since the1800's. They have their own small museum with guests book to review. Over the years beautiful restorations have taken place, yet none of the intricacies have been lost.  The foyer welcomes you with beautiful fresh flowers, beautiful stairwells, and chandeliers to dazzle your eyes,  One final comment, location is perfect for walking to all types of fabulous shopping, tours, and restaurants.",5,2014,10,25
207,felt like royalty,"This is one my favorite hotels!!  My now fiance and I booked this hotel on the front end of our two week vacation in Ireland.  We stayed here for 3 nights and it was amazing!  The hotel is within walking distance to bars, restaurants, shopping, etc.  The staff was amazing!  The bed was one of the most comfy beds I've ever slept in.  Plus, the hotel is immaculate.  If you have the money or points to splurge, staying here won't disappoint.",5,2014,10,25
207,For Deluxe read Small!,"Despite being a Marriott Silver Elite member and having paid extra for a Deluxe room, we ended up with one of the the smallest, if not the smallest, room (according to the fire escape plan) on our floor during our event stay at the Shelbourne.  In addition, the in-room Wi-Fi appeared not to be working.  This is a lovely hotel and, in fairness to them, they did offer to change our room when I commented on the problems, however we were leaving early the following morning so it wasn't worth it.  However, the Shelbourne clearly does have some very small rooms, so be warned if you plan to stay there.  Your Marriott status and paying for a better room may not help you!",3,2014,10,25
207,"Wow, excellent service","As we arrived to the hotel doormen were waiting outside who unloaded our luggage out of the taxi right away and showed us in to checkin. We were quite early for checkin but they were able to store our luggage until the room was ready. Beautifully decorated and clean room. Aromatherapy shampoos and conditioner, your own robe, and little extras in the bathroom. The staff are all very friendly and would recommend to everyone. Location is great and short walks to most of the sights.",5,2014,10,20
207,What a fab place and service is 100%,"I have been to many a hotel in my travels but this has to be the best. From the time we walked through the door to the time we left we had only first class service. It was my wifes birthday and on the morning we were served by a very nice young ladt called Vere. She was 100%, She could not do enough for us and even when we were not in her serving area late in our visit she came and found us to see all was well.

Other staff we came across were good and we just loved our visit and would be happy to go back again.

A bit thanks to Vere and all the staff for making our visit so nice.

Sorry it has taken me so long to do my report. We were there end July begining of August 2014",5,2014,10,20
207,excellent room with fantastic view over St Stephens green,"have walked past this hotel for years and decide that i wanted to  wake up on my 50th Birthday in one of their lovely rooms over looking over the Green.
had watched the recent TV documentary about the hotel and was really excited.
Was not disappointed with the room and view.
check in was smooth and i said how excited i was as it was a treat for my  50th birthday. .
Receptionist told me i had booked a beautiful room and would not be disappointed.. it was a heritage park view room . 
it was far bigger than i though and an a amazing view even from the bathroom.
when we came back form the bar on the night of my birthday i was delighted when a bottle of wine was left with two glasses. i was overjoyed and thought it was from the hotel for my birthday. but it was from my pal and her husband. . 
i guess i was a little disappointed that there was not a little chocolate or something to say happy 50th.  yes a small gripe.
however on the night of my birthday it poured rain and due to it being an old building the rain did came through the window.
we put  towel around the ground below the window to soak up the water.that was coming in through the crack above the window frame. to be fair it had been raining horrendously all day.
over our two days we spent a good lot of time in the bar and had a lovely time. the food in the bar is fantastic.as is the staff.
breakfast was good also.",4,2014,10,20
207,Character and class,"Great hotel, would recommend to anyone looking somewhere with old world charm and character
Lots to see and do in thus area of Dublin as well with good choice of restaurants and nightlife. Worth staying in",5,2014,10,20
207,"""Total Comfort in Dublin""","This hotel exemplified the meaning of customer service....I was impressed from first entering the hotel to my departure. The Maid and room service was above what I was use to. Although the weather changes rapidly, I was very happy with the bar environment and daily breakfast at the hotel. The staff at reception was warm and very receptive and helpful each and every day. Our room was large, clean, quiet and comfortable, with excellent amenities. I don't think one can do any better unless you find a hotel with everything described near everything...",5,2014,10,19
207,Great experience,"We were in Dublin and decided to have a quick drink in the bar here. Well, when we arrived the bar was busy with no obvious seats, I was approached by a member of staff whe found 2 seats at the bar, the barman was attentive and welcoming, drinks and nuts were provided with a pleasant chat and we were made feel very welcome. This is a lovely bar area and weenie up spending a pleasant couple of hours. Leslie the barman., he is worth his weight in gold!",5,2014,10,19
207,Wonderful,"Our introduction to Dublin on a 4 week trip around Ireland was a 5 night stay at the wonderful Shelbourne Hotel. The staff at reception were all very helpful each and every day. Our room was large, clean, quiet and comfortable, with excellent amenities. The location is fantastic directly across from the glorious St Stephen's Green and although our room did not face the front, walking out of the doors each morning on that busy street across from the Green was delightful. We did not eat in the restaurant but happened to see people enjoying 'high tea' . There are many cafes and restaurants close by and Grafton St is just around the corner. Love the small history library in the front lobby and the slideshow of famous people who have stayed at the Shelbourne. This is a classic!",5,2014,10,18
207,Beautiful Hotel with old rooms.,"The hotel is beautiful, and is a great places for celebrations, parties, and the Spa is very good.
Also the tea room is nice to enjoy a real tea time on Saturdays.

The location couldn't be better, and it's great if you ask for a room facing the park.

The only but that I found, is that the room were old, It looks like they refurbished the room many years ago, and it will be great to do it again in order to be more appealing.

We stayed in a room facing the patio and it was very noisy, not because of the customer but because of the staff due to the cleaning.",3,2014,10,17
207,Christmas Shopping and The Shelbourne go hand in hand!,"We stayed here during December, coming up to Christmas.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Staff are amazing from the moment you take that first step from the pavement - just fabulous.  We had afternoon tea in the elegant Saddle Room.  Everything you could possibly expect from a fantastic hotel and much more!  We drank cocktails in the Horseshoe bar and the atmosphere was incredible. The fire was lighting, big comfy chairs and sofas appointed around the room but it has a contemporary feel also.  Rooms are beautiful and well stocked.  There is such a historic feel about this hotel, it's hard not to get sucked in.  Breakfast was wonderful and Dublin city & St Stephen's Green are right on the doorstep - it's really a fantastic hotel in a superb location.",5,2014,10,17
207,A touch of class,"The Shelbourne hotel is pretty much the place to stay in Dublin.it has history, class style and not a little glamour.
It used to be a bit frumpy until it's makeover , but now it gets the best of Dublin society and it's visitors.
Bar is now modern and classy and lots of talent for girls and boys!",5,2014,10,16
207,"Dublin Landmark, Best location in Dublin","Stay in this living piece of Irish history. Fully restored to its past glory. The restaurant meal was 5*, wonderful service and ambiance. Extensive wine list. Our table of 10 was no problem for the dining room. Bar was lively. The high tea experience was lovely. Would love to return for a longer visit. Internet is sketchy in this historic hotel. Ask to use the busiess center if you have online needs. An ethernet cable may be worth throwing in the suitcase.",5,2014,10,15
207,Historic Hotel in the heart of Dublin.,"having arrived early the receptionist Katy took our luggage and was one of the most pleasant efficient front of house staff I've ever dealt with.
Upon returning though, I was grunted at by an Eastern European lady whom barked at me to wait!! I was astounded this would happen anywhere let alone a 5star hotel; an Irish guy then took over and order was restored.

The room was fabulous, with a large king bed and steps up to a large bathroom with Elemis showering products, fluffy robes and Amazonian shower over the bath. 

Breakfast was delightful until I found a large piece of plastic in my fruit! The manager apologised but didn't offer a good will gesture which I found to be poor service as I'm sure a greasy spoon would offer a good will gesture! 

The little museum is well worth a visit as you can see Princess Grace of Monaco, and other famous guests and history of The Shelbourne.  ",5,2014,10,15
207,Elegant place to stay in Dublin.,"My husband and I stopped briefly at this Marriott hotel in Dublin on our way home from Italy.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff beyond accommodating.  We were offered complimentary drinks and a breakfast buffet.  Suffering from a cold, I opted for dinner at the Shelbourne and made an excellent choice for a poor reason.  My husband was particularly pleased that my condition led to such a nice meal. [Try the pre-theatre dinner special--a good value.] 

The rooms are comfortable (ours had recently been redecorated) with any amenity you could need.  When I requested an extra pillow, one was delivered before I could put the phone in the cradle and return to my chair.

The Shelbourne is in an excellent location for visiting the art museum, parks (on St. Stephen's Green), Trinity College, pubs and the major shopping area.  You need not walk far to find the River Liffey and the Ha'Penny Bridge.

We even had lunch at the hotel.  We sat in the living room and enjoyed a light lunch before leaving for the airport.  I recommend trying tea when you are there.  

The elegant atmosphere, the service and the accommodations at the Shelbourne will not disappoint!",5,2014,10,14
207,Great location,"Perfect location.... Great restaurant and bar! Breakfast with lots of selection, the oyster bar staff are very efficient
Need for improvement : room needs to refurbish, needs more improvement telephoje operator/service centre...
Overall hotel is nice and we will come back ",4,2014,10,14
207,Did not live up to expectations,"On a recent visit to Dublin, my other half decided to treat us to some luxury for a couple of nights at one of Dublin's most famous hotels.  We arrived late on a Friday with some fairly high expectations sadly not realised.

First problem was the room.  On entering it we quickly realised this was not what was reserved.  We called reception who advised us our select room was unavailable.  We were left to sit it out where we were while the reception figured it out before we were offered the wheelchair accessible equivalent of what we'd expected.  This we accepted and eventually was shown our new room.

There were issues with the new room... and I'll mention those later, but what really irked us was the quality of reception we received.  We booked the hotel at some considerable cost through a Hotels.com.  And for that we were made to feel less than special.  When he asked about Marriott points, my partner was told they were unavailable as a 3rd party was used.  When we complained about the room, we were told that our confirmed room with the booking service could not be guaranteed with them.  The implication that our 3rd party booking was something less than equal to a direct one.  I get it.  Mistakes are made.  But for a hotel of this caliber you expect them to take ownership of the problem, find a resolution... and not blame it on someone else.

To be honest, there was little in the interior decor of the hotel - both rooms/reception areas - which screamed luxury.  Even then a hotel can excel on its service alone.  This didn't and what was expected to be a bit of Dublin extravagance was nothing more than a rather nice property in a global chain.  

Breakfast which was included in our rate was at the very least excellent.

Final note on a wheelchair access room.  Wheelchair accessible it was, but it felt the accessibility was an afterthought particularly in the bathroom.  The shower area was protected from the rest of the bathroom by a cheap flimsy curtain which fell off with a good tug.  The whole room would flood after a shower.  There was not place to put toiletries if you had a shower.  And there was a uncovered hole for a drain in the floor.  Dangerous for anyone not in a wheel chair.  Finally the grips and railings to help access were cheap plastic.

If I were a wheelchair user I would most definitely feel the 2nd class citizen people often with mobility issues have to endure.",2,2014,10,14
207,Best place to stay in Dublin for leisure,"Nice bedding ,quality decent room , do not expect a view , expensive hotel but you can grab good prices if your dates are flexible...The Bars and the restaurants are the best things about the hotel ,they are highly popular in Dublin, you do not even have to leave your hotel for a good night out..Reception was so lovely and kind...You will feel like your family hotel even on your first stay...
Strongly recommended...",4,2014,10,14
207,Simply the very finest!,We were lucky enough to stay at this property for 5 exceptional nights at the beginning of our tour of Ireland.  It remains the very finest hotel we have visited. Wonderful caring staff throughout; beautiful rooms and delicious food -particularly the breakfasts!,5,2014,10,13
207,just what you would expect!,"Fantastic place, history abounds and service remains fantastic. Do not stay in Dublin and miss this place, it exudes comfort, style but is never pretentious. You have not visited Dublin without walking through these doors.",5,2014,10,12
207,All that you'd expect from a 5 star hotel,"I stayed here for a friends wedding. It's a superb hotel, although you pay royally for it. 

It overlooks St Stephens Green (an attractive public park that's a popular spot on a nice day) and is a short walk from the top of Grafton Street. 

There are lots of cafés, bars and restaurants within 10 minutes walk for those that don't want to pay 5 star prices but for those that are happy to, you won't be disappointed. Breakfast offers an excellent choice of hot and cold options and the wedding dinner was restaurant quality fine dinning (in spite of us being a large group of twenty or so). 

The rooms are lovely (although the zig zag of corridors through the adjoining buildings, that make up the hotel, can be a little disorienting), the wi-fi is refreshingly free and the health & fitness facilities good. 

For those flying in to Dublin Airport there's a regular airport coach (that stops just around the corner on Kildare St) for around €8 (TBH I can't quite remember the exact amount) which compares with around €25-30 for a taxi.",5,2014,10,12
207,What a Great Visit!,"This is a wonderful hotel in a wonderful city.  Great service, and a great location close to many places we wanted to visit.  And, in the evening - less than a block from great pubs with authentic music.  Wonderful food, we especially enjoyed High Tea, relaxing wonderful room, music, and service--The dessert theme was ""Strawberry Days"", and when we told the hostess we had strawberry allergies, the chef prepared special  pastries, just for us!  Not one, mind you; but six different varieties!. Other meals were excellent too. Truly a great place to stay.",5,2014,10,12
207,"What else can I say, it's the shelbourne","My Girlfriend and I stayed in the beautiful shelbourne two days before St Patrick day this year and although I am sure they where very busy getting ready for one of there craziest days of the year, everything was perfect.

207,Location and history with great service,"An iconic name within Dublin city for aeons. Located overlooking St Stephens Green. Dawson Street with its many bars and restaurants is a short walk. Grafton Street a tad further. Baggot Street has all of its famous hostelries a short walk away as well. Service levels and rooms are luxurious. Valet parking service. Knowledgeable concierge. And, of course, the famous Horseshoe bar. Always a vibrant place with an eclectic mix of Dubliners and visitors alike. One of the best breakfasts you could have. Afternoon tea.. Its just part of the heritage, history and ambiance of the Shelbourne",5,2014,10,11
207,What a fabulous hotel.  Top drawer!,"This hotel truly capped a vacation of a lifetime!  My husband, daughter and I recently stayed at the Shelbourne from September 18 through the 25.  I had no idea that I had booked one of the premiere hotels in Ireland.  I booked through Marriott and had spent the previous week up North in B&B B's.  Obviously , there was no comparison!  The service, full Irish breakfast in the Saddle Room, Horseshoe Bar and Oyster Bar were each unique in their own way.  We tried them all and loved each one.  The Tea Service in The Lord Mayor's Lounge was delightful and service very attentive. The Spa was fun and I totally enjoyed resting afterwards in the Relaxation Room, watching the world go by.  We were there during Culture Night and enjoyed all of the evenings festivities.  Our Irish family members joined us from Naas and Meath for some enjoyable conversation in the Horseshoe and agreed wholeheartedly, when in Dublin enjoy this classy hotel with a delightfully attentive staff and newly furnished rooms.  We hope to come back soon.",5,2014,10,10
207,Excellent Service,"Great place with that extra detail that makes the whole difference... they remember your face and your name! Will definitely come back, specially for breakfast it is superb! Rooms are cleaned and quiet, complimentary water (still and sparkling), bathrobe and slippers...",5,2014,10,10
207,Wonderful hotel in a great location,"I was fortunate to stay here for 4 nights and cannot say enough about the service.  We arrived on an early morning flight and though unable to get into a room immediately, our bags were stored and we were on our way.  It had started raining as we were about to leave and the doorman heard me mention I need to get my bag to grab my umbrella and before I knew it he was handing me one of the hotel's umbrellas.  

We were put in a renovated room which had plenty of room for two, and a nice bathroom.  The beds were incredibly comfortable and I slept great which doesn't often happen In a hotel.  I found the hotel quiet, no hearing doors close or people in the hallways at all.

Breakfast daily in the Saddle room had anything you need for a substantial breakfast and the bar was a nice place to wind down after a day or touring.

The concierge was very helpful in giving directions and I found all the people working at The Shelbourne accommodating.  That along with the close proximity to Grafton Street, Trinity college and many pubs and restaraunts, I cannot come up with anything not positive.  Great hotel and worth the money.",5,2014,10,08
207,Excellent hotel but a few small issues,"Stayed for two nights B&B recently. We were very impressed with the service provided by all the staff we encountered. We were on the 8th floorat the rear, facing the office block. The advantage was that you could glimpse Dublin Bay from the window.
The bedroom was recently renovated and was spacious. The bed was very comfortable and there was no traffic noise etc. The bathroom was the room with some problems. The grouting in the bath/shower had some mould on it and there were some stains on the floor tiles. The water flow in the shower was just adequate.
Our breakfast was served in the very comfortable Saddle Room and while there was a good food choices I was surprised that no fish appeared on the menu. Also there was a limited choice of cheeses and cold meats. The full Irish breakfast was good but the sausages lacked flavour and the white pudding was turgid. However the omlette was very flavoursome and cooked freshly in full view. There was also an issue with one of the chairs on one of the mornings which was not of the hotel's making. Somebody had stuck some very sticky material to the underside of the chair. I reported this to one of the waitng staff and they undertook to remedy this. Obviously this is an issue that  hotels can do little about except to routinely check furniture.
Overall we were very happy with our stay and as this stay was a gift it was greatly appreciated.
We would certainly recommend the hotel for a short stay as it is very central with St Stephen's Green across the road and the main shopping streets just a short stroll away.",4,2014,10,08
207,Afternoon tea - fantastic,"Brought my mum here for afternoon tea for her birthday.  What a great experience.  We had 3 teenagers and a toddler with us and they were all looked after.  The service was excellent, the food was splendid, the atmosphere is superb (as you would expect from the Shelbourne).  Booking in advance is almost essential although walkins are occasionally lucky.  Enjoy! (BTW we had afternoon tea in another 5 star hotel in Wicklow and was not impressed - more expensive and service not as good).",5,2014,10,08
207,Wonderful stay in a beautiful hotel,"We recently spent 8 nights the end of September.  Our room faced an office building, but the room was appointed with nice sheers and light blocking drapes, so the view was not an issue.  I'm assuming our room was one recently renovated and it was lovely.  So many things to note- tasteful décor, soft closing drawers and a beautiful marble bath with nice amenities.  As a tall person, I especially appreciated soaking in the oversized tub.  I was actually able to stretch out and that is not always possible!  Most important to us-we had a most incredibly comfortable bed with crisp, fresh  bedding, a cozy comforter and large pillows-not too hard and not too soft.  Crawling into bed each night was literally just right!  Little things like a daily paper delivery, notices delivered without interruption, friendly staff greetings, to even having a good quality hair dryer were appreciated.  We dined daily in the Saddle Room for breakfast and found the buffet to be fine with a nice assortment of breakfast fare to begin our days-especially loved the fresh squeezed juices.  I enjoyed a relaxing spa day and all our needs were met by the concierge, including reserving front seats on a side tour we took without asking for them.  What a nice surprise!  The hotel is ideally located.  We had easy access to whatever we wanted to do- be it on foot or by bus.  I loved the historical feel of this grand hotel and am pleased that the renovations seem to honor that.  I feel very fortunate to have enjoyed such a pleasant stay in this fine hotel.",5,2014,10,07
207,Great Hotel,"The hotel is a great place to stay if you want to see Dublin at foot. It s placed within walking distance of most things.
The hotel it self is a great stay. The rooms are of very high quality, and the staff is very serviceminded.
Stayed there from Friday to Sunday and enjoyed it very much",5,2014,10,07
207,Beautiful historical hotel,"Just returned from a 1 night stay with 2 small children in September this year. What a beautiful hotel. I have read some other reviews of The Shelbourne Dublin and they are unfair. So many comments about tired rooms and unrenovated facilities but we loved the rooms. Yes they weren't modern, but a modern room would be an insult to such a culturally important building as this. The suite that we stayed in was fabulous, gorgeous marble bathroom and 2 separate  rooms both overlooking St Stephens Green. Such a fabulous position! You really do feel that you are staying somewhere incredibly special and it's easy to get caught up in Dublins history. I particularly loved the genealogy room, just off the reception, many beautiful  historical photos featuring the hotel in the early 1900's. I can't recommend this hotel enough... Staying in a beautifully  maintained ( not modernised) hotel in one of Europe's most charming cities is a must. Also, I indulged in a facial at the spa and it was fantastic, no wonder the spa had won best in Europe this year!",5,2014,10,07
207,LOVELY HOTEL,"We recently stayed just for one night - I loved this hotel, I loved the decor throughout.  Our bedroom was perfect and also the bathroom. We dined in the Saddle Room Restaurant and it was beautiful.  We asked to sit at the Oyster Bar as we enjoy watching the kitchen in full swing.  We also enjoyed the buzz in the main bar even though it was very busy all staff were very attentive and friendly. The Lobby was probably a bit busy but bedroom corridors & our bedroom was perfectly quite. The  location is perfect especially if you are going on a shopping break. So enjoyed our stay and can't wait to return.",5,2014,10,07
207,MISREPRESENTATION,"Visiting Dublin for an important formal dinner, I emailed The Shelbourne weeks in advance to book a 'Heritage' one bedroom suite for the two nights of my stay. Having read that some rooms were still in need of renovation, I particularly requested that I should be allocated a suite as shown on the hotel website which appeared to be smart and luxurious. I also requested an early check-in.
On arrival (at about 12:30 pm) my room was not ready but I was content to wait and enjoyed a light lunch in the bar. On being shown to my room I discovered that although it was huge and did have a view of St Stephen's Green, it was not only un-renovated, old-fashioned and distinctly tired but also contained TWO double beds! I was told ""this is one of the best suites in the hotel"" and on remonstrating that it was not what I had expected was informed ""none of our suites have been renovated yet"". So why is there a photograph on the website purporting to be of a Heritage Suite and why was I not told this on first booking and offered an alternative? This is misrepresentation and at 800 euros a night completely unacceptable.
Sophie, the duty customer services manager, did apologise and reduced the charge for one night (why not both?), but this was not the point as my expectation of a special stay in a luxury hotel had been dashed. 
Generally, the staff were polite, pleasant and helpful but the Concierge team seemed rather disconnected, not remembering who I was from moment to moment despite having had a lengthy email correspondence with me re transfers and restaurant reservations. Indeed, I had found it quite difficult to get a prompt response to emails prior to my visit from both the Concierge and Customer Services.
Beware The Shelbourne at weekends as it becomes a complete madhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings, with hordes of revellers in the bars making an appalling racket and with nowhere for residents to sit quietly and enjoy a drink. I fled to the peace and calm of the Merrion Hotel just around the corner, where I shall certainly stay on future visits to Dublin.",2,2014,10,06
207,Disappointing Service,"We chose this hotel because of its location and reputation. However, the service was less than desirable. They screwed up our reservation not once but twice. We were locked out of our room both times and it took an hour to get it sorted out each time after we came back from our golf. My husband had to show them our reservation confirmation email to confirm that we were indeed booked for that many nights. And to top it off, they had confirmed the departure date when we checked in so not sure why this happened to us twice. We also had a bad experience the first night in the bar. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came to wait on us. This was a Sunday night and at 9:30PM and there was certainly plenty of staff around. However on all the ensuing evenings, we used the same server my sister had on that same Sunday night when she arrived late at the hotel and Kate was fantastic. She was the most attentive person we experienced in the entire hotel.

As for the room, it was great with a fantastic bed and pillows. The shower water pressure was poor but survivable. The breakfast options were also fantastic.",3,2014,10,05
207,Great Location,"Being a Lifetime Platinum Member, and a Lifetime Gold spouse, with Marriott for many years, I am quite spoiled with exceptional service when I check in to their properties around the world and being given outstanding service.

Although this hotel is historic with a fascinating history, terrific spa and pool, and located in a great park of the City, we had a so-so experience.  Particularly at check in.

We arrived at 10:00 AM the morning of check-in, having emailed them a week prior of this early arrival, and Regina at the front desk tried to assist.  She said she saw we had a request in for additional pillows and an upgrade, but the room would not be ready for two hours.  So we went into the restaurant and had breakfast (which closed at 11:00 and we had to leave so they could set up lunch).  FOUR hours of sitting directly across from the reception desk, and watching other guests check in and get their keys, and checking with Regina every hour, she finally allowed us to move into our room.  This was just not acceptable treatment.  Especially when they told us every hour that the room had been vacated and would be ready ""within the hour"".

By 3:30, when we got to our room we were exhausted.

Not a great experience.  I believe using points at this property is a questionable decision.  It appears there is a separate standard of care.

But as I stated earlier... the property is beautiful, the hotel staff helpful (except our experience at checkin), housekeeping was great, and the staff in the restaurants, spa, and lobby bars were fabulous.",3,2014,10,05
207,Dublin 's Finest,"My husband and I spent two nights at the Shelbourne Dublin on the recommendation of family. We were very pleased with our accommodations. Our room was elegant and luxurious. We also were delighted with the proximity to most popular tourist attractions.
I must admit that the hotel staff make the stay memorable. They were the most gracious and helpful group of professionals we have ever encountered our travels. Thank you!",5,2014,10,05
207,Classic Dublin Hotel - Great Location,"We stayed here on two separate occasions within a week of each other. 

i am not sure why but the hotel upgraded us each time and put us in a suite in the old main building with a view of St. Stephens Green.    The hotels is old and could use a renovation, especially in the public areas.   

Overall the service was great in the hotel and any ask was accommodated. 

The Saddle Room (the restaurant) for breakfast was very good and the service was impeccable.  Combination of buffet and off menu.  The other F&B areas including the bars were not great.  The main bar to the left of the reception felt like a chain pub in London.  

Location was also great, very central.",4,2014,10,04
207,"Good Marriott Hotel, that is it.","I am a regular business traveller and stay in hotels more than I like or care to remember. I stayed for 2 nights at the Shelbourne , great thing about the Shelbourne is the location, other than that it’s a typical 5 star hotel and nothing to rave about.  The staff were courteous, polite and accommodating.  I don't think the house keeping is top notch, one evening I saw a cleaning cloth left in the bathroom and a plastic bag. I called reception and had that removed.  The hotel itself is old, it is not architecturally well constructed.  The hallways are claustrophobic and breakfast area is dark, with no windows.  I don't like to eat, particularly, breakfast in dark windowless places. Dinner or lunch I don't mind.  In terms of breakfast the selection is pretty standard, you are not going to see smoked salmon (at least I didn’t for the 2 days) on buffet.  And the most annoying thing for me is the lobby in the evening is like a train station, too crowded and noisy.  Sorry I like quiet places. 

The gym is good, and machines are new (life fitness brand). I did not venture into the spa but walked past, seems good. 

The hotel is priced right at the top end, some nights even touching the 500 euro mark. While the price is right I don't think Shelbourne is right value for money, unless one of your fetishes is old world hotels build a century ago with new carpets and glistening door knobs.  Not my cup of tea. 

I rather harshly compare all hotels to Four Seasons, and the Dublin Four Seasons is no different.  The breakfast areas is large and overlooking the courtyard, the staff, like in all FS properties, embarrass you with politeness.  Only drawback is that the property is a bit out of town,  my view is that in a city with average taxi wait time of less than 5 minutes it really does not matter if you have to stay a bit outside.  Breakfast spread is very good, all in all I didn’t have anything to complain about.   And FS also has an overnight laundry service which Shelbourne doesn’t,  for a business traveller travelling with one suit this service is a must.  

I like Marriott hotels, and also their generous point redemption scheme in comparison to Hilton.  But Marriott has proven it cannot run a luxury brand (Ritz Carlton being another Marriott property that falls short in few properties) alongside a mass market brand.  

If you are discerning and fussy about the minor details I suggest look at Four Seasons in Dublin,  but if you are not annoyed by small things and want to stay in an old world hotel in a central location Shelbourne should be your choice.  

Good luck in Dublin.",3,2014,10,03
207,All around great hotel,My wife and I stayed there on our last day in Ireland on a recent trip. The check in went great. We were offered lemonade and cookies while we finished our paperwork. Nice touch. The staff is very attentive to your needs. The rooms are great sized and outfitted very well. The location of the hotel makes it so easy to get around the city. I highly recommend this hotel for both business and pleasure.  ,5,2014,10,03
207,"Great location, staff a bit stuffy","We stayed at the Shelbourne on our last night in Ireland. You can't beat the location as it is right off St. Stephen's Green in within steps of the main shopping district and a slew of wonderful pubs and restaurants. Our room was very nice, with an extra large bathroom with marble floors and fixtures. The shower needed a good scrub down for mold, however as it had permeated in between the tiles -- a little Clorox goes a long way, Marriott! The bed was incredibly comfortable. 

The staff who checked us in was quite friendly and accommodating, as were the bell hops who indicated a few good happy hour bars in Temple Bar. 

We chose to eat dinner in the hotel. The food was incredible, probably one of the meals we had in Ireland in terms of freshness and uniqueness of flavor. The oysters with Guinness sabayon must be tried. We, however, were initially disappointed with the way we were treated when we asked to move from the stuffy back room, where my husband was sweating it out under the fluorescent spotlights to the front oyster bar which was more relaxed and MUCH cooler. All cordiality and respect shot out the window when we settled at the bar and our original waitress turned on her heel. It took a while before someone--I believe the manager--approached us again and his attitude was a bit curt. 

That said, once our new waiter settled in to serve us, he was friendly and inviting and gave wonderful recommendations. We also chatted up the chilled seafood chef--Tony--making the beautiful platters behind the bar and enjoyed hearing about his ice sculptures and floral design.  Dinner turned out great but, in my opinion, for hotel guests paying for a high-priced meal (almost $200), there was no need to treat us so poorly for our seating choice. Thus, I only rate the Shelbourne 4 stars.",4,2014,10,02
207,Old World Elegance!,"A lovely historic hotel in the heart of Dublin!  Directly across from a lovely park and within walking distant of Trinity College and other Dublin attractions.  The main bar is beautiful and full of Dublin business people and hotel guests, the restaurant is good and the service was excellent.  Don't miss the small museum in the lobby that highlights the hotel's historic significance. ",5,2014,10,01
207,Very central and nice,"This was a great place to stay. Very central to most of the areas you'd want to visit in Dublin. The rooms are nice and service is great. The breakfast is very good and was included with the room rate (in our case it was at least, but not sure this is always the case).",5,2014,10,01
207,Nice Hotel,"Great location right across the street from St. Stephan's Green and close to much of Dublin.  Room was very nice with an extremely comfy bed - very quiet.  Excellent staff.  Breakfast buffet at the hotel was perfect with so much to choose from.  
My only negative comment would be about one of the restaurants in the hotel.  We ate dinner in #29 or #27 - I can't remember.  Absolutely terrible service - would not go back there.  
We did enjoy the Shelbourne and I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,10,01
207,great experience.,"We just completed our second visit to this hotel. It's been 5 yrs since we were there last and the hotel has been updated. Our room had that ""new"" smell to it. We even had a balcony (two rooms on the 7th floor had a balcony) Our room was large and comfortable. The bathroom had double sinks which was like being at home. Someone could better engineer the bath/shower but the bathroom is newly done over and all high end fixtures. The hotel staff was very helpful. And the fitness center/spa is over the top. Great cardio equipment, nice pool and the locker rooms were clean and had plenty of space. One of the nicer hotel fitness centers you'll find.  Great location too. Convenient to everything we wanted to see and we walked all around the city. Ad the wifi was one of the easiest ones to connect to that I've experienced.",5,2014,10,01
207,Fantastic stay - we'll be back (hopefully soon),"I live in Dublin so we weren't traveling far for a night away. However, with young children when the opportunity arose for the grandparents to babysit we jumped at it and booked in to the Shelbourne for the night.

When booking I mentioned that it was our wedding anniversary and upon arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite which was amazing and very big - a good sized bedroom, massive bathroom and a large sitting room. 

I've stayed in a few 5-star hotels in Dublin but the thing I liked about the Shelbourne (from the moment I lifted the phone to book) was that the staff were professional but also extremely friendly - not at all pretentious as I've found in some other hotels. 

The bar is lovely for a drink before dinner and breakfast was very nice (although I wouldn't say it was fantastic).

Obviously the location couldn't be better.

Keep up the great work guys.",5,2014,09,30
207,First class old school charm,"This is an old school hotel in the finest sense.  Those of you who have been in Chicago, think of the Drake Hotel, but better.  The location is ideal, across from St. Stephan's Green.  The center of Dublin isn't that large, so it is easy to walk around to most sites.  The buffet breakfast starts at 6:30 during the week and 7:00 during the weekend.  It is a very thorough and well done buffet.  One interesting twist.  You can pour some Jamesons Irish Whiskey on your porridge.  I understand the porridge is very good.  

Another interesting twist--I went to mail some postcards.  I took them to the front desk.  I was told that I didn't need to stamp them, they would have provided the stamps for me.  That's a nice touch.  

Tea is very popular and sometimes it is so busy that it is only open to hotel guests.  You may substitute champagne for tea, if you wish.

They have a bar, I believe that it is called number 27.  It is a very large bar.  I worked as a bartender and bar waiter in resorts when I was going to college.  This bartending crew is, by far, the most efficient that I have ever seen in my life.  At the same time, they are still very friendly.  The hostess who greets you is a pure joy.  She is very nice to talk to, and is genuinely friendly and helpful.  I will remember her in her ponytail. :).  Overall, nice job people.

They have a lot of wedding receptions there on the weekend.  They handle them with a lot of class.  One thing that I learned--Irish love to wear hats on dress up occasions.

Overall, this was the perfect place to start an Irish vacation.",5,2014,09,29
207,Nice hotel but needs updating,"The hotel is in a great location in central Dublin.  The hotel has a lot of history and the staff is generally very good.  I would say certain features are a little lacking, the internet connection drops far too often, the floor creeks and the gym doesn't open until 8am on the weekends.  In general, a good hotel and with a few changes could be much better.",4,2014,09,29
207,Very Nice Hotel,"I planned two weeks in Ireland and it included 4 different hotels. Two were on the B&B side and two were actual hotels. The Shelbourne is a little pricey and the service is that of a normal hotel. Having said that the room itself was fantastic. One of my favorites. The room is not very large but after a week and half of sleeping on OK beds it was a relief to be sleeping again on a bed as comfortable as this one. I didn’t want to leave!! If I ever make it back to Dublin I could easily see myself staying here again! Lovely place.

Also, as it was a little warm during the length of our visit, it was nice to be in place that had air conditioning. I didn't realize how much I'd missed it.",5,2014,09,28
207,"""Can't wait to return...""","I love this hotel! The service of the staff exceeded my expectations. On my next visit I plan to never venture outside it's walls so I can fully experience everything this hotel has to offer. It is full of old world charm while still being a modern hotel. 

I had a lovely suite which was beautifully decorated. The living room was spacious as was the bedroom. The bathroom was large and all marble.The shower was the best of any I had while in Ireland. The bed was also the most comfortable one I had been in on my trip.

The location was perfect for me. I was able to walk to all of the ""must see"" attractions. I started my sightseeing adventures by walking directly across the street to board a ""Hop on, Hop off"" bus and get my bearings as this was my first trip to Ireland. The hotel itself is rich with history and hosts its own mini museum near reception. There is also the services of a genealogist available for those exploring their family history.

While at the hotel I also booked a service at the spa. It was nicely appointed with a rich feel. I liked that the robes and towels were a chocolate color rather that the typical white at most spas. My massage was very good. The pool was beautiful and the fitness center was also great.

The Horseshoe Bar, The Saddle Room and No.27 Bar were all wonderful as well. The food and service was excellent. 

Again, I love this hotel!",5,2014,09,28
207,Outstanding hotel and service,"This is simply one of the best hotels we have stayed in.
From the great location in Dublin city centre to the friendly welcome by the doorman and the excellent comfortable rooms, everything about this hotel is perfect.
The staff are friendly and very helpful. As an example, I asked a member of the staff for a specific business room and was personally escorted to the floor above instead of being given the directions The bedrooms and bathroom was enormous with a very comfortable king size bed and excellent temperature control. The bathroom is luxurious and the size of many hotel bedrooms you might stay in! The location is perfect for visiting Dublins main attractions or shopping. Breakfast was superb with personal service.
It was great to stay in a place with character as well as all the comforts you would expect from a 5 star hotel. 
In summary, a superb hotel.",5,2014,09,28
207,great staff,a beautiful historic building right in the heart of the city. Modern amenities but put on a way to keep with the original building. saddle room at the hotel great breakfast and dinner. staff exceptionally friendly. Great experience. The rooms are a bit small.,5,2014,09,28
207,Outstanding,"We stand at the Shelbourne Hotel August 29th, 30th and 31st of 2014. We were with a group of 6 other couples and only 3 of the couples stay at the Shelbourne Hotel. We made the right decision in paying a little more and staying there. It is right where you want to be and the hotel is fantastic. It even has a small museum by the front desk which you should check out. The location is right by St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street and walking distance to the Temple Bar. The hotel rooms are large and the food is great. Our breakfast was included everyday and it was a full hot breakfast buffet. The bar was wonderful each night and the service was great. We all were very pleased with our choice. The couples that didn’t stay at the Shelbourne hung out at our hotel lobby bar because they didn’t want to go back to their own hotels. Highly suggested.",5,2014,09,26
207,A matriarch of the hotels world,"the Shebourne really is one of those iconic hotels; located on St Stephens Green the location is fantastic within walking distance of a lot of the must see areas of Dublin.  The hotel is old world charm with old world service - everything you would expect, want and more.  The rooms are not overly big but are extremely comfortable (the beds and pillows - my main benchmark on quality - were exceptional).  The Horse shoe bar was a great place to hang out in the evening and the Guinness was one of the best pints I had.  If I had to give any negative it would only be the hotel was a little on the hot side in all public areas.",5,2014,09,24
207,A stunning hotel,"We chose this hotel as we tend to choose Marriott hotels as my husband is a gold member for life. This usually gives us free breakfast and upgrades. There was no upgrade available but our room was quite lovely if on the small side. The location was perfect as this was our last night in Ireland and it was good to be in the center of Dublin as we only had one day there.  This hotel was extremely nice but maybe a bit too pretentious, as they seem to play up all the important people that have stayed there, such as Michelle Obama just a short time ago. We ate in their bar and lounge which was fine but nothing exceptional. The service there actually was on the poor side.",4,2014,09,23
207,Old World Comfort,"They don't make hotels like this anymore - large suites, high ceilings and plush comfortable furniture. The bed was very comfortable and I had a great sleep! The service was fast, friendly and professional. The location is perfect (for business or pleasure). Great cocktails (and a nice crowd) at the Horseshoe Bar. This isn't my absolute favorite hotel in Dublin, but it's definitely in the top 5.",5,2014,09,23
207,Wonderful hotel,I stayed in the hotel with my husband and adult daughter.  We had two rooms that were both tastefully furnished and very clean.  The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating whenever we had questions or needed any service.  The hotel is located in a good area from which to base sightseeing.  The breakfast buffet was wonderful.  We would stay highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,09,22
207,"I, too, stayed at The Shelbourne in Dublin.","Sadly, my 2-night stay was too short. The park across the street is a terrific retreat from the City. The location is superb to banks, dining, shopping, city Bus and Hop-on Hop-off tour. Staying at the Shelbourne was divine - made me feel like a Queen!",5,2014,09,22
207,Staying in History,"This hotel is steeped in History, my girlfriend booked this hotel for a surprise visit for my 30th. The hotel is so elegant and the fact you are staying some where that is etched in Dublins history gives it that edge. The only downside was the size of the room we payed just close to £350 for a night and the room wasn't much bigger than the double bed in it.. The shower was amazing and the 2 bars downstairs we loved and had a couple of drinks in. The breakfast in the morning was excellent and even catered for gluten free. All in all it was an excellent stay and we enjoyed ourselves very much, Dublin is an unbelievable place with even better people",4,2014,09,22
207,Wedding Anniversary (bad) experience!,"I am a die hard client of Marriott for the simple reason that I try to reward my family with  stays at nice hotels with my points for putting up with me being gone so much.  

So this is our wedding anniversary here in Dublin, and I will spare the long story to tell you that for the staff and managememt of this hotel, you are cattle.

I called with ample advance to let them know this was a special stay and that I was looking for an upgrade.  Upon arrival, I was told that because of a football game, they were sold out of the good rooms, but they would put me on a ""quiet"" room, which meant to drag your luggage up and down some stairs into a conjoined building and them face the back of what looks to be the hotel's kitchen (see pic) which they call ""stunning city views"".
As a platinum member of the Marriott program, you usually have access to the exec. Lounge, but here, they give you 1 (one) free ""regular"" drink coupon (see pic #2).

So don't expect to feel special at this hotel. ... 40,000 points or 400 Euro a night gets you a mediocre experience at best.",3,2014,09,22
207,It's just okay,"Having stayed in my fair share of five star hotels, the Shelbourne's rooms just don't cut it for me. The double beds are definitely not to standard size and are not overly comfortable. For the price paid, one would expect a decent sized bed and little extras that were missing. Now don't get me wrong the hotel itself is absolutely charming and magnificent and I shall be reviewing the bar in a separate review but what I would suggest is stay elsewhere and come to the Shelbourne's bar for cocktails before your evening meal. It's fab for people watching and just sitting in comfortable opulence.",3,2014,09,21
207,Best afternoon tea ever,"I've been here numerous times and every time I go for the afternoon tea. I live in London now but make an effort to visit this place 3 or 4 times a year just for the tea. It is so worth it! Amazing sandwiches, scones and deserts. I have to say in the past I have loved the different choices of tea and the new sandwiches that come onto the menu. 

The service has always been impeccable and when there was a small issue with a tea with dietary requirements the staff handled it excellently and made us feel at home. 

Currently looking to visit again during the Christmas break and maybe even bring my parents this time! Very excited!!!",5,2014,09,21
207,A massive let down,"I was very much looking forward to my night at The Shelbourne as I had stayed here in Aug 2013 for a couple of nights & it was excellent but this time around it was a totally different experience & I left really disappointed.  My sister in law & myself checked in last Saturday @ 1pm, my booking was for a Deluxe King Room, at the time of booking it didn't give an option for twin beds (I booked 3 months ago) so I requested a twin on the booking form.  We checked in & I confirmed our room with the receptionist, stating separate beds, which he said was fine but the room wasn't ready yet & the room would be ready from 3pm, so we could leave our bags & when we came back later all we would have to do is pick up the keys & the bags would be sent up as we were checked in now.  That was perfect for us as we were heading to a show in Dublin for the afternoon.  We got back in the early evening, collected our key (found it strange I had to ask for a 2nd one) & went to our room.  It only had the one bed so I went back down to reception to change room but was told they were fully booked & a twin room should not have been confirmed for me by the original receptionist.  I was offered a roll away bed, free of charge but this to me wasn't good enough as I had booked this 3 months prior & didn't really expect to have my sister in law or myself to sleep in a roll away bed in a 5* hotel!  So I kindly declined this offer & said we'd share as no other option available.  He said we'd been given an upgrade to a king room, that we were originally in a queen but it was only after when I checked my booking, that it was a deluxe king I had booked in the first place.  So back to the room to unpack, after 20 mins still no bags.  I went to the bathroom then & even more disappointment, we were put in a wheelchair accessible room which meant there was no bath & no step in shower just a shower curtain around a miserable little shower head.  The one thing I had been looking forward to was a lovely bath as I'm 7 months pregnant & was stunned there was none, not even a decent shower.  By this stage I was quite upset (as in crying), so back down to reception again to find out where were our bags & why were we put into a wheelchair accessible room & what could be done.  Again was told the hotel was full that nothing could be done & I was made feel like, whats the big deal! At this point I gave up as I was getting nowhere. Eventually our bags arrived & we tried not to let it ruin our evening.  Also the Sunday paper I requested never arrived & the booklet holder that tells you your room number had me down as a MR. not a Mrs, minor I know but not what you expect from The Shelbourne.  We did share our disappointment on check out to the lady at reception, who in turn waived the charge on our 2 mini boxes of pringles from the room & said the next time I stay I will be upgraded, not sure if I believe this though & this experience has left me with no desire to return.",2,2014,09,20
207,I Can See it Now . . .,"The Shelbourne is not for the budget traveler, but, having said that, it should in some way be a part of every visitor's stay in the magical city of Dublin.  If you can afford to stay there, then that is fine; the rooms are clean and very comfortable with all the amenities.  However, short of taking a room, you must at least saunter past the jovial, top-hatted ""greeter"" at the entrance and visit the small museum in the reception area.  There you will see, on permanent display, the original signed copy of the Constitution of Ireland.  Recent renovations have done nothing to alter the charm and sense of antiquity of the hotel, and shades of deValera, Collins, and the many other great Irish patriots literally ooze from the dark wood paneling of the public rooms.",5,2014,09,17
207,Better than expected,I would recommend this hotel period. The staff was outstanding and the accommodations are first class. Just remember tobring money. The location is absolutely perfect and the concierge will be happy to assist you.,5,2014,09,17
207,Wonderful Hotel,"We were on a 10 day tour of Ireland and stayed here at the beginning and end of our trip; a great way to arrive and depart.  It is located about 30 minutes from the airport but was an easy ride in with little traffic.  It might take a little more time during rush hours.  The hotel and our rooms were beautiful!  The staff was helpful and friendly, especially Declan, the doorman.  We would definitely stay here again.  It's conveniently located to shopping, restaurants, the park and right across the street from the Hop On Hop Off bus stops.  We would recommend it to anyone who wanted a little luxury!",5,2014,09,17
207,Fabulous hotel,"The Shelbourne is a lovely hotel in a lovely part of town. Our plan was to stay in smaller B&B's while wandering the countryside and then come back to Dublin to luxury and we were not disappointed. And usually when we go to Europe, we do not stay in big american hotels, but this is very authentic. The staff was great; the bellman, Greg, gave us explicit directions to return the Budget rent a car and we hadn't even checked in yet. Highly recommended hotel.",5,2014,09,16
207,Best martini in all of Ireland!,"The elegance, grace and genuine charm of this hotel cannot be overstated! I only had tie to stay one night, but it was definitely one of the highlights of the entire journey. It is quite dear in price, but what a treat! Highly recommended!",5,2014,09,16
207,Spot On,Had a great past pupils union lunch here on Friday.  Staff were very attentive and helpful.  Would definitely recommend the hotel.  It certainly lived up to its reputation.  Looking forward to my next visit to the Shelbourne :),5,2014,09,14

207,"First stay OK, Second stay wey hey!","Ok First time we stayed we got a poky room in the back of the hotel but the second time we paid a little extra and got a green view room which was more spacious.  The hotels charm is really unsurpassed.  It is a top class hotel in a perfect location. Really worth it paying more for the breakfast as you are set up for the day. The beds in both rooms guaranteed the best nights rest too.  While we did our own thing, I didn't really have any dealings with the concierge service or the reception but everyone had a smile on their face.",4,2014,09,08
207,First class,"My wife and I stayed to celebrate a significant wedding anniversary, which was recognised with a much appreciated upgrade to a suite, a bottle of wine, and a card.  This may slightly colour my review, but in all rspects this is a superb hotel. Every member of staff bar none was genuinely friendly, couteous and helpful. Great location, very comfy beds, great gym, pool and spa, and excellent food in the Lord Mayors lounge (although still not sure about having all 3 courses served at the same time, and breakfast taken in our room. Highly recommended",5,2014,09,06
207,Beautiful and a Great Location,"This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin directly across from St. Stephen's Green. It' s location is great for exploring the city.  It is about a 10 min. walk to the Temple Bar area and close to the shopping area. It is a beautiful hotel with large rooms and well appointed bathrooms.  It is a very luxurious hotel especially by European standards.  We traveled with a large group and got very good service.  The staff very pleasant, efficient and always willing to answer questions. We had breakfast every day and it was very good.  We ate dinner one night and it was very good but you can walk to pubs not far from the hotel.",5,2014,09,06
207,Great Hotel in a great location,This hotel is located right in the middle of Dublin.  Perfect spot for exploring the city.  The room was great.  Very comfortable bed and it was very quiet (both unusual characteristics for a european hotel).  Additionally the room and bathroom was also significantly larger then just about all other european hotels i have stayed it.  Quite luxurious.  We enjoyed a lovely breakfast there every morning as well.    I would definitely stay here again.  Highly recommend for your stay in Dublin.,4,2014,09,05
207,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"A beatiful historical hotel in a great location opposite St Stephens Green, close to Grafton Street.  The offer of a glass of lemonade and a cookie at check-in sets the tone of a lovely experience.  Food was great and breakfast fully catered to all desires.  Rooms are spacious, wi-fi free and staff were very helpful.  We walked to most major attractions from the hotel and there was no shortage of local places to eat outside the hotel if desired.",5,2014,09,05
207,Absolutley the best,"This is one of the best hotels we have stay in during our holiday.

The location of the hotel is excellent to be able to stroll the parks and access the gardens.

The room was spacious and comfortable and the hotel service and staff were excellent.",5,2014,09,04
207,Vacationing in Dublin,"This hotel was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at.The rooms were large and equipped with
WIFI which was free.The bathroom was large and the facilities in the room were all that one could want including a nice sized refrigerator,safe as well as plenty of storage space.The food establishments within the hotel were excellent.All of the hotel personnel were friendly,personable and extremely helpful.The hotel was a five minute walk from Grafton Street which was excellent for shopping and had numerous restaurants and pubs in the vicinity.St. Stephen's Green Park was directly across the street from the hotel.",5,2014,09,03
207,Step back in time,"I took a step back in time , when I walked into the lobby . The history of this hotel is quite amazing , a staff member was kind enough to show us the ""constitution room "" (where the drafting , of the Irish constitution was drawn up ) . What can I say about my hotel room it was amazing & I had breakfast in "" The Lord Mayor's Lounge "" . I felt as I was in Downton Abbey for the weekend . Dinner was Also amazing . I did go for a 2hr spa treatment the spa is lovely ,  I'am a esthetician so very picky when it comes to facials . Wow this is one of the most amazing hotels , 5***** right up their with the st. Regis :)",5,2014,09,03
207,Ruined my lunch,Was there for my lunch was really looking forward seen your hotel on the TV and the food looked to die for but ordered steak sambo it came it looked lovely took a bite it was all full of fat it really upset my lunch I know I did not pay for it but that's not the point I was soooooo looking forward and the girl who served us made up as best as she could she was sooooo nice to us it was my first time to go there,3,2014,09,03
207,"Great hotel, shame about unreliable door locks","Had a very nice couple of days at The Shelbourne.  Staff very helpful and room really comfortable. The afternoon tea in Lord Mayor's Lounge superb. Ideally situated for sightseeing, business, shopping etc.  Only gripe my husband and I encountered was the unreliability of door locks - we had a lot of inconvenience when they continually didn't work.",4,2014,09,03
207,Dream Come True,"My husband always wanted to stay here, and splashed out on our last trip to the U.K. Really, no review is necessary. This is a grand, historied, plush hotel. Just stay here if at all possible. The carpet in our suite had to be at least 4-inches thick, with velvet furniture. Staff is wonderful. Will say that the lobby is very modest by comparison, and belies what waits for you in your room. A nice reversal of what you find in hotels with opulent lobbies. The flower displays were exceptional. And the location is ideal. Across from St. Stephen's Green, but with Grafton Street a short walk. So you have a bit more serenity while still being in the thick of things.",5,2014,09,03
207,The only place to stay!,"I was with my husband on a very short layover. I contacted the hotel to get directions from the airport, which was immediately responded to. Once there, check in was quick and easy. We spent the time waiting enjoying the lovely on site museum that is right off of the lobby. Rooms were lovely and well appointed. Alan with the concierge staff was incredibly helpful in providing us with a map and recommendations for where to dine. We can't wait to go back",5,2014,09,02
207,Absolutely fantastic!,"We stayed for 3 nights in August and had a lovely time! From the moment we checked in to when we checked out, it was great service! In the true Irish tradition we were treated like family! The Irish breakfast was delicious and the room was lovely! This is the place to stay if you want to be pampered! Great location! We will stay again for sure! ",5,2014,09,02
207,What a Great Experience,"We had a most wonderful time. The staff was very helpful and the bar was very lively. A great place to stay. It is within walking distance of the National Museum and Trinity College.

The hotel has old country charm and class.",5,2014,09,02
207,Superb hotel!,"This hotel is located in an excellent area,  it has big enough rooms for european standars, cozy and elegant Bar, a must if you want to be in an ideal location in Dublin. Shopping pesdestrian street is just 2 blocks away",5,2014,09,02
207,Timeless and beautiful,"I stayed at 3 or 4 hotels during my stay in Dublin using hotel points. This hotel completely surprised me and I fell in love. Not only do I dream of coming back to Dublin, but I dream of coming back to this hotel and staying. The staff is amazing, the decor and architecture is classic and timeless. 
My only regret is I didn't bring someone with me to share the amazing experience. ",5,2014,09,02
207,Shame....,"Read a couple of reviews on this hotel on Tripadvisor; couldn't agree more with the reviews rating it Terrible. I'm resident in Dublin, but I've stayed here on two or three occasions over the pat six years or so, the most recent time last Oct while attending a city centre gig.

It is a pity that service and reception staff attitude has changed very little in all these years; not all mind you, but the front desk staff have been a bit of a let down, aloof and although the adjective rude isn't accurate, on two separate stays, I found checking in unwelcoming and stand-offish.

I too found on the last occasion staying there, the voucher one gets on price-comparison sites for this hotel gets one the back rooms of the building, which are small, have on suite loos the size of a closet, an empty minibar and no turn down service. It is almost like the service doesn't extend to a forgotten part of the hotel. Of course, one gets what one pays for, but if service and standards are compromised, then my opinion a hotel of this supposed class should not entertain cheaper rates.

On the plus side, the spa and their staff are friendly and worthy of a 5-star reputation.",2,2014,09,02
207,First Class,"We had a fabulous stay here this week. The Shelbourne is classy and elegant, yet exudes a warm, welcoming atmosphere.  

We had drinks in two of the lobby bars (Horseshoe and No. 27). They each had their own ""vibe"" and we thoroughly enjoyed both. 

Our room was quiet, spacious, and very comfortable. The bathroom had obviously been recently renovated. Great shower. 

Staff members are extremely attentive and professional and helpful. Several of them helped me by email months before our arrival and they never tired of my questions. Our requests for various items were met almost  immediately.  The concierge staff consistently steered us to great pubs and restaurants and made other recommendations. They booked us a wonderful driver/guide to take us on a day trip. 

The staff in the Saddle Room greeted us with smiles each morning at breakfast. I loved all the fresh whole fruit that was part of the buffet.  You could also order off the menu and be served very quickly. Another food note: my son said the hamburger he got from Room Service was the best one he'd has in his 22 years. 

And the location--can't be beat. The Shelbourne is walking distance to Grafton Street, St Stephen's Green, Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc.  We even walked to the Guinness Storehouse. 

Not sure when we will be back in Dublin, but you can be sure we will stay here. 

",5,2014,09,01
207,Afternoon tea,"Had a super tea. The service was superb, and the sandwiches and cakes were endless. The staff were fantastic with our two year old, nothing was a problem. She had her own special sandwiches. Overall lovely experience.",5,2014,09,01
207,Must stay hotel!!!,"What a great hotel. One of the best anywhere. The staff is friendly and very accommodating! The staff also provides excellent local suggestions not on the tourist route. Go out of your way to stay here. 

Also, one of the best bars in Dublin!!!",5,2014,08,31
207,A true five star hotel!,"Everything you would expect from a five star hotel, in a great location. Best nights sleep I had in ages :)

Particularly loved the breakfast - the honey is still on the comb!! and the Shelbourne eggs Benedict was divine. Make time for a drink in the horse shoe bar.

",5,2014,08,31
207,Beautiful Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"Arrived very early in the morning, and while there were not yet any rooms available, we were able to shower in the spa ( we'd been traveling for almost 24 hours). Staff was very friendly, especially Keith, who went out of his  way to be helpful. When we finally were able to get into our room, the view was of the back of an office building, which was very disappointing. As we were very jet lagged, we didn't complain, but it was irritating for what was supposed to be a "" deluxe"" room. There was also a question of whether breakfast was included, as it was never mentioned. We later found out that breakfast was usually included. Finally, housekeeping did not leave face cloths the second day. Beautiful building with a lot of history, and a great location.",4,2014,08,30
207,Best Hotel I Have ever stayed at,"This is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed at.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.   Convenient location, exceptional quality and standards.  The bed was the most comfortable I have slept in my travels to UK and Ireland.",5,2014,08,30
207,Very good,"We stayed at the Shebourne to kick off our vacation in Ireland. I arrived two days before the family. So I was there a total of four nights. The staff is outstanding. The rooms are spacious. The lobby bars are phenonimal. It is an expensive hotel. I think it's worth the price, however, for that special vacation. We had one disappointment. By 5pm on a Sunday afternoon, they had not cleaned our room. They did not give us fresh face towels. The bed sheet had several permanent stains. When I mentioned it upon check-out the next day, they were sorry, but still charged me for everything. They could have given me a free croissant,",4,2014,08,26
207,Wonderful stay!,"We stayed here for 3 nights the end of July and loved our stay. Great location. We walked to most places or took the hop on hop off bus. The hotel is lovely inside and the staff was excellent .Had a deluxe room which was big and comfortable .No view( but didn't spend that much time in room). But it did have air conditioning which was needed because they were having another hot spell!!  We stayed in 2 hotels in Scotland and 2 more in Ireland and this was the only one to have air conditioning!
The afternoon tea was wonderful. Also like the Shelbourne dinner in the Mayor's lounge.
Had breakfast included with our room. Breakfast was buffet and had a good variety, plus you could order off the menu-pancakes,omelets and eggs benedict etc.
Would stay here again if we ever get back to Ireland!!!.",5,2014,08,26
207,Graet stay at the Shelburne Dublin,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Shelburne Hotel on our way to a Van Morrison concert outside Belfast . We stayed again on our way back. We found the level of service to be excellent and the Dubliners very warm and attentive. The hotel reminded us somewhat of the St. Regis in NYC. It faces St. Stephen's green which is an excellent location. When we arrived we stayed in a large room facing Kildare St. which was wonderful. There are larger and smaller rooms in hotels of this era all priced similarly, so ask for a larger room. On our way back to Dublin we faced the green which was even better than the first room. Generally the staff was very helpful and the location was perfect! Don't eat at the hotel, get out into the neighborhood.  For breakfast and lunch there is a small restaurant down the street called ""The Hatch"" which has wonderful organic and fresh dishes. The concierge also made us a reservation at "" Matt the Thresher"" where Michelle Obama had eaten 2 nights before.",5,2014,08,25
207,Family vacation in Ireland,Walking into the front door is a step back in time. The beautiful craftsmanship with design details are amazing. Enjoyable time spent in the lounge as be began our discovery of Dublin. The location of The Shelbourne is perfect. Across the street is the (On and Off) bus stop. Within walking distance of all the action to restaurants and bars. The rooms were exceptional and the staff very friendly and helpful.,5,2014,08,25
207,Just Perfect,"I have to be honest, despite living in Dublin for most of my adult life I had not been through the doors of the Shelbourne Hotel until I received a gift voucher for the Spa on Mothering Sunday. With a good excuse to try out the hotel, I booked rooms for myself and my sister for the night before the Spa treatments as a special treat. 
What can I say? From start to finish, the break from ordinary life's concerns was an absolute pleasure. I now realise to what others have been referring for so long. The friendliness of the staff made the brief stay very special, at no stage did we feel anything other than valued. The rooms were extremely comfortable, clean, quiet and relaxing. The staff were gracious and welcoming. It is a very nice, top quality hotel but only acknowledging that would do a disservice to the ambience and gracious welcome we experienced. 
The atmosphere seemed to rub off on the guests as the residents bar was conducive to relaxed conversation between the tables of guests having a drink before retiring to enjoy the very comfortable beds.
Breakfast was delicious and plentiful both in quality, choice and service. 
The Spa treatment was the icing on the cake and I left the whole Shelbourne experience refreshed and relaxed, everything I could have hoped for. 
I would not hesitate in finding an excuse to return to this very special place, my only problem is that it is so very, very accessible and the temptation is consequently very, very strong!",5,2014,08,23
207,prehistoric,"Don't go with gift vouchers. We did and the treatment we received was disgraceful. Qued to reception at 1330 approx for check in. You will have to wait in the lobby until we call you. Ok but 40mminutes later without any staff  interaction whatsoever. Eventually we approached  the desk  informing the clerk as to our predicament. She could not have been more rude. I quote "" are you two together"". We were eventually escorted through a maze of corridors to the most pathetic little room overlooking a car park and directly facing an office block. Whow !!! The day was unexpectedly hot, the room stifling. We couldn't hear ourselves think when we switched on the air conditioning,  so we spent the whole day & evening out then returned to suffer. Up first thing for breakfast where we were greeted cordially and seated. The breakfast came, nothing special apart from the cold plates. I happened to catch the attention of the chef to ask a simple question . Go and find one of them out there. Even at checkout we had same girl with bad attitude. We left feeling really disappointed & booked into the morrison, which was excellent.  Review will follow",1,2014,08,22
207,5star all the way,"My husband and I recent spent an overnight at the Shelbourne for his birthday. As we had stayed last year for our wedding anniversary we couldn't resist going again.. I love arriving at the Shelbourne as it feels like a home away from home....a welcome the minute you step out of the car. We like to arrive early to make the most of the time in the city.
Which is perfect as the valet parking is excellent. We provisionally checked in and reception would give us a call if our room was ready before the check In time. We left and went to the lunch time concert just down the road at the national concert hall... Then had lunch during this Corinne from reception rang to say our room was ready early. Perfect. 
A lovely surprise awaited in the form of a room upgrade to a suite!!!!!
In a word.....DIVINE. A massively spacious suite greeted us. 
Luxurious decor, huge king size bed. Pure indulgence.... 
We simply loved it. So much so we came back from dinner early that evening to enjoy it. 
The sleep we had that evening was fab, 
We ordered breakfast to the room which was gorgeous, perfectly good and tasty.. Having reluctantly checked out we left our luggage with the wonderful Denis and we to another lunch time concert and a small bit of shopping.. We picked up our car after 2pm which isn't a problem.... Every member of staff was wonderful. 
We had a lovely lovely stay. And looking forward to arriving for another stay....",5,2014,08,22
207,Unforgettable Experience!!!!!,"I will never forget my experience in the Shelbourne hotel. I had booked a room for myself and my girlfriend last September. I explained to the reservations team on the phone that I was planning to propose in the room so if there was anything they could do to help me make it more special I would really appreciate it....On the day I couldn't have been given a better service...I checked in earlier to set up the room with a few things, and upon check-in I was met by a fantastic guest relations manager who put me immediately at ease.. the hotel had arranged to upgrade my booking to the one of the presidential suites. They were also fully available for all my needs on the day...Trust me this was a great support to have at such a nerve wrecking time....
I was brought up to the room and when I opened the door was completely overwhelmed..What a setting! The room was incredible... 
When I arrived with my girlfriend later that day, the guest relations manager was waiting to open the car door and give us both a warm welcome. I had to pretend to check in a second time and found the girl behind the desk understod very quickly what was happening. She pretended to check me in as normal and adapted excellently to the situation.
My girlfriend had no idea what was happening yet I felt I had the support of every single hotel associate around me....
When we arrived in the room, the whole experience was unforgettable..5 stars doesnt it justice..As soon as she said yes, the guest relations team sent up champagne to celebrate.. Its hard to put into words as this review cannot do justice to the fantastic experience the hotel has given us.
Thanks to everyone at the shelbourne for such a fantastic and unforgettable experience...Something we will NEVER forget...We will certainly be back....!!!!!!",5,2014,08,22
207,afternoon bliss,We went for afternoon tea on our final day in Dublin all I can say is wow amazing service and a afternoon tea that not only looked awesome but tasted divine I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the ambience of this amazing place.,5,2014,08,21
207,Excelllent hotel in lovely city,"This hotel is a real renaissance hotel, with an excelllent ubication!
The concierge excelllent in advice and service.

The rooms aré confortable, good bathrooms, good housekkeping.

Excellent FOOD and bar

You should try ""the tea experience"" MARVELOUS",5,2014,08,21
207,Very nice hotel conveniently located,"Room nice quiet.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Close to many things and tours easy to catch near the hotel.  I am here on business s
Found their conference room great for small working groups and the catered lunch perfect.  Hotel could stand  updating here and there.  Found the bathroom a bit dated.
Overall very nice would stay again",4,2014,08,21
207,Very good.,I like here very much. The room is so clean and tidy. And the staff here are so friendly and courteous. The breakfast is included in the room price. Overall I had a very good time here. Obviously the location is just superb. Will be back soon.,4,2014,08,20
207,Top Drawer,"Stayed here last time  for family occasion. Always a treat and your always made feel like your as important as some of the celebs who may frequent this establishment.This Hotel is a blueprint for any establishment. ""Treat all your Guests as Royalty.""",5,2014,08,19
207,Great to be back,"We stayed here 17 years ago and it's still a pleasure. We had a lovely room and the service was excellent on the whole. Dinners in the restaurant were very good, although we missed the opulence of the old dining room. Staff are invariably pleasant. Location is very important and the hotel is situated on the lovely St Stephen's Green and a short walk from most of the places you would want to visit. Only caveat I have is that it is too obviously determined to cultivate an American approach to everything - I do not expect to have to ask for a translation when making a choice of the way I like my eggs cooked at breakfast ! Ireland should be proud of its own heritage and not be so keen to offer visitors from the US a 'home from home'.",5,2014,08,19
207,Delightful!,"My husband brought me here for the night as a birthday surprise. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was just lovely. The hotel was spotless, warm and very welcoming. The breakfast delicious and overall we had a really nice time. Obviously the location is just superb on many levels. Can't wait to go back. ",4,2014,08,19
207,Always delightful.,"Superb location right on St Stephen's Green in the centre of the city. Extremely friendly and helpful staff, beautiful bars and public areas - especially the Horseshoe! Our room was extremely luxurious and spacious. Breakfast was excellent and the selection very wide. Love this place.",5,2014,08,18
207,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here for a night in Dublin, really nice hotel.RIght in the center of everything,take a right and your beside the grafton street,Dawson street,Kildare street all the tourist sightseeing venues before your eyes.Across the road is st Stephens green beautiful park in the heart of dublin full of people just walking around,having lunch or just lying down and relaxing, really beautiful.Take a left your beside merrion st, big museum here, or just wall to baggot st,alot of nice bars here. The hotel itself was really nice the room was spacious, the view wasn't great, but it was really busy there at the time there was some horse show event on.THe staff were very polite and professional,the bar downstairs was amazing and full of all types of people, great vibe in it.The best part was breakfast the next morning, the buffet was amazing,full Irish breakfast, fresh squeezed juice, omelette made to order, different breads, fresh fruit, teas coffee, everything you could want.A wonderful experience and would recommend the shelbourne to anyone staying in dublin.",5,2014,08,18
207,Living on its reputation,"If you book through one  of the websites that offer special discount deals you are in for a shock.
Special discount equates to poor accommodation.
The room was at the very back of the hotel,tired worn look and a night time surprise of some friendly bed bugs.
At breakfast we were shown to a back room even though there were tables near the front close to the self service breakfast,I was told these tables were reserved for tourists from the USA.
Breakfast was of poor standard with the self service in a very confined space
Save your money and book elsewhere.",1,2014,08,17
207,Very Nice but Stuffy,"I stayed at this hotel on Marriott points. 

The hotel is quite beautiful and blends the new with the historical features of the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff assisted me with my bags and escorted me to the check-in area. The woman who assisted me with check-in was less than friendly and acted as if I were interrupting her. I authorized my credit card for room charges and received confirmation. I was given my room key and two complimentary beverage coupons, and then attempted to go to my room.

When I opened my room door, the room was in disarray; it was quite clear that this room was undergoing renovations. The furniture was pushed into the center of the room, the lighting was disassembled and paint buckets were everywhere.

On my way to the hotel lobby, a hotel staff person found me and apologized for the mistake and took me to my new room. After seeing the earlier room, it was quite clear that I had been upgraded (I'm not sure if it was because of my Marriott Elite Rewards status or because of the mistake; either way, I was appreciative).

The hotel room was beautiful and comfortable; my only complaint was that the mini-fridge was not usable for anything other than the pre-stocked items.

There is no executive lounge at this hotel for Marriott Elite Rewards guests so I went to the bar to use my free beverage coupons; when I tried to pay the tab, I was informed that there was no credit card on file and I was not authorized to charge to my room. This was quite embarrassing and frustrating since I had authorized my card earlier in the trip. I had to leave my traveling partner at the bar while I went to the reception desk to present my credit card for the second time.

As a Marriott Elite Rewards guest, breakfast was included with my room. Breakfast was very nice and offered a variety of options. To note - this is not a casual breakfast environment. I felt out of place without a collared shirt. In general, I did not feel comfortable lounging in the hotel lobby or bars in casual clothing.

I made use of the fitness center and it was impressive. There were actually three rooms, each offering different types of equipment. Of all the people I encountered at the hotel, the fitness center staff was the friendliest and most helpful.

Overall, I don't know that I would stay here again. I think I would have preferred to stay in a less ""luxurious"" hotel where I would have felt more comfortable.",3,2014,08,15
207,Classy and classic,"We love this hotel, having stayed there several times during visits to Dublin. The hotel is classy, with a calming feeling as the doors are opened by the doormen. Reception staff are efficient, but it's the rooms that we have used that are the impressive element of the hotel - spacious with quality furnishings and great pillows. The proximity of the hotel allows for a relaxed wander through St Stephen's Green, a shopping expedition in the close by shops or a pint if Guinness in a local bar. Can't wait till we are in Dublin again",5,2014,08,14
207,Stellar Shelbourne,"Well, the fact that we have been coming here regularly since 1995 speaks volumes. There have been some changes over the years but it still remains a wonderful place to retreat to.
The Horseshoe Bar oozes charm and old time authenticity, staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfasts are everything you would hope for, although some tables can be small and lacking in personal space. Rooms have everything you would want, because of Shelbourne's five star rating I would hope for a few more ""special"" touches - better quality coffee, some nibbles on arrival and maybe newer robes. All that said, I will be back for another short stay in a few weeks! Definitely my favourite Dublin hotel!",5,2014,08,13
207,Stunning!,"From the moment I entered the hotel I was extremely happy with the level of service and I felt compelled to write this email.
I was greeted by a very polite and kind young man ( by the name of John, a trainee I believe) who checked me in very quickly and could not do enough for me. My partner and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary and he congratualted me whilst I was checking in.

When I arrived at the room, it was Impeccably clean & beautuiful. The bathroom was stunning and the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!
Every single member of staff could not do more for us, we were even sent a bottle of wine and some macaroons as a gift from the hotel to mark the occasion. 
In one particular instance, my partner had forgotten his hair gel, we asked at the front desk if they had any, unfortunately they did not, 10 minutes later a young man ( I did not get his name) knocked on our door with hair gel from his own locker in work and offered it to my partner.
The breakfast was to die for and the staff again were perfect. 

The hotel itself is very beautiful and will always be an historic land mark in Dublins city centre, but the staff at the hotel made my experience 5 star all round.",5,2014,08,12
207,"Amazing Hotel, Snobby Staff","This hotel blew me away the decor is fantastic, the food is spectacular but dear god the staff a stuck up and snotty. When I walked in one of them looked me up and down, she was very rude and did not seem to think I was good enough to be in the hotel and also failed to realise she does not actually own the hotel she only works there because of this I would not return to the shelbourne no hotel in the world is good enough to be treated like that.",3,2014,08,11
207,"At your service in Dublin, Ireland","I have stayed many times at the Shelbourne in Dublin due to business.  I thoroughly enjoy it and its location and when I went to Dublin on vacation, I definitely wanted to stay there.  The staff is friendly and the concierges were helpful booking every tour and reservation that I needed.  I would especially like to thank Keith who had to change one of my reservations several times and was most gracious about it.  I highly recommend the high tea at the Shelbourne.  It's outstanding. The airport Air Coach conveniently drops off and picks up near the hotel.",5,2014,08,11
207,Beautiful Hotel ,"We stayed for the weekend 8th & 9th August. The hotel entrance is magnificent and the staff very welcoming. In fact I cannot praise the staff highly enough every single member accommodated requests with a smile and enthusiasm. 
We stayed in a newly refurbished queen room although small it was beautifully done and had everything you would require for a weekend away. A minor issue however was a constant hum from the air conditioner which went on all night even on turning it off. 
Breakfast was busy but this did not stop the staff being efficient with all requests. The choice was extensive and the food quality good. 
The leisure facilities were top notch and of good quality even though it is a complicated root through the hotel to find them. 
All in all I would defiantly recommend The Shelbourne Hotel.
 ",5,2014,08,11
207,Fantastic stay in the land of the Irish at the Shelbourne,A first trip to Ireland was amazing due to the Shelbourne Renaissance!  This classic hotel is in a perfect location for city exploring and is very close to many shops and pubs.  The hotel itself is similar to the Willard in Washington DC in terms of classic elegance and attentive staff.  The room was beautiful with a mix of past and present.  We ate breakfast in the restaurant each day and the buffet was exquisite.  Housekeeping visited the room twice a day and kept things quite tidy.  Yasmin and Sophie at the front desk were especially helpful and made our stay so pleasurable--greeting us upon arrival and checking on us during our stay. The concierge was very helpful and assisted our driver in locating the best route for a drive.  We will be back to visit Ireland and will make the Shelbourne our hotel of choice.,5,2014,08,11
207,Beautiful old hotel in the perfect Dublin location!,"What a beautiful hotel, located perfectly for sightseeing while visiting Dublin.  We spent our last 3 nights in Ireland here using Marriott points - it is definitely a first class property.  Right across the street is St. Stephen's Green which is similar to Central Park in NYC.  It's actually larger and is a beautiful spot for walking anytime of the day.  There's also a Hop On/Hop Off sightseeing bus stop right down the street and the area is loaded with pubs, restaurants and shopping.  The included breakfast was wonderful and included a buffet as well as a menu to order from.  We found all of the staff to be very friendly and efficient and enjoyed our stay.  Leaving the hotel one morning we greeted Omar Sharif coming in - very nice!  We had read about him in that mornings paper and it said he was in town for some type of awards ceremony.  Yes, we were star struck.  We highly recommend the Shelbourne Dublin for a wonderful upscale stay!",5,2014,08,10
207,Very  over rated,"This hotel has a very big repitation and is a 5 star hotel in my experance staying there for one night  it dose not warrant a 5 star rateing.
the room was comfortable it was the best part very good bed as you would expect the breckfast i was looking foward to and i was very disapointed all food out and pre cooked  and dried out like eating leather i had to ask twice for tea no toast staff not helpfull you had to do try to get there attenion for every thing and they did not come to ask if all was ok in my experance you will expect a much better service from a hotel with 5 stars and for the price of this hotel.
Lesure center is also very poor and not well maintained.",3,2014,08,10
207,Excellent food!,"My wife and I were in the saddle rooms for dinner on 9 August. Overall, the quality of the food was really excellent. For starters my wife had the rabbit and I had the seafood chowder. The rabbit was excellent and the seafood was only good. The quality of the fish was excellent, but the sauce for me was a little on watery side, or thin... Maybe it was more like a fish stew... I personally prefer it a bit thicker. In addition, it was quite salty. But despite all that, it was still a very good dish. 

For main course, my wife had the lamb and black pudding Wellington and I had the surf and turf of lobster and fillet steak. My wife had asked for the lamb Wellington to be medium well and specifically asked for it to be not "" running""... The waiter agreed and understood, but when it arrived it was really quite rare and very bloody. The Waiter immediately took it back without hesitation and it arrived back, perfect, 5 minutes later. The quality of The lamb Wellington was truly excellent. A wonderful mix of flavours on the plate. The surf and turf was also very very good and the steak was cooked perfect for medium well. 

For deserts we had the chocolate fondant and cheese plate. The fondant was superb and a struggle to finish. The cheeses themselves and accompanying chutney were excellent...  The only quibble here was the waiter never described what each of the four cheeses was or where it came from. Also the cheddar seemed quite dry and maybe had gotten too much air at some point in storage. Plenty of crackers and cheese though, which was great.

One last item was that the staff had asked and seemed interested if this was a special occasion. It was my wife's 45th birthday... But despite them knowing this, there was no specific ""happy birthday"" call out of any description.

2 x starters, mains, desserts, 1 x tea and coffee and 1 x wine came to 200 euro and I felt this was reasonably good value based on the service, quality of the food and friendliness of waiter and other staff.",4,2014,08,09
207,Wonderful with an asterisk,"Overall a wonderful hotel.  Rich in history and elegance.  The buffet breakfast was amazing.  If you have ancestors from Ireland, an appointment with Helen Kelly the genealogy butler is a must.

One caveat.  DON'T LET THIS STOP YOU FROM VISITING THE HOTEL, just AVOID the rooms with ""accessible bathrooms"".  We had read other not so favorable reviews on thi issue and I thought ""how bad can it be?""  Turns out the reviews were right.  The bathrooms only have showers and they don't drain properly so you're always worried about flooding the room.  So you end up with short showers and a clean up job when you're done.  We asked for engineering to come up to fix the problem and I don't think they did anything.  I almost get the feeling that the hotel knows it has an unfixable problem, so they tell you that engineering will look into it.",4,2014,08,09
207,small rooms / small beds / too busy,"We were given a room for a family of 4 with 2 tiny beds in. After making a complaint I received 5 different version of a story about why this was the case. It turns out it was not the hotels fault at all but the refurb contractors who had installed the wring sized beds. Well that's OK then? We were eventually moved to another room and had the priced reduced. The hotel was nice but as there was a wedding on it was very busy. The bar seems to be also a Dublin hangout. breakfast was OK but normal 5 star quality. the staff were a bit stressed. This is a Marriott hotel which I think is trading on the famous people who have stayed here, rather than concentrating on the people who are staying in the hotel.",3,2014,08,08
207,"Fantastic Hotel, with great location in Dublin","I visited Dublin in March, and stayed at the Shelbourne for two nights using Marriott points. It certainly is a premier Dublin hotel. The front desk staff when we checked in was amazing. Very friendly to us ""foreigners"". After a long trip across the pond, the Beds were fantastic. We ate breakfast in the morning, and it was AMAZING (included in our Marriott Gold Status). Very clean and well equipped hotel. 

I only had one major disappointment experienced during our stay-- the late night staff. The first night we returned late evening and went to the restaurant/bar. We were told they were closing, but the other bar would be open late. So we went to the other bar, sat down, and a rude bartender stated we are closed, you cant stay here. It was ignorant how he responded. Finally we were told we could go to the ""lounge"" for a night cap. Additionally, on the second night returning after hours, the front desk staff seemed to believe we did not belong in the hotel. We were asked for our room keys, which we quickly produced, and his attitude quickly changed. I appreciate the late night security, but the tone of the guard could have been better.

Would return though, despite the above negativity.",5,2014,08,07
207,Just Beautiful,"I dont think I have ever stayed in a room as nice as the one I had in The Shelbourne. They were the fluffiest pillows, the nicest en suite with really gorgeous products. The room was a little small but this made it feel even more cozy when I got into that amazing bed. The rooms are absolutely worth their value. The bar and food were very nice and its feels intimate yet it is right in the heart of Dublin city. This is a special occasion hotel or for those who can, its the absolute right choice. Concierge parking, bags taken, you hardly lift a finger once you arrive. Enjoy!",5,2014,08,06
207,Excellent Business Trip,"Stayed here for 3 nights at the start of July for business meetings. The hotel is beautiful & the staff are very friendly & obliging. The bedrooms are quite large & spotlessly clean. The beds are comfortable & the bathrooms adequate. 

We ate breakfast at the hotel & I also ate room service for evening meals on 2 of the nights. The food is excellent & well presented. 

I would recommend this hotel for a couples holiday as I am sure I would of appreciated it more if staying with my wife rather than for business.",4,2014,08,06
207,Relax and Unwind,Desperately needed a stress buster break.. Decided on The Shelbourne Dublin.. WOW great choice... From the valet parking to the breakfast the following morning..Staff all very friendly and welcoming got a free upgrade to a junior suite..heavenly.. super comfortable bed no outside noise could be heard in our room hard to believe we in were in the centre of the city on a busy bank holiday Sunday night...Had drinks in No.27 bar excellent service excellent choice great atmosphere.. Had the taster menu in the Saddle Room restaurant excellent service excellent food great variety to choose from...Would definitely return to The Shelbourne and highly recommend it though it is pricey but not as pricey as some five star hotels but definitely well worth it..,5,2014,08,06
207,Grand old lady,An excellent hotel where I have been coming for 6 months friendly staff great location and great service.  Always welcoming with great food a pleasure in empire style.  Top marks to the breakfast crew who always greet you with an amazing smile and make the mornings enjoyable ,5,2014,08,05
207,Amazing birthday weekend! ,"Have just returned from another wonderful weekend at The Shelbourne. 
It was my birthday and the staff made it absolutely magical helping my partner with flowers, cake and wine in my room.... Not to mention a gorgeous little Shelbourne teddy bear! 
A special thanks to Jane for taking such good care of us. This isn't confined to this weekend, she always does! Fantastic front of house! 
Also thanks to the fabulous lady in guest relations from Lisbon. Unfortunately her name has escaped me but she did an amazing job of keeping everything a surprise for me!
Can't wait to return ASAP! ",5,2014,08,05
207,bit of a mixed bag,"We stayed here in March and we weren't bowled over by this hotel.   The room was somewhat disappointing for the amount being charged - it was more like 3-star standard with respect to décor - however, it was clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was ok, I can't be any more enthusiastic than that.  We were shunted upstairs as the breakfast room was full and the food was in heated trays, it just wasn't very appetising.  The staff are more than a little bit snooty and the bar heaves with pretentious 'locals'.  
That said, the location is fantastic and the concierge was very helpful in booking & recommending restaurants, of which there are an abundance within walking distance.
It was fine but The Merrion is streets ahead.",3,2014,08,05
207,Dinner to delight at The Shelbourne,"The Shelbourne is the “Grande Dame” of the hospitality scene in Dublin as it approaches 190 years of continuous service. It has hosted Princesses and Presidents, Captains of Industry and Sport, Rappers and Rock’nRollers. It underwent a recent radical refurbishment and now presents as a luxury property in the style of a European Grand Hotel with clever local touches and a pervasive sense of Irishness.

Nowhere is this more evident than The Constitution Room, a glorious space to the front of the building, overlooking St Stephen’s Green where between February and May 1922 Michael Collins and others of the nascent Irish Free State painstakingly drafted the parameters of what it would mean to be a citizen of Ireland. Yvonne Donohoe, Director of Sales and Marketing at the hotel, arranged for Denis, learned historian and Head Concierge at the Hotel, to walk us back through 190 years of the hotel’s history. It was indeed a privilege to sit on the very seats used by our drafting forefathers and to listed to an entirely compelling account of the vicissitudes of our history, peppered with some amusing aphorisms. When relating a story connected with Princess Grace who was given the option of avoiding the adoring crowds by exiting discretely out the back door Denis intoned ""Every good hotel has a front door. Every great hotel has a back door"". 

Dinner, served under the watchful eye of Francois, was spectacular, drawing on locally sourced produce but presenting it with true artistic panache and brio. My picture of the painterly Clare Island Turf Smoked Salmon with Castletownbere Crab and Tempura Prawn was retweeted many times. Throughout dinner conversation flowed easily as we listened to gentle sounds of slow Irish airs and poignant operatic arias played gracefuly on concert harp. It was a moment to treasure, a moment from which great memories are forged and, ultimately, a moment that’s often the tipping point for planners as the weight up the pros and cons of the destinations under selection.

207,Afternoon tea,"I treated my mother to afternoon tea. The whole experience was great! Sandwiches are delicious, so are the scones and bread! The only downside for me was the desserts. I don't like mousse and it was in them all. I asked if there was anything else but they only have a set menu. I didn't let this spoil it as it was such a lovely way to spend an afternoon!",4,2014,08,05
207,Ideal location,"I have stayed at the this :grande dame"" twice while visiting in Dublin. It is a beautiful property, perfectly located right across St. Stephen's Green (Dublin's ""Central Park"") and very close to major attractions such as Temple Bar, Trinity College, and Grafton Street. The hotel itself offers wonderful accommodations and lots of history.",5,2014,08,04
207,Grand Hotel in perfect location,"My family (2 adults. 2 boys under 12 and one grandmother) stayed at this grand hotel right across from St Stephen's Green. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The rooms were spacious and lovely.  The location was perfectly close to everything. The hop on-hop off bus stops directly across the street. The beds are VERY soft and might be troublesome for anyone with a sensitive back. I would stay here again",5,2014,08,04
207,Iconic Dublin Hotel with excellent spa facilities,"The 'Old Lady of the Green' aka the Shelbourne is one of Ireland's leading hotels. It is situated right in the heart of the city on St. Stephen's Green. It has all the facilities of a modern 5 star hotel and with perhaps an element of pretentiousness from staff and customers alike - but then it is an iconic place. 

I've stayed both in a standard and superior room and they are both very comfortable. Wifi is free and the breakfast is excellent - however if seated in the bar for breakfast make sure to checkout the main breakfast area for more options which were not available in the bar area. 

Pre-theatre meals in the Saddle Room are reasonable value and very tasty. The spa and pool are superb and excellent for a city hotel. All in all a real treat and something for everyone's bucket list.",5,2014,08,03
207,Perfect!,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for (regrettably) only one day and one night, but the experience was amazing. The staff are wonderful (emailed them a few weeks before to help arrange a small surprise for boyfriend's birthday and they were very helpful!), the rooms tasteful, historic, super clean and yet lack no modern amenity. The beds are heavenly! 

We had dinner at No. 27 (lobby bar/ restaurant), which was impeccable and the breakfast at The Saddle, where there was variety of English Breakfast (Buffet) and special order (poached eggs, etc.). The only thing confusing was that it was not indicated that the special orders were included in the breakfast but the Smoothie menu is not (we had to ask). 

When staying at the hotel, do go for a wander around and explore the hotel's history, and enjoy its wonderful old rooms. Overall five stars as it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in in Europe so far in this star and age category.",5,2014,08,03
207,Dublin stay in a perfect location,I love this hotel! I have stayed here 6 of my 8 trips to Dublin and each time I am impressed with the grace of the staff. Dennis (concierge staff) is a true gem! Rooms are comfortable with plush bedding. Bathrooms are quite small with zero counter space. Centrally located to many sightseeing places and a short walk to the train station to travel by train throughout Ireland. Highly recommended,5,2014,08,03
207,"Great Hotel, Terrible View","The Shelbourne service was fantastic, truly a first class service.  It's a little confusing to find your room as the hotel is a collection of buildings.  The view from the hotel is terrible, we ""overlooked"" the other side of the hotel which was 25 yards away and full of pigeons, not ideal.  Breakfast was outstanding.",4,2014,08,02
207,What a gem!,"We are Marriott platinum members and booked this hotel using our points. What a great end to our stay in Ireland! The location is so convenient for exploring the city. The hop-on hop-off buses stop just across the street, and shopping and restaurants are a short walk. The hotel itself is beautiful with an interesting history. One of our B&B hostesses earlier in the week suggested we watch the documentary series currently airing about the hotel. It is quite interesting. While we were watching the segment about VIP guests, I commented to my husband that I didn't think we would receive such treatment. We soon received a knock on the door for turn-down service and yummy chocolates! Breakfast in the Saddle Room was very good, and we enjoyed our dinner in Lord Mayor's. My only complaint was our lack of view. We were on the second floor overlooking an alley.",5,2014,08,02
207,"Very grand hotel, centrally located.","We stayed at the Shelbourne on the last 2 days of our family vacation to Ireland and Scotland.  Colleagues of my husband made arrangements for 2 rooms for our family of 4.  The rooms were huge, quiet, well appointed with deliciously comfortable beds.  Baths were spectacular, as you would expect from a hotel of this caliber.  The staff was courteous and helpful with turn-down service each night.  (We had swans and rose-petals, I assume at the behest of the colleagues LOL!)  The location was perfect, walking distance to shops & restaurants (Grafton & Temple Bar) and the hop-on/hop-off bus just a block away.",5,2014,08,02
207,Top notch,"Stayed here a few nights with the family.  Overall very pleased with the service from all levels of the staff.  Hotel has the old world charm but honestly beginning to show signs.  Rain leaking through the ceiling, window frame not tight and air on units stressed to keep rooms cool when rain prohibited opening the windows.  Breakfast buffet was excellent and the 27 bar is a happening place with excellent staff!  Proximity to everything makes this a top place to stay",4,2014,08,02
207,"Outstanding service, excellent accomodation and nice SPA","My spouse and I finished our trip in Ireland staying a couple of days in Dublin so as to discover the city. 
If the inner town has kept a provincial athmosphere, this hotel gave us the opportunity to relax after long promenades and museum. 
As an Elite Silver Member, I am accustomed to stay in the Marriott hotels when possible. The international standards in terms of service and amenities will never disappoint you.
This hotel bring out a very relaxing and cosy atmosphere and the rooms on the yard are very quiet.
We loved our sojourn in this place and are very looking forward to coming back! 
",5,2014,08,02
207,An Unexpected Delight,"When booking a room at the Shelbourne in the center of Dublin, I was expecting convenience - but after a couple days settling in, I realized I had picked a hotel that gets everything right! The staff was unbelievably courteous and helpful, the room extremely comfortable and well apportioned (with a fresh rose in the bathroom!), the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner wonderful. We started our two and a half week trip here and it was bittersweet to have to leave. As others have said - this hotel has a perfect location for picking up a bus tour, visiting St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College or the shopping district. A couple special notes: the room on the fourth floor was exceptionally quiet, despite over-looking the Green, the windows did open for fresh air when we wanted it, and the concierge was exceptional with advice on places to visit, things to do - when we asked where we could buy stamps to send postcards - the concierge took the postcards and said he would get the stamps and post them for us. Very considerate! Next trip to Dublin, we'll be back at the Shelbourne for certain!",5,2014,08,02
207,Not so great - The Merrion is so much better,"We stayed at The Merrion the previous year but decided to try the Shelbourne for a change.

At check-in a manager told us they were overbooked and we would have to stay at the Merrion for one night. These things happen. We had a great night at the Merrion and loved it.

At the Shelbourne we had a refurbished room but the hotels shortcoming were immediately clear:
1. Terrible old bed - the bed was so soft and spongy it was like sleeping on a boat in a big swell. I had a horrible sleep for two nights. Why didn't the hotel replace the beds?
2. Linens - the pillows were soft and poor while the sheets were ok they weren't great either
3. Noise - lots of banging doors and creaky floorboards. You get these things in older hotels but it would have been easy to have added a door self-closing mechanism during the refurbishment.
4. The toiletries are Elemis which feel cheap

The ok things:
1. Breakfast was ok, the choices were reasonable but the restaurant is cramped and busy so it is hard to get service.
 
The good things include:
1. Location is great - right on St Stephens Green
2. Free wifi thought-out the hotel
3. The gym and pool are great

In conclusion, Tthe Shelbourne feels like a corporate hotel which goes through the motions of a hotel to maximize profit for the bean counters. In contrast, the Merrion Hotel feels like you are a guest in a grand home, the staff are so courteous, the beds and linens are of the highest quality and the toiletries are first rate.

I would choose The Merrion Hotel every time over the Shelbourne.",3,2014,08,02
207,Great Hotel and Perfect Location,"This is a very nice, upscale hotel very close to one of the big walking districts and across the street from St. Stephen's Green. Rooms are comfortable and as quiet as you can get within the city. The hop-on/hop-off bus stops directly across the street and is the best way to see what tourists want to see (Book of Kells, Guinness, Jameson, O'Connell Street, Kilmainham).",5,2014,08,01
207,Very grand and luxurious,"Stayed here for a couple of evenings and was totally wowed! Service was top class, nothing being too much trouble. Perfect location near Grafton street and plenty bars and restaurants. Breakfast was fabulous and everything we ate was beautifully cooked. Would love to come back one day.",5,2014,07,31
207,One of the Worlds Best,"It is the perfect location in the perfect city.  This historic hotel features a location close to everything, you can walk anywhere but also take advantage of the modern LUAS ( light rail), taxis, buses or horse drawn carriages nearby.  Many world class restaurants and pubs are steps away from the front door.  The Horseshoe Bar in the hotel is legendary in its own right.  Around the corner you will find the National Library, National Museums and The Dail (Irish Government). Make sure you drop by the Celtic Whiskey Shop on Dawson street for a tasting with the expert staff.  The rooms are wonderful and unique.  The service and hospitality are par excellance.  You won't want to leave.",5,2014,07,31
207,Outstanding hotel,"Excellent service with very helpful and attentive staff throughout the hotel. The rooms are comfortable and well maintained and very clean. Bars and restaurnat are first class, I highly recommend ordering from the oyster bar, the the cocktail menu is more than adequate.",5,2014,07,31
207,"The Shelbourne, a Beautiful, Historic, and Charming Hotel","The Shelbourne facing St. Stephen's Green is a Beautiful, Historic, and Charming Hotel, managed by Marriott.  Grafton Street, the shopping district, is three blocks away,   Parliament Trinity College, and several museums are around the corner. A walk through St. Stephen's Green is encouraged before you enter The Shelbourne Hotel.

As you enter the lobby of The Shelbourne, the first scent after the  revolving door is the peat burning in the lobby fire place.  Your first decision offers many options: riding the old classic elevator to your floor and suite.   I always suggest stopping at the Shelbourne Room, a large cosmopolitan room with a long L shaped bar for a Guinness, champagne, and lunch as you view St. Stephen's Green or the Irish walking quickly pass the large Shelbourne windows.  A smaller G bar is also available for more private or intimate conversations.  However, the Mayor's Lounge is used for afternoon Tea with piano music, or after-dinner beverages in relaxing couches and chairs.  The Saddle Room Restaurant offers excellent cuisine if you decide to eat in the hotel.

Your memories of the The Shelbourne will remain with you for a lifetime.",5,2014,07,30
207,Very Nice Hotel,"One of the best Hotels in Dublin. Perfect stay, near everything and walking distance to shopping centers, restaurants, pubs, and landmark. Public transportation are near. Staff are amazing and very helpful",4,2014,07,30
207,What a treat!!!!,"Stayed here for the first time last weekend only having been for drinks / afternoon tea before. Really was excellent - service super, room top class and superb breakfast. The bar was buzzing and a great olace to have drinks before dinner- my husband loved the number 27 house cocktail! Real treat in itself and worth every euro ...  ",4,2014,07,30
207,Grand hotel,The Shelbourne is a historic grand hotel across from St Stephens Green.  Staff are very courteous and helpful.  Main bar is fabulous and great for people watching.  Hotel rooms are very nice. There is a small museum which you can learn about the historic place this hotel has in Irish history.  There is also a spa in the hotel although we did not use it this trip.,5,2014,07,29
207,Completely fabulous!,"I have just returned from a wonderful weekend stay at the Shelbourne hotel for my Partner's 30th birthday.  We were so incredibly well looked after, with the staff going out of their way to make our stay as perfect and memorable as possible.  We had a fabulous heritage room, overlooking St Stephen's Green.  Incredibly comfortable bed, huge luxurious bathroom and incredible view.  We ate in the The Saddle Room for both breakfast and dinner and on all occasions it was exceptional quality.  I also treated myself to a swedish massage at the spa which was very relaxing and followed by a refreshment platter in the relaxation room - heaven!  I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.  A special thank you to Dana De Moel for her help in making this a great experience.",5,2014,07,29
207,Relaxed elegance,Just home from a fabulous overnight stay. We were kindly upgraded as it was my friends' birthday. The room was recently refurbished and it was beautiful. The hotel is outstanding in everyway and it was everything that I hoped it would be!,5,2014,07,28
207,Fantastic customer service,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights from 25-27 July this year.
We booked through a third party website where it stated that the deluxe king rooms had separate bath and shower facilities, however when we arrived and were shown to our room the bathroom only had a bath with a shower over it..... Minor issue you might think but not what we thought we were getting.
I immediately informed reception of this and due to the hotel being fully booked on the Friday night we were unable to be moved however on the Saturday while we spent our day in Dublin when we returned to the hotel, all our belongings had been moved to the most beautiful Heritage room where we enjoyed the second night of our stay. 
In fact all the staff in the hotel were fabulous, from our waiter in the Saddle Room on the Friday night to the waitress who got me strawberries on Sunday morning for breakfast, thank you all for a wonderful stay.
Can't wait to come back!",5,2014,07,28
207,The Best Hotel in Europe,"Just arrived back to the UK from a weekend stay at the Shelbourne Hotel.  What can I say......OMG! I love this hotel, it is the best hotel I have stayed in, in Europe. (Burj Al Arab is the best in the world).  We stayed in room 252, we have a lovely view on to Kildare Street.  The room was gorgeous, with a well stocked mini bar, as for the bed..........it was like heaven, you just sink & sink into the most comfort bed ever.  The bathroom was huge, with lovely toilettes, slippers and robes.  The Staff were all lovely and made us feel very welcome both the restaurant and the bar (the food and cocktails are to die for).  :)

The hotel is in a brilliant location, just across the road is St Stephen's Green and it is a short Distance walk from Dawson Street and Grafton Street.

Thank you for a fantastic stay :)",5,2014,07,28

EXCELLENT 5 O'clock tea.
Good breakfast, good coffee.",4,2014,07,27
207,"stay from July 19th to July 21, 2014","We checked into the Shelbourne on July 19th for a 3 night stay.  My husband had been looking forward to this trip for along time because when he was a student at Trinity College Dublin in the early sixtys he always wished he could stay there.  I stayed at the shelboure with by parents when I was  a little girl.

We were given room 380.  No one mentioned to us, that a majpr construction project was to start the next day.  The next morning (Sunday) when we cane back from breakfast we had difficulty accessing our room because of furniture being moved out of rooms and into the corridor.  Noone offered to help us.  We decided to go for a swim, but we could not reach the pool bcause the elevator was not working.  There did not seem to be any way to access the pool other than the elevator.  The construction noise continued until 10:30 p,m.

The next day July 21, we went out for breakfast.  When we came back, and exited the elevator on the third floor there was a piece of furniture blockinf the entrance to our area of the floor.  No one mentioned that we that we should have take the freight elevator to our room.

Finally, at 23 p.m. on the 21st, Marta Oltumzyk  offered us another room.  We declined saying we were leaving at 7 a.m. the next day.  She paid for afternnon tea and we received a credit for 68 euros at checkour.

Other items of note.  We were told onlu one robe per room, although there were two pairs of slippers in the room  We finally got another.  We received turndown service on only two nights.
One night there was only one sheet on the bed.",2,2014,07,27
207,Great Lobby. Tired Room,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. Service and facilities were excellent. Great restaurants and bar.

The room however, is in serious need of an upgrade. I had a very old bathroom, with cracks in the tile and a noisy exhaust fan that wasn't working particularly well.",4,2014,07,25
207,A classic hotel,"I recently had a several night stay at the Shelbourne and there are many good things to say about the place.  Location was very nice across from St. Stephen's Green, staff was very friendly and helpful, the breakfast buffet was very good, great atmosphere in the bar.  I found the rooms to be a good size and the bed to be very comfortable.  My one reservation is that the rooms felt a bit worn and tired.  Probably time to some updates and refreshing.",4,2014,07,24
207,"A beautiful hotel, central to everything","As a base from which to explore Diublin, this hotel is a welcoming and simply beautiful. The red bus leaves from opposite the door and it's a walk through the parks and gardens, and to nearby pubs.
The Shelbourne is top quality. Its restaurant is first-class and service is impeccable. We strongly recommend it.",5,2014,07,24
207,5 star hotel,"This classy hotel is perfectly located in central Dublin close to shopping, restaurants and pubs.Nice bar atmosphere in smaller Saddlery but Larger Bar at entrance has a nice menu for a fast bite.

207,Great hotel in Dublin,We loved this hotel. I was able to use my Marriott points towards free nights in Ireland. Excellent and elegant room with plenty of space. Perfect amenities and excellent breakfast option. Great location near Grafton st and of course so close to crawl back from O'Donahue's great authentic Irish pub. This is a winner hotel!!!,5,2014,07,23
207,Excellent stay! Excellent Location!,"Spent 2. Wonderful nights at this lovely historic hotel. Because this is a Marriott property, I was able to use my Marriott points for the King bed room for my husband and me. Our 3 sons (ages 15  - 22) were across the hall in a room with 2 double beds. The rooms were beautiful! The beds were so comfortable. Everything was clean. We had a great experience from assistance with luggage and taxis by the bell hops to the fresh lemonade and cookies upon arrival. We did eat breakfast at a small cafe just past the hotel in order to keep costs down. However, if I'm ever in Dublin again (and I hope I am), I won't hesitate to book a room at this lovely gem!",5,2014,07,23
207,Rated somewhere between Average & Very Good,The Shelborne is a nice hotel in an alright location. It has a rich history and is very beautiful. Their breakfast buffet was the best we had while in Ireland. Now for the negative; Space was limited in the room we had and it seemed a little run down. More shelving in the shower/bathroom would be a welcome addition.,3,2014,07,23
207,You might not get what you expect.,"I am a regular hotel user, sometimes 4* sometimes 5*, sometimes just whatever is convenient. So how do I see the Shelbourne? Beds fine, food fine, staff mostly great, location good. That's it. Is a marble lobby enough for a 5*? Not for me. Used to be a great hotel and they feed off this reputation, sadly it has gone downhill. Would I stay there again? No. There are some superb hotels in Dublin. This isn't one of them.",2,2014,07,23
207,Expectations 2 High?,"We have stayed in some well run hotels in the past and maybe our expectations were just to high....Upon arriving to the hotel a couple of hours before checkin we understand the possibility that our rooms may not be ready, but it is not 5 star service just to regergitate that ""check in is at 3pm"". At least check.... Beside the robotic and unfriendly welcome, the bellman was great, very patient as we sorted out storing luggage and trying to freshen up in a washroom near the lobby. Housekeeping was well below expectations as rooms were never feeling clean and had hair from the past guest in both rooms. The rooms are in need of a refresh and a little maintanence in the mean time is in order as drains didnt work properly and both rooms had bulbs fused. No attention to detail. There was always staff on the door who payed more attention to their own conversations than the guests coming and going. The one real possitive was breakfast. Food choice and quality was very good and service was attentive yet not abtrusive. Check out was smooth and the gentlemen (early AM) was much more friendly and helpful.",3,2014,07,22
207,Poorest 5 star yet,"Having stayed in several 5 star hotels and never written a review I found myself compelled to after our time in the Shelbourne.

Room was very small overlooking skips and compactors.
In the mini fridge was two lumps of beef in tin foil rolled up the beef had hair growing on it so it had been there for some time
If you take the cost of parking into consideration we'd have stayed in a 5 star down the road from this hotel for €60 a night cheaper so I expected excellence we got average.

",2,2014,07,21
207,Nice City Center Hotel - Expensive,"Nice hotel in the center of Dublin, if you have the means this is a very nice hotel.  I had a bed and breakfast rate and the breakfast a good Irish breakfast, however just down the street their are plenty of places for a wonderful breakfast.  

The staff is wonderful, upon check in the lemonade and cookies are a nice touch.  The beds are very comfortable and the cleaning staff is wonderfully quick and almost invisible.  Atmosphere is pleasant but not exactly casual.",4,2014,07,20
207,Overnight stay,"Most disappointed with the pool. Tiny and had kids throwing footballs around in it. Had far too much chlorine, I could barely see after using it grot 10 minutes. The room numbers lead you around in circles but not to your room. The coffee machine in the room has no instructions and is difficult to use. Car parking is 25euro extra. Costs less to park in a car park nearby overnight. Rooms are tatty for a 5 star hotel also. Honestly one of the worst 5 star hotels I've ever experienced. ",1,2014,07,19
207,Always Fantastic experience but unbelievable prices,"Always a fantastic ambiance with plenty of welcoming staff. Enjoyed a very pleasant post dinner night cap in the Horseshoe bar last night but we were totally shocked when we looked at the prices. Appreciate the Shelbourne is a 5 star venue but seriously, €10.25 for a standard glass of red wine??",4,2014,07,18
207,Fabulous room/so so service,This hotel was beautiful. The spa was fantastic. I went for a book event that was being held there and everything was great with the exception of the service. We called once to get reservations for dinner and the staff told us they would get back to us and didn't. Then we called to get the bellman to get our bags and waited an hour to call back to make the identical request.,4,2014,07,17
207,Overnight stay on business,"I travel to Dublin a couple of times a year on business and am always pleased to stay here - super service, great rooms, delcious dinner and breakfast and free wifi throughout hotel.  Great spa - always look forward to coming back!",5,2014,07,16
207,Excellent customer service,"On one of my many visits to Bar 27 for birthday Cocktails I came across a very customer orientated staff member (Linda) who was very experienced in all aspects of making sure we had everything we possibly needed. As a business owner of many staff, it's hard to come by such enthusiastic staff.",5,2014,07,16
207,Six stars from this traveling family!,"We were tickled and delighted when we found the hotel (we drove into Dublin from Kilkenny).  The valet was super accommodating, made sure the kids were safe and helped us unload.  They were helpful with providing tips on how to return our car (early, rather than attempt driving to the airport).  The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, pristine condition, with wonderful public spaces.  I appreciated the fully functioning business center, as I needed to attend to several issues at home. 

The Horseshoe bar has a great vibe and we dined in the hotel restaurant, The Saddle Room, both mornings, which was delicious.  For an afternoon pick-me-up, I recommend a wonderful pastry and tea in the No 27 Bar & Lounge (front dining room/bar area) although the hotel also has a full tea in the Lord Mayor's Lounge for  about $45 euro 

We really appreciated the extra touches, such as bringing the kids slippers, along with adult ones.  They loved it!

The bed and linens were heavenly, best night sleep of our 10 day trip!",5,2014,07,15
207,One of the best!,"If you're considering booking this hotel, you're probably expecting a certain standard and this hotel will not disappoint you.  Considering the fact that all the residential spaces seem packed and congested in downtown Dublin, rooms in this hotel are surprisingly spacious.  In addition, despite the fact that the hotel was originally built in 1824, it has excellent sound insulation.  We heard no noise whatsoever, either from the streets outside or from the hallways. 

The location is excellent, too.  It's across the street from St. Stephen's Green, through which is a very pleasant walk, and it was less than 10 minutes walk from where the bus of three of the four tours that we took picked us up and it was also less than 10 minutes walk from Pearse train (DART) station where we went to get on a train to go to Houth per one of the concierge's recommendation, which was such a beautiful fishing village to walk around.  In my opinion, Houth is a must if you go to Ireland.  I'm so happy that she recommended it for us. 

The room service was inconsistent, e.g., they did not replace the washcloths after their afternoon maid service, so we had to call them; they failed to fill our in-room breakfast order one day (They said they never got it, but our order was gone from the door.); they did not empty one of the waste baskets one day, etc., but the people at the front desk and concierge were always very courteous and helpful.   

Overall, we were extremely pleased with the hotel and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Ireland.",5,2014,07,15
207,Stay here for the beds,"As every other review has said - the hotel is beautiful.  Very old school glamour - chandeliers everywhere, great breakfast, etc.  However, the real standout feature was the bed.  It was basically like sleeping in a cloud.  It had an extra pillow-top mattress, really fluffy pillows & comforter...just perfect.

The gym is also pretty nice.  They have 3 or 4 treadmills, a few ellipticals, free weights, and the best thing I've ever seen in a hotel gym - a real spin bike.  

Another nice thing - the hotel is apparently undergoing some renovations (didn't actually see/hear any of it), so they had people from the front desk personally escort every guest to their room upon check-in so we wouldn't get lost.  Fantastic service overall!",5,2014,07,15
207,Absolutely Perfect.,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for the first 3 nights on our honeymoon tour of Ireland.  The staff was incredibly warm, welcoming and helpful and the accommodations could not be beat.  Our room was impeccably clean and the bed was divine, especially after having travelled for almost 10 hours!  The location was perfect as well -- walking distance to almost anything we wanted to see or do in Dublin (right across from St. Stephen's Green).  The only part of our stay that was a bit surprising was that when we had made our reservation online, it said that breakfast was included.  When we checked in, they said we did not have breakfast included even though I had printed out our confirmation saying otherwise.  The upside was that it gave us the opportunity to find other amazing breakfast places around the city! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Dublin and can't wait to go back.",5,2014,07,14
207,Not a good experienc,Myself and my wife stayed here Friday 11th July we booked it through BOOKING.COM we were also going to dirty dancing in  the bord gais theatre. We arived at 2pm we were aware we might no get our room until 3pm that's understandable we check in and were told it would be 3pm before our room was ready. But then the lady checking us in hi lighted to me I used BOOKING.COM to book our room and the price of our stay. What's that all about? I'm well aware of the price of 5* hotels THE SHELBOURNE is not the only 5* we have staid in. If they dont want people using BOOKING.COM why advertise on there website.We went for a walk around the green arrived back at 3pm and we were told our room was not ready we asked when would it be ready and were told they don't know. I hi lighted that we were going to a show at 5pm and had to leave at 4pm they said they would ring me when it was ready. We waited another 30 minutes and we we're getting very annoyed at this went back to the reception and after 15 minutes eventually got a room. We got back from the theatre and in our room was 2 bottles of lemonade and 2 chocolates with a card but the names on the card we're not our names. No we though someone else was going to enter our room when we went for dinner I hi lighted this at reception they thanked me no apology. We we're really looking forward to our stay but THE SHELBOURNE did not live up to it's reputation.,3,2014,07,14
207,I expected more!,"I had wanted to stay in this hotel for years and was really excited to go for 1 night for my husbands birthday. The hotel lobby is fab and reception staff were lovely. Greated us with delicious warm cider. But I was so disapointed with the room. It was TINY. The smallest hotel room I have stayed in in ireland. It wasnt any fancier than a 3 star hotel room, probably smaller! We had breakfast and it was delicious. There was a great selection of food. I was disapointed in general. I just expected it to be amazing and it wasnt.",3,2014,07,13
207,Excellent hotel,This is a really wonderful place dating back to 1826 I believe. Service was impeccable and the whole experience was incredible. Highly recommended. It's a Renaissance but it's still old school Ireland.,5,2014,07,12
207,Birthday celebration,Could not commend the staff more for the great time we had 8-11 July to celebrate a 65th birthday.  They treated us twice with chocolates and petite fours and a birthday rendition in No 27 bar on 10 July. Deluxe room was superb.  Breakfast was superb. Service everywhere superb. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin.  Thanks to The Shelbourne for making our special break so wonderful.,5,2014,07,12
207,Afternoon Tea,"Can't beat afternoon tea at the Shelbourne for a relaxing, pampered way to spend an hour or two.. Tea/Coffee sambo's and cakes were delicious and there was seconds (always good).
Almost as good as the breakfast. Will be back again..",5,2014,07,11
207,"""The Grand Old Lady""","We stayed here for 2 beautiful nights. I have always wanted to stay here every time we visited Dublin. It cost us ~AUD 296/night (for a double room without view) with complimentary buffet breakfast. The hotel itself is beautiful with excellent staff and services. With it's central location and just right across form the St Stephen's Green Park, it is so easy to get around.
Room: Cosy, clean, bathroom has a big modern shower ( a little bit low pressure shower, but that did not put us off).
Hotel design is a bit like a maze (I presumed due to it's huge size), so it took me a bit of time to familiarise with the way to go to the Gym. One of the lifts (for Room 671-677) had a smell of stale old vomit, so I did point this out to one of the staff.
Breakfast buffet had a variety of fresh options or you could also ordered hot food (pay extra).
The Gym has a couple of rooms for weights and cardio machines and is attached to the indoor heated swimming pool.
Oyster Bar is located downstairs and I would highly recommend it.
Overall, it is a very good hotel but I would prefer Westbury Hotel over Shelbourne.",4,2014,07,11
207,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We stayed at the Shelbourne in June, and the hotel, staff, and location was fantastic! Our original flight was cancelled so we were one-day late arriving in Dublin and the hotel cancelled and refunded the first night of our reservation with no hassle. The lobby, restaurant, and rooms are impeccably clean and decorated. The breakfast was included in our stay and the variety and quality of food was great. Our room was spacious, clean, and showcased the heritage of the hotel while at the same time being upgraded with modern expectations like a super comfortable mattress, fluffy towels, and large bathroom with new fixtures. I would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2014,07,11
207,Great concierge service,"We spent three nights at the Shelbourne in late June.  The food was excellent and the accommodations were just fine. The concierge Denis O'Brien was exceptional - he moved heaven and earth to help us with a package delivery and coordinating our time there.  Our disappointment came when we were asked to move rooms (away from the room next door to our minor daughter) to ""an upgraded room"" in order to accommodate a family with young children who needed adjoining rooms.  We agreed, but the room was anything but an upgrade and all the promised extras to entice us to move (bottle of wine, etc.) conveniently never appeared.  We will never voluntarily move rooms again! We felt put upon by the front desk. Because of Denis we rate the stay a 4 - without him, it was a 2 or 3.",4,2014,07,10
207,Dublin's Finest,"At St. Stephens Green area, the Shelbourne Hotel has long stood for excellence and it did not disappoint.  Our accommodations were first rate and the staff very attentive.  We enjoyed a great breakfast before touring for the day around Dublin.  Returning for the evening, we were again met with a warm welcome back.  Anyone visiting Dublin would do well to stay at the Shelbourne as have many famous people over the last 190 years the hotel has been serving.  This is a high quality luxury hotel that has earned a reputation as the best tradition of Irish hospitality for any traveler.",5,2014,07,10
207,Christmas Party Blues,"I didnt stay in the hotel but I did attend a Christmas party with a group of friends, in one of the hotels reception rooms and also visited the main hotel bar. As I had heard this hotel was a 5 star hotel, I felt assured almost everything would be to a very high standard, I was mistaken. We were told by staff that any pre party drinks bought within the main hotel bar, could be taken into the reception room where the party was being held however we found out this was not the case. We had to leave our drinks and the HOTEL itself, walk outside, in the cold winter rain and wind, down the road to the entrance to the reception room. The only 5 star hotel I have ever been to that has no link hallway and is happy to allow their guest to be rained on. When we entered the reception room, it was packed full of tables. It looked more like a cheep bingo hall then a ""luxury"" hotel. No one could move and my back was constantly being knocked by fellow guests and passers by. Added to that, my table was right next to an exit used by staff and the doors were constantly left open, with freezing cold air hitting us every few minutes. To top it all off, there were cracks in the crowded dance floor, which a number of female friends caught their high heels in. Unhelpful staff, bad planning and poor surrounding. It has the location and the name, no doubt its standards are not that of a true 5 star hotel.",1,2014,07,08
207,Afternoon tea to die for,"Visited for afternoon tea service that was recommended for out visit to Dublin, booked in advance which is highly recommended. The quality and service was second to none in a wonderful luxury hotel. Served a selection of sandwiches first in different breads and even got a second tray as they were amazing! Next was very fresh scones/ginger loaf and individual deserts. All served with as much tea as wanted and we were even able to take away a couple of cakes that we couldn't finish. 
A truly luxury experience throughout!",5,2014,07,07
207,Magnificent hotel in perfect Dublin location,"The Shelbourne is a hotel steeped in tradition located within easy walking distance of most center-city attractions. The National Museums are in adjacent blocks, St Stephen's Green is directly across the street, Grafton Street is just a few blocks down as is Trinity College. Christ Church at St Patrick's Cathedral are each about 15 minute walk away. 
We began and ended or trip to Ireland at the Shelbourne, and it was perfect for both. In arranging the trip - which was a slightly belated celebration of our 40th anniversary - I communicated with Dana at the hotel via email regarding some specific requests. Everything was handled beyond my expectation and was in place on arrival. I give her most special thanks for making our stay there so memorable.
The rooms were very comfortable, clean and well kept. The rooms are stocked with amenities.
Our room included breakfast which was beyond ample. The breakfast is served buffet style, but eggs and such can be prepared to order.
We enjoyed afternoon libations in the No 27 Lounge at the hotel where the bar staff was delightful.
While I'm certain the staff is child-friendly, the hotel itself has formal areas that architecturally suggest the character of one of those places children under 12 might not be so comfortable.",5,2014,07,07
207,Nice hotel in a convenient location,"The Shelbourne is well situated right across the street from St. Stephen's Green and a 5-minute walk from Grafton St.  The property itself is an older, elegant building that has been modernized.  The rooms are nice -- nothing spectacular, but a good size and well appointed.  The bed and bedding were not that comfortable for me (e.g. the pillows were too high), but at least the room was nice and quiet so I slept ok.

Breakfast at the hotel is really excellent (included in our rate).  There's a buffet with hot and cold selections, though I especially liked the option to order off the menu.  There were many tasty options, including omelettes and pancakes made to order, though this also took quite some time.  The espresso drinks made to order were very good as well.

I had the chance to use the gym once, and it was well equipped to get in a good workout on the road.  There's also an indoor swimming pool for those who want to swim laps.  It's definitely nice to be able to stay active on the road.

Service at the hotel was friendly and helpful -- polite, professional and efficient.

I usually don't comment on the bars at hotels, but it's worth noting that the hotel bar doesn't have TVs (during the world cup, this was an issue).  Also the bar is on the small side and seating is not very plentiful or comfortable.  It also got very stuffy and hot in there.  Good thing this is Dublin so it's easy to find a pub, but would be nice to have a better bar option in the lobby.",4,2014,07,06
207,Beautiful,"A truly elegant hotel, and the location is unmatched. This hotel is only a 2 block walk from Grafton Street. The Temple Bar area is about a 10-15 minute walk. All kinds of stores and restaurants are along the way.",4,2014,07,04
207,Half way there,We stopped off at the Shelley for cocktails en route to our final destination . Service excellent I said it was my wife's birthday and the staff presented her with three petit cakes with happy birthday written in chocolate . Cocktails amazing  what more can we say you have to return!.,5,2014,07,04
207,Nice,But.....It's a little too fancy for kids.  Went with 5 kids and I wouldn't recommend this place for family.  Location is nice but a longer walk to temple bar area.  Close to park and shopping but we didn't come to Dublin to go shopping.  Personally we preferred the Morrison hotel (Doubletree) on the north shore of the Liffey for its proximity to the Temple Bar area.  Internet access was restrictive as well.  The afternoon tea was nice and very classy.... Nice bars at the Shelbourne too.  ,4,2014,07,03
207,Old World Elegance - delivered,"I travel a lot and have stayed in luxury hotels and hotels where you sleep on rather than in the bed.  In modern 5 star hotels you get a lot of mod-cons but the Shelbourne is an old elegant hotel so what you do not get in features you get in bucket-load with service and great hospitality.  
The rooms are well proportioned and very clean.  The beds are very comfortable.  Breakfast is a feast and appeared always to be well supplied even when it was coming to the end of service.",4,2014,07,01
207,Good place,"We had a weekend there and quite liked it. You can feel the place is full of history.
It is very nice and it's hard to beat the location. You can walk to pretty much everything. People were very helpful and nice. I'd say the only place you can't walk to is the prison.
You should really include the breakfast with your room because it is really worth it. There's a nice buffet and the ""a la carte"" is also included as far as we understood.
All in all, I'd recommend the place.",4,2014,07,01
207,Wonderful weekend in Dublin,"From the moment we arrived in the Shelbourne I was made to feel privileged. Its an experience - an amazing venue full of history, streeped in traditions and yet 21st Century.
Our room was outstanding as were the hotel facilities.The location opposite Stephens Green was very central to all major toursist attractions. The breakfast wasnt the best Ive had but the ambience & staqff attention to detail made up for this
 If at the Shelbourne be sure to visit its own Museum detailing the hotels history &information about its most famous clientele",5,2014,07,01
207,Great Old Hotel in a great area,"Completely remodeled and grand accommodations. We loved this place, it is very close to downtown and all the tourist areas are walkable from here, the restaurant is classy with superb dining options. Our room was small but elegantly decorated with premium bedding and free 
Wi-Fi, is kind of pricey but well worth expense",5,2014,07,01
207,Luxurious - no other word to describe this one,"This hotel has recently been renovated and it is beautiful. First stop in the lobby, they actually have scented air in the check in area. Plus, they provide lemonade and homemade cookies when you arrive. That is a small sample of the ""extra's"" that are everywhere. 

Our room was lovely. The bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to go home to my own very comfortable bed. Turn down service at night with chocolates and bottled water. We had a newspaper at our door in the morning. The bathroom was big and had a great shower. They provided wonderful shampoos, etc. Everything was perfect and perfectly attended to.

Breakfast was a feast. It was beautifully served buffet style with fresh fruits, baked goods, a large selection of savory items and cereals. There were hot items too. Everything you could want.

We had a stop in the little bar off the lobby for an after dinner drink. Very cozy. Service was great. The location is convenient to shopping and eating and museums. 

If you are looking for an elegant place to stay, this is it.",5,2014,06,30
207,Beautiful Hotel!!,"We went  to the Shelbourne in Ireland as part of an award business trip that my husband earned! It was a beautiful hotel and the rooms were absolutely gorgeous! The rooms are not only beautiful but very clean.  You feel pampered from the moment the bellman in his top hat opens the door for you and walk into the grand foyer with fresh flowers everywhere!! The food was excellent which isn't always true when you are serving a large group!  One of the best features of the Shelbourne is the location --not only are you staying in a luxury hotel but you can not beat the location.  It is close to everything --right across from the gorgeous park, shopping and tons of fun pubs and restaurants.  If we make it back to Dublin we would make a reservation at the Shelbourne.",5,2014,06,30
207,The grand old lady of hotels is Class,"Wonderful location in the heart of the city the Shelbourne stands proud overlooking Dublin's fashionable St Stephens Green.  The bar is a part of Dublins social scene, the rooms amazing, although it's a five star there is a friendly feel.  You can walk out and access great restaurants, bars, and night life.  The spa and swimming pool are an added bonus in a city location.

The thing that makes this property is extra special are the staff, nothing is too much trouble..... I have stayed as a guest, co-ordinated business incentives and each time I go to the Shelbourne I do so with a smile.",5,2014,06,30
207,Wonderful Historic Hotel,"This hotel is historic and in a great location!  It reminded me of staying at the Plaza in New York City-great for people watching! It's just a short walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, Temple Bar area and St. Stevens Green is right across the street.  We caught the Hop-on-off bus right across the street.  

Service is superb!  We were offered breakfast due to my husband's Marriott status, and since we had an early flight were offered room service instead- a wonderful spread that was a very special end to our trip!

The room we had was spacious and nicely furnished- though the air conditioning was not working and it was very warm which made for an uncomfortable sleep.",4,2014,06,30
207,Great hotel,"I came here for lunch and it was great. Very child friendly and amazing service. I ❤️ed it. The food was great and we got a special menu. This hotel is great for after parties of communions, conformations ect.",5,2014,06,26
207,Elegant and amazing!,"I used points to stay here and I can honestly write this is the most fabulous Marriott property I have ever stayed at!  It is elegant and in a great area for shopping/pubs/and getting anywhere.  The staff was amazing-extremely accommodating and just a 'class act'.  The rooms are very comfortable and nicely appointed.  The only 'negative' was the concierges who were not very friendly or helpful-not sure what that was all about but everyone else was great!

Some FYIs:
1.  I was surprised to find out later in my stay that breakfast was included-even with points.  That was a big savings and they also allowed room service-so ask when you check in.
2.  The restaurant on site is very formal-not what I enjoy but there are lots of options near by the hotel.
3.  They don't get wash clothes out except for the first day-strange but true.  You have to request each day-weird...just weird.
4.  There is no gift shop-but lots of shopping (Grafton Street) close by.

I would highly recommend this hotel-absolutely fantastic-thank you for a memorable stay!",5,2014,06,25
207,A touch of luxury in the centre of Dublin,"This was the second time we've stayed at the Shelbourne, and even though we paid slightly more (we got a *really* good deal the first time) it was still well worth the money. The hotel itself is stunning, the location couldn't be better, and both breakfast and afternoon tea (the two meals we ate there) were truly wonderful.",5,2014,06,24
207,Great place,Beautiful hotel.  They did a nice job of renovating the place. Lots of little touches.  Loved our room.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Liked the history of the place. Had a small museum that was very interesting.  Nice shower and towel Warner's a nice touch.  Beds were very comfortable and even the pillows were good.  I often have problems with pillows. Had a lovely time at the bar.  The bartenders were especially pleasant.  The breakfast that came with our room was good.  A lot of variety on the brunch option. I would definitely come again.,5,2014,06,23
207,Excellent old world elegance ,"Very classy and posh hotel. The staff is great. The rooms are small, but comfortable and clean. I visited the gym as well as took a swim in the pool. I do wish the sauna and steam room were segregated male/ female though. I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2014,06,23
207,Always a pleasure amazing staff,It's always a pleasure to stay at The Shelbourne amazing staff great location right in the middle of the city. Great breakfast. Nothing is too much trouble. The staff always make our kids feel welcome. Beautiful spa. Can't wait to go back!! ,5,2014,06,21
207,A classic !!!,"This hotel is part of the history of Dublin and behaves that way.
The greeting ,the valet car parking, check in ( with home made  lemonade while you complete the paperwork) and the bedrooms are all executed perfectly.
The bars are bustling and comfortable and great for people watching.Pricey but you are in the Shelbourne !!
A great hotel ",4,2014,06,20
207,"It's the best hotel in Dublin, well worth the money.  Location can't be beat.","I booked a room with a park view, and we had a suite!  I lived in Dublin and never realized the mountain views but I saw them from the window in my room.  (Well I'm from Colorado, but the pretty hills that they call Mountains.)  Beautiful to have a view of the Green.

It felt like we stepped back in time to a beautiful snapshot of the old Ireland, but lucky for me they have done all the updating to high end luxury modern levels.

This really is a nice place to relax after seeing the sights or catching up with friends.  I loved the easy walk to Trinity and my favorite store, The House Of Ireland.  I bought my girls Claddah rings there.

It's exactly as you hope it will be.",5,2014,06,18
207,Cream tea,"This is so good.
I was in a wheelchair and need special food but they went out of there way it was my brother birthday and they came out with a cake and candle. The price is high but it so worth it  you feel like a queen everything is done for yo yes I did feel like a fish out of water but so good",5,2014,06,18
207,Great Hotel.,Great service experience had at this hotel. Management and staff very helpful. Hotel situated near to all amenities. Ate in the hotel on on evening I was staying and food and service was very good indeed.,4,2014,06,18
207,First hotel in Ireland was the Shelbourne,Our first trip to Ireland and this was the first stop.   Beautiful hotel and helpful staff.  Great location practically on The Green.   Stayed here using Marriott points.  Our room was an average size but everything was top notch.  Breakfast was very good and the wait staff very attentive and friendly.  Would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone vacationing in Dublin.,4,2014,06,17
207,First Class - with friendly service.,"Enjoyed a really good stay here recently. Our room was very well presented. Staff at every level were very helpful. Dinner in The Saddle Room was outstanding. Breakfast next morning was also excellent with very friendly staff.
Well done to all concerned!",5,2014,06,16
207,"Shelbourne-location great, everything else average!","We stayed here for a wedding. We were a party of three with one senior. We booked our rooms far far far in advance.  We booked two double beds. when we arrived it took forever for us to check in and get our rooms. They were packed, all bell hops and attendants were busy. After a long overnight flight, the last thing you want to do is wait in a lobby full of loud talking people waiting for thirty minutes just to be seen. Once we arrived in our rooms, the bellhops were soo busy we opted to take part of our luggage so we could atleast get started on unpacking- good thing we did, it was another thirty minutes before they showed up with our bags. The room was ok, however, there was mold on the baseboards and showers- due to the humidity I kinda expected it to be honest. The shower/bath tub on the other hand was soo large to get into I almost fell getting in and out. I knew my grandmother would have severe issues with this and i didn't want her to attempt it for fear that she would fall and crack her head open. We asked for another room. We were told they were sold out. AGGGGHHHH. However, we were there for a wedding so the groom to be was nice and asked for us to be switched. Well a lot of good that did because they switched us to ONE BEDROOM QUEEN- um, ok, so that's great for the two of us, but there are THREE of US. they offered a rollaway, but it was broken so my husband slept on the floor basically of this five star hotel. Room was ok- antique with paint chipping, mold, baseboards coming off, but yes it was clean enough to sleep in.  I thought the breakfast was way overpriced for the selection. Descent selection for a standard Irish breakfast with the essentials of fruit, granola, cereal, pastries and juice. I would probably not stay here again. It was not to a standard five star hotel and could use a lot of updating. I would say a four star hotel with a three star appearance, service and room value.  However- with all that said... you cannot beat the location!!!! It was tremendous for location. Right across from St. Stephen's Green-which is a beautiful park!",3,2014,06,16
207,Wish I could give it a 6th Star,"A hotel has never astounded me as much as this.  Yes it is expensive, but when you enter, it becomes obvious that this is one of the few luxury hotels where you undoubtedly get your money's worth.

Maintaining a historic property such as this has to require lots of money and effort.  Thankfully, they address the challenge head-on and with gusto.  It took me days to notice even the slightest hints of aging, and by that point, I was aware that they are currently renovating (to probably address these slight imperfections).  The decor throughout is old-world but never ordinary.  They take risks; our room's yellow walls were surprisingly tasteful.

The room had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  We were upgraded from the cheapest available room to a heritage room.  I can't comment on what the base room consists of, but the heritage rooms are big by American standards and huge by European standards.  I was surprised to find that our room was air conditioned; which is unusual for Ireland but appreciated. 

The service is absolutely top notch.  It may just be the famous Irish friendliness, but every staff member I met seemed genuinely happy to interact.  A special tip of the hat goes to the man who worked the door around dinner hour; he felt like a lifetime friend from the second you met him.  None of the pleasantries from anybody seemed insincere; everybody is just a genuine delight.

The breakfast was amazing.  Even though it is served buffet style, all the components of the Irish breakfast were perfectly cooked.  The breakfast is served on china (why wouldn't it?).  Even though it's ""just a buffet"", the service (of course) was great.  If the buffet isn't your thing, there is a small menu to order from; my wife's Eggs Benedict was perfect.  If you stay here, be sure that breakfast is included in your rate; don't miss it.

The hotel is so close to perfection that I have to mention one nagging issue: the elevators are not air conditioned.  You become so spoiled by every other facet of your stay that the slightly uncomfortable elevator becomes irritating.  As far as I can tell, the elevator is the only thing that stands between this hotel and perfection.",5,2014,06,15
207,Chocolate chip cookies and fresh lemonade !!!,"Had a wonderful stay here with my 14 year old daughter who was in Dublin to see One Direction . Dublin was buzzing this weekend and the Shelbourne did not disappoint . What a special place this is .The doormen are amazing , so friendly and helpful, loved the use of the hotel umbrellas (always useful in Ireland !!!) . My daughter adored the chocolate chip cookies and fresh lemonade at reception when we were checking in , very tasty . Our room was beautiful , not the biggest but very luxurious , Bit disappointed that there were no tea/ coffee making facilities in the room . The location is great really handy for all the lovely shops in Grafton Street . 
We only had breakfast at the hotel and it was amazing , staff were very efficient and friendly . Check out the honeycomb , i would love to know where it is from, i have never seen one that big before !!Last but not least the florists at this hotel deserve special mention as the flower arrangemenst were simply stunning ! Thank you for a lovely stay and i hope its not too long before i can come back again .",5,2014,06,14
207,"if you are a history lover, then it is a must!","checked in very smoothly on 4th of June, the reception staff were lovely, and then we were transferred to our room, which was in good size comparing to European standards, unfortunately our window was looking in to an inner wall :-( very disappointing! the furniture is classic and the bathroom was marble. The history and story behind the Shelbourne is impressive i was so impressed staying in a building with this rich history.

pros:
1-Perfect location walking distance to everywhere in Dublin city center  
2- Staff is very friendly and helpful
3- Breakfast for sure not to be missed ..yummy
4-oppisiate the St. stephans park directly
5-hopon hop off trips are just across the road
6-many shops and dining options around
7-spa is very good although expensive
8-apperantly it is the celebrities’ best hotel in Dublin ;-) 

Cons:
1-some rooms has better view, and they really need to work around the rooms without view
2-TOOOOO expensive
3-there was some water leakage in the bathroom
4-wifi need to be faster

anyhow loved it, will definitely recommend it if you can afford it.",4,2014,06,11
207,Worth the distance travelled,"I treated myself to 5 nights at the Shelbourne recently to celebrate a milestone birthday, travelling from Australia. The experience was well worth the trip - the whole place was spotless, my room expansive, the service impeccable and the staff personable but professional. My only disappointment (albeit a very slight one) was that my ""park view"" room only included a glimpse of a couple of trees at the edge of St Stephen's Green.  However this was over-ridden by the hotel's location and its very interesting history.  Its small museum on the ground floor next to reception is well worth a look, and it was convenient for pick-up and drop-off on a day trip I took to Wicklow and Glendalough..the bus stopped just across the road.  I only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was included in the rate, and it provided a very extensive range of foods to satisfy the most discerning palate.  I would not hesitate to recommend this establishment to anyone who would like to be spoilt for a few days - I found it well worth the expense.",5,2014,06,10
207,Great Location!,During our first trip to Ireland we stayed at the Shelbourne.  The location was wonderful.  It was close to the main shopping and restaurant area.  Our room was quiet and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and the food was great.  It was a great experience.,5,2014,06,10
207,Not 5* treatment,"Stayed one night last week end and was very disappointed or maybe I had myself built up to much for the 5* treament as I dont often get to stay in 5* hotels. We arrived about noon and was met at the entrance by very helpful staff who parked the car for us then we went to reception to let them know we were there as we knew we were early and that went well and I left my case and was told to come back at 3pm to book in. We  went out for walk and look around the city and arrived back at 3pm to be told my room wasnt ready and was asked to come back in half hour which we did and room still was not ready so I went away again for 45 minutes and back again to be told room not ready and not given any proper explanation so eventually we got a room at 4.45pm which I didnt consider great as described in other reviews. The room was very average size the bathroom was small with a big shower and barely enough room to work at a tiny sink, the room was so small it  had a sliding door and when using the sink your elbow was hitting of the shower door which was loose at the end.  Our view from the window was flat roofs. We had arranged to meet friends at 5pm for dinner but had to delay that as we only got the room at 4.45pm. We came back to the bar that night and asked for a Hennessy brandy and got a Gin and when this was pointed out to the bar man he said it was Hennessy Gin ? then we had to point out the brandy to him and the bar was quiet that night. The breakfast was brilliant and very relaxing and the service was great. The hotel itself is beautiful but would think twice before going back at the price they charge. Not a five star  experience. It was a special occassion for us and I said that to the lady in reception but that didnt make any difference to them.",3,2014,06,09
207,Great Location!,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for our first few nights in Ireland. The location really cant be beat. It is right next to the main shopping and restaurant streets in Dublin and it is such a well known hotel that many tour buses will stop there for pickup/dropoff. It is right around the corner from the National Museums. The hotel is pretty big, it has 2 bars, a tearoom and a restaurant. I wouldnt bother eating there however as it is really expensive. The afternoon tea there is famous though so your call. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and our room was large and clean. We didnt have a great view but we had a balcony which was a nice surprise. We had to keep re-signing into the wifi to get it to work which was annoying but thats normal for european hotels. Overall it was a great experience, I would definitely stay again.",4,2014,06,09
207,Sunday dinner at The Shelbourne,"My wife and I were in Dublin for The Eagles concert.  I decided to round the weekend off by having Sunday dinner in the Shelbourne, and what a way to round off the weekend.  The service was extremely friendly, the food superb and the bill not as you might expect!  A great experience all round.",5,2014,06,09
207,As expected: Perfection,"This hotel is exactly the treat that you had expected (and that you are paying for, mind you). 
It is centrally located, but not too central, i.e. relatively quiet for a city-hotel, with a nice view to a park –  St.Stephen’s Green – and within short walking distance to the center of Dublin. 
The design of the room we were given was not just the normal “square”, but with a funny little “hall” – good effect, and good thinking!",5,2014,06,09
207,High Tea is a Must,"The Shelbourne is a wonderful place to stay. It is very luxurious. It has such a rich history if visitors. It is hard not to feel as if you are a part of that. The rooms are so nice. We had High Tea, and it was exceptionally nice. The food was wonderful. Breakfasts each morning were excellent.",5,2014,06,08
207,Excellence in  Elegance!,"The best of the best if you want luxury, convenience and friendly staff! We spent 3 nights there and it was awesome. Everything you want to see and do is in this neighborhood except The Guinness and Jameson Brewerys. And the cab ride for those are short. A must is to have High Tea at the Hotel, you just might see a celebrity or two! The restaurant (Saddle Room) has delicious food, desserts are to die for!!  The Conceirge staff at the Hotel are so friendly and helpful, one of our group lost her cell phone in a cab coming from the airport to the hotel and thanks to Denis the Conceirge we got it back 24 hours later!!!",5,2014,06,08
207,Absolutely Loved the Shelbourne!,"My husband and I just spent 3 glorious nights at the Shelbourne! I used Marriott points for our stay and was happy as a Platinum Rewards member to get an upgrade to a Heritage Premium room. From the moment we got out of our taxi to our checkout, the service at the hotel was superb. 

Check-in was easy, although we did have to wait a few hours for our room as we had arrived so early. However, the hotel stored our bags and gave us access to a small private bath so that we could freshen up after our trans-Atlantic flight. We still ended up getting our room about an hour and half earlier than normal check-in.

The room was absolutely lovely. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable, and the room itself was so quiet. The bathroom was gigantic! Separate shower and tub, plus a huge vanity. There were a plentiful supply of amenities in the bath including shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, bar soap and shower gel. The towels were particularly fluffy. The flat screen TV had a ton of channels and the room also had a mini-bar. The desk had a US style electrical outlet, as well as the usual Irish/British outlets. 

As a Platinum, we had breakfast for two in the restaurant every day. You can order off the menu or select the buffet. The buffet had a lot of choices, but doesn't change from day to day. We were also given 2 drink vouchers. We did have drinks in the 27 bar one afternoon and it was a lively, fun atmosphere. Lots of good people watching!

I really cannot stress how upscale, comfortable and inviting the Shelbourne is. I would recommend it to anyone! And of course, it is central to all sight-seeing, dining, and shopping in Dublin. Perfectly located for a great weekend in Dublin!",5,2014,06,07
207,First Class,"What a wonderful place for a full champaigne afternoon tea.  The elegant and large room was very clean and comfortable.  The location is perfect, and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to spend time in Dublin.",5,2014,06,05
207,Luxurious in every sense of the word,"This is a five star hotel that ""delight(s) to serve"" most of the time. From the moment you walk in through the doors till you check out, you feel well cared for. The staff are very nice. The hotel property is very beautiful and luxurious. As are the rooms. There's a lot of Irish history associated with this hotel as well, which makes it an Irish icon, in my view. Everything about our (my fiance and I) 3 nights stay at the hotel was great and indulgent except for a very rude, discourteous check in staff who failed to live up to the Shelbourne motto of ""delight to serve"". In a nutshell, if you are arriving at the hotel well before the check in time and have pre-arranged early check in, don't let the staff tell you otherwise and make you wait. And if one staff member does try to tell you to come back at the normal check in time, like we were repeatedly told, don't take that for an answer and ask another staff member. We didn't understand this inconsistency in the service, especially from a five star hotel. But apart from that, our stay here was perfect. I have written separate reviews about the restaurants at this hotel - which are great. Location of the hotel is very good - just minutes away from Grafton Street, St Stephen's shopping centre, Trinity college and the hotel is directly across the road from St Stephen's Green itself. You will not regret staying here. Beautiful, indulgent and luxurious.",4,2014,06,05
207,Very nice hotel,"The hotel was beautiful, food was great, service was good. In a good location in Dublin, just a short walk to museums and main shopping. Hard to find the gym and spa. The breakfast was very good and we had dinner in the hotel which was very good as well.",3,2014,06,05
207,First Class,"What a great, classic old hotel!  This hotel has the best, friendliness and most helpful staff of any that I have stayed in. Our room was beautiful and large. The location is convenient to just about anything you want to see or do in Dublin. I can't recommend it highly enough. ",5,2014,06,04
207,"Beautiful place, but don't value rewards members","This was beautiful, and my husband and I used points for two nights at The Shelbourne. However, I didn't feel like we were ever taken seriously because we had used points for the place. Also, being in our late 20s/early 30s we were sort of ignored. Also, the spa was already booked solid. However, the rooms were beautiful and the location is amazing.",3,2014,06,04
207,Afternoon Tea,"Was treated to afternoon tea at this hotel; it was wonderful.  The service was, as expected, being a 5* hotel, first rate.  The afternoon tea was wonderful, with a selection of open sandwiches, scones and fancy cakes,  there was also a fabulous warm ginger cake.  I have had afternoon tea in many London hotels, including The Dorchester and nowhere have I had a ginger cake served with the scones - this was truly the best.",5,2014,06,04
207,Fantastic stay!,"Loved this hotel from start to finish. The service from everyone we met here was exemplary.
The room was spotless and full of thoughtful details. Extremely comfortable bed.
I particularly liked the swimming pool with sauna and steam room. What a great way to wake up in the morning!
The location was central and we pre-booked a taxi online to the airport for 22€.
Would recommend for a comfortable stay in Dublin.",5,2014,06,04
207,"lovely hotel, fantastic service","What a lovely, beautiful hotel and fantastic service! The location perfect, right in Dublin's city centre just minutes away from the best restaurants, cafes and shops. The room was very comfy and the breakfast was amazing.
The hotel has a nice swimming pool big enough for a real swim, that's certainly a plus if you're a keen swimmer!",5,2014,06,03
207,Very disappointing,"We stayed in The Shelbourne Hotel in March.  We were celebrating a special occasion and we had a weekend planned in great detail for months in advance.   I had The Four Seasons booked but as the time came nearer we decided to cancel and 'treat ourselves' at The Shelbourne.

First impressions were good.  We were allocated a beautiful room and Reception staff were lovely.  Next morning breakfast was OK - very expensive for what we actually ate though.  This is where the positives stop however.  When we returned to our room we found somebody elses luggage was left there.   It took some persuasion for Reception to believe it really was NOT our luggage.  2 hours later the luggage still sat there.   

We left and returned later in the evening to find our room had not been serviced.  I realise, the hotel was very busy and preoccupied with the Irish rugby team - however even in the cheapest, most basic hotels I have stayed in - my room was always cleaned.  The worst bit was yet to come - the bath fitting was broken since we arrived -  so we could not have a bath/shower.  A maintenance man took up residence in our room for almost an hour trying (in vain) to fix it.  We didnt even have time for a shower before we went out to dinner plus I didnt even have the privacy of being able to get changed.  It was a frustrating start to what should have been a wonderful evening.

I reported all the above to Reception and also wrote to the Customer Services Manager.  I was informed that 'full disciplinary action took place where necessary' and I would be given 'a complimentary upgrade to a heritage room on my next stay, subject to availability'.",2,2014,06,03
207,"Lovely Building, Awful Service!","Spending our last of three nights here at the Shelbourne, which is a beautiful old style building with some lovely grand rooms on the first floor, but desperately in need of a makeover on service!  First, the Pros:  Awsome location!  Walking distance to virtually everything, and right across from St Stephens Green which is a gorgeous park.  Also, the bars downstairs and the lounge where high tea are served are beautiful and ornate, you really feel like you are somewhere special.  Now, the cons: while location is great, service is very poor.  When we checked in, three men out front and no one offered to help me lug my suitcase up the couple of steps and into the hotel.  Ok, not the end of the world.  When we checked in at 10 am, room not ready.  Ok, fair enough, check in is not until 3 pm.  They said they would put a priority on at least one of the two rooms we had and call my cell.  We went off to explore. No call.  We finally come back to the hotel at 2 pm and discover that our room was ready at noon, but no one bothered to call us.  Other room was not ready but they assured us they would call us right away.  No call, so at 3 pm we check again.  front desk too busy to talk to us, and say they will call us back in two minutes.  No call.  We call back in 30 minutes.  No answer at front desk.  I go downstairs and find no customers at front desk!  Oh yes, our room has been ready for some time!  This is the kind of sloppiness that just makes you angry, especially when you have been up all night.  Front desk completely unapologetic and entirely oblivious that this is annoying.  Both rooms are ok, but are small and have no view at all and but beds are horrible!  Two of the three have enormous troughs because they are so worn and it is like sleeping in a hammock.  Not acceptable at the rates being paid.  There were 4 hangers in our closet so I called to ask for some more.  Oh yes, I was told, they will be right up.  Two days later still no sign of the hangers.  No turndown service in our room first night, but it was here last night.  No replacement of empty shampoo bottles, no wash clothes left by housekeeping either day, we have had to call and ask to have them delivered the last two nights.  Frankly, none of this is horrible, but it is sloppy, annoying and preventable and should not be the type of service that anyone paying almost $900/night for two rooms with no view and bad beds should expect or accept.  I was going to let it all go until we got back to the room at 5 pm today after being out walking since 8 am this morning.  We wanted to relax, and put our feet up, before having to meet our sons in an hour.  We get to the room and bed is stripped, cleaning stuff everywhere, and no sign of housekeeping person!  We wait a bit and she finally comes back. There is no place even to sit, much less relax or shower.  We tell her we will go downstairs and wait while she cleans.  However, there is no place to sit downstairs while we wait.  Lounge has high tea so it is full. Horseshoe bar is small and pitch black, and main bar is packed with a wedding party.  We wait a half hour and then return to room and she is STILL cleaning!  Finally she finishes.  I don't care if the hotel is full and that is why my room is not getting cleaned until 5 pm.  That is not my problem and the hotel needs to plan for a fully booked hotel, not me plan to accommodate a busy hotel.  I travel constantly on business and frequently for vacation and this was a long series of lazy, preventable mistakes.  As a platinum Elite member of Mariott I can say I am surprised and very disappointed.  We asked the concierge to book us a car to airport in the morning but I have zero confidence this will actually happen?  Stay someplace else until someone here at The Shelbourne figures out how to efficiently run a hotel.",2,2014,05,31
207,The staff make the Shelbourne a true 5-star hotel!,"We spent 6 nights at the Shelbourne and we enjoyed nearly all aspects of this beautiful, classic hotel. Our first night we stayed in a room with beds that were simply abysmal; even with a requested bed-board added, the mattresses on both beds appeared to have been original to the hotel itself. After a miserable, sleepless night, we complained to the service manager, JD Flynn, who promptly, professionally, and perfectly addressed our concerns. We repacked and left our room to return late afternoon to a room with lovely beds making the rest of our stay, faultless.  

Mr. Flynn and his staff are exceptionally well-trained, service-oriented and genuine in all efforts. Our experience over the years with Marriott is simple: if it isn't right to begin with-which it most often is--given the chance to make it right they always do their best for the client. This is one reason we remain loyal to the Marriott brands.

Our week in Dublin was enhanced by the location and comfort of the Shelbourne, from the doormen and bellman (esp. Keith and Emil) to the concierge/navigator Paul Burne or Burke (apologies for not obtaining your card) all the staff were friendly, helpful and perpetually available to help make our stay perfect.  Paul B. helped me in a pinch make a last minute dinner for 12 colleagues special and fun in The Lord Mayor's Lounge (when I quite literally could find no where else to take a group that size, other than a local pub.)  a sincer ""bravissimo"" job by the staff in working to quickly accommodate our group and specific requests for what turned out to be a memorable, delightful meal in Dublin!

We enjoyed a range of the hotel services (bars, restaurants, reception, concierge, housekeeping) and truly found every interaction with Shelbourne staff exceptional! While the hotel is gorgeous and the facilities lovely, it was the people that made the Shelbourne stay truly special.",5,2014,05,30
207,An Irish Gem,"Second stay at this wonderful hotel. Located perfectly on St Stephens Green. Staff are excellent, beautiful interior. The comfiest bed I've ever slept in. The iced lemon drink on arrival is fab. I could live here!!!
@westderbywench",5,2014,05,28
207,Absolutely wonderful hotel,"Beautiful hotel in a great location, downtown Dublin. Across from Stephens Green.  Walking distance to everything.  Staff was fabulous.  Room was comfy and eloquent. Wonderful traditional Irish breakfast.  The best Marriott property I have ever stayed.",5,2014,05,28
207,One of the best meals in Dublin,"We went to the Rugby in March 2014  I booked 2  restaurants for our Friday and Saturday evening meal. Now I've got to say having stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel many times, I've always thought the breakfast to be one of the best in the world. The eggs benedict are to die for, the bar food is excellent too  
But the best by far was our Saturday night in a booth in the restaurant there were 4 of us, and a baby, the staff are very attentive without being over bearing very pleasant .The seafood was as fresh as the moment it was caught, our 2 males had steak and thought they were excellent too",5,2014,05,28
207,Elegance On the Edge of St. Stephen's Green,"The Shelbourne is THE place to stay when traveling to Dublin.  Across the street from St. Stephen's Green, it is in the heart of Dublin, within blocks of important attractions such as Grafton St., Riverdance, carriage rides and Trinity College.  It is one of the most luxurious hotels in Dublin and, as such, boasts unparalleled service.  However, rates can vary widely - from high E200s to  upwards of E600s so plan ahead.  If you are unable to stay at the Shelbourne, do stop by for dinner drinks or high tea.",5,2014,05,28
207,Memory Making,"What can one say about a stay at The Shelbourne except that it is the stuff that dreams are made of?  The staff is personable and happy to be of service at any time.  The venue is absolutely gorgeous and the history fascinating.  Treat yourself to Afternoon Tea in the Lord Mayor's Lounge, by all means.  This was the trip of a lifetime and we are 100% delighted with our stay.",5,2014,05,27
207,Luxurious experience,"If you want a real treat book into this hotel. Excellent customer service, luxury accommodations delicious food and an array of activities on the door step. Do try the eggs Benedictine shelbourne style for breakfast.........",5,2014,05,27
207,Another excellent Marriott property...,"Traveling frequently I tend to seek out Marriott properties. This property meets or exceeds they Marriott standard by a mile. The staff is the true highlight, attentive to every detail and extremely friendly. The room quality is great, and the history associated with the property makes it more likely to be considered as an Autograph property than a Renaissance location. You can't go wrong with this location! ",5,2014,05,27
207,Wonderful stay,"We stayed in a standard room for one night, drank in the bar, had room service, breakfast and brunch. The hotel is wonderful - bed, bathroom etc supremely comfortable, food and service friendly, not stuffy, and top quality. Look forward to returning soon. Thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2014,05,27
207,"Lovely, elegant property in a central location","I had to attend a 2-day conference in Dublin and being my first time in the city, wanted to get the property right. This hotel was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad he did.

This has a great location in the heart of the city. My room was large - more like a room found in many older hotels in the US than the cramped rooms of Europe. I was welcomed by two ladies with a very quirky sense of humor that was wonderful. Plus there were cookies as a quick snack. My only quibble with the room was the location - it was a long walk right to the end of the floor with small stairs to navigate. Plus I struggled a bit to get the hot water going in the shower. Breakfast was excellent but looks like I came in at the wrong time in the morning - the place was full and I got the farthest table from the buffet.

I wasn't around for dinner but the menu looked nice. This is a place I will visit again.",5,2014,05,26
207,Outstanding Hotel-----Great Bar,"The Shelbourne is truly a grand old lady. The staff is absolutely superb.
Because of all the additions through the years it's a bit of a maze..the floors are sloped and creaky....but that is the Charm of a Hotel that has origins in the early 1800's... you get used to it.
The Hotel indoor pool is one of the finest I have encountered.
While it is on the pricey side...you do get what you pay for.
As a Marriott Platinum I got a small upgrade and the king room is comfortable. The mattress is worn to one side....I guess we know what side the heavy men sleep on. The new bathroom is Terrific.
The Bar #27 is one of my favorite bars in the WORLD....ranking right along side the King Cole bar at the St Regis in New York. Young Master DAVE, the bartender/ mixologist is probably the finest young bartender in Europe. He is self taught yet is a total craftsman. I watched him make every concoction on a Saturday evening....and his total attention to the details were amazing.
His suggestion to me that I "" upgrade"" my Gin to Beefeaters 24 was spot on....smoothest GIBSON I have ever had. 
If you want an upscale refined stay in Dublin......one choice....the Shelbourne.",5,2014,05,26
207,Top Notch Service and GREAT Location in Dublin,"This historically important hotel in the center of Dublin, across from St Stephens Green, is beautifully run by the Renaissance group of Marriott.  Service is terrific and the rooms are extremely comfortable. On sight, the restaurant is world class, and afternoon tea, offered only to hotel guests, should NOT be missed.  Just outside the hotel, the center of Dublin is at your feet.  Dawson and Grafton Streets offer ""High Street"" shopping and a world of food and drink possibilities, only a minute away.  If you can drag yourself out of the bed, which is one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a hotel.  Splurge for a view of the Green if you can arrange it!",5,2014,05,26
207,truly extraordinary,"stayed 4 nights after two weeks driving all around Ireland, and it as pure heaven!   Had one of the refurbished rooms overlooking St. Stephen's Green and it was truly luxurious, patricularly after an excellent two weeks at everything from B&Bs to guest houses to 3 and 4 star hotels, but nothing was even close. (of course it cost a bit more, too.
Was in Dublin 5 years ago and stayed at the Westin, but this is like the hotels our ancestors stayed in - took me a while to figure out that the beautiful box in the closet was to put shoes out for polishing, bur they came back beautifully done.
Staff could not have been more pleasant and willing to help- even to the point of going out of the hotel to get a copy of the international NYT with the Sunday puzzle, much to my embarrassment and gratitude.
Last night dinner at the Saddle Room, where we had had excellent breakfasts, surprised by serving dinner in a room closed off for breakfast, with one of the finest meals I had had in a long time - complete with oysters with a mignionettte sauce which was wonderful. Worth every penny!",5,2014,05,25
207,Traditional Elegance,"We had a wonderful stay at The Shelbourne. It is a grand old hotel, a real throwback to yesteryear. The lobby and restaurants are beautiful and everyone went out of their way to provide great service. Our room was very nice (Deluxe King). The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was smallish but clean and nicely decorated. I noticed a bit of wear and tear when I looked closely, but no real complaints. This is a very pricey hotel though so be prepared. We found the location to be superb and the overall ambience enchanting. A real treat!  Excellent breakfast with made to order entrees.  Lovely stay in beautiful Dublin.",4,2014,05,21
207,Perfect Choice,"The Shelbourne, Dublin was our first stop in Ireland.  We couldn't have made a better choice.  From the moment the top-hatted doorman opened our car door to our last wave goodbye, the service was warm and attentive.  Hotel location was perfect, right across the St. Stephen's Green in the heart of town.  The room was good size and the bed very comfortable.  Breakfast. which had both a buffet section and a la carte menu, was very good.  We did not dine in the hotel restaurant.  As we went out for the evening, the bar and lounge areas were beginning to fill up.  It was a place to see and be seen.  The hotel also has a lot of history which one can browse in a little ""museum"" room off the side of the lobby.  it was a perfect choice for a Dublin visit.",5,2014,05,18
207,PURE ELEGANCE,This is a top of the line hotel.  For Europe the rooms were large and modernized.  The service was great.  Breakfast was included with our stay and there were many items to choose from including made to order eggs and omelets.  I love the top hats on the guys!,5,2014,05,16
207,A piece of luxury in the heart of Dublin,"Myself and my friend arrived from a Cork to spend a night in my home down for her big birthday. I had always wanted to stay at this historic hotel and figured this was the ideal opportunity.
The place was amazing from check in to check out! All staff made my experience 5 star and they couldn't do enough for us, particularly at the front desk. 
It was great to hear the Dublin accent amongst some staff as it made my visit even more authentic.
The luxury is evident throughout and the renovation was extremely sympathetic. The hotel has not lost its soul, phew! I'll be back for sure....................",5,2014,05,16
207,Time Travel,"The Shelbourne Dublin was an outstanding, exquisite experience and reminded me of trips taken years ago when I was a young girl. The service was perfect, the staff exceedingly gracious and attentive to every request, the decor was elegant and the food service whether at breakfast, during high tea or dinner was a joy. The location couldn't have been better. It was very central
and withing walking distance to many spots of interest.",5,2014,05,15
207,Great Service!  Great Location!  Grand Hotel!,"We stayed here for 3 nights.  We arrived very early and our room wasn't ready, which was ok because we rented a car and drove around the countryside for the afternoon.  There was a Europcar rental place in walking distance.  Once we got back, our bags were in our rooms.  We took a nice nap (after traveling from San Diego) and then headed out on the town.  There were plenty of places to eat and shop within walking distance from the Shelbourne.  St. Stephan's Green is also across the street, which is a great area to go running or to take a walk.  

We had breakfast here every morning.  Service was fast and the staff was very polite.  One morning, the only morning we were pressed for time, the kitchen messed up our order somehow and we waited at least 30 minutes for our Shelbourne Benedict.  Other than that, the service at breakfast was great.  We were always welcome by the staff as we walked through the hotel.  

Our rooms were clean and spacious.  They had plus-ins for our (American) electronics, but only 1 or 2, I can't remember, so I had to do my hair at the desk, but that's not a big deal.  The hotel may be old, but everything inside is updated.  Our bathroom was very modern and the room was very clean.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,05,14
207,4 Star at best,"Arrived at hotel at 1 pm to be told room ready at 3 pm, not a problem so came back at 4 to be told still not ready, waited for 20 mins while room being sorted and was asked for credit card details for a second time which girl wrote down on a piece of paper, not permitted under any circumstances!!! First room showed to tiny and no bath, second room not bad only problem being hum coming from office block 3 feet away from window and tiny TV seventeen feet away from bed. Forget about this place it's for Americans who maybe visit Ireland once or twice. Jane was excellent at trying to sort out my stressful and very horrible stay at this substandard hotel. Don't think about the swimming pool, freezing cold with no jacuzzi.",2,2014,05,13
207,Absolute Top Class Hotel,"The Rooms are very very clean and elegant. They offer everything you need. The breakfast is healthy and delicious and the service is stupendous. The SPA is amazing, not too big and crowded. It has a  very young active/sporty SPA atmosphere. This is how you relax after a strenuous day of cycling/jogging and hiking.We would come again anytime! For everything else, the employees always have an open ear. There are unbelievably friendly and attentive staff! what more could one ask for. Highly recommended! We had a great time. In a nutshell, absolute top class service hotel which is quiet and it's central location makes it the perfect holiday.",5,2014,05,13
207,Rooms small surprise in fridge,"We stayed here in January this year. The room was clean, but I found someone else's leftover salad in the fridge and it took 3 hours for someone to come and take it away! Go early for breakfast we went down at about 8:30, by the time we were leaving the queue was a mile long. Also there were a lot of tables free in the residents bar but the staff still made us give the room number and stand outside for a few minutes to be seated.",3,2014,05,12
207,Good hotel but alcohol prices are very very expensive.,"We stayed in this hotel for two nights and really did not enjoy our stay. The carpet in the room was not clean and it was old dirt that had not been treated for a while. The restaurant is the most fantastic comfortable setting you could find but the food was very poor. We thought that €9.60
for a beefeater gin and tonic was a little too expensive along with €6.50 for a pint or bottle of Heineken. There seemed to be a lot of young single ladies hanging out in the bar.
 I am afraid it took 20 minutes to retrieve our car even though we had phoned down for it, and when we returned in two hours to collect our luggage it took half an hour to get same also. Very disappointed with this hotel and I could not recommend it to anybody.",2,2014,05,10
207,"Quick walk to Temple Bar, Amazing Pool",The walk to temple bar is only a couple of minutes. the location is great for shopping. The staff at the hotel was very nice and the breakfast was a feast of champions. The best feature of the hotel is the pool. The indoor pool is huge and there is an attached steam room and sauna. Highly recommend diving in. I'm a little upset that they got rid of the executive lounge at the cost of adding a spa.,5,2014,05,10
207,"Lovely hotel, less than experience","To be perfect honest we are rating this hotel lower because of our room.  The hotel itself is wonderful.  Lovely staff, great bar and restaurants (breakfast is awesome), and beautiful lobby.  It is in a great location and once it is renovated I will recommend it to others.  Our stay was troubled by multiple issues in our room...the power when out completely, the beds are uncomfortable and our toilet stopped working multiple times.  We talked to the staff on three separate occasions to fix our room while we were out exploring.  Finally they admitted that the hotel is to be renovated in the next month and our room was on the list.",3,2014,05,10
207,"Great location, grand hotel","We enjoyed a two night stay in this Victorian hotel, grand in every sense.   Our room was very comfortable, if not exciting, though the grout in the bathroom could do with freshening up.  Breakfast was excellent in variety, though the dining area was not really well suited to self-service, quite a lot of wandering round required, and the waitress muddled up tea and coffee.  It was a shame that our ordered papers did not arrive on either morning - the staff were apologetic.  The bar was pleasant, though again, the waiting staff brought the wrong wine.  These are minor niggles – there were large parties in the hotel both nights so they were very busy.  Best of all was the location, right in the centre of the city, particularly useful as it was raining, as so often in lovely Ireland.",4,2014,05,08
207,6 day stay at the Shelbourne,"We just stayed 6 days at the shelbourne for vacation and it was lovely.  The room was completely updated and gorgeous.  The best part of this hotel is the location, its right across the street from a beautiful park called Stephens Green and a great park to run in.  Two blocks over from Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  The Saddle Room where we had breakfast was great, white table cloth and great service and food!   The workout facility is ok, a normal US like hotel gym, but you get your workout from walking everywhere!  The bar is crowed everynight with locals so it was nice to people watch!",5,2014,05,08
207,"Top accomodations, excellent, friendly service","This is certainly one of the best city hotels we have ever experienced.  The location is extremely central so that one can literally walk to anywhere in central Dublin.  We never took a taxi, and only once the train to Howth (highly recommended for lovely seaside cliff hiking).  Service was extremely efficient and friendly both at reception and in the restaurants.  Requested non-allergic non-feather bedding which turned out to not be a problem although the Front Desk manager was not immediately sure if available.  The food at both breakfast and in the restaurant were top notch.  The French toast must definitely be ordered for breakfast.  Everything served with a smile and genuine (non-superficial) friendliness.  The bar has tons of character in the evening and is something of a Dublin hot-spot (and pick-up joint which was a lot of fun to observe).  The building has lots of old-world charm which has thankfully been preserved in the lobby and restaurant / bar.  Nothing to fault here, I would most definitely recommend, especially for a nice Dublin weekend.",5,2014,05,07
207,nothing wrong at all,"i will be brief  this is a top notch spot rt in the centre of town  ..staff are brilliant facilities likewise  great bar and restaurant nothiing more to add ....we stayed during race week at punchestown and it really was worht the effort in travelling to and from the venue .....this is without doubt a proper 5 star hotel  ,,,,i will definitely be visiting again  and soon   and btw if you book early on price comparison sites  this hotel is not expensive as you would imagine  ...",5,2014,05,07
207,Fabulous Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel on business for the first time and was very impressed with the comfort and quality.
My room was extremely well appointed and comfortable and there were some nice little touches like the complementary bottle of pink lemonade on the desk when I arrived. 
I didn't eat in the hotel but did notice that it was quite expensive. However, this would be justified by the quality of food on offer.
The hotel is situated on St Stephen's Green and is ideally located for most areas of Dublin and is only 25 minutes drive (on a good day) from the airport.
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Dublin for business or pleasure.",5,2014,05,06
207,Effortless elegance and superb service,"We stayed a week in Dublin, and decided to treat ourselves this time to a suite at the Shelbourne. It was everything an old world grand hotel evokes, but seldom delivers. It was roomy, comfortable, with a pleasant view over St Stephen's Green. Every aspect of the service was just perfect. Well worth the the price, and edged out the admittedly superb Merrion as our new family favorite. The staff is just wonderful, anticipating your wants and needs, and delivering flawlessly, promptly and graciously. Little things can be so important, such as a great recommendation from the cheerful concierge, and needing laundry done on a weekend and getting it back perfectly done in just two hours, or ordering birthday flowers and having a stunningly gorgeous arrangement appear (It's not often you get to be the hero to your wife when visiting your family.)

And the food was a wonderful surprise - from perfectly poached eggs in a room service breakfast to perhaps the best seafood dinner I have ever eaten. (Yes, in Dublin!). Every meal was great. 

A wholehearted and enthusiastic ""superb""!",5,2014,05,05
207,Old fashioned charm,"nice hotel, friendly staff, good service and overall a pleasant stay at this hotel, the hotel is convenient for shopping and you could get a room with a nice view to enhance your experience. We didnt get a chance to use the leisure facilities which is my only regret.
The bar drinks can be a little expensive, breakfast was very good and for a small price can be delivered to your room, beds are very comfy and good night sleep is to be had.
Staff can hold onto your luggage after you check out whilst you finish your retail therapy before leaving or if you want to lunch in seafood bar.",5,2014,05,05
207,Sunday Brunch and Jazz Heaven,"There can't be a better place to have brunch and to listen to Jazz on a Sunday in Dublin ...... It is difficult to say what was better, the high quality and choice of food, particularly the seafood, or the amazing jazz lead by Cary and his band.  What a voice! He did a special request (At Last) for a beautiful lady in the audience which was a great finishing touch.  It's got to be on your Must See in Dublin list.....",5,2014,05,04
207,nice break,"Had a lovely weekend with my wife although i live in dublin i,ve always dropped in to the shelbourne for a drink or lunch when ever i get a chance staff are friendly/helpfull and will do their 
best to make your visit very special",5,2014,05,04
207,Amazing place to stay in Dublin!,"I stayed here with my boyfriend last week for a group trip that we won through work. First of all, the hotel was accommodating 140+ people from this trip… SEAMLESSLY! The staff was extremely friendly at all times and so helpful throughout. The hotel itself is gorgeous and has everything you need. The breakfast had great food and was so plentiful. A walk down the block from the hotel takes you to the best shops and pubs. it is across from St. Stephens Green and right near Trinity College. We also took a short ride to the Guinness Factory and The Jameson Distillery since it was so close. I can't say enough great things about the Shelbourne. We would definitely come back to stay in the future!",5,2014,05,03
207,Excellent stay and perfect location,"The hotel is centrally located, so it was a perfect jumping off point. We were lucky to have beautiful weather during our stay in Dublin, so we were able to walk everywhere from the hotel. The staff and accommodations were first class. We asked for a room upgrade upon check-in and the receptionist hooked us up! The room was big, clean and very comfortable. I would also recommend splurging for the breakfast buffet, it was amazingly good and well worth it.",5,2014,05,02
207,A bit of old fashioned charm in a lovely city,"I had a beautiful suite overlooking St. Stephens Green, an upgrade from the room I booked - a lovely surprise. The welcome glass of real lemonade was also a nice touch. Breakfast was nice but not spectacular. For the price, I would expect a better range of a la carte choices.",5,2014,05,02
207,Great Hotel,"Beautiful Hotel ,Superb Service , Lovely rooms
Spent 2 nights at the Shelbourne, 1st time in Dublin when asking a business colleague where to stay he recommended the Shelbourne ,what a great recommendation.
The Hotel is old world luxury yet with every modern convenience .
From arrival to  checkout  the staff were excellent . 
Rooms are luxurious ,beds great and the room amenities first class .
At the end of a business trip the Shelbourne capped of the Visit to Ireland . 
One of the best Hotels I have stayed in.",5,2014,05,02
207,Impeccable hotel! Marvelous Location!,"It truly is a lovely, historic hotel that faces St Stevens Green ---which is just a wonderful city park. The Irish Constitution was written here and it is truly wonderful that Marriott renovated this old beauty. We had and amazing breakfast buffet included in our package. Fresh fruits. cheese, eggs, hash browns, breads and more! The staff here is very friendly and eager to please. The room we had was very spacious and my only suggestion would be to offer up a more comfortable chair. The one we had was decorative but not conducive for settling into with a cup of tea. The hotel centrally located near museums and the Liffey River walk is ten minute walk away. Grafton Street and Temple Bar I are also an easy 5-10 minute walk. Note the four Egyptian statues out front if the hotel!",5,2014,04,30
207,Jazz Brunch - what a treat!,"We visited The Shelbourne for brunch in the No 27 Bar on 27 April 2014 and have to say it was the highlight of my birthday weekend in Dublin.  

We were made to feel very welcome on arrival despite being slightly early and were invited to take coffee whist we waited.  The Shelbourne is a glorious hotel and all of the staff were very helpful, polite and attentive.

The brunch event is obviously very popular and a queue had already formed by the time we moved on from coffee but we were shown to a well appointed, comfortable table.  An interestingly varied menu for both food and drinks left us with plenty to contemplate with our final choices being delicious.

However, the star of the show was Cary Posavitz who entertained us all for 3 hours together with his band, The Players.  Whilst other guests came and went, we stayed for the entire 3 hours so entertained where we by Cary's beautiful voice, interpretation of the jazz classics and the fantastic accompaniment.  As a birthday treat, Cary sang my favourite, 'At Last' and I was mesmerised.  

The staff also presented me with birthday macarons which was a lovely surprise.

If you're in Dublin, Sunday brunch here is a must.",5,2014,04,29
207,Historic hotel with all mod cons in a great location,"This was our second stay at the Shelbourne and it doesn't disappoint. A beautifully maintained historic building which reeks of class and luxury. The location on St Stephen's Green is superb, you can cross the road to walk in the serenity of the park, walk to the end of the road and you reach the main shopping drag and it's just a five minute walk to Trinity College and the riverside.
The room was beautifully appointed and the bathroom was spacious (except for the bath which is wide but short!). Staff were all very helpful, from reception (lemonade was a lovely touch and very refreshing) to concierge to waiting staff. nothing was too much trouble. We were over to watch a GAA football match so were dressed accordingly but the staff didn't turn a hair. What was disappointing was that the Horseshoe bar was closed (it was a Sunday) which is one of our favourite hotel bars. The other bars are more formal and less cosy.
Drinks were fairly priced for a venue like this (definitely not cheap!) but food was very expensive.  Our booking did not include breakfast and it was an extortionate 39 Euros per person so we passed on that and went 50 yards down the road to an artisan café called Hatch and Sons which did a lovely breakfast with orange juice for 11 euros each which we would recommend.
If you can book a package with breakfast it would be well worth doing so. This is a 5 star hotel with 5 star service but the food is at 5 star prices!  Having said that it is really worth paying for the rooms and ambiance. We love it and will be back again.",5,2014,04,28
207,Superb hotel in city centre,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Shelbourne hotel in Dublin and what a treat it was. The service is outstanding, each member of staff being professional and polite. The rooms are beautifully appointed with soft colours ensuring a relaxing environment. The bathroom is a little small with the shower intergrated into the bath. The spa was wonderful, with a beautiful relaxation room overlooking St Stephens Green. We enjoyed the pool faciities also. There is a great variety of places within the hotel to relax and have a drink. The Lord Mayors lounge serves a great supper and is a really nice experience. Breakfast was excellent with wonderful choice, even the porridge is available with milk or water. A truly enjoyable experience. We will certainly return to this great landmark hotel and would have no hesitation in recommending it.",5,2014,04,26
207,Lovely Hotel in the city centre,"Really beautiful and historic hotel in the city centre. Check in and out was fast and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The pool is a lovely oasis in the city centre and was very quiet and relaxing. We enjoyed a couples massage in the spa, I would totally recommend the spa as it was so relaxing and a great end to our stay. The room itself was pretty small but it had everything we needed.It felt very small as myself and my husband were getting ready to attend a wedding and we both kept getting in each others way. We stayed in a standard double room which over looked a court yard area. Breakfast was included and had something for everyone!",5,2014,04,26
207,Afternoon tea disappointment,"We booked this for a special lady to mark her 70th.  The room was elegant and beautiful. The girl looking after us was very inexperienced and it made us nervous. She handled our cups without using the handle etc. She had as much grace as shrek!  My tea was cold, thought it was too much milk, poured more but still cold, my two companions sent their coffee back for same reason. Disappointing all round. Lady playing the piano was a nice touch. Then to depart they gave us a box in a bag with unused scones/desserts. When we got home they had all mixed together. Very annoying. It's the little things that make a place stand out. This lacked the finesse of a 5 star hotel. Would recommend westbury for a better afternoon tea experience. ",2,2014,04,26
207,A gem in city centre,"Stayed in Shelbourne recently for my granddaughters 16th birthday, from the moment we arrived it was a first class experience. Check in was quick and efficient while still being friendly. The glass of homemade lemonade was a nice touch? the bar staff  were excellent as was the food. the rooms were bright and spacious with fantastic views of stephen's green? Breakfast was all you would expect of a Marriott, again served by friendly efficient staff. my only regret is that we didn't have time to use the leisure facilities...next time hopefully. the bathroom was huge and had everything including separate shower and bath tub. Beds very comfortable. Overall a great experience.",5,2014,04,25
207,Consistently good ,Stayed at the Shelbourne for the third time in March and it was a great experience. The Oyster Bar is superb the Lounge relaxing with great service and the Saddle Room excellent fare (albeit the door attendants a little unfriendly). The Spa was very restful although the massages need to be firmer. Overall a good place for a weary traveller. ,4,2014,04,24
207,Nice hotel and great location,Everything a tourist could want within the hotel or walking distance.  It's in a safe area and the staff was helpful and professional.  It's no cheap but so worth it if you want a nice place to stay.  This was a girls weekend and the spa was nice as well.,5,2014,04,23
207,Great Location,Really nice restaurant and bar.  Room was great with comfy bed.  Room service was really efficient.  Location is excellent for wandering the city.  Staff was very helpful.  Great place to stay and to visit.,4,2014,04,23
207,Great Location!!,great location within 5-10 minutes of many attractions or travel to the attractions made this a great part of the Shelbourne. St. Stephens Green was soooo beautiful with a sunny day and flowers blooming. The staff were friendly. The interiors are being updated as we speak in the guest rooms. Complimentary buffet breakfast was given to us- not sure if this is because we are Marriott Rewards or for all guests. The hotel has a museum that mentions the hotels place in history.,4,2014,04,23
207,Philip and Georgina's trips,"heavy day shopping? Still a couple of notes still in the wallet or purse? Take yourself off to the bar at the Shelbourne and order a drink at the corner bar. Blink as the bill arrives and then enjoy looking at Dublin's finest as they unwind after a hard day. Real money here, folks, and don't you soon know it - take your time, sip your drink (you won't be able to afford another) and take in the craic.",5,2014,04,23
207,Weekend break to relax,"Stayed for 3 nights at the Shelbourne. Excellent hotel. Great location, really great hotel design and facilities. Staff very helpful. Definitely 5 start. A bit pricey so worth noting but worth it.
No 27 bar is great and very open , bright. If staying some great bars on Dawson street if not into the standard more hassle of temple bar area. Try out Cafe en Seine. Hotel directly opposite St Stephens Green park.Worth booking the breakfast as part of booking as very expensive otherwise. Hop on/Hop off buses also just across the street.",5,2014,04,21
207,Great location with high attention to detail,"I did a ton of research before booking this hotel and was so impressed with how true many of these reviews turned out to be. This hotel is worth the price if you are looking for a bit of luxury during your stay. We were able to check in early and found the concierge to be very helpful with booking tours (we didn't book anything before arriving). If your room is not ready earlier, you can use the spa for free to shower. If you are a gold member with Marriott, you will enjoy free breakfast during your stay (€29 otherwise). If you can get a package that includes breakfast, it is well worth it. The hotel is right across a beautiful park and a 10 minute walk from the temple bar area. Also, tons of great restaurants and shopping within 2 blocks. We decided to take air coach to and from the airport which drops/picks up right by the hotel for €7 each way.",4,2014,04,21
207,Fabulous hospitality,"What I enjoyed the most was the can-do attitude of the entire staff.  They were amenable to any request and happy to assist.  I found this to be true of the Irish people in general but when paired with a great location and lovely, comfortable rooms it was just the touch of old world charm to make a quick trip into a relaxing holiday",5,2014,04,20
207,Fabulous hotel - wish I had more time to enjoy it!,"The hotel is located in the best location, was so beautiful and the room had great amenities.  We were on vacation from the States, and weren't in the hotel much, but loved every second we were there. The guest room and bath were both spacious (we had a quad for a family of four). The bed was so comfortable, and in particular, the pillows were amazing (where can I purchase these??).  I wish we had brought work out clothes because the gym and the pool were really nice!  The breakfast buffet was also delicious!",5,2014,04,20
207,Pros and cons,"We stayed for one night at the end of our one week Ireland trip. We visited Ireland last year as well and spent more time in Dublin, but since we were flying out of Dublin, we needed one day in the city. We enjoyed the cocktails in the lounge as well as the helpful and friendly valet staff. Also, the room was very clean. I know it's an old hotel, so the wear and tear I noted was to be expected. What we did not enjoy was the lack of knowledge from the staff regarding easy questions about tolls to the Dublin airport from the hotel and where to eat a basic meal (We weren't looking for anything fancy). Also, we had to leave very early and the front desk staff seemed disorganized at that hour.
Other than that, the hotel's character and charm were redeeming and I can see why many would stay here.",3,2014,04,20
207,High expectations not honored,"The Shelbourne is a luxurious hotel with an exceptional location.

Being a 5-star hotel my husband and I had very high expectations to our 2-nights-stay in Dublin. They were honored in regards to location, servicelevel - the staff did everything and more so that we would have a great stay - food (restaurant and afternoon tea) and spa.

Unfortunately our room didn't meet our expectations at all. 
The room (560) was worn - paint peeling off the bathroom door, small flush in toilet wasn't working and the curtain had large stains on it.
We decided to complain to the concierge downstairs (when we book a 5-star hotel we expect everything to be absolutely perfect) and unfortunately he couldn't help us to another room the first night. 
The next day we were transferred to room 652 - a perfect room that we only wish we'd had from the beginning.

Considering the trouble we had switching rooms during our stay (pack and unpack our lugage and not having a room to stay in until 3 pm) we were surprised to find that we were fully charged of the room(s). 

Despite the trouble with the room we had a lovely stay at the Shelbourne - our experience just wasn't worthy of a 5-star review (which was what we paid for and expected!)",3,2014,04,17
207,City Centre -Heart of the Action,"This iconic Hotel is in the heat of the action in Dublin. You are within walking distance from most everything and this is ""the place to be"" for local business people who meet for lunch and in droves on Friday night in the two bars. The rooms are spacious and the beds super comfortable. .  Dennis O'Brien, the concierge really went the extra mile to give us advice and arrange transportation when we needed it. The whole staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy. The breakfast buffet is top notch.  If you want to be where the action is in Dublin at a 5 star Hotel, this is the place for you!",5,2014,04,17
207,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"My sister (who lives in Canada) and I met in Dublin to celebrate her special birthday. We didn't stay at the hotel but I pre-booked Afternoon Tea for 6 of us. It was the Best afternoon tea I have ever had (and that includes hotels in London famous for this). 
The food was brilliant. We didn't need dinner that night! The service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Thank you so much.",5,2014,04,15
207,Afternoon Tea with the Ladies,"I am a big fan of the Shelbourne so when we booked Afternoon Tea I was very excited.  The room itself is really nice and very cosy.   I could have listened to the lady playing the piano all day, she was fantastic.    Our waitress semmed quite nervous, perhaps it was her first day, sticking her hands inside the lovely little cups just isn't part of the afternoon tea experience.  The tea & coffee was. clearing away some of the plates when others were still eating.  The sandwiches/scones and pastries were nice.  The choc moose in particular really beautiful.  The lady gave us a take away box, but placed everything in the same box so they were a little difficult to eat later as everything had spilled.  Overall a little disappointed .",4,2014,04,15
207,Kate lebarron,"Our stay at the shelbourne was the most wonderful stay. Never thought there cod be such a beautiful hotel. Room service twice a day, very clean, and the staff were always very pleasant. The Shelbourne was the biggest reason our stay in doublin was so successful.  Thanks everyone",5,2014,04,14
207,Beautiful and luxurious,"Impeccable service from the moment we stepped out of the taxi. Offered us drinks at the reception while we checked in, carried our bags at any chance, turned down the beds each night with fresh water set out...overall the service was incredible. The rooms were luxurious and the bed extremely comfortable. Enjoyed our complimentary hot breakfast. This is a beautiful, very upscale hotel in a great location. Honestly, I can be critical of hotels but I cant find any negative critique to give of this one. Thank you for a lovely stay - I definitely recommend this one to everyone!",5,2014,04,13
207,Truly a luxury hotel,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful and luxurious the Shelbourne is. We were traveling with a group of 6 and had three rooms. Each one was as luxurious as the other. While this is what I would classify as an old hotel, you would never guess it's age by how much care and upkeep the hotel staff obviously lovingly provides to this hotel. The hotel is exceeded my expectations, which were already high based on recommendations and reviews. 

The hotel is in an excellent location. Very easy for tourists to get around. The staff were very helpful with recommendations and suggestions. 

I would not hesitate to stay here again and look forward to my next Dublin visit!",5,2014,04,12
207,"Good, not great.","My hubby and I stayed here for two nights and although a lovely, old fashioned hotel in a great location, it lacked....something.

Our room was large, bed was massive but with a very soft mattress, which caused ny hubby to get backache.  There was no full-length mirror in the room, not even mounted on the internal cupboard doors.  The bath mat was adequate, not thick and luxurious like you'd expect for a five-star hotel.  Bath towels were great though.

At breakfast in the Saddle Room, the service was distinctly average. We asked for toast and on both mornings, they didn't bring us any butter with it! There were no waiters in sight so my hubby had to get up from the table and look for someone.  It may be a small matter but it's the details that make an okay hotel stay into a fantastic one.  One of the windows in the dining room was also not closed properly and when we asked one of the service staff to close it, he had no idea how the windows worked!

There is also a lack of space for guests to wait e.g. Once they had checked out of the room and before getting a taxi to the airport.  You just get the feeling that they don't want you to hang around.

However, the reception staff were helpful and efficient and they served up yummy freshly made lemonade.

Overall, it was alright.  Just not as good as I expected.",3,2014,04,12
207,Another lovely visit to the Shelbourne!,"Had a one night stay at Christmas with family.   Love everything about this hotel, the location, the lovely room, the friendly staff and, of course, the amazing breakfast!  Hope I get to stay in 2014!! My favourite hotel in Dublin!!",5,2014,04,11
207,perfect location in the heart of Dublin,"A lovely older hotel in the heart of Dublin.  totally a 5 star experience.
the lounge/pub in the front of the hotel is the place to be.
even in the busiest of times the servers were great. I honestly don't know how they did it.
the entire staff should be commended on their professionalism. they were just wonderful at every turn. 
We were lucky enough to have a private dinner party in the constitution room.  this was just fabulous.  If your looking for a great family reunion with a special flare be sure to check out this option.
the rooms were small but this is because this is an old hotel that has been refurbished. but as small as the room was the bathroom made up  for it!
Even if you don't stay here be sure to stop by - just a lovely hotel!",5,2014,04,10
207,Great service,"Stayed for two nights at the weekend. Ashleigh who helped with our booking was very helpful. Check in was very quick with lemonade and biscuits. Room (double deluxe) was fine, although it is a bit of a maze to get to the rooms. Only downside was an air-conditioning unit from the adjacent offices hummed all night. 

Breakfast was fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We ate in The Saddle Room on the Saturday night. Our waiter David was very helpful as we had to leave half-way through the meal to get to the theatre on time, so our dessert was served when we got back. 

I used the swimming pool - very nice and the spa staff were very helpful. 

Friends who were staying with us found their room (heritage room) to be very noisy as it was above a function room and there was music playing until 1am.",4,2014,04,10
207,Dublin for Two,This was my first visit to Dublin with my girlfriend. We had a wonderful time & our experience was made all the more enjoyable by the amazing staff at The Shelbourne. A massive thank you to all of you.,5,2014,04,09
207,Absolutely Fantastic - I did not want to leave!,"Classy, luxurious, glamorous, historical, in the best location anywhere in Dublin, and with all the finishing touches; I loved this place!  Great bed, large bathroom with the sound from your TV piped in - so you could listen to the news or music  while you were bathing or getting ready.  Large windows for natural lighting and an airy feel.  From the ""welcome to our hotel"" letter, to the robes and slippers, all the finishing touches were there.  I used the spa both days of my stay and it was delightful!  The bar area appears to be frequented by guests and locals alike, so it has a real local and fun feel to it.  Drinks and food are very good in the bar, and I had lunch there twice.  Breakfast in the main restaurant was superb with wonderful service.  I was very disappointed in the dinner however (both service and food quality), and would recommend going outside the hotel for that meal.  The park across the street should not be missed if you are staying here - it is beautiful and well laid out.  Local transportation is always readily available from the hotel.  I have stayed in two other hotels in other parts of Dublin and this, by far, is top of the line.",5,2014,04,08
207,Faulty Towers,"My Husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding and the next night also. It was our favourite hotel for drinks and food for many years and we had always wanted to stay, so what better occassion than our wedding night? We booked on-line months in advance and called into the hotel reception 2 days prior to our wedding to ensure we could check in very late on the wedding night after our reception which was held elsewhere. We told them it would be after 3 a.m. when we would arrive and that we would arrange for my husband's sister to leave our bags in earlier in the day before the wedding and do the check-in for us. We were assured that all this was fine and we really looked forward to our weekend in The Shelbourne. Unfortunately what followed let the whole experience down. We arrived back to the Hotel around 4 a.m. and went to reception to get our key. The Receptionist on duty seemed to have no prior knowledge of our booking and could not locate our names. Exhausted, we were forced to stand at reception in our wedding attire for a good 20 minutes before he finally sorted things out and gave us our key! When we got into our room, we noticed clothing and personal items scattered around the room. My Husband walked into the bedroom to find someone in bed. He had given us the wrong key! We immediately went back down to reception. Yet again the receptionist was bewildered and had to look up our booking again. After another wait, he realized his error and gave us our proper key to our room on a different floor! How this mess could happen in a 5 star hotel with such a good reputation is beyond me! I wrote a letter to the manager expressing our disappointment with the service but never heard anything back from him. Would not recommend this hotel as a result.",3,2014,04,08
207,The best hotel in the world,I have travelled the world and this is still one of my favourite hotels. The beds are unbelievably comfortable. The staff goes the extra distance to ensure that you feel welcome. Great location that makes it easy to walk anywhere you want to go in Dublin. Lots of umbrellas available to be borrowed.,5,2014,04,07
207,Dissapointed.: (,"We have heard so many good things about this place, but for us it was very disappointing. The Service was very poor. We were supposed to receive cheese and wine in the room as we  arrived but that did not happen till much later . 
Also, they did not have an outlet for the blowdrier in the bathroom and not even the one in the room by the mirror.
Lastly I am appalled by the way we were treated by one of the concierges. His job is to help his guests to find places to see and book the restaurant. When we asked him to recommend a good place to eat for dinner , he said that nothing was available in the whole city of Dublin .  WTH!?  We called the restaurant and were able to make reservations  with no problem, but wasted our international minutes. That guy brings this hotel's reputation down tremendously!  Just awful. By the way, I Hope that someone is reading these reviews. The staff that was so rude to us worked the concierge desk on  Saturday night around 7 PM 4/5. Hope he gets fired!",2,2014,04,07
207,Most beautiful hotel in Dublin,"This is a fantastic 5 star hotel located in the centre of Dublin City.
I've stayed her on numerous occasions and the service is just outstanding. I loved it so much my now wife and I chose it as our wedding venue. It was a dream wedding.

In the bar the cocktails are the best. If you are in Dublin on a Sunday make sure you don't miss the afternoon Jazz session.
The saddle room has the most beautiful food wine and service to match at a very reasonable price.
The rooms are out of this world, decorated in an elegant Georgian style with the most comfortable beds in the world. Try to get a room overlooking St. Stephen's Green park if you can. It will be well worth the view.",5,2014,04,06
207,Great location,We stayed here for one night in March and as great as the location and staff were the room was the smallest of all of the places that we stayed during our trip.  The bathroom was absolutely tiny.  You also don’t get some of the amenities that you do at one of the other 5* hotels in the area like bed turndown w/a chocolate on your pillow.  All in all it was a bit of a disappointment.,3,2014,04,05
207,Łove this hotel!,"This is one of my favourite places to stay in Dublin. The beautiful building, great location and overall experience made my stay such a pleasure. The reception staff are pleasant and professional as are the waiting staff we were served by. Our room was very clean and the bed so comfy, lots of lovely little touches as well. Breakfast in the Saddle Room  was fab with a great choice, my husband had the Fillet Steak Eggs Benedict which he loved. The Horseshoe bar is a lively place, great for pre dinner drink or to pop into at lunch time. Will definitely return",5,2014,04,04
207,Great Stay,"What a beautiful hotel, service amazing and atmosphere divine, really looking forward to staying again. One thing unfortunately we had problems with was the air conditioning which was too noisy when switched on and so had to open the window during the night to let in air.  However, everything else outweighed this minor issue.
      ",5,2014,04,04
207,only place to stay,"This may be in the Marriott family but the Shelbourne is the only way to experience Dublin. The location is outstanding and the staff is absolutely top of hill. Love the breakfast, even the food is elegantly prepared. They couldn't stop talking about America, it was so nice to be appreciated.",5,2014,03,31
207,Nice hotel in a great location,"The general atmosphere is this hotel is stately elegance.  The entrance lobby is shouldered by three restaurant choices, and all have good food.  The rooms are on the small side, but what you would expect in an older, centrally located, building.  The best part of this hotel is the location.  All of the main sites in Dublin are well within walking distance. I would stay here again. ",5,2014,03,31
207,Excellent place to stay!!!,"We had a wonderful stay for a week at the Shelbourne Dublin.  The service was amazing and the rooms were a little small compared to US standards, but they were very posh and comfortable.  The lobby area was beautiful. The gym and pool were really nice too.  The location is very convenient.  The concierge was very helpful and room service was awesome.  I really enjoyed the breakfast buffet.  I can't find a thing to say that would have made our stay better!!",5,2014,03,30
207,Fred Karno's Army still lives on!,"About an hour before we checked out of the Shelbourne we received an e-mail asking us to review it. There weren't hours enough left in the day. Now, a week later, I have time for - to paraphrase Wordsworth - frustration recollected in tranquility.
After an early start and some tiring travelling we arrived at the hotel at check-in time - 3pm. But our room wasn't ready, nor would it be for a while. So we kicked our heels for an hour and a half, after which time - you've guessed it - the room still wasn't available. So we lurked. The receptionist made some mention of a room upgrade; to be honest, I don't know whether or not she gave us one but she also asked if there was anything which might take the sting out of our inconvenience once we were finally in the room. We suggested a cold bottle of dry white wine might help. After we'd been in the room for a while ( very nice,  rubbish view) a waiter arrived with........a small bottle of lemonade and a bar of chocolate. Eventually our wine came and indeed the (empty) bottle and the cooler were still in the room 2 days later. Some while later we were reunited with our luggage. Too tired to go out for dinner, we chose to eat in the hotel and in fact had asked when we booked the room if we should book for dinner - no need, we were told. In the restaurant, we were given menus by a waitress and seated temporarily in the Oyster Bar while she went in search of a table for us - which she said would take 2 seconds. She also warned us that there were no oysters available that night. About 15 minutes later, hungry and losing the will to live, we gave up on her and decamped to the bar, where the waitress confirmed that 'of course' oysters were to be had! Er?
The following evening we gave up on the hotel and went in search of dinner elsewhere in the city. But thought, in our innocence, that it would be pleasant to have a drink in the hotel bar first. No danger of that. 2 bars were absolutely heaving with happy Friday night party-goers - presumably non-resident,  and there was not a seat or a quiet corner to be had. I wish them joy with their merry-making but not to the exclusion of people who have paid serious money to avail themselves of the hotel facilities. 
What was really efficient however was the very early delivery of our bill to the room the next morning. Cleverly it charged us for the 2 nights' accommodation for which we had pre-paid. 'Oh, you shouldn't have seen that' was the receptionist's response when we pointed it out. Too right we shouldn't. 
So we bade farewell to the Shelbourne; the classic iconic hotel which was once a byword for all that was brilliant in the hotel world. A positive word: the staff were uniformly pleasant and friendly. The food - when we got it - was excellent. The room and its facilities were terrific. But nul points for smooth running and streamlined service. Comparisons with Fawlty Towers are probably a cliche in review territory, but cliches only become so because they are true. And this wasn't far off. Would we spend that sort of money to go there again? Probably not. And, in a way, that saddens me. ",3,2014,03,30
207,My second review in Ireland,"This is a gem, proper five star without the pretentious bull.. Rooms are a little small but nothing to worry about for city location. The Bar is fantastic, great service and prices are very reasonable considering!  Check in was impeccable, so professional but the highlight for me was breakfast. It was surperb! The best I've ever had.",5,2014,03,30
207,Perfect ,"Couldn't have stayed at a better hotel. Everything was absolutely perfect; the staff, breakfast, room and location. I would certainly look to stay here again. 

The experience is one of being treated like a truly valued customer by all aspects of the hotel. ",5,2014,03,29
207,"Wonderful Location, Staff and Experience","Although I have no other frame of reference, I can't imagine a better place to stay in Dublin.  The location was perfect, right by St. Stephens Green and minutes to walk everywhere.  As we pulled in, a nice in a top hat took our bags and escorted us inside.  The lobby was beautiful and all staff were EXTREMELY helpful.  We ate breakfast here twice and it was AMAZING...delicious food, fresh juices, etc.  Our room was clean and comfortable.  Oh, and the bar is fantastic!!!  So beautiful and fancy, yet the staff was very nice.  Having wine in the bar at the end of the night was perfect.  I really can't imagine a better place to stay in Dublin or elsewhere.",5,2014,03,26
207,Just what the Doctor ordered !,"I have stayed in this hotel twice in the past 4 months & I have enjoyed every minute.  From the minute we stepped out of the taxi at the front door we felt we were in a very special place.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are a good size and very clean.  The food was as you would expect - excellent !!  Always plenty of people around - a great buzz around the hotel and yet you know you were safe.  The leisure facilities are new, clean and relaxing - right in the centre of the city, its hard to believe there could be a place so relaxing.  Can't wait to return :)",5,2014,03,25
207,Beautiful Hotel,We stayed for the weekend and had a double room. Little bit disappointed at the size of room and bathroom and also the burn mark on side table. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was first class.,4,2014,03,25
207,The Shelbourne Experience,"We stayed for a night in The Shelbourne Hotel recently and I absolutely loved our time spent in the hotel from beginning to end. From the minute you arrive at the hotel, the staff take such good care of you. Nothing is too much bother. They are enthusiastic and informative. The bedroom was beautiful, spacious and comfortable.Toiletries available were good quality. Food was beautiful. Great selection available for the breakfast buffet. The pool was a good size, especially for a city centre hotel. There is no jacuzzi which I was a bit disappointed about. Overall a great stay and I would definitely like to return.",5,2014,03,25
207,Business Meeting and Dinner,"I recently hosted a business review meeting followed by dinner in the Shelbourne Hotel for approximately 20 people.  The meeting room was located over looking St. Stephen's Green and was ideal for what was a fairly lengthy meeting.  Midway through the meeting we decided to change the room layout and found the staff on hand most helpful in this regard.

I hosted our dinner in the Constitution Room where we were given a short history of the importance of that particular room.  The meal and the service were superb.  I received numerous compliments from our guests afterwards.  Well done Shelbourne Team.",5,2014,03,24
207,Really first class experience,"Stayed here in January, as we were going to a concert around the corner at the NCH. Staff were most welcoming and enthusiastic right from the start. Had a really nice Heritage room. We dined before going to the concert. The food was first class - as was the breakfast the following morning. Really good spacious bathroom. We will return!",5,2014,03,24
207,Recent 2 day stay,"The hotel was exquisite, well located with especially good bar and an excellent drink which won awards: The No 27 - a refreshing bourbon/orange drink.
Ii particularly appreciate the concierge service, especially Paul Burke, who was immensely helpful and concerned about our change in flight plans. My 8 friends hope to return within the year.",5,2014,03,22
207,Champagne Christmas Afternoon Tea - A real treat,"I returned here with my family as a pre-Christmas treat, as usual the Shelbourne gave us a wonderful experience. The Champagne Afternoon tea was a delight. The food was plentiful and very nice. The staff were welcoming and attentive as always. I would recommend that everyone should have afternoon tea in the Shelbourne once in their lifetime. I think this will become an annual Christmas tradition in my house!",5,2014,03,22
207,Lovely hotel. Friendly staff.,We stayed here for three nights for my wife's birthday. The reception staff were very nice and made you feel relaxed from the moment we arrived. The first night I didn't sleep due to a very uncomfortable bed so mentioned it to reception on our way to breakfast. They said it would be sorted. It still wasn't that evening so had to mention it again. This time we got moved to another room which had a comfy bed. Having to repack and unpack was annoying but what can you do. The breakfast was lovely with great choice. We ate lunch in the bar which was good but didn't eat in the restaurant. The menu looked good and was well priced. Overall it is a nice hotel in a great location. Would recommend staying here. ,4,2014,03,20
207,Nice hotel but concierge not very good,"Went there for 3 days with my husband. Nice welcoming at the reception. The lady (dont remember her name) who checked us in was very friendly and helpful. She suggested a dinner at the hotel and we were very glad that we took her advice. She made the reservations for that same day! The dinner at the hotel was delicious!!!
The concierge helped us indicating how to get to the Guinness Brewery, but not very friendly. And when we wanted a suggestion for a restaurant (for dinner) he suggested one called Gallagers. I asked if he could make us reservations since it was already 9pm but he said it wasn't necessary. When we got to the restaurant the kitchen was closed!!!
Also, the shower is not very good. The water comes out in so many directions it takes forever to rinse ones hair. 
Breakfast is ok. The decoration of the entire hotel is very very beautiful, but the dining room is very long. One day we sat in a table that was way too far from the buffet. Also, the service during breakfast is not as good as the service during dinner. I had to wait for almost 10 min to get sugar and sweeteners AFTER coffee was poured into my cup. 
",4,2014,03,20
207,Very nice hotel with very good service in a great location!,"We stayed here for three nights while we were in the city for the ""Country To Country"" concert featuring Zac Brown Band.  This hotel is gorgeous!  The dining rooms/bars were plush and comfortable and had a very classy feel to them.  The staff in the dining/drinking areas were great; they were friendly and attentive, very professional, and were very accommodating to all of our special requests.  Our room was very nice and very clean.  The bathroom is clean and had great water pressure (something few hotels seem to have).  The soaps smelled soooo good!  The website said the room was equipped with a refrigerator but it was actually a mini-bar, so we had to keep our milk (for tea) in an ice bucket.  The bed was comfortable but the pillows were horrible.  The pool/fitness center was clean and well maintained and attended with staff at all times.  I must say, though, that the hours were very limited-opening late and closing early.  Consequently, we used these facilities only once during our stay so I felt a bit cheated.  Also, if I may recommend, Please, management of the Shelbourne, post that clothing is required while in the sauna/steamroom! Clothes are a good thing!   Back to positive things:  We were greeted at the door and assisted by the doorman.  Checkin was quick and easy with four lovely young women waiting on us and offering fresh lemonade and delicious cookies during the process.  Staff assisted us with our luggage all the way to our room and oriented us to the functions of our guestroom.  We used the services of the concierge desk several times with great success.  The location of this hotel is across the street from the opening of St. Stephen's Green, which is a lovely (and safe) place for a romantic stroll (or morning run, or place to air out the children, etc.).  The flowers were in bloom on our relatively warm but very breezy St Patrick's Day Weekend stay!  Just down the road was the fantastic shopping area ""Grafton Street"", and Trinity College, and Temple Bar.  We never had any trouble finding something to do or somewhere to go.  We burned off many Guinness calories walking just about everywhere.  But we also used the Taxis, which are numerous, and the buses, even more numerous.  I love Dublin; it is a great city with important and interesting history, beautiful art, delicious food, phenomenal Guinness and Jameson, fun pubs, and lovely people!  I look forward to my next visit to Dublin and I hope I get the chance to stay at the Shelbourne Dublin again!  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking an elegant, relaxing, and pampered experience.",5,2014,03,18
207,Lovely staff and great food in beautiful surroundings!,"We had a marvellous stay in this lovely hotel for St Patricks weekend. We had supper (3 courses)in the ""supper club"" on sun night, good value for this class of hotel (€25 -€30 for adults, €8.95 for kids) and very good food.  
The swimming pool was very safe 1.2m deep all over and not at all busy while we were there. The changing rooms were super, with shampoos, body lotion, deodorant, hairspray etc provided.
Our room was in the heritage part of the hotel and had great views over St. Stephens Green. Breakfast was an experience in itself!
We finished off our trip with afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors Lounge at the front, an experience not to be missed.  at €32.95 a head it was worth every penny and they even do a kids afternoon tea for €19.95 which had a coke float! and nutella sandwiches among other things like a cheese sandwich and ham sandwich. A real special treat for a child.  The location was great too as its just beside grafton st. area and within walking distance of most places you might want to see. Also the valet parking at an extra €25 was good value considering the rates charged for parking in this part of Dublin.  We never made it to the famous ""horseshoe Bar"" so will have to go back!
An amazing hotel to stay in.",5,2014,03,18

207,"Great hotel, beautiful and great service","Only got to spend one night in this beautiful place, but heard from a couple of taxi drivers that it was ""the best hotel in Dublin"" 
Great service from the minute we got out of the taxi, the butler/doorman came and greeted us, helped with our luggage and directed us to the front desk, we had reserved two rooms and one was ready even at 10am,  which was perfect for us to put our luggage away, clean up a little, and head to town…
We opted for ordering breakfast in the room the next morning, tray came with everything so fresh and delicious, and a great presentation.
Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.",5,2014,03,17
207,Love the attention at this hotel,"We stayed at the shelbourne for our third time, in February.  First of all, the location is perfect.  It's easy to go on foot or take taxis to anywhere close by.   The service provided by the staff at both the check-in counter and at the restaurant is friendly and helpful.  Only complaint is that the hotel is so popular with travelers and locals that we sometimes have trouble getting a table in the lounge or bar area. That's an indication of how consistently good the service,food, and location  is at the Shelbourne. The conceriege staff helped us get a dinner reservation for the same night at a nice seafood place.",5,2014,03,16
207,Top Class place,I went here recently for their early bird menu. The service was simply excellent and they attended to our every need and more. Food was delicious I just wish their had of been more of it :) some very snobby women in the table next to us but that is probably expected. Bathrooms were gorgeous. I will definitely be back.,5,2014,03,14
207,Lunch at Saddle room restaurant,"Had a delicious lunch at the above last weekend. Food and service wonderful and was so nice not to be under pressure to move from dining area. Was very impressed that staff noticed one of the party was celebrating a birthday and a delicious dish of petit fours ,with candle and happy birthday greetings, was brought to table with the coffee's. This was such fun and our American visitors were so impressed. We were given a lovely round table which was great so everyone could chat together.
My only issue would be that beef/ steak has a supplement on the menu. This is often the case in other restaurants also and is such a shame. We live in a country that produces beef!

However, well done to the wonderful staff who cater to their guests so well.

207,"Good hotel, fab history","The hotel rooms themselves are pleasant but unspectacular for a hotel costing this much - you'll find better rooms in thethe Fitzwilliam just the other side of the square (or the Four Seasons in Ballsbridge).

However, the lobby area, restaurant and bar ooze class, history and character. It's worth staying here for that.

Location is obviously fantastic - right off Stephen's Green within a couple of minutes to Grafton Street's shops and restaurants. Temple Bar is a short walk away.",4,2014,03,12
207,"Top class hotel, but no wow factor","Stayed here on the night of 8th March's with my wife as a special birthday treat. Understandable that it was the same night as as the Irish rugby game and Beyoncé being in town so the hotel was full. Service was very professional and friendly at check in. Had diner in the saddle room, part of the hotel : very good food and service. Room was only satisfactory unfortunately having a few minor problems. Breakfast was very disappointing. Served very weak coffee at first, though soon replaced with proper coffee only after commenting to staff : should not have too in a hotel of this class. Breakfast was a buffet and food quite poor in comparison to the other many Mar riot hotels that I have stayed In.  In summary not a bad hotel, but came away disappointed that we did not have any wow factor during our stay from the hotel.   d",3,2014,03,09
207,The Divine Shelbourne!,"Stayed one evening at the Shelbourne in Dublin- last night of a weeks vacation in Ireland.
What I found was a luxurious, top of the line hotel with efficient,  friendly service.  We had drinks in the bar and dinner in the Saddle Room- our choices included oysters, fish, and accompanying vegetables - every single thing we ate was delicious and service was perfect.  An expensive hotel
But worth every dime!  We had to leave before breakfast...",5,2014,03,07
207,Great old Dublin Hotel,"Stayed here for a night out on the town to celebrate an occasion.....great service from the moment we pulled up outside, door staff emptied all our luggage and took car off to be parked (min of fuss). Reception staff could not have been nicer, very efficient. We were taken to our room.......great room overlooking the green, some nice touches and they had noted our reason for over-nighting. While we didn't take dinner at the hotel, breakfast was excellent, so much choice. Overall this is a great old world Dublin hotel which hasn't lost any of its charm, its maintaned is top condition giving the feeling of stepping back in time. Attention to detail is perfect and all of the staff could not have been more helpful, friendly and efficient. Whomever heads up the hotels customer services/staff training certainly knows what they are about!",5,2014,03,07
207,Will stay there again,"Great location, beautiful hotel, nice room and bathroom. All the staff were very helpful and kind. The breakfast included deal was worth it and the dining area was classy. Transportation to the hotel from the airport was easy by bus (cheaper than taxi).  Loved it!",5,2014,03,07
207,Great location and nice service,"The Shelbourne is located right in central Dublin, so you can easily get out and about on foot to many of the most popular sights and attractions, which is lovely.

I really appreciated how effective the staff was - they were gracious and attentive, without being overbearing.  The breakfast in the hotel was fine, and the rooms were larger than many in Europe, with comfortable beds and nice baths.

I would definitely come back to this hotel.",4,2014,03,07
207,"Great location, great service, plentiful, tastless food, nice pool","Great location.  Great service (1. although there were no loungers at the pool, the staff let us sleep on mats in the empty exercise room until our room was ready...2. The hostess actually sharpened my eye pencil when it broke).  Plentiful but tasteless food for breakfast ( stick to the smoothies and the croissants.   Long, shallow, clean pool. Unfortunately small inside room with a view of a tiny dark inside courtyard---just windows, no garden---perhaps rooms with a view cost more?. The room was not cleaned because the cleaner came in the late afternoon when we were napping.",4,2014,03,06
207,Superb and luxurious,"I stayed with my husband on a Friday night. On arrival our car was taken and our bags brought in to reception. Our room was not ready (it was 3.30pm) but we were taken to the bar for complimentary drinks. We did nt mind the wait... It was a lovely start... At reception we dealt with the efficient and superb Jane Bridge. She came to let us know our room was ready and to top it all off we had been upgraded to a suite!!
The suite was out of this world. Overlooking Stephens Green, spacious, luxurious ... a dream...
Later we had drinks in No 27 bar and the atmosphere is electric there. 
Breakfast the next morning even though it is a buffet was excellent..
We enjoyed our stay so much we opted to stay another night! This time it was a deluxe room and it was still quite nice. There was a waiting period for breakfast the next morning but our wait in the lounge was lovely with complimentary drinks etc...
We usually stay in another 5 star hotel off Grafton St (!) but next time I think it will be the Shelbourne as we enjoyed our stay so much. 
When we were leaving we were slightly disappointed as we were not even asked how out stay was and the concierge simply plonked our bags in front of us... Should they not be taken to the car...? However the guest relations manager who was outstanding throughout our stay noticed this and he himself brought them out. Very thoughtful but the concierge should have done it..
JD Flynn and Jane Bridge really made our stay.. ",5,2014,03,05
207,As good as we had hoped...,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Shelbourne in January, and thorougly enjoyed the whole experience from start to end.  The location is unbeatable, with easy access to the many shops, pubs and restaurants of central Dublin.  We treated ourselves to dinner on the Saturday night, and the food was also excellent.  The room and toilet were spotlessly clean, the staff were very friendly and, all in all, we can't wait to return.",5,2014,03,04
207,Pure Luxury at The Shelbourne,"Our children bought us this weekend at The Shelbourne as a Christmas present.  We have stayed in The Sherlbourne before and again it didnt disappoint from the minute we arrived until we left.  There was a great atmosphere and lively buzz in No 27 bar on Saturday afternoon.  Our meal in The Saddle Rooms on Saturday night was excellent.  I has scallops which were to die for and then Dover Sole, my husband had prawns to start and then rabbit which was tender and juicy.  We had breakfast in bed on Sunday morning, which was delivered at exactly 10 30am as we requested.  They had a jazz band playing in No 27 on Sunday and we then ate there on Sunday evening.  Again the bar food could not be faulted or the service.  They have a museum in the foyer of the hotel where you can look through their old vistor books and guest lists from years ago, we thought this was a lovely touch.  We would highly recommend The Shelbourne for a special treat.",5,2014,03,04
207,Hotel Location Excellent,"Review of our stay in your hotel on the 29th Dec. 2013
""When we got our rooms"" we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in your hotel; the rooms were lovely, the Christmas atmosphere in the hotel was great and so too was the Restaurant & food at both Dinner and Breakfast. The staff pleasant and helpful especially Grace at Reception.
Prior to day of arrival I had checked with reservations that the confirmation of my 3 rooms booked was correct ; 1 king size Double Room (1 bed), and 2 Twin Rooms (2 rooms with 2 beds in each room).
On day of arrival we checked in at 3pm, but only the Double Room (1 bed) was ready for us to use. We left our mobile phone number at reception to call us when the other 2 rooms were available for us to use. By 5pm we had not received a call so I checked back at Reception, it was then we received the other 2 rooms.

As the Reception is the first point of contact for most guests on checking in, it is off putting when rooms are not ready for guests to occupy and is something the hotel needs to address. 
Arriving at the 3pm check in time, an apology for a wait of an hour delay 4pm may be acceptable, but for over a 2 hour delay it’s not really acceptable. The hotel has a charge for guest late checkout but doesn’t seem to give any recompense for a delay in giving out rooms due at 3pm check in time to guests, especially when it’s of no fault of the arriving guest.
Sent letter to hotel giving feedback in Jan'14 and have yet to receive acknowledgment back from hotel.",5,2014,03,03
207,Perfect,"Perfect hotel overlooking St. Stephens green. 
A very easy and friendly check in.
Smallish room with large bathroom. 
Extremely comfortable bed. 
Great bar for pre dinner drinks - great for people watching!!",5,2014,03,02
207,A lovely hotel centrally located with generally fine service.,"We had the good fortune to stay and dine at the Shelbourne 25/2/2014 & 26/2/2014.  Our party had three different rooms and all were lovely.  The toiletries were first rate, and the bath included a fabulous deep tub if you care to soak (with the provided bath salts) and a separate shower if you didn't. Being able to recharge our phones using US plugs without any adapter was a pleasant surprise. My husband used the gym and was quite impressed with the equipment available.  We dined in The Lord Mayor's Lounge, No 27 and the Saddle Room.  I know, that's a lot of in hotel dining for such a short visit, but the food was fabulous!  The only reason my overall rating was a 4 and not a 5 was because the service we received at the Saddle Room left quite a bit to be desired.  The restaurant was not at all busy.  We were seated in what seemed like a great location, but it was next to an over active heater and the waiter insisted we could not be moved.  We finally convinced him to close the curtains to block some of the blowing air.  He had no clue what was unavailable on the menu until we ordered it, then came back and told us the kitchen was out. As seems to be typical in Ireland, the appetizers and entrees for different people in our party came at different times, even though we all ordered the same number of courses, but the gaps here were particularly long.  Our waiter would begin to clear some plates when we were all done with a course and then disappear for 10 or 20 minutes.  At the end of the evening we finally gave up on our coffee and tea 20 minutes after finishing our dessert by flagging down another server.  Our waiter returned and protested that he was waiting for us to finish our dessert (though at the the table adjacent to us he had served the drinks and desserts simultaneously).  All that said, I would stay here again in a heartbeat!  The rest of the staff was fabulous and it was a pleasure to be a guest of the Shelbourne.",4,2014,03,01
207,Fifth stay and we'll be back another day,"We booked months in advance and took advantage of The Shelbourne's breakfast-included rate. The breakfasts were superb and satisfying. Their dining room is elegant and rich. Our buttercup room was facing the side street but the double paned windows kept the noise away. As usual, the staff was extremely helpful and professional. A big shout out to Dennis, the concierge. I always love to ask him questions just to hear his delightful brogue. They've added a spa with a very nice workout and pool area. It's very relaxing to hear classical music as opposed to ""noise"" while one works out or swims.  For the cost conscious, there is a very comfortable bus from the airport that stops right around the corner. Will we be back? We certainly hope so.",5,2014,03,01
207,"Great Hotel, Staff make you feel special, rooms just ok","Stayed here for one night on business, the bar areas are lovely although service was a bit slow, we ate in the bar and the food was very good. The staff in reception couldnt do enough to help, the valet parking is great and only €25 for the night, possibly the cheapest parking in Dublin city centre over night and so handy. My bags were taken to my room and not only that but on check out they took my bags out to the boot of the car, so by the time i had finished breakfast i was good to go, great service. Proper old style quality service.The only reason why i havent given this hotel full marks is that my room was a bit dated, i know its an old hotel, but the furniture was tired and tatty and that was really the only fault, but for €200 a night i would expect highest quality in all areas.",4,2014,03,01
207,A real hotel experience,"We stayed here last week (second time) as they had a good room rate. From check in to check out its a lovely experience. The bar is a bit pricey for lunch, compared to the food you get in the Early Bird menu in the Restaurant and for some reason the staff don't seem as friendly in the bar (not unfriendly) just a little officious. The gentleman supervising the breakfast was lovely and had us seated quicker than we thought Food was lovely throughout and we will definitely return.

Overall (except the bar area, sorry....) the staff seem smiley and happy.

Other than the above quibble i would gladly stay here again, the location is great.",4,2014,03,01
207,"Old style service, with a smile.","This was the second time I have stayed at the Shelbourne, this time with my wife as part of a tour of Ireland. Service is relaxed and polite from the moment you arrive. Polished, happy and confident.

The room was wonderful with a great view of the park. Breakfast was excellent. The bar is a great place late in the evening with a wonderful range of spirits. 

The location is ideal for shopping and eating in town.
The hotel does not have parking but there is a secure Q-Park around the corner, 2 mins walk.",5,2014,03,01
207,Simply Elegant!,"My husband and I stayed at the Shelbourne mid-February 2014.  The hotel, staff, and the food were outstanding.  The hotel is within walking distance to Grafton Street, but just far enough away to enjoy the serenity of St Stephen's Green..",5,2014,02,28
207,Great location,"I stayed here with two friends and we were all impressed with the room and facilities. The hotel is in a great location in the city centre and the staff were very professional and accommodating. The food is great, if a little pricey. The dining room, bar and reception are all beautiful and the jazz band that plays on a Sunday afternoon are great.",4,2014,02,27
207,Ask for a room at the front,Stayed for one night recently. A beautiful historic hotel in a prime location. The staff were exceptional. Lovely room - but in the back. Breakfast is a buffet which maybe not everyone likes. The hotel was fully booked and public areas can get busy. Had afternoon tea which I highly recommend. A great treat.,5,2014,02,26
207,Not a great stay,"Although the room was nice we were disappointed to have had to move at 3.30am due to maintenance works going on outside. Not sure why we were put in that room if they knew the works we're going to be taking place in the middle of the night? 

The following morning we had to wait over half an hour for breakfast, we were whilst waiting offered tea or coffee which I thought was nice touch given the wait only to find out we were being charged for it although we would have it free if we were actually having breakfast. When we did get to breakfast then numerous items had run out. 

On checking out I told the receptionist that we were disappointed, she said she would speak to the customer relations manager but they weren't there but would make sure they emailed but they haven't. 

We then had to wait over half an hour for the car. 

Overall a poor experience although I will say all the staff were very friendly and helpful. ",2,2014,02,26
207,afternoon tea,"We booked afternoon tea to celebrate my daughter's birthday. we were made welcome and the room for tea was very comfortable.  On arrival we were told to allow 90 minutes for tea which actually was not long enough as we didn't get our cakes and scones until after an hour. Not a problem for us as were enjoying a relaxed occasion and fortunately the staff did not hurry us. The food was delicious and we were able to have extra sandwiches. We couldn't finish all the cakes and scones so the staff very kindly boxed them for us to take home.The service however was rather slow and we had to ask for more tea. 
A very pleasant afternoon",4,2014,02,25
207,I expect a lot more for 5 star red rating!,"I spent one night here last Saturday evening and upon arrival all was not well. The room was 2 hours delayed for check-in to start the stay - it should have been ready from 2pm but not ready until 4pm in the afternoon. In the room everything seemed fine until I noticed there was mould around the corner of the glass shower surround, around the outlet in the basin and around the overflow in the basin. There was a light not working in the entrance way to the room which made the room dark around the wardrobe. There was a knob missing from one of the bedside cabinets also, which even in Premier Inn accommodation is not something you would expect. The real icing on the cake for me was the 20 minute wait to be seated for breakfast on the Sunday morning! The lounge area in the hotel on the Sunday morning was being used as a holding area - cooked breakfast was mediocre too. I have spent many nights in 5 star hotels and I am surprised greatly at the reviews I have seen on this page. I will need to be convinced that this hotel can live up to a busy 5 star hotel reputation before returning.",2,2014,02,24
207,Afternoon tea at The Shelbourne,"I took my two children and mother-in-law for afternoon tea as a mid-term treat.  We all thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff were lovely and brought extra sandwiches for the children, they loved all the attention and the fact they got individual cake stands.  There was a lovely selection of sandwiches and cakes/patisseries for the adults.  It was a really lovely experience and I would thoroughly recommend it. ",4,2014,02,23
207,Attentive staff that cater for your every whim,"The hotel is very grand, with plush carpeting, magnificent chandeliers, gold lifts and generally great service. Like a lot of 5 star hotels, there are a large number of Eastern European staff, who are generally very professional, but what they lack is the charm and character of the Irish, who for me, stood out and gave me what I wanted in a visit to Dublin. Jo flynn deserves a mention because his customer service was great, he made us feel special during our stay.  ",4,2014,02,23
207,Nicely located superb staff,"Wonderful staff -well trained to please - dining area for breakfast a little small- upgraded on bed room - pity someone didn't check the alarm clock woken at 6am- will be back again and again- just like it!

Pity car park is away from hotel - but car is taken away and back for you- a tiny inconvenience ",5,2014,02,22
207,Others could learn a lot,"From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave, customer service is evident throughout. The hotel is ideally located right in the middle of everything - very nice rooms, excellent food and customer service that others really could learn from. I look forward to staying at the Shelbourne again.",4,2014,02,22
207,Great location!,"We enjoyed staying at the Shelbourne in Dublin.  Any concerns were addressed thoughtfully.  Loved being able to walk to most places.  St. Stephen's Green is right across the street and a lovely park to walk through and enjoy the day.  O'Donoghue's Pub is right down the street where you can enjoy a Guinness and Irish singers. The museums and library are right around the corner.  Trinity college is up the street. Across from the hotel is a staging area for the ""tourist"" buses and Grafton Street is a short walk. We arrived hoping for an early check in... though they could not give us a room they arranged for us to shower in the spa and held our bags so we could go exploring.  We were able to get the ""190 Years of History"" rate that included breakfast.  The breakfast is amazing and the staff does their best to make you feel at home and satisfied.  Had a relative meet us in the Horseshoe Bar in the hotel...it was quiet and a great place to sit and chat. Overall, I would say we had a wonderful stay in Dublin!  Can't wait to go back!",5,2014,02,22
207,Presidents weekend at the Shelbourne Dublin,"This hotel has a wonderful reputation and it is well earned. We were treated exceptionally well by every employee we came in contact with. The concierges were extremely helpful, the spa was lovely and the bars and restaurants were very popular and a great places to spend time.

Don't think I have anything negative, would stay there again with hesitation.",5,2014,02,21
207,The Grand Old Lady is in good hands,"Had a midweek stay here last week, very impressed, first time here, the manager Stephen Hannely and his staff, Shauna, Sandor, Yasmin and Jack were so helpful, highly recommended. Location is excellent.",5,2014,02,21
207,"Nice reception and breakfast, poor room.","We checked in on a Friday at 2.30pm and were told that the room was not ready till 3. I had rang ahead the Monday before to arrange an early check in. I was told that they will not know until Friday morning if a room will be available and to ring back then. I rang back early Friday morning and I was told that it would be OK to come up as a room should be available. When we arrived at 2.30 I was told that the room was still not ready. I had previously explained that we had to be at a wedding down the road at 3 and needed somewhere to freshen up. Luckily a friend of mine had been given a room and we used that room. We left our bags in reception and they said we could pick them up with our room key when we returned later. This wasn't a great start but we got over it. 
After we got back to from the wedding it was approx 2 am and we got our room key and were told our luggage would be sent right up. 20 mins later, the luggage finally came up. We had one bag each and this pretty much took up the floor both sides of the bed. The room was very small.  Just enough room to walk around the bed, no chairs to relax on. Bed was the only thing to sit on. The bed was lumpy and had a duvet under the bed sheets for some reason, which did not make for a comfortable night sleep.The vanity unit had a TV instead of a mirror, so my girlfriend had to use the bathroom mirror which is not as easy when it all fogged up from the shower. The bathroom was also very small, the shower was big but the sink and the toilet were very close to each other. No bath either, which I was very surprised by. The whole room was fine if you were just looking for somewhere to sleep for the night but not suitable for anyone looking for somewhere to relax. The paint was chipping off the door frame and the carpet did not look clean. Also there were water rings on both bedside lockers, not the cleanest i've ever seen. The view out the window was looking accorss at more rooms.
The next morning we got up and had breakfast downstairs. This was excellent. The staff were friendly and efficient and the food was fantastic. There was enough selection to suit every pallet, from cereals to fruit to jams and fresh honey, to the full irish breakfast and if you wanted anything else all you had to do was ask and the chefs would prepare it for you.
We went back up to our room at 11.30 to prepare for the 12.00 checkout. when we got in, the whole room had been cleaned. Our bags were still in the room so the cleaners must have know we had not checked out yet. Maybe they thought we were staying another night. If they did think we were staying then the next guests would have ended up with the same sheets and pillow cases as we used. I messed up the bed a bit just in case to let the next guests know. All the towels were changed and folded too. We freshened up and used a couple of small towels and threw them back in the shower. 
The valet service was fantastic. Once I handed my ticket to the guy at the door, he arranged for the car to be brought back around and organised our bags.
All in all, it was an average stay, which is disappointing for Dublin's most famous hotel.",3,2014,02,21
207,Lovely stay in a great location,"We love this hotel and always try to visit every year with our 6 year old. We stayed in a heritage room overlooking the park ( ...........my Irish Central Park as I call it as we are frequent visitors to New York). The beds were so comfortable. The staff were very polite and accommodating at all times. Even at breakfast when havIng to queue at the busier times, it was nice to be seated in the Lord Mayors lounge with coffee and orange whilst a table became available.The staff profusely apologising for our wait ( which clearly wasnt an issue) . We stayed here for 2 nights before going onto the West of Ireland to see family. The Shelbournes  History room was very interesting - make sure you visit it ( off the Reception area) . Overall a lovely start to our trip to Ireland. Proud to be there for the short time we stayed.",5,2014,02,20
207,Excellent hotel,"We had an excellent overnight stay in the Shelbourne. From the first step into the hotel foyer, the staff were very attentive and pay attention to every detail. We received a complimentary room upgrade and it was a beautiful, sumptuous space. The breakfast the following morning was excellent. The pool and spa area are new and very well laid out. It is so worth staying in the Shelbourne from every point of view - I look forward to going back again in the future",5,2014,02,20
207,Worth a visit,"We recently had an overnight stay in the Shelbourne,as a birthday treat. The minute we arrived the staff came out and helped us unpack our car, then they took it away to be parked.  There is a charge of 25 euro for this service but it's well worth it. The staff in the reception area were very friendly. We were offered home baked cookies and fresh lemonade on arrival. In fact the receptionist wrapped some cookies up for us to take to our room to have with a cuppa. We spent some time in the small museum in the lobby. It was very interesting as the hotel has a lot of history. It's in a perfect location, right in the centre of things, and overlooking St. Stephens Green. My only slight gripe was that our breakfast was a little cool, due I think to the air conditioning.",5,2014,02,20
207,Old country sophistication combined with modern conveniences!,"A five-star hotel located in central downtown Dublin.  Extremely friendly and courteous staff, comfortable rooms with fine amenities. If you are arriving from the US most likely you will arrive in Dublin in mid-morning and extremely tired.  You may want to contact the hotel in advance to arrange a room being readily available.  We had to wait over two hours for a room which was understandable.  They were kind enough to offer us a complimentary breakfast for two. The pancakes were the best I've ever indulged!  This hotel is over 150 years old yet is updated offering all of today's modern conveniences. This picturesque hotel was used in several movies.  Traveling the city and seeing other accommodations I would rate this one of the best and recommend it to anyone traveling to Dublin.  You will not be disappointed!",5,2014,02,18
207,I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!,"What a beautiful hotel. It's well run, staff are helpful and friendly. The decor is marvelous, including the lovely marble lobby, the fantastic bar and restaurant areas, and the modern rooms. The location in the heart of Dublin cannot be beat. This is truly a world-class hotel in one of the most wonderful cities.",4,2014,02,17
207,Beautiful hotel at the heart of Dublin,"Just returned after a romantic break in this stunning hotel. From entering the hotel with the courteous staff in the foyer to the busy reception staff we could not have been treated fbetter. We arrived at around 4pm and the foyer was really busy with people checking in but this was dealt with as quickly as possible with trays of fresh juice being brought round to those who were waiting in the queue to check in. We then went off to our room which again lived up to our expectations. It wasn't huge but it was very tastefully decorated and had the most comfortable bed I have slept in in any hotel I have stayed in. We dined in the The Saddle Room restaurant and enjoyed fine dining with efficient, friendly service. The breakfast was also served in the Saddle Room restaurant and the choice and quality of the food was again faultless. Really enjoyed this break, unfortunately it was only for one night but will definitely be looking for a return trip.  ",5,2014,02,16
207,Fabulous hotel - shame about the restaurant service,"Stayed here for a Valentine's Day surprise with my husband. The room was fantastic, the atmosphere is wonderful. I had a fantastic 1hr massage in the spa. We went down for dinner and to be honest I was very disappointed with the service. The food was nice however the waiting staff were all over the place, there didn't seem to be a cohesive system in place. We were left quite a while to order our food, had to ask for bread and then I counted ten times that a member of the waiting staff walked by our table once our dinner was finished (knives and forks arranged accordingly) before I asked to speak to a manager and finally the plates were taken away. The manager said that ""they were under pressure"" but I really felt that was not good enough given the large number of tables and it being Valentines' night. The manager came over a few minutes later to offer a free glass of wine and assured that all would be ok after that. However after finishing dessert, still left sitting around for a long time and eventually got sick of waiting for the bill to be brought over to the table so we left as we knew it would arrive on our bill. No rose like the rest of the diners! :( Rest of stay was lovely, romantic rose petals on our bed and a lovely breakfast. Great valet service, lovely staff in spa, reception, cleaners etc. A little disappointed because it really wasn't cheap. Skip the restaurant and go to Town or The Cliff Townhouse instead.",4,2014,02,15
207,Valentines weekend,Good service when we arrived nice and friendly the staff were and first meal was lovely and we felt welcomed here and it is my first time in ireland and it doesn't feel if I am in another country and the room is comfortable and Dublin is a wonderful city,5,2014,02,15
207,Top Class,"Stayed in December - its a perfect spot to enjoy some Christmas Shopping and the atmosphere in the city. The staff are professional and friendly - Senior Championship All Ireland standard.
Really enjoyed an early morning walk through Stephens Green and the Iveagh Gardens.
Tried out the the new spa this time too - highly recommended",5,2014,02,15
207,Great location,Fabulous location on Stephens green and real old world charm. Rooms not very large but for city centre that's expected. I particularly enjoyed the horseshoe bar and the front lounge. Found the Shelbourne a little expensive.,4,2014,02,14
207,Splendid afternoon tea,We decided to treat our family to afternoon tea in the Shelbourne just before Christmas and what a wonderful experience it was! Nothing was too much trouble for the staff there...they are a credit to the hotel. The teenagers had sandwiches made specially for them as the ones on offer were not to their taste...all were delicious. The scones were light as a feather and the desserts jus amazing. Half way through one of their friends joined us and even with her help we still couldn't finish all of the food! The atmosphere in the hotel is super and we had a really special time there. The one thing that would have made the day perfect would have been to have stayed overnight......but who knows maybe next year!  Well done to all.,5,2014,02,12
207,Great breakfast,"We went to the Shelbourne for a breakfast twice.
I always tooked the ""Shelbourne eggs benedict"" and i totally recommend it, they taste amazing and you will be full for the whole day.

The only bad point, was the orange juice which was not good at all the second time i went there.
However, the service and the place are great.

I totally recommend it for a great breakfast in a cosy place.",4,2014,02,11
207,Prestige and history,"The Shelbourne is Dublin's premier landmark hotel. No other hotel in the city has such a weight of history behind it and the ambience of the place evokes prestige and nostalgia. This alone makes a stay here worthwhile and memorable. The location is superb, opening onto St. Stephen's Green, Dublin city centres leafy urban escape. The bars and restaurants are excellent and you pay for excellence. The gym is state of the art and no gym bunny need compromise their workout for a lack of equipment or space here. My room was beautifully appointed. However the tv was substandard and the in-room entertainment was not what I would expect from 5-star. The bathroom was nice but paint was peeling from around the door frame. Please note these are minor gripes and did not take away from what was a great stay in a fabulous ""old world"" hotel unique to Dublin. ",4,2014,02,11
207,Excellent service,We stayed for 3nights on a very busy rugby weekend the staff were brilliant.i would like like to thank James and all the resturant/kitchen staff  for there handling of the night on Saturday.would highly reccomend the hotel and resturant to all.will return as soon as possible.once again thank you.,5,2014,02,11
207,One of the best rooms I've ever stayed in,"My company booked a conference at the Shelbourne.  The place is absolutely fantastic and highly recommended.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The room was the best I have ever stayed in. 
Highly recommended.",5,2014,02,10
207,Wonderful a definite for your stay in Dublin,"Stayed here in December 2013 and thoroughly enjoyed it, We had a fabulous meal in the restaurant and even tho we should have booked a table as it very busy, ( Christmas diners) it was no trouble to accommodate us. On arrival to our room we had an issue with the electrics ( we had none) but we were moved and upgraded for our inconvenience. The new room was beautiful over looking the Stephens green park. The hotel itself is old world and just beautiful. I would recommend This hotel to anyone and hope to come back again in June ! It's central location is superb  and the staff were lovely so down to earth and full of chat, overall  the service they gave us was over and above what anyone would expect. ",5,2014,02,10
207,Simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in,"We arrived at The Shelbourne on a very hectic Sunday afternoon (the hotel was busy and hosting the Irish Rugby Team) and yet the reception from all of the staff was very warm, friendly and personable. The grandeur of the hotel was very impressive and our room and bathroom were sumptuous. While we did not have time to avail ourselves of the restaurants at the hotel (we were at the game and some of the lovely old pubs in between) breakfast was a veritable feast and easily catered for every taste. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough and while a little exorbitant, we are looking forward to treating ourselves again in the not too distant future. Can't wait.",5,2014,02,04
207,Excellent,"Wonderful hotel with attentive staff and beautifully appointed rooms.  On a Friday night the lounge had a nice vibe with great food and drinks.  Finding our room from the elevator was a little tricky - 2 or 3 steps up to our wing - but that is the charm of an old, historic hotel.  Would highly recommend this hotel if you're visiting Dublin for business or pleasure.",5,2014,02,02
207,Quality,"I usually travel for business but we stayed for a special occasion and I can honestly say it was the best hotel experience I have ever had in Ireland .
Great food,great service great room and a amazing building. 
Next time we have a special occasion we know where to go.",5,2014,02,02
207,Early bird dinner very disappointing - not to be recommended,"We booked early bird in the Shelbourne for 4 persons as it was my birthday - it was not explained to us on booking that all three courses come together and on the same platter - chips and onion rings are extra - no veg provided - when starters, dinner and desert arrived the starter was cold - all had to sent back - therefore dinner was cold and extras had to be sent back until all three courses arrived again - back they did come but luke warm ..... At this stage we were to embarrassed to send back again - the atmosphere and surroundings were second to none but really one just could not recommend the early bird  - such a pity very disappointing.",2,2014,02,02
207,Enchanting; 5 stars is an understatement!!,"Where do I begin! This is the finest hotel in Dublin because your greeted with nice scents and kind doorman and staff, the sophistication of the architecture, the pleasantry of positive energy, amazing staff, non-discriminatory and diverse staff, appearance of a team building atmosphere, kindness of the hotel to invite guests to sit down, have a fresh cup of lemonade and cookies, the size and quality of the hotel rooms (deluxe on 8th fl), water bottles in room and just fine finishing touches made this a EXCELLENT vacation for us. I mean the staff from the bellhop, the concierge DENIS, front desk staff, Lezlo, housekeeping (am and pm), the SADDLE ROOM restaurant kitchen and wait staff, management, and so on! We loved this place so much and the location is a given. It was safe, centrally located, near shopping area, great direction and advice, near all the museums and GREAT restaurant outside hotel like Dawson Brasserie, Bang and Hugo....I can go on and on but I am a typical high stressed American who works a lot and this gave me a change to rest. YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET and it worth every penny for a peace of mind and comfort. They also have an amazing buffet breakfast at the Saddle Room (oh did I mention the bread pudding....gosh). ENJOY and we might see you there sooner than later.",5,2014,02,02
207,Dublin Lovely even in the snow!,"The Shelbourne was a great place to stay, easy access to the whole city by, bus, taxi, or walking.  The service and attention to detail here were wonderful, the staff warm, friendly and so helpful!
We loved our stay in this grand city and the Shelbourne was a great part of it!",5,2014,02,01
207,Ledgend Hotel,"Great location, good night life close by, residence bar open till late , great bar in the hotel ,
food is pretty good , rooms good , service ; its a busy hotel and easy to loose the personal touch you might get elsewhere , business like ,",5,2014,01,31
207,High standard of service matched by impecible level of cleanliness,"We stayed for three nights in this beautiful hotel.  The standard of housekeeping was the first thing that caught my eye.  Everything has sparkling, no dust to be seen anywhere.  Everything was just lovely from the welcome at reception to the service at breakfast and in the bar. The shelbourne know how to provide great service.  The room was lovely, lots of space and a huge bathroom, all overlooking the park. Perfect location, just a few minutes from Grafton Street.  We are looking forward to staying again during our next trip to Ireland ",5,2014,01,31
207,Awesome Historic Hotel,"If you want pampering, ambiance , old world Irish charm, this is the place. The rooms are decorated beautifully, and typical European size, the beds are comfy and it's easy to fall asleep.The staff is wonderful, friendly,and very helpful. The restaurants, high noon teas, and bar areas are splendid. The spa/gym is a nice size with an indoor salt pool and spa treatments. The gym equipment is modern and plentiful. The hotel location is prime location across from St. Stephens Green. Highly recommend.",5,2014,01,30
207,Beware of the restricted menu for 8 or more - and other niggles!,"In many ways the hotel lived up to our expectations – particularly in relation to its location and general ambience. However the check-in procedure was extremely long-winded and, despite the fact that I emphasised that I was to be responsible for payment for several rooms, was extremely embarrassed to find that on the day of our departure separate accounts were put under the doors of each room.

We had been attracted by the a la carte menu displayed on the hotel's website and had reserved a table for a celebratory dinner in the Saddle Room for the 8 of us.  It was therefore a major disappointment to be presented with restricted menus and be told that for parties of more than 7 people the a la carte version was not available.  When we suggested that the waiter should perhaps treat us as two parties of 4, his response was to the effect that “he could do that if we didn’t mind being served 45 minutes apart”!!  The quality of the food, when it eventually came (after a lengthy wait and without any aperitifs being suggested), was excellent.

In summary, a very uneven experience became the subject of a letter of complaint - to which a prompt but somewhat perfunctory reply was received.  I think they may have to write quite a lot when the expectations that go along with 5 star status are not satisfied.",3,2014,01,28
207,Very nice,"Stayed here a couple of nights to explore Dublin after spending a week at the Grand Hotel in Malahide for a conference.  The hotel is located fairly close to must see attractions, such as Trinity College. The  room was spacious and comfortable. There are three restaurants, but if you simple want casual, your only option is No. 27 Bar and Lounge, which has great sandwiches (try the steak sandwich or the Shelbourne burger). The Saddle Room is nice, but there is a dress code (shirt/slacks) and it is quite expensive; pretty good, but not sure it was worth the cost. I would stay here again next time I find myself in Dublin. After all, if it is good enough for First lady Michelle Obama, it is good enough for me.",4,2014,01,26
207,Will definetly return!,"Just spent a night in the Shelbourne & it certainly fulfilled our expectations. Service really is excellent from the moment you drive up to the door. Room was lovely, very comfortable bed etc. Both bars were buzzing all day long. The only fault was the breakfast. We were led into the 27 bar for breakfast - I assume it was as place was busy & that's used when needed. However there was no fresh fruit, breads, or pastries there. When I asked I was giving quite a strange look & reluctantly told there was some in the saddle room & I could get some if I wanted?! Also no-one came near us to top up coffee, no-one advised we could have anything ""made to order"" i.e Omelette, French toast etc..All in all as disappointing as breakfast experience was, it certainly would not stop me returning & we certainly hope to in the future.",4,2014,01,26
207,A real 'home from home' in the heart of Dublin,"I stayed here for one night on business and it was a really great experience.  From the moment I pulled up at the front door, the valet parking was superb and I didn't have to worry about my bags either, I just had to go and check-in.  The reception area was not immediately obvious, but I was duly directed.  The receptionist who checked me in was friendly and asked about my day in a friendly and interested way, like she meant it - the welcome glass of home made lemonade and cookies were a nice touch too.  I then went up to the room to find a very comfortable and spacious twin room with everything required for a comfortable stay.  The room was very cozy and had everything needed including a nespresso machine, large bathroom, bathrobes etc.  It is just a few minutes walk away from Dawson Street, Mansion House and city centre shopping etc.  If there was just one thing I would have preferred slightly firmer pillows, but I guess if I had asked for them, I probably would have got them! Breakfast was superb with a buffet and a number of dishes made to order including the best scrambled eggs I have ever had - I wish I could make them like that at home!  All in all I would love to return here with my wife and family.",5,2014,01,25
207,Excellent in every way.,"The Shelbourne is perfectly located near St. Stephen's Green and Trinity College. Shopping, Dining, Pubbing are all an easy walk, even in rainy weather. The hotel itself is historic, which when one hears that, I am usually inclined to think ""old."" The Shelbourne has been kept up very nicely, warm and inviting from the lobby bars, to the guest rooms. The staff were all very courteous, helpful and professional. I highly recommend The Shelbourne for your stay in Dublin.",5,2014,01,23
207,Mutton Dressed as Lamb,"'A Dublion Institution' claims the hotel blurb. If true it is an institution in need of reform. This may be a 5 star hotel but in terms of execution it is closer to 3. A list of small gripes. Firstly i was given a disabled room. The hotel was very busy so perhpas this was understandable albeit disappointing. No bath and a puny shower with a motel style curtain. Mirror not above the wash biaisn which was curious. Had to print my boarding pass,called the concierge.' Sure' they said,' email it over'. Next morning no boarding pass ( request made at 6PM) and no note of the request. Breakfast was expensive and by contrast to other Dublin hotels fairly limited with over cooked food under lights. There are far better hotels in Dublin at lower prices and i won't be wanting to saty at this institution again.",3,2014,01,23
207,Not Completly Faultless,"There is no doubt that this is a fabulous hotel and is truly deserving of its five star grading in many ways.  The staff are very professional and friendly.  Some nice touches with complimentary sparkling water, pink lemonade and chocolates in your bedroom as an evening treat.  Really spacious bedroom and extremely comfortable beds to ensure you get that a very important restful sleep.  Unfortunatley however I was disappointed to see that we only got the priviledge of one bathrobe for the two of us and we also had to share the complimentary toiletries.  Breakfast is available up until 11am at the weekend so we arrived down at 10.30 am and had to join a large group congregating in the Lord Mayor's parlour who were also waiting on a table to become available - hardly the experience that you want to experience in a five star hotel!!  The Horseshoe Bar can be extremely busy and I was told that they do not take reservations so unfortunately you may find that you have to go elsewhere for something to eat.  Although it is in a terrific location for shops, restaurants and bars closeby.",5,2014,01,21
207,Five star excellence Christmas at the Shelbourne,"Christmas at the Shelbourne what a treat. The hotel and staff could not have been nicer. Our room was looking out on St Stephens green a large room with spacious bathroom. We arrived Christmas eve the hotel was mystical. The food that evening in the bar was perfect a club sandwich from heaven. The bar staff really were exceptional, taking into consideration it was christmas eve they had smiles on their faces and enjoyed their jobs which made the experience very special. I presume they are well looked after and appreciated. Christmas dinner was exceptional we sat for nearly four hours enjoying our very special day the food and the waitress were again exceptional. Overall  an excellent experience all round. Being pregnant meant i was analysing everything and I really could not fault the hotel or the excellent service. Thanks you to everyone who made our stay extra special.",5,2014,01,20
207,Five star Fabulous ,"We stayed here this weekend for 2 nights and were absolutely spoiled from the moment we arrived. Old world charm with every hospitality you can anticipate! Check in was excellent, so genuine even offering food as we had arrived late! Simple but rare to get someone so engaged and caring! Our room was fab, every comfort you require and of course the bed was just heaven. Breakfast is a busy spot but we loved the bustling market style buffet, it had a cool New York City feel and even though the staff must have been under pressure you wouldn't know it. They were efficient, attentive and very friendly. Sophie and Val went out of their way to ensure our special weekend was first class, it was my husbands birthday and there were treats at every turn, lemonade, birthday plates, even afternoon tea delivered to our room (that might have been more for my weary legs though in the last months of pregnancy!!) Thank you all for such a wonderful weekend, Monday certainly seemed brighter after our great weekend in The Shelbourne! If only we could stay every weekend! ",5,2014,01,20
207,Top notch for a stay in Dublin,"As soon as you arrive you know you are somewhere special. Door men welcome and assist you, a refreshing drink at reception. Was here on business then took the weekend to meet friends and sightsee. This meant an early arrival Friday. I had spoke to the hotel to warn them I'd be there at 10.00, no problems we were straight in to our room. 

The Spa and Health Club are impressive, lots of gym machines, fab pool, steam and sauna. Changing rooms have everything you would need.

Rooms are well appointed, beds very comfortable, free bottled water (and chocolate!), a turn down service, staff were friendly and attentive, nothing was any trouble at all.

Breakfast in the Saddle Bar was efficient, good selection of everything you would expect. Try the specials, the Shelbourne Eggs Bendict was sublime. The No. 27 bar turned out to be our favourite, great ambience for an early drink or supper. We ate in there Saturday, food was top notch, we finished with cocktails mixed to perfection.

Location is good base for sightseeing. All in all, excellent choice. Would highly recommend.",5,2014,01,20
207,5 stars in the City,"My husband and I just spent 2 nights in Dublin staying in the Sherbourne Hotel and I have to say it was fantastic.  All that old World Charm and style and service too from the door mans greeting every time you enter to his thanks when you leave.  We didn't use the facilities so cannot comment on those but the atmosphere in all of the reception areas was great and a busy spot too.  Breakfast each day was excellent and once again served by a team of very professional, genuine, friendly people.  We booked on line and got a rate of €190.00 per night in a deluxe room with breakfast.  Our room was lovely and spacious only criticism was the bed but that from 2 people with bad backs so we will always be a little picky.  Overall a great stay in the city, we really felt that we got value for money and were treated so well by every member of staff that we encountered.",5,2014,01,19
207,Very disappointing!,"I hesitated to write this review because the hotel is such an iconic place in Ireland.   
I did not like the hotel: it was  extremely busy with people coming in from outside and using the bar, tea rooms and restaurant.  Staff was not particularly helpful and my impression was that this is a hotel for People Watching if you are into that sort of thing.
Breakfast was very ordinary and certainly not 5 star standard. Room was comfortable but small.
Residents lounge was pretty awful with not even a glass of water available.
We did not use the spa so I cannot comment on it.",3,2014,01,15
207,A Treat!,"Our stay was thanks to our son and daughter-in-law, as a thank you for support during their wedding preparations. It was all that I hoped for, and more, An absolute treat in every way. The bedroom was beautifully decorated, the bed extremely comfortable and the bathroom and dressing area amazing. The ambience throughout the hotel was very relaxing, and everything about it made us feel special and cared for.  Breakfast was delicious, such a great range of food on offer, I wanted to spend all day in the dining room.  All in all a memorable stay, all I can say is ""you're worth it"".",5,2014,01,15
207,A glimpse into how the other half live,We treated my mum to a night away for her 60th birthday. We were told when we checked in that we had been upgraded to the best suite un the house. It was such classic luxury.. we loved every second and it almost made us want to stay in for the night. From when we parked the car to when we checked in to when we checked out we experienced 5 star service and were treated like royalty. Everyone made a huge fuss out of my mother and they also dropped a 'happy birthday' dessert plate up to the room. Thanks for a fantastic stay ,5,2014,01,14
207,Very comfortable stay in the heart of Dublin. Lovely spa/fitness centre,"I had a very pleasant 12 night stay at The Shelbourne while on business in Dublin. The location, history and unique atmosphere of the hotel are second to none. My room was great, conveniently located right beside the elevator down to the spa/fitness area, and my bed was very comfortable.

The big highlight of my stay was definitely the spa/fitness center. The hotel has a beautiful (new-looking) pool and gym and the trainers there are superb. This is the part of the hotel I spent the most time in and I could certainly notice the level of service and attentiveness of the staff here compared with some other hotels I’ve stayed in recently. Some of my colleagues were also at the hotel for a few nights and we made great use of the sauna, as well as the classes. The guy Simon down there is particularly helpful and gave me good advice on my workout plans whenever I was down.

If I was to complain about anything it might have been some small details like a bit of rust on one of the light-switches and some wear on the Info brochure in the room, which I wouldn’t expect to see in a 5*, however these didn’t put much of a dent in an otherwise very pleasant stay.",5,2014,01,14
207,Wonderful experience - afternoon tea,"We went for afternoon tea last weekend and it was a really nice experience. The room itself is lovely, oozing with history. The ambience was created by a lovely piano player in the corner - really added to the experience. Food was great - sandwiches, scones and desserts. We were constantly topped up with tea and asked if everything was ok. Staff were very friendly and always described in detail what was being served. It was a really nice way to spend a rainy Sunday.",5,2014,01,14
207,Meh...,"We stayed here for Christmas and being from Dublin but now living abroad I was excited to stay here as I never had before, although many afternoons have been wiled away in the bar over the years, which is ridiculously expensive. Anyway.. The room was fine, but nothing like we were expecting after a well publicised refurb a few years back.

The bathroom was huge and luxurious, but also a waste of space. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I've slept in for many years. It dipped so badly in the middle and was far too soft. I slept in a V shape and had to put a pillow between my legs in an attempt to stay horizontal. It was like a bed for very old people.

Another thing - the lighting in the room was all over the place. The bedside lamps were far to bright and should be on a dimmer. You could light the room with just one of them. I had to unscrew one of the two bulbs in the lamp to create my own ambiance but it's like none of these details were thought through and having stayed in so many hotels over the years, you become attuned to these details as they are the very elements that distinguish great hotels from bad ones, but the Shelbourne is supposed to be high class, historic, sophisticated.. this experience wasn't.

The food in the restaurant was massively over-priced because it was Christmas, and the while the food was good, it wasn't anything special and was just a few notches about the old Broccoli and Carrots hotel restaurants that many of us remember from our childhood. In fact the bar food looked far better than the 'festive menu' and it was all coming out of the same kitchen!

Here's another thing that really pisses me off. The Bill - but not for the obvious reasons. I woke up to find the bill staring at me from the floor, having been slipped under the door in the dead of night. This is something that lots of hotels do and I've no problem with it. But in every other hotel, the bill is either folded over or slipped under the door in a crisp white envelope. No no.. one piece of A4, face up for anyone to see. What if you didn't want your partner to see the bill as it was a treat? Where's the manners, the class, the discretion? In fact, that example was pretty endemic of the entire experience.

Just one more thing - On the bill the 'festive menu' which was €99 per head and included in our package was listed on the bill as an additional charge. So that's €198 and I now have to bring it up at reception and they have to check it all out and blah blah blah and it's unnecessary and I immediately think the worst as I've come across this in many other hotels. Lots of people don't check their bills, they just pay and leave. It's a hassle I didn't need and it was the cherry on a collapsed soufflé as I was exiting the building.  

The hotel looks great and is very seductive. You are attracted to its history, its location, but the details are all wrong and the substance and philosophy is lacking.",3,2014,01,11
207,Among the best,Two nights at the Shelbourne Dublin in early January 2014.  On a par with the best London hotels...but with friendlier staff.  Perfect location.  Superb restaurants nearby.  Not inexpensive - but real value for the class of service.,5,2014,01,11
207,Not near as good as expected,"Arrived tonight for our last night out together before we welcome our next born - therefore obviously our last night out for a while so decided to treat ourselves to the shelbourne - do you kno what ? Not all that impressed - downstairs lovely , room - not what you would expect - toilet rolls thrown on the floor - towels not hung up & 1 bathrobe to share between 2 of us! In addition when we filled the sink it wouldn't empty - I'm just back in the room now 3 hrs later and it still hasn't emptied.
To be honest very disappointed  that I brought my wife out to this hotel
To find it at a standard far less than what we expected because at the end of the day it's not cheap.
Now have to pay €25 more for parking in the morning....
Disappointed.

207,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service","Our friends were holding their wedding reception at the Shelbourne so my boyfriend and I decided to stay the night before and night of the wedding. 
Firstly, we were struck by how beautiful the hotel is. The staff were very friendly and professional, allowing us early check in after a very early and eventful flight into Dublin. We went for lunch in the saddle room, which isn't cheap at 30 euros for a two course meal however the food was excellent. We have a vegan diet and the chef was happy to adapt the vegetarian dishes to vegan. 
We had drinks in the downstairs cocktail bar which was clearly visited by not just guests but people on a good night out. They cocktails were delicious. We also went out for dinner and noted that the Shelbourne is very well located for other bars and restaurants. 
Breakfast was included and there was an extensive range. They also offered alternatives for us such as soy milk for the cereals and soy milk cappuccinos. 
Our friend's wedding reception was held in a separate suite and was absolutely beautiful. The service was excellent and so was the food. 

All in all, an absolutely brilliant trip full of fond memories. I would definitely recommend.",5,2014,01,10
207,Irish do it right,"Took the entire family on a trip to Dublin, Ireland and spent three days and 2 nights.  Got into Dublin early on the morning of Dec 27th took a bus to the Shelbourne all I could say would be ""wow"" the place is amazing including the staff.   Upon arriving I had reserved 2 rooms, one for my daughters another for the myself and wife.   One room was available, the other not so the staff at front desk gave us a comp breakfast while we waited for the other room to open up.  This place is all class.  Rooms were very nice and staff very helpfull.  Hotel is in a perfect spot to see the many attractions in Dublin.   Hotel has everything, good food and cheer.  My family loved it.  Will be going back again.",5,2014,01,08
207,Great Food and Staff,"The Shelbourne Hotel is the perfect location for a city centre break. The high standards set by this hotel are to be commended. The hotel restuarant is top class and normally I would check in and choose a quality restuarant away from the hotel for my evening meal. I can certainly recommend their in house resturant and please book in advace of your arrival as I witnessed some very dissappointed clients (as they had not booked in advance). This hotel is expensive and you certainly pay for the service, but i is special and worth it. The bedrooms are nothing special although they are fully equipped and decorated well, I wa expecting more (I dont know why). I was there at Christmas time and they had decorated the foyet and bar beautifully - well done to all concerned. Valet parking was a nice touch as parking close by is problematic and the front door staff are excellent.
If you are on a budget stay away from here as cocktails in the bar are €12 each.
If you want somewhere special with all mod cons during your stay and can afford it - then this is thee place to stay in Dublin. Probably not suited to the under 35s.",5,2014,01,08
207,A great time,"My wife and I spent a wonderful New Year's Eve at the Shelbourne.  We arrived on the red eye from the US early Dec 31 and the staff was so accomodating in securing a room for us to freshen up.  The staff truly makes this hotel great, along with such a beautiful room and access to all of Dublin's wonderful attractions.",5,2014,01,07
207,"Full of character, charm, style and still has a relaxed welcoming vibe","My girlfriend and I got engaged at the Shelbourne last Christmas (2012) and visited again this Christmas. We have stayed in one of the suites which was amazing and the experience will last a life time. Everything about the place is class. If you want a relaxed pint/glass of wine then head to Horse Shoe bar whilst the front bar is a little more up market and sophisticated (watch out for celebs). There is also a beautiful residents lounge. The location couldn't be better. St Stephens Green, Grafton Street, O'Donoghues and the theatre are all within a five minute walk. 
We have also used the spa which was brilliant and worth every penny. I particularly enjoyed the chill out area that they take you to after your treatments. Lie back in your post massage glow and watch Dublin city pass you buy whilst you contemplate where to spend your evening......bliss",5,2014,01,07
207,Not sure,"I booked this as a surprise for my fiancée, where there are areas where I think the hotel is good, being upgraded there are areas where they fail miserably! and I am not sure would I recommend the hotel or stay there again.

1) Breakfast, they are totally unorganised for a 5 star hotel you would not expect to queue or to be seated in the bar area.

2) the worse experience I had and I have never experienced in any of the hotels I have stayed In before and this was meant to be a 5 star.  My partner ironed his shirt to which he noticed the black coming off on his collar! it was not a cheap shirt so I rang housekeeping, they sent the head of housekeeping and her first words were "" this shirt is dirty"" I was discussed and both in shock at the way she spoke to a customer!! I think she realised when I told her why would I tell you about the black coming off on his shirt when we were heading out for the evening.  She did say she would try and get it off and bring the shirt back in a few minutes.  I had to chase her twice she made us late and we missed our booking! and even when she brought the shirt back once again said that the black came of from the iron, I responded to say it had never happened before and maybe she should learn to speak to customers.   I have never experience this before and when I told the front desk all they said was sorry not a good feeling from the hotel!!

Also our upgraded room had a dirty bath and labels on the floor which were not ours, obviously housekeeping are not doing their job!",2,2014,01,06
207,Great staff and historic hotel,"Such a pleasure! The hospitality of the Irish continues and is readily found at The Shelbourne. 
From the moment the doors are graciously opened for you to the minute you turn your key into your well appointed room you will feel the luck of the Irish is with you for booking this lovely hotel.
Great location, wonderful Irish breakfast. Only drawback: many tourists enjoying all the amenities. 
It can be difficult finding a table for breakfast or a chair for a seat. Perhaps they should have some areas for guests only.",5,2014,01,05
207,"Amazing hotel, fantastic service, perfect short stay!","I took my wife to the Shelbourne for a couple of days after New Year to celebrate her birthday and we loved it! The hotel was perfect, very grand as you would expect but beautifully done, the food was great, the service was fantastic and I would certainly recommend a trip...we will certainly stay again should we visit Dublin anytime soon.",5,2014,01,05
207,almost perfect.,"We recently stayed overnight on our NYE trip into one of there premium deluxe room on second floor. There were a little bit queuing upon arrival as the hotel was fully booked around Christmas period. Crowds always spoil the charm of a place especially it come to a hotel which we expect luxury and discretion like the Shelbourne ! 

The hotel is nicely located in front of st. Stephen's park right in the heart of Dublin with everything reachable by foot. There were also nice decoration for Christmas, and a little museum room with old guest registry and some souvenir to remind the glorious past of history !   
 
The staff was very welcoming and helpful. At check-in the receptionist advise us we had a very nice room which we indeed had by its enormous size but yet so empty with a view on the back yard + I think they should consider re-designing a new layout to smartly use the space along with some furniture update (ESPECIALLY THE BEDDINGS!!!) to give a personality to the room and to make it more cosy and welcoming to the guest, then we can call it a very nice room. 

The bathroom was also huge with separate toilets and marbles everywhere which was nice.  

We haven't had time to test the tea room and the bar, we only had breakfast in the saddle room the next morning which was excellent I would say. There were plenty of choice and and the staff was very attentive and welcoming. But we were the first guest around 7am so I can't say if it's stays the same when the breakfast room is crowded with the refuel and other details like that ... 

The fitness and indoor pool area was very appreciable after a long day walk.

As conclusion I would say we have had an very enjoyable short stay and would consider this hotel as a good choice for our next stop over in Dublin. Apart from some critics, overall was fine.",4,2014,01,05
207,Excellent!!,"Visited with the teenager kids for a few days in January. Excellent hotel, superb breakfast. The rooms are a bit small, but the service is great, the building is beautiful and it has the best of locations.  The Saddle Room restaurant is excellent. great stay!",5,2014,01,05

207,Mostly good,Came to a family wedding and stayed three nights. Great location and service as expected in a 5 * establishment. Efficiently run and staff well trained. Room was OK but a little small . Personally I did not like the feelings generated by everywhere being so busy - reception areas and breakfast. Presumably good for business to be so full. Nothing to compare it with and nothing to complain about. Just a City centre hotel which gets really busy.,4,2014,01,02
207,"Stunning hotel, good rooms - would recommend","I stayed overnight on a recent business trip. The ground floor is beautifully done and had been nicely decorated for Christmas (with a working train set by reception). The room was decent, hampered by the bathroom which needed a little updating but everything else was fine. Considering the room price I thought the hotel was excellent value. I slept very soundly with no noises or disturbances.

Breakfast was excellent with good variety and choice. Staff were very friendly and professional. The hotel location was fantastic and allowed us to walk to nearby restaurants and pubs (I would recommend O'Donoghue's just down the road for a good pint of Guinness).",4,2014,01,02
207,Christmas Stay,Stayed for three nights over Christmas. Lovely hotel in a wonderful location. Great Atmosphere and very lively.  The bedroom was extremely spacious and comfortable. Received a lovely Christmas goody bag which was a lovely surprise.,4,2014,01,02
207,"5star downstairs, 3star upstairs","Beautiful hotel, gorgeous reception, lively bars. Best location. 
My wife and I arrived to check in, we were greeted with a warm apple cider which was so nice after been out in the cold. The hotel was very busy and the lady told us that the room would take an hour. So she gave us a free drink which was perfect. So nice and professional. We then had afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors lounge, heaven. Pure 5star class. Drinks that evening in both bars and breakfast were all perfect and the staff, even tho the hotel was jammed, were professional and smart at all times.

What let our stay down badly was the room. We booked last minute so I presume we got the worst room in the hotel. I have to presume it was once a linen closet. It was so small, stuck in a corner looking directly onto where the bottles (long into the night) were emptied and into a neighboring office block. so we couldn't even open the curtains. So it was tiny and stuffy. Also, and this is a smaller thing, I've never stayed in a 5star hotel that doesn't provide a turn down service, I had to use the same towel for three showers. Our DOUBLE room only had one dressing gown, and we weren't offered a newspaper at any stage, disappointing as it's the small things that make the big difference.

Overall I'd be back to this hotel in a flash for the service, drinks and afternoon tea and ambiance. It's a beautiful hotel in a perfect location. I would not stay overnight again unless I was guaranteed a different class of room. The room ruined an otherwise great stay.",3,2013,12,30
207,Above what I expected,"I attended an event recently in The Shelbourne and my first visit to Dublin. I am surrounded by great hotels in London and this really is in a league with those.The hotel is beautifully decorated and really gives a warm welcome Irish feeling. The food and service at the event was extremely attentive and professional but still with that Irish charm. Our waiter for the evening provided more than what I expected with a great knowledge of the food and wine but still never too busy to help. I made a note of his name as I felt so strongly about this, so I just wanted to say a big thank you to all the team and our waiter Jack Fitzsimmonns who made this a memorable experience for me and my colleagues. I will be back soon and i have no questions about where I will stay. Thank you Shelbourne! ",5,2013,12,30
207,Dublins Best,"The hotel was bustling, warm and inviting on 28th Dec. Staff coped amazing with the demands of the busy hotel and were friendly and courteous (we did have to wait for our rooms to be ready). Rooms high standard and the breakfast delicious! Location is in the heart of the city and couldn't fault anything.",4,2013,12,29
207,Greg the Doorman...,"Just a fantastic experience in every regard. High praise goes out to Greg the ever present, cheerful, pleasant and wonderful young man who always greets you on your arrival and treats you with respect and helpfulness. I know I've arrived when I am greeted at my home from home in Dublin by Greg - wonderful fellow and good lad - great work there Greg!",5,2013,12,29
207,An Elegant Hotel,This is truly an elegant hotel. It has a central location in Dublin. The exterior areas of the hotel were truly beautiful. The staff were true professionals. The room was charming and comfortable. Boutique hotels throughout Europe should use this hotel as a model. I hope to be able to return to this hotel.,5,2013,12,28
207,An absolutely beautiful hotel,"This would have to be one of the best hotels in the world. Stayed for 3 nights 23-26th December 2013, what a fantastic Christmas stay. Everything about this hotel is magic, from the location, rooms, bars, restaurants, but especially the staff who are professional, courteous, friendly, and incredibly helpful. If you are looking for a truly wonderful experience look no further this is it.",5,2013,12,26
207,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin,"This is a gorgeous hotel in the middle of Dublin. Right outside it's doors are tons of shops, restaurants, and St. Stephens Green.  The hotel itself is lovely and the staff is very friendly.  I arrived very early in the morning and they were still able to give me a room.  I do wish they had a concierge level but it was not a big deal. The restaurants are nice and the breakfast buffet is really fresh.  The rooms are decent size and very charming. I was there for work so wasn't in the room much to need the views others mentioned.  The beds were unbelievably comfortable.   All in all this hotel is great.  It's very pricey but it's likely due to the location.",4,2013,12,26
207,Great Hotel!!!  Wonderful Staff,"I'm currently at the Shelbourne.  JD has taken excellent care of if us......even though I've been a pain!   The staff is fantastic. We even had chocolate and a Christmas stocking on the door. This is is a well oiled machine. Food is awesome. We really appreciate how the staff bends over backwards to make you feel at home. If you come to Dublin, STAY here!  You will be glad you did.....they pamper you!",5,2013,12,25
207,Christmas at the Shelbourne,"After looking forward to staying at the Shelbourne for Christmas all year,  I have to say I am disappointed.  The hotel is nice as one would expect, great location, room is ok  but the customer service is very disappointing.  I requested a room with 2 beds which was not available by the time we arrived after a flight cancellation- but I was assured that a roll away would be place in the room immediately.  We left the hotel to get dinner on the 24th as the hotel dinning was totally overbooked. Returned several hours later  No bed  waiting for us,  3 calls to find out where and when it would arrive- even called the hotel manager who of course never called me back.  Finally bed arrived.   Asked for times for closest Catholic church for Christmas services but no one knew.  Asked what time shops closed on Christmas Eve  again no one could tell me nor the hours for pubs or places to eat.    The hotel is very busy so perhaps given normal times things might be different but at this cost I expect better service.",3,2013,12,24
207,Horseshoe bar a must,"Great location on St Stephens Green, with two fantastic bars and a restaurant on site. New gym facilities really improves the overall experience. Get a room overlooking the green if available as opposed to the side street or rear view ",5,2013,12,23
207,Grand old dame holding up well ,"The Shelbourne is Dublin's grand old dame of the hotel world and hasn't lost any of her sheen.

Well situated, whether you are there for pleasure or business, sitting next to the shopping precinct and a short walk to the pubs in Temple Bar.

The common areas are richly furnished and there is a warm, home away from home, feel to the place.  A lively bar downstairs is just what you want if you are here to enjoy yourself.  

The rooms are good and comfortable, but not luxurious or anything special.  

Is it still the best hotel in Central Dublin? Yes, quite likely. ",4,2013,12,21
207,Surprise visit and what a treat!,"Received lovely surprise treat of a one night stay in this beautiful hotel.  Room was extremely comfortable with everything one would expect in a hotel of this calibre.  I absolutely adore the breakfast and we took our time enjoying same.  I ordered the French toast and it was delicious.  Nothing was any problem to the staff as I also ordered a latte to finish off my meal.  

The hotel is beautifully decorated for Christmas.  I arrived the night Gay Byrne was there to switch on their lights but unfortunately missed him by about an hour.

Will be back....soon, I hope!",5,2013,12,20
207,A Good night spoiled with poor valet service,"We took our annual trip to Dublin meeting our agent for dinner and opted for the Shelbourne using points, we had a very good check-in, received some complimentary bar vouchers (there's no concierge lounge) and also heard that breakfast was included and that was spectacular. The room which was an upgrade was fine, floor creaked but it's an old hotel with some inherent characters aspects I guess, bed was really comfortable though. We we're told to allow 15 minutes for the car valet return so we phoned down prior to check out and arrived at the front door 15 minutes later but then got to hang out for at least another 30 minutes, the lady at the front noticed our irritation and facilitated a refund for the €25 fee but the excessive wait really ruined the check out experience, also there was quite a smell in the car that was unexpected and quite unpleasant but we we're too much delayed to follow up on why that was present",3,2013,12,19
207,Almost excellent,"We stayed in The Shelbourne on a busy Saturday night in November. On the whole this was a generally good experience. The positive points are the central location, fabulous attention to detail in the décor throughout the hotel and the individually wonderful staff. And therein lies the only problem – the apparent individualism of the staff. On three occasions we suffered at the lack of communication between the staff. 

Firstly we were woken up at 8:47am by a member of the housekeeping staff trying to enter our room, this happened a further two times and we also had a call on the room phone with someone who said that they were expecting housekeeping staff to answer. So between 8:47 and about 10am (when we went for breakfast) we had three calls to the door and one further intrusion by phone. Don’t these people talk to each other?

Secondly when we arrived for breakfast we were informed that as it was a peak time we’d have to wait to be seated. We were shown to the lovely Lord Mayor’s room where we had a short wait until we were called to be seated in the breakfast area. We were shown to a table and an order for coffee & toast was taken. We went to the breakfast buffet and were shocked on our return to find that our table had been given to another couple by another waiter. Don’t these people talk to each other?

Finally after checking out, I gave the guy at the door my ticket to have my car collected. He informed me it would take about 25 minutes, I said ‘no problem, how will I know when it arrives?’ I found him to be very dismissive as he instructed me to go back into the hotel and said that I’d be located. Confused as to how this would work I asked again and was given the same dismissive answer. Well I waited & waited and after 35 mutes nobody had come for me and I asked a different guy about my car, he took my reg and said asked another unformed guy nearby to bring my car. After 50 minutes I went out again still no sign of my car. I happened to look around the adjoining street and saw my car. Don’t these people talk to each other?

Within a four hour period we were repeated left disappointed and frustrated by the apparent lack of communication between the staff of The Shelbourne. This might have been isolated – I have to believe that we were extremely luck to experience such incompetence.

Despite these tremendous inconveniences; the swimming pool, bedroom, breakfast, dinner, décor and individual staff are second to none. It has to be said this is an impressive hotel – almost perfect except for our souring experiences.",3,2013,12,18
207,"Some delightful, some disappointing….","My three girlfriends and I (all busy working mums) travel to Dublin for a weekend every Nov/Dec, always choosing a 5* hotel for our one weekend of indulgence. We were eagerly looking forward to the staying at the Shelbourne but unfortunately it didn't quite match expectations. There are many wonderful things about the hotel. It is aesthetically stunning, with traditional decor and the welcome is flawless, from door to check in. Unfortunately, we hit our first glitch when we were shown to our rooms. We had specifically requested adjoining rooms, and were pleased to see our request had been accommodated - until we opened the curtains to a view of an office block only feet away, and as an extra bonus, if we looked down we had a view of the bins. 
We asked to be moved, and after several calls, were accommodated in rooms on the sixth floor, over looking a fairly tatty courtyard, but at least these rooms were brighter.
We then headed down to the bar, keen to begin our break to find it was absolutely packed out. We ordered food at the bar, but by the time it was ready there were still no tables free, so the bar staff informed us they couldn't bring it to us. We then noticed SIX empty tables with reserved signs on them. We asked if we could reserve a table, only to be told that they didn't take reservations at that time of year (first weekend in Dec). When we pointed out that clearly wasn't the case as many tables were reserved, we were told that those were for the sales department's ""special guests"". We said we were hotel guests, but were told that didn't make a difference. Eventually, a surly member of staff (in fairness, the only one we encountered during our stay who was less than welcoming) allowed us to sit at a reserved table as long as we agreed to vacate it when we'd eaten our food. Not the best start. We asked if we could book a table for the next day and were told again, that they didn't reserve tables. Oh, the irony - as we were still surrounded by empty reserved tables. We went elsewhere for the rest of the evening and opted for dinner in another hotel instead. On returning, we decided to have a nightcap in one of the hotel bars, only to find them both absolutely packed out once again. Not even standing room. We enquired as to an alternative residents bar and were told that there wasn't one. And therein lies the problem with the hotel. We were informed that it was one of the busiest weekends of the year (switch on of Christmas lights, many private functions etc) and that's fair enough - but there should be provisions made for residents. Over the whole weekend, we were unable to enjoy a leisurely drink at the bar, dinner in a hotel restaurant, afternoon coffee in the lounge - all the things we look forward to on our Dublin weekend - because the hotel was simply too busy and they didn't offer an alternative residents' bar / lounge. We ended up doing nothing more than sleeping there, starting the day with the wonderful breakfast, then leaving the hotel, returning only to change, check if there were any free tables in the bars / restaurant (there never were) and then head back out. We ended up spending more time at the Westbury than at the Shelbourne.  I worked in the international hotel industry (for Sheraton and Hilton in Europe and Asia) and I understand that at peak times service can slip - but our overall experience was so disappointing. In summary, I'd say that in quieter periods, the Shelbourne would be a magnificent destination (as long as you're not in the office block-view rooms), but for busy times, I'll be giving it a miss until they establish an executive lounge /  residents bar to ensure that hotel guests have full facilities.",3,2013,12,17
207,"""Legendary Service""","I would like to personally thank the management and staff of the Shelbourne for an excellent stay at your hotel. From the moment my family stepped through the doors we seemed to be transported from modern day Ireland to the 1800's.  
Along with our 11 year old and 15 year old  boys we toured the exquisite establishment.  Our family suite more than accommodated the four of us. The cookies, coffee and orange juice was an all day delight. The staff went out of their way to meet and exceed our every expectation.  We look forward to our return to Ireland and without question the Shelbourne will be our hotel of choice!!",5,2013,12,16
207,"Great hotel experience, great service","I picked the Shelbourne Dublin for a recent trip to Ireland because of its location, its history and because it's a Marriott property.  We were not disappointed.

The location is terrific. Everything you want to see and do in Dublin is within walking distance for the most part. We did take a taxi to the Guinness Storehouse but walked everywhere else. There are some great restaurants nearby, St. Stephens Green is a nice park right across the street, Gaston Street shopping is just a few blocks away and Trinity College, Parliament and the National Museum are just down the street.

The Shelbourne is also a building rich with history. But it has been updated nicely and is in great shape. It has a very elegant but comfortable feel to it. 

The service of the staff really stood out.  From the moment we checked in we were taken care of. The desk attendant gave us a friendly greeting and upgraded our room. After dropping off our bags I needed to take a shower (I had golfed earlier in the day).  I did that and we headed out to grab some dinner. When we came back, not only had they given us turndown service on the bed but they had cleaned the bathroom and stocked us with new towels.  That was a nice touch.

The concierges helped me find the rental car office to return the car we had and in helping us with reservations for dinner at a local restaurant (The Winding Stair...highly recommend it).

The restaurants at the hotel are great as well. We had drinks in the bar every night and ate dinner there once as well. In particular I want to point out one of the staff who helped us out. On our last night we walked in and found the place packed (it was Friday night). I did a quick circuit of the room and didn't find any open spots. My girlfriend and I started to discuss what our options were when Fergal Ohalleran approached us and asked if we needed help.  He quickly found a spot for us at one of the long tables, put up a reserved sign, found us chairs and got us drinks and menus. He really did a nice job of recognizing we could use some assistance (before we even had a chance to ask for it) and got us set up. We really appreciated that.

One other major point to note.  Friday afternoon we decided to try tea at Lord Mayor's Lounge. I was just in the mood for some tea and biscuits so was a bit shocked when I saw the menu for afternoon tea. It was 32 pounds and a set menu, though you could choose the tea you wanted.  We decided to go for it anyway and boy am I glad we did! It was really excellent.  We stayed there for about 2 hours. We each had 2 different pots of tea (I loved the Chocolate Orange Truffle the most). And the sandwiches and desserts were terrific, beautifully presented and delicious.  I highly recommend taking an afternoon break for tea in Lord Mayor's Lounge.

The only slightly negative thing I would say is that I would have liked pancakes or French toast in the breakfast buffet. But the chocolate croissants were delicious.",5,2013,12,16
207,Opulence and great atmosphere,"The grand entrance and friendly attentive porters on arrival, make you feel instantly welcome.  The receptionists were very efficient and helpful.  I was in awe of the Christmas train set display with everything made from ginger bread and sweets.  This was a decoration with a difference!
My room on the 5th floor was nice a quiet, big and very comfortable.  The complimentary teas and coffee's were available.  The bar was busy with Christmas revellers and the breakfast had all you would want, apart from smoked salmon.",5,2013,12,16
207,Old World Grandeur,"Stayed here on a weekend break in Dublin. The hotel is really well situated, surrounded by shopping and fine dining options. The staff are really friendly and welcoming, without the sort of strained over politeness that sometimes goes with five star hotels. 
The rooms are a little small, understandably, since it is such an old building, but the bar and various lounges are lovely and elegant - overall a great place to spend a couple of days treating yourself. ",5,2013,12,15
207,The Ultimate in Irish Hospitality,"In visiting our daughter in college we stayed at The Shelbourne. From the moment we checked in when we were offered hot cider and ginger cookies to our departure The Shelbourne was a delight. The staff were all so friendly, our stay included breakfast which was fantastic (I'm still dreaming of Irish bacon). The Horseshoe Bar poured a great pint of Guinness and the tea in Lord Mayor's Lounge was a special treat. The Christmas decorations and general feeling of good will made me feel optimistic about the human race!  And I haven't even mentioned the Spa and large heated pool. Overall, a magical place, great location across from St. Stephan's Green- The Shelbourne is highly recommended.",5,2013,12,15
207,Very good choice of hotel,"We stayed in the Shelbourne for the first 3 nights of our Ireland trip. We choose it based on Trip Advisor ratings....the first place we always look. Our room and the hotel was lovely. We also ate there one night. Service was friendly and efficient in both hotel and dining room. The location is wonderful, right across from St. Stephan's Green. You can also catch the Hop On Hop Off Bus across the street. It is very walkable to visit numerous historical sites. We would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2013,12,14
207,Dining etc options most inadequate,"Continuing bug bear I have with this hotel is this: apart from breakfast (which is very good) dining and bar facilities for residents are as good as non-existent. Reason: they are wide open to the general public and, any time I've been there, inaccessible/ unavailable for residents. So you are stuck with room service which is much too slow (presumably because all the other residents are also using it). On the plus side, staff are very friendly and the building is very nice but the facilities shortage is, in my experience, unique among five star hotels and therefore defining.",3,2013,12,14
207,Afternoon Tea,"I have been here for two afternoon tea's and both times I have not been disappointed.  The staff are very friendly and attentive.  I love the fact that you can change your tea with each course of afternoon tea which they serve in stages rather than the usual three tier.  It gives you a chance to sample some of the more elusive teas that you might not see on everyday menus.  It would be great if they did a chocolate afternoon tea as both times I think there was only one dessert that included chocolate flavours.  

The setting is very beautiful and they always have fresh and unusual floral displays in the Lord Mayor's Lounge.",5,2013,12,11
207,Wanted to love it,"We booked this hotel as the last night of our trip through Ireland. We began our trip in Dublin at the four seasons, and should have done our last day there. The atmosphere at the Shelbourne is wonderful and the staff is professional. It's a great place to go have oysters or dinner or drinks and just hang out. The rooms, however leave much to be desired. There is nothing luxurious about them and they are small. We saw 3 so I can say that if you want a decent room, go for a suite. Even a mid-level room is just not exciting in any way. Also, be sure to verify that your room has a view, the alternative is pitiful. The restaurant is great and we would return to the Saddle Room.",3,2013,12,11
207,"Wonderful hotel, fabulous service","I took my little Godmother for a girls Christmas shopping trip to Dublin and there can be no better place to stay in town than the Shelbourne. The staff were so friendly, attentive and professional and we were wonderfully cossetted in the luxurious surroundings of our Heritage Room overlooking the Green. Thank you JD and all the staff, this trip will now become an annual event!",5,2013,12,11
207,Nice Historic Property!,We stayed here for four nights in November. Another couple traveling with us also stayed four nights here. I am sure the staff and guests will be happy when the construction out front is finished. It is a busy place with a nice lobby and historic side rooms for sitting and having tea. Breakfast was included with our rooms and the buffet was quite nice and comprehensive. The staff was very friendly and packed us a to go breakfast when we did an early day trip. The heritage bar was great but always very crowded. The location was not bad for tourist activities as it is on St. Stephens Green. Our rooms were okay but not overly special. Beds were comfortable but rooms were warm and a bit dry. Making the room cooler helped us sleep better. We are loyal to Marriott and that was a reason we stayed here. Overall positive experience.,5,2013,12,10
207,Friendly staff but many aspects were disappointing,"I travelled with my husband and my two children aged 3 years and 6 months. We were really looking forward to spending time in a five star hotel. Some aspects were wonderful but unfortunately some weren't what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre.

Upon arrival we were immediately helped by a lovely doorman who took care of our bags and our car. We were escorted inside and met by a very friendly lady who whisked us to the reception desk.We were given a glass of mulled cider and some ginger biscuits which were lovely. The lady at reception desk was very friendly and helpful. She told us that we had booked a king room with a roll away bed and a cot but that she would place us in a room with two double beds. I had no quibbles with that until I reached the room. Firstly, the corridor to the room had two steps along it meaning that it was awkward to transport the baby in the buggy. The room was very disappointing. It was very small and it had two tiny double beds. My husband and I are both very tall and we would have barely fit in the bed. There was no baby cot inside but it would have barely fitted in had it been there. We phoned and spoke with another very helpful lady who agreed to let us see another room on the 6th floor with more space (a king room which we had originally booked). It had more space (although I wouldn't describe it as a very spacious room) and a little single bed for our 3 year old. There were steps down to a little area before the bathroom where the cot could be fitted. The second lady was very lovely and recognised us again on our way in to the hotel after being out for a walk. The lady who checked us in saw us and apologised for the room move.

The breakfast each morning was lovely. We all really enjoyed it. We had 'supper' in the Lord Mayor's Lounge the second evening (we booked after the first night just to ensure we could spend some time in the hotel's communal area in the early evening). We weren't told that it was three courses that were served at once until we actually arrived in the lounge. We didn't want to have three courses but had no other option and the food portions were very small for the price.

As indicated, I had high expectations given that it was a five star hotel but again I was disappointed by the room. It was not as luxurious as other reviews had suggested the rooms were. I have stayed in better 4 star hotels room-wise. 

A few things listed below really did disappoint me however;-
* We had to request the cot for the baby three times before it finally arrived at 7.40pm.
* No towels were provided for our children.
* The tissues were not replaced on the second day. One was placed on top but there were no further tissues underneath.
* The face cloths were not replaced on the second day.
* The room was incredibly hot even with the noisy air conditioning unit being on full blast. My three year old and I had a terrible second night's sleep due to the heat.
* The lobby area only had two seats by the Christmas tree. There was no substantial seating area to sit and take-in the ambience of the lobby.
* I appreciate that we stayed in December but the hotel was completely rammed from 6pm on in the evening. We could not get a seat anywhere downstairs so we were confined to our bedroom with our children. 
* The water in the pool was too cold for the children.

I hate being so picky about the above but I really did expect more from this hotel. The staff we dealt with were lovely but unfortunately I don't think that that reason is enough to make me want to return to this hotel. I appreciate that we were staying at a busy time but I would try another hotel before returning to The Shelbourne.",3,2013,12,09
207,Really great atmosphere,Stayed here with family around Thanksgiving. Staff was very friendly throughout including a very early check in after our tiring flight from US. The venue is amazing with several bars and rooms that really seem to create a focal point for the social life in Dublin. Rooms are ok,5,2013,12,08
207,Excellent Hotel and Restaurant.,"Our experience in  The Shelbourne   Dublin was extremely impressed. Warm and  welcoming staff brought us to dinner table in restaurant. The décor and ambiance was as we expected to be ,private table helped us to enjoy even better- the lovely dishes we had to experience. Wine selection and sommelier  help to paired them with the  dinner was highly appreciated by our  guests .Our server Pawel was above and beyond to pleased us and his knowledge of wine was spectacular. He made our dinner with friends very special and we will be back to celebrate more eventful nights like this  .Keep a good work.",5,2013,12,06
207,Beautiful well maintained property,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights at the end of our family trip to Ireland. I was extremely impressed from the moment we  arrived. We were greeted at the curb by a very polite and helpful bellman who helped us with our baggage and directed to the lobby check in. As we waited to check in he brought each of us a glass of lemonade and a home baked cookie, a lovely way to begin our stay. The hotel very nice, it is housed in a very old bldg., which was refurbished with much attention to detail. Our room was large and clean as was our son's room. The staff was very friendly, helpful and professional. The hotel is also walking distance to most tourist sights and the hop on hop off bus stops just up the street!",5,2013,12,05
207,"A ""happening"" first rate hotel.","The Shelbourne Dublin is in a great walkable area, near shopping and with much to do nearby. Our room wasn't ready for a bit and after checking back at registration, they upgraded us to a junior suite. The room is very nice, staff is wonderful and the (included) breakfast is also terrific. This is our first trip to Dublin and loving it!",5,2013,12,04
207,They really take care about the customers,"Stayed at The Shelbourne this week, because the company I work for organized an event at the Shelbourne. All in all, excellent hotel, great room, very clean and cozy.  Very friendly staff, and professional attitude.  

Special comment to the architecture of the hotel.  Definitely a fantastic building.  No doubt, will stay here again in my next trip to Dublin.",5,2013,11,29
207,Exquisite hotel for our special stay.,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for a long weekend on one of the hottest weekends this year.

It was our anniversary and we chose the Shelbourne for several reasons; my husband was born and brought up in Dublin, and often came to St Stephen's a Green (just opposite the hotel) with his family when he was a nipper. I had never been to Dublin, so when we learnt that my husband's grandparents stayed here on their honeymoon decades ago, it was a special weekend all round. 

We were helped in with our luggage and offered fresh lemonade on check-in - perfect given that it was knocking on 30 degrees outside! We were upgraded to a heritage suite on the 5th floor with truly sumptuous furnishings and bathroom and I can honestly say, we have never felt more spoiled in our lives. Comfy bed, huge walk in shower, beautiful classic furniture. 

We were lucky enough to stay here for 4 days and it was a wonderful base to explore Grafton Street, Temple Bar, St Stephen's Green and a day up in Malahide in the sun. We opted for the tasting menu at the Saddle Room on one evening (I ended up in a delightful food coma) and also treated ourselves to a full Irish breakfast in our room on another day. Pricey, but worth it for our anniversary. 

A note on the staff - truly helpful and genuinely interested in their guests. I couldn't decide on a cocktail, so the bar tender in no. 27 rustled one up for me with all my favourite flavours. The concierge noticed that I had written post cards one morning as we came down the stairs and he immediately offered to post them - I didn't even have to ask. I can't recall his name but every time we saw him, he asked about our stay.

We will be back - this may well become our annual anniversary haunt. Thank you to all who helped make it so special.",5,2013,11,28
207,Picture Perfect,"First time to Dublin and we could not have been happier with the Shelbourne. The location (on St Stephen's Green) was superb; within a few minute walk to great pubs and restaurant. It had old time charm, but was renovated to a level that would rival any of the five star modern hotels. The area around the hotel was charming, safe and so convenient.

From the time arrived at the hotel, the staff could not have been more helpful. The bed was the most comfortable that I can recall sleeping in and the breakfast arrangements in the hotel restaurant was fantastic. We highly recommend the Shelbourne to anyone looking for a great hotel to stay when in the great city of Dublin.",5,2013,11,26
207,Excellent,"An amazing place, definitely 5 star. We stayed here as a party of 5. The service, ambience the surroundings. Everything was fab. Their attention to detail is second to none. Most definitely the place to stay in Dublin.",5,2013,11,25
207,Excellent Customer Service from Check-In to Check-Out,"I would give the Shelbourne more than five stars if possible. We arrived at the Shelbourne late morning. We didn't expect our room to be ready but wanted to drop off our luggage so we could go sight seeing. While my husband was checking in I waited nearby with our luggage. A woman working at the reception desk brought me a glass of lemonade while I waited. It was just what I needed! Mirta checked us into our room. She suggested a place nearby on Grafton Street for lunch, Bewley's. It was perfect. I ate there twice during our three day stay. Throughout our stay whenever we ran into Mirta she inquired about our stay and was very helpful. I got the impression that she genuinely cared about our stay at the Shelbourne. Everyone working at the hotel was so friendly. We were upgraded to a suite that was beautiful. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was huge. Breakfast was good with many options to choose from. The hotel is located close to many attractions. The Museum of Archeology is right around the corner and worth a visit. I hope to return to Dublin soon and would not think of staying  anywhere other than the Shelbourne.",5,2013,11,24
207,Proper old fashioned luxury.  Perfect.,"This is a beautiful old building in the heart of Dublin.  Friendly professional service,  really comfortable bed and a great nights sleep.  One minor irritation was a bartender who was less than pleasant or helpful but overall this is gem and worth the money. ",5,2013,11,24
207,The best Beds,"A great nights sleep was the best. The bed was so comfortable, you did not want to get up. Great hotel restaurant, and the bar was so nice. It seems to be quite the place to be. The flower arrangements were beautiful. It is a old hotel, but, has been kept up very nicely.  All the amenities were excellent. Was a pleasant surprise and a wonderful staff. Location was an added bonus!",5,2013,11,21
207,Very disappointed,"I pre-requested foam pillows and a high floor (also requested early check-in if possible as I was arriving around noon).  Upon check-in at noon, was told that no rooms were available - so they stored my luggage and I toured the city.  Returning back to the hotel at 4:00 to get the keys to the room, it appeared that I had never stopped to check-in prior....nothing was ready, first disappointment.  I was then told there isn't an executive lounge, but I would get breakfast and drink coupons (in my experience this doesn't equate to having access to an executive lounge and I would have thought a 5-star hotel in the Marriott chain would have this feature and no drink coupons were ready for me at check-in...we will bring them up later).  The room was on the 4th (out of 8 floors) not exactly high, but it didn't really matter - as the room overlooked a building / alleyway nothing to see.  Feather pillows were on the bed (my wife is extremely allergic to feathers) so off to the front-desk - so my 2 requests made ahead of my stay were not met (already at the never stay again and I haven't even unpacked my bags).  The room was a typical Marriott room, nothing of the ""splendor"" that I had read in previous reviews.  The next issue I had upon returning to my room after re-requesting the foam pillows - the key already didn't work in the door...back to the front desk.  

Bad experience and only on the property 10 minutes.

This morning no paper delivered.",2,2013,11,21
207,Top quality stay in Dublin,"First off, don't be put back by the crowd upon entering the lobby.  The Shelbourne has two great lobby bars and the locals are here enjoying the premises.  Very helpful staff at reception.  My room was really nice, well decorated with high ceilings and proper trim.  Furniture was in good condition.  This is a Marriott property and hence, had a fantastically comfortable bed.  Bathroom was spacious and spotlessly clean.  I would rate this property as one of the finest hotels in Dublin.  A must stay.",5,2013,11,20
207,Haven't even arrived for my stay and have already received the 5 star treatment,"I am heading to the Shelbourne next week for a special, though quick, trip with my sister, who has never been to Dublin.  I specifically picked The Shelbourne because I wanted her to have an exceptional experience from start to finish on what will be just a long weekend trip.

I reached out to JD Flynn to arrange for something special ahead of time as well as to ask for suggestions on great,  ""non tourist"" restaurants.  This was well in advance of the trip and JD responded to me immediately and made some great suggestions in addition to handling my special request.  He really got it that I wanted to make this a special trip.

I travel a great deal for business and this level of responsiveness is not the norm - especially for such a short trip. To have someone address my requests immediately and make me feel like this would be the exceptional trip I really want it to be for my sister just assures me I made the right choice in picking The Shelbourne.",5,2013,11,20
207,A Perfect Stay,"Wonderful location on St Stephens Green.  A beautiful old hotel with well appointed and spacious rooms.  All the staff were very polite.  The bars can become a little crowded and there is never enough seating but great atmosphere.  

Only thing I found a bit odd was that out loo part of the bathroom was right next to a huge window over looking the Green and it had clear glass with no net curtain.  We had to keep pulling the blind down for some privacy!",5,2013,11,19
207,Terrific property in a beautiful city,"I stayted at the Shelbourne in November 2013 while traveling to Dublin on business.  I highly recommend this property.  

The Shelbourne is a classic hotel in a great city, located across the street from St. Stephen's Green. The guest rooms are large and comfortable, staff is attentive, restaurants are tasty and the bars are vibrant, although it can be difficult to find room for a large party during peak times in 27 or the Horseshoe Bar.",5,2013,11,18
207,Historic hotel,"Excellent location, easy walk to all the sites, restaurants and bars.  Attentive service.  Large rooms with large double sink bathrooms.  Nice to stay in a historic hotel.  Breakfast included with our stay.  Large lively bar at night.",4,2013,11,18
207,A Gorgeous Piece of History in Dublin,"We enjoyed our three nights at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin very much.  After a hiccup at check in, Guest Relations manager JD Flynn, took care of us and across the board, the staff was the icing on the cake of this stunning property.

Our rooms were gorgeous with very comfortable Marriott bedding.  The amenities were fantastic.

The hotel has a perfect location, across the street from St. Stephen’s Green, a few blocks from Grafton Street and and Merrion Square and minutes from Trinity College.  It’s a 10-minute walk or short cab ride to the happening Temple Bar area and the River Liffey.

The public areas are wonderful and beautifully maintained.  The Horseshoe bar is a great place for a late night Guinness before going back to your room.  The breakfasts are delicious (their Irish breakfast and Shelbourne Eggs Benedict with Irish steak out of this world) and again, the staff was first rate.

This hotel is a gorgeous piece of history in Dublin and well worth the money.",5,2013,11,16
207,BAD STAY,"We stayed at the shelbourne dublin 1st room was awful tiny looking out to a very dirty space, dirty bedclothes, 2nd room was bigger but still not very clean bird poo all over curtains inside, had to wipe clean the marks on loo seat, food in restaurant not 5* just ok,we did say all this at the time but staff were not interested, i also wrote twice never got any reply very disappointed as we always stop there for drinks bar food when in Dublin but our stay was more 2* than 5* much better out there, won`t be rushing back,",2,2013,11,16
207,Excellent Service,"We have recently stayed in the Shelbourne and had stayed there last September as well. The service on all parts is excellent, from the Doormen to Receptionists, to Waiting & Bar staff and the Concierge. We mentioned that it was my husband's birthday & our anniversary the next day. We were upgraded to a wonderful, luxurious room overlooking St. Stephens Green. The bathroom was spacious,  & clean and had a shower & bath. Later that day, one of the waiting staff brought up ""petit fours"" with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate. A very nice gesture. The same happened the next day on our Anniversary. We had dinner the second night in the Saddle Room The food was great and vegetarian options are always available. At the end of our meal, a slate with more ""petit fours"" arrived with Congratulations on it. A drink inThe Horseshoe Bar is always a nice way to end the evening. Will stay here again. Thank you, Shelbourne for making our stay a memorable one.

207,Fabulous Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 2+ nights before a tour.  Wonderful hotel across from St. Stephens Green and walking distance to most Dublin sites.  Everything about this hotel is FIVE star. Staff was helpful and went out of their way to please us. Every restaurant offered great food and drink. The Concierge helped set up a side trip to Cork & packed us a breakfast picnic to bring on the train. There is also an in-house genealogist who helped track down my ancestors. This hotel exudes Old-world charm and do not miss it, if only for a drink to soak up the atmosphere. Don't miss the museum in the lobby, very interesting.  IMHO, one of the finest hotels in the world!",5,2013,11,15
207,Just thought it was going to be better!!,"We always have drinks here when we are in Dublin. We stayed here earlier this year and we couldn't wait to get back, we were made to feel so welcome. We gave this hotel a glowing review on this website, so we had very high expectations!!! Disappointingly these expectations were not met!!On arrival we received no help with the luggage, not even an offer of assistance!! Had an ok experience in the restaurant, I was actually frozen where we were seated!! Very cold in the residence bar area as well, last time there was a lovely warm open fire!! Cleaning lady was knocking early on our door, why?? We left feeling disappointed, we won't be in too much of a hurry back this time. :( ",3,2013,11,15
207,Excellent Location with 5 Star Service and Amenities,"I recently stayed at The Shelbourne Dublin and booked through my Marriott Rewards site. So glad I did as they treated me extremely well as a Marriott Rewards Platinum member and the hotel was in such an excellent location directly across the St. from St. Stephen’s Green and around the corner from Grafton Street Shopping and Pubs. I came in on the ferry and was dropped off at the bus station and it was an easy walk from the central bus station about 1.5 to 2 miles away – but note I like to walk and see the sites. This is partly why I chose this hotel as it is central to all walking and site seeing in Dublin. I did also this time purchase from the concierge at this hotel a hop on hop off green bus tour ticket. The bus stops almost directly across the hotel next to St. Stephen’s Green so you can use it to get to the further attractions like Jameson and Guinness and another one I highly recommend is The Kilmainham Gaol tour (Prison – excellent)! Anyway, the hotel checked me in earlier as I got there from the Ferry very early in the morning and I also ate breakfast there in the hotel and it was an awesome buffet – not usually a buffet kind of guy. Ended up going back for dinner since food was so good and the drinks in the Horseshoe Bar – recommend also. The room was very well appointed and quiet and the beds were very comfortable. Bathroom did not have a shower curtain and instead a large glass swing door which was okay but sort of a pain as most the tub was not covered – minor issue. The hotel is very historical and like I mentioned it is in an amazing spot for just getting out and walking and seeing the beautiful sites of the city. Happy Travels!",5,2013,11,15
207,Luxury at its finest,"What a beautiful hotel!  From the wood and marble upon entering, reception, lobby and throughout the hotel was lovely.  My room was no exception ... very roomy with a king bed, large flat screen tv, coffee/tea maker, private safe, nice robe and slippers and a daily newspaper.  Location was good and just around the corner from St. Stephen's Green.  Complementary breakfast buffet was very nice as well.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,11,14
207,Ireland at its best,"Obviously the place is pricey, but if you really want to experience the best Dublin has to offer, in the finest location, stay at the Shelbourne. For more than a hundred years this has been the city's mist exclusive hotel. (A charming museum in the lobby has photos of illustrious guests ranging from movie stars -- Clark Gable, Princess Grace--to the Kennedys.) Renovated in the mid 2000s, the hotel offers a fabulous breakfast spread, cushy rooms and even a lap pool in its spa. Easy walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, the National Gallery, Government House (get a free tour; it's fascinating) St Stephen's Green & Marion Square. We also found the staff to be outstanding. My husband wasn't feeling well & they went out of their way to arrange for an in-room doctor visit (really!),  room service, etc. We left Ireland feeling as if we had been given a warm hug.
",5,2013,11,14
207,You will not be disappointed,"We had the pleasure of staying here purely by accident, we had a booking elsewhere but when we arrived we found it to be less than satisfactory. So we drove to The Shelbourne at 7.30pm and they could not have been more accommodating. They sorted us with a room at a great rate, took all our bags directly to our room and instantly made us feel at home.
The bed was so comfortable there was one or two days I contemplated not getting out of it :)
The luxury is felt as soon as you step into the foyer and is continued up into the accommodations, all staff were welcoming and polite.
We will be back for sure and will be booking the Shelbourne without second thought.
Thank you to all the staff that made our 4 night stay as wonderful as it was.",5,2013,11,11
207,Fabulous,"Stayed here in November and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. My room was superb, couldn't fault it. Very large choice of foods for breakfast, served hot and with a smile. The staff on the main door were extremely friendly and helpful. Counting down the days until my return",5,2013,11,10
207,"Shelbourne hotel, Dublin","We have just stayed in this hotel for the weekend. We couldn't possibly have asked for more. The service was outstanding and the accommodation was amazing. The staff were truly amazing however a member of staff named Jane Bridge was so unbelievably professional in her job that she single-handedly made our weekend. She is an incredible person to deal with, she is excellent with people and is exactly what a hotel like this needs. Thanks for everything Jane and your team.
Will definitely be back, a lot!",5,2013,11,10
207,Simply the best,"I have just returned tonight from the most lovely lovely stay over in the shelbourne. From the moment we arrived, the doormen very graciously took our car from us and we arrived at check in. It was extremely busy and hectic, yet the reception staff were so so kind to everyone, good humoured and making us feel welcome. I do however want to particularly acknowledge Jane Bridge who was truly exceptional in meeting our needs and acknowledging my sisters birthday. She made us feel truly special and we thank her for that. The attention to detail is truly exceptional and even though it is a large hotel, there is still a lovely family feeling and that there is some one there that actually does care. Breakfast was really lovely and there is even a juicing machine which I thought was wonderful for those that want a really healthy option. I could not find a single fault and I want to say a very very sincere word of thanks to all the staff for the efforts they make and particularly to JANE for making this a truly memorable weekend in room 430.",5,2013,11,10
207,THE PERFECT HOTEL IN THE PERFECT LOCATION.  JUST PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.,"I stayed with my family at the Shelbourne recently, we had 3 rooms booked.  It is everything we expected and more.  Firstly the location is perfect for a city centre visit, we needed to be within walking distance of everything and this is by far the best-located hotel in Dublin.  Rooms were immaculate, well equipped, spotless.  One of our rooms was a single, but horror, it had a sliding door into the bathroom which is a bit of a let-down for such an otherwise great hotel.  One practically had to reverse into the said bathroom.  Other than that, the service is completely first class, doormen, reception, valet, bar and restaurant staff; the breakfast was divine, and overall we really enjoyed our stay.  Will definitely return.",5,2013,11,10
207,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel is simply fabulous. Beautiful and spacious rooms, with a bar full of charachter. Good location close to shopping area. Ever so helpful staff. Although a little pricey it was worth it! Will visit again.",5,2013,11,08
207,Worthy of an Anniversary Celebration,"We stumbled across the Shelbourne on our way to the museums that are close by.  Being late morning, we were looking for a place to relax with a cup of coffee before the museums opened.  The Shelbourne lobby coffee shop with a pianist giving us wonderful background music was perfect.  We were new to Dublin and wanted a place to celebrate our anniversary dinner that evening.  We had a chance to review the dinner menu and found it more than adequate.  We made a reservation and were on our way to see the museums.  That evening, we were back for a most delightful dinner.  As we were waiting for dessert and coffee, our waiter brought out a slate inscribed ""Happy Anniversary.""  What a wonderful surprise!  A beautiful evening and a wonderful Dublin memory.",5,2013,11,06
207,Should form part of any trip to Dublin!,"My third stay at the SHelbourne. I don't get to come to Dublin as often as I would like but whenever I do I always try and make at least one night here. We stayed Marathon weekend for one night after running the marathon. Check in was quick and we were pleasantly upgraded. Nice ! 
Room
Was sumptuous and spacious. My partner declared that it was the most comfy bed he'd ever slept in. The marbled bathrooms are a delight again spacious. However whilst the bath is gorgeously deep it isn't very long so stretching out is problematic. Facilities would also be enhanced by the addition of a bedet. There is a tea tray And a posh but fiddly nespresso coffee machine and bottles of water. On previous visits a few years back these weren't available so it's nice that they are now righly so for a hotel of this standing. 
Also now Insitu is the spa. Whilst we didnt partake of the treatments or gym we used the pool steam room and sauna. The spa facilities are ok but would be greatly enhanced by addition of a jacuzzi. I realise that in an historic building planning regs and space are of a premium but I was really looking forward to a soak in a jacuzzi after running the marathon. Just small gripes really. 
Service I found to be a bit hit and miss. I waited for at least a good 5 mins to be acknowledge and served in oyster bar. Which is not acceptable whereas the concierge horseshoe bar and breakfast staff were excellent. 
Overall a most enjoyable stay again at the shelbourne. When you stay here you are not just staying in a hotel but buying into a little bit of Dublin's grand and proud history and any minor gripes can be forgiven because its simply a gorgeous grand hotel. ",4,2013,11,04
207,What a great wedding,"Unfortunately we didn't stay at the Shelbourne but I still wanted to praise them for the wedding. Great atmosphere, staff were awesome and the food was fantastic. For any couples getting married here, you must have the fillet of beef on your menu!!!",5,2013,11,04
207,Fantastic Vegan Menu,"I have to say I was pleasently surprised that The Shelbourne Hotel was capable of producing such excellent vegan menu's.  I was in The Saddle Room and the Manager James was on the ball - offering me a selection of dishes and desserts.  I had a fantastic evening (and have to say my meal was better than anyone else's:)) It is always refreshing to use a hotel that actually has real Chef's - who are not thrown when someone has dietary requirements - fantastic meal - no hassle catering to me at all.  

If you are looking for a special meal - then make sure you check out The Saddle room (and if James is around even better).  I was even told that they had a Vegan Wedding in October, which just goes to show how able they are to provide top notch food.",5,2013,11,04
207,Potluck and disappointing for an iconic location,"Being a platinum marriott member you expect the best rooms and I didn't get it . My colleague also the same status and booked in the same time  got a fantastic room , mine was tired odd shaped and views of nothing. So he was happy I was disappointed and as I stay 100 nights a year in marriotts I would expect a lot better .

Service was hit or a miss, I told the maître Di at breakfast I was meeting with a colleague he did not him to meet me, he also had asked for me

With so many staff they could have done so much better .............",3,2013,11,02
207,Simply the best......as the song goes.,"My partner, my 5 year old  granddaughter and I stayed here for the last two days of our five day break in Ireland from the UK.We haven't been to The Shelbourne for over a year, but as soon as you are greeted by the lads on the revolving door, it's as if we'd never been away. Staying here is more than just booking accommodation; you are buying an experience. Seeing some of the most professionally trained staff in the Irish Hospitality Industry in action is part of that experience ,together with the high standards of food and beverages adds to the pleasure of staying at The Shelbourne. Jane,the reception manager, runs a tight ship as the checking in process is always friendly and swift; not to mention the free lemonade and cookies....and of course, the occasional upgrade if they can do it. The breakfast service is the best in town with one of the nicest blends of tea I've ever tasted. Our granddaughter, Layla, thought it was ""well posh"" and wants to stay here again; and, of course, we will; that's a certainty.",5,2013,11,02
207,Superb,"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent one night stay here. The Hotel is elegant, close to everything and the staff were truly professional. Alexandra in the restaurant was a star.

We will return and recommend.",5,2013,11,01
207,A treat for a night our in Dublin..,"My sisters and I decided to stay in the Shelbourne as a treat for one night in Dublin. I'm giving a rating of four stars for exceptional and thoughtful service - even if our room was quite old and tired (albeit immaculately clean). Our Room was not ready on check-in, there was a (child-size) cot as opposed to another double bed in our room and the chandelier in the bedroom rattled with ANY movement on the floor above. All issues were dealt with fairly and promptly on check-out (3rd person supplement waivered, comp-ed the the previous evenings cocktails as a goodwill gesture etc). The common areas are very grand in an old-school manner and the staff are exceptional. Don't think I'd stay again, would just prefer something more contemporary - but thats just personal taste and does not take away from the welcoming, professional and warm atmosphere at the Shelbourne..",4,2013,11,01
207,Absolutely the best hotel and staff ever!!!,"This hotel and the staff, particularly Guest Relations Managers JD Flynn and Mirta are absolutely the best I have ever met.   My husband and I had a medical emergency while staying at the Shelbourne and had to call an ambulance.  The staff were there instantaneously and very professional.  Handled everything competently and I felt totally reassured.  They had my husband quietly moved to a waiting ambulance and they were just so compassionate and supportive.  
Unfortunately since then, my husband has passed away but I will always remember the kindness of JD Flynn and Mirta.  If I ever return to Ireland, I would stay nowhere else but the Shelbourne.  
Rooms are very comfortable, beds are wonderful, buffet breakfast is awesome.  Location couldn't be any  better.  Just love it!!!",5,2013,10,31
207,Elegant,"Stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel when arriving into Dublin for a Ireland Tour.  The hotel was just beautiful, very well maintained, the staff was great.  Lovely dining area for High Tea, Dining Room for breakfast very nice, the breakfast buffet was delicious.  Great selection,  Also, you can order eggs the way you like them.  The Shelbourne is in a great location, right across from St Stephen Green, a beautiful park to wander in.  Grafton St is a very short walk from the hotel.  A shopping center is right down the street.  Lots of restaurants nearby.  Location is perfect.  The Shelbourne is such a wonderful experience, we would stay again while visiting Dublin.  The hotel has hosted many rich and famous people and I can see why!  There is a little  museum near check-in and it tell about famous people who have stayed at the hotel, very interesting.  If in Dublin treat yourself to the Shelbourne, you will love it.  The rooms were decorated very nice, the beds were great, the entire experience was wonderful.  The also have a wonderful Spa but we didn't have a chance to experience it.",5,2013,10,31
207,November Stay,"We stayed here last November - my last trip before our baby was due and had to say overall experience was lovely - we had a lovey spacious room with additoinal living space- bathroom was great - breakfast was fabulous - wonderful selection 
We had afternoon tea - have to say was just ok was very crowded that day as Ireland rugby team was in and even though we booked in advance they didnt have our reservation - needless to say this was rectified quickly but I dont think it was worth the price -have experienced AT it in other 5* hotels and have been more impressed 
Concierge service was great and I hope to come back to this charming hotel which is in a great location",5,2013,10,30
207,Three impeccable days in Dublin,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for three nights and did not realize that it was a bank holiday weekend when I booked it. However, the service was excellent save for some delays for breakfast to be expected on a holiday weekend. The room was very good and all of the staff were most helpful. It is perfectly situated by the park and other sites. I would definitely return. If you go to Dublin and don't stay here, stop for tea or a drink to marvel at the  architecture and interior. One negative the mattress was a bit concave and lacking the comfort that it should have had. It was my error for not complaining after the first night.",5,2013,10,29
207,Nice hotel,"Classic older hotel, staff was really nice and helpful. The hotel is within walking distance to restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, shopping pretty much anything you need. Also the rooms are nice and big. ",5,2013,10,27
207,How could such a fabulous hotel that minds every detail have such awful mattresses?,"This hotel is opulent and well located, along with having a mostly fine  staff, unparalleled fitness center with indoor pool, and excellent bars and restaurants.This was only marred by a very bad mattress and less-than-topnotch concierge. We would have traded a little opulence for a decent mattress.

We were checked  in by Laszlo, who is a star among stars. He offered help at every juncture and would be a credit to any establishment. We are most grateful for his help during our stay.

The hotel is a historic landmark and beautiful throughout, bringing forth the best of its past and present with its architecture and décor. Our room (#770) had a number of unique architectural elements, which we thoroughly enjoyed.

Our room also had the worst mattress we’d experienced since college dorm rooms. It was lumpy and visibly sloped down to the middle. We pulled the coverings off to get a closer look, and it is apparent that the hotel is aware of this shortcoming—something like a “fake pillowtop” or add-on has been put on top of the regular mattress with a mattress pad on top of that. It doesn’t help. My husband is a lifetime platinum member of this chain and, in theory, gets priority treatment. Are those without priority status being issued cement pads?

The linens are sumptuous. Upon stepping out of the shower, large bath sheets encompass even those of us with growing backsides from Guinness over-indulgence. The duvet on the bed is SO warm, thick, and large (a small compensation for the mattress); and the sheets are high thread count.

The concierge staff were pleasant but less than helpful. We asked to arrange a half-day walking tour with a private guide. First they tried to shunt us over to a group tour. “It’s not that busy at this time of year. There won’t be many other people.” When we made it clear we wanted a private tour, they gave us a bunch of the brochures from the same walking tour companies asking that we tell them which we liked best. Ultimately they called one of the principals from this group to try to arrange a private tour, and, after a full day, the individual never returned their call. I don’t know if The Shelbourne concierge staff have loyalty obligations to these companies—but before we left the States, we found a number of Dublin private tour guides but didn’t have the time to arrange it ourselves. I find it hard to believe that a concierge at a property such as The Shelbourne is so poorly connected that he can’t get a reputable private tour guide during low season.

The hotel is scrupulously clean down to the smallest detail, and this includes the rooms. The location is accessible to Temple Bar and many other attractions; and stops for many of the tour buses (“hop on/hop off”, Viking Splash, etc.) are across the street.

I have never seen a hotel fitness center superior to this one. The jewel of the center is the indoor swimming pool. It is 18 meters, but seems longer, has a lap lane, and has a temperature that is balanced to accommodate those of us who swim for fitness and might want it just a touch cooler and families with small children who want it a tiny bit warmer. The large, well-appointed changing rooms have lockers with keypads, so you can secure your valuables without having to deal with a lock; and the center provides towels. Workout equipment is cutting edge.

We would stay at The Shelbourne again without hesitation--after making sure the mattress has been updated.",4,2013,10,27

207,Refined and Opulent,"The best hotel in Dublin in my opinion.   High Tea is a must,  the Bars and restaurant are first class and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Centrally located, close to everything you need.   Don't think I could ask for anything more.   ",5,2013,10,24
207,Wonderful stay,We arrived in time for a late lunch which was delicious.  Great atmosphere in the bar and the staff were attentive and professional.  The bath in our room was deep and the elemis products of excellent quality.  Breakfast the following morning had plenty of variety.  We really enjoyed our stay.,5,2013,10,23
207,Excellent Excellent,"We called into to the Shelbourne Hotel today Tuesday 22/0/2013 for Lunch , what a Lovely Surprise , We were shown to our Table straight away asked if we wanted a drink by a very nice Man who showed us the menus .
We were served our food within 20 minutes , the food was really first class , well done .
We were so happy that we are now going to book a weekend stay at the Shelbourne .

First Class.",5,2013,10,22
207,Great stay,"I had a most enjoyable stay here in October having secured a great deal online.  The room was on the smaller side but was nonetheless luxurious with top class linens etc...  I availed of the room service menu and had a delicious snack, the service was excellent.  I ate breakfast in the Saddle Room the following morning, it is very good but perhaps not worth the 30 euro charge.  The staff are second to none. Will definitely return.",4,2013,10,22
207,Brilliant,"I was here with my husband and we got the princess grace room for the night. The room is so big with large sitting room area and a long meeting table. It has 2 rooms which is very ideal for families. The interiors were very luxurious and the room is just spectacular. It is very pricey but if you want to be lavish with your loved ones, then this is the way to really impress. Although the breakfast let me down a little. It wasn't as what i expected. It was very basic.",5,2013,10,22
207,Five stars with an asterik............,"We arrived early on the morning of September 30.  I was ready to book two rooms for two nights even though our arrival was in the wee hours of the 30th...one night on the 29th and one night on the 30th.  The Marriott representative suggested that I only book one night and take advantage of their ""red eye check in"".  We could check in as soon as we arrived.  I was skeptical but it saved us some money and and she sounded sure we would be able to check in at 6 am............We had a great flight and could not wait to check in to our hotel.  Our first time to Ireland and had plans for a quick nap,shower and breakfast before our short 24 hour stay in Dublin. Except that (and I know you are shocked)they had NO rooms available for a ""red eye checkin"".  Yup---they were fully booked.  And I knew they were not going to throw anybody out on the street for us.  Check out is 12 noon.  I kept telling myself it was just too good to be true.  But I was practically begging Marriott to take our money for TWO rooms for TWO nights.  Their rep talked me out of it!!!!!  So we were very,very disappointed at this turn of events.  And it did effect our 24 hour stay in Dublin.  Be that as it may,the hotel was perfect.  We loved it.  The two rooms (when we did check in) could not have been nicer.  The hotel is grand.  We had breakfast two mornings.  Very tasty.  Service impeccable. Pity about the check in.........really disappointed.",5,2013,10,20
207,Shelbourne Hotel - grand dame of Dublin and a great place to staty,"The Shelbourne is a grand hotel with a lot of history in the center of southest Dublin.  Great staff, lovely rooms that appear to have been redecorated within the last couple of years.  We arrived early in the morning from New York.  Our room was not ready but the front desk staff bent over backwards to make us comfortable, offering us a free breakfast in the Saddle Room while we waited.  Gave us a great upgraded room by 11AM.  You could not pick a better location in Dublin or find a more accommodating staff.",5,2013,10,20
207,Great hotel! Great location!,"Stayed for two nights.  Valet parking took care of the car parking.  Could not check in early, but could drop off our bags.  Room was very comfortable and spacious.  Great location to walk to shopping, restaurants and pubs.  Hop on hop off bus picks you up just across the street.  Did not eat in the restaurants, since plenty of options are nearby.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Shelbourne.",5,2013,10,19
207,Awesome,"A superb 5 star luxury hotel.  The staff is wonderful and goes out of ther way to accomodate  every request and all of your needs.  When we walked in the front door to check in, a very pleasant woman met us at the door and escorted us to the desk.  She offered us information, helped us with check-in, gave us a brief history of the hotel, and immediately arranged to have dinner reservations made for us.  Our room came with free breakfast--it was bountiful and splendid and the table and set-up were nicer than one typically finds in the nicest of restaurants.   Our room and bed were both very comfortable.  The room itself was not too large but we had a very modern and large bathroom.  The hotel is very centrally located.  Right across the street from St. Stephen's Green which is a marvelous park.  It is only a short walk to Grafton Streen which is kind of a combination of Times Square and Fifth Avenue.
If you can afford to stay at the Shelbourne Hotel you must do so.  You would be making a mistake to stay anywhere else.",5,2013,10,19
207,A great hotel in Dublin,"Very much enjoyed my recent stay here. The historic building is beautiful and the location is central. My room was spacious and well appointed. The bathroom was recently redone, with marble detailing and a rainspa showerhead. The buffet breakfast service was also very good. ",5,2013,10,19
207,Enjoyable stay,"I recently stayed here with my 5 year old daughter for 8 nights. There is nothing bad I can say about our experience. The staff were fantastic! They were all friendly yet professional. Every request was fulfilled quickly and happily. They mailed my postcards for me, called taxis for me, and answered questions regarding directions to various locations. When the airline delivered my luggage (it was temporarily lost), I did not have to ask for it- bell services delivered it to my room when it arrived. Room service meals arrived within the time allotted and as ordered.

The room was nice sized for a European city hotel. There was plenty of room for luggage and clothing storage. Our view was nothing spectacular, but it was as expected since I did not pay for a room with a view. The bed was very comfortable, with some kind of pillow top cover that was really cosy. This hotel also has air conditioning, which is sometimes hard to find in Europe. This was a much appreciated feature since it was warmer than expected during our stay and we like to sleep with the room cool.

The location truly cannot be beat. It is right across the street from St Stephen's Green. Several of the city sightseeing tours have pick up locations across the street from the hotel: Viking Splash, City Sightseeing (red bus) and the green bus tours. Grafton Street is a 5 minute walk. Also very close by are the National Museums (Archaeology and History, Natural History, and National Gallery) and Trinity College (Book of Kells). Most everything you would want to see you can walk to within 20 minutes or less. Everything else you can take a sightseeing bus to see.

We ate at the Lord Mayor's Lounge, including afternoon tea, and in the Saddle Room for breakfast. We also used room service several times. Everything was quite good, especially the Pavlova for dessert (my favorite).

The next time I am in Dublin I will definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,18
207,Luxury & Location...,"We stayed here for three nights and loved every second of it.  Lots of reviews will tell you the same.  Great staff.  Clear room.  Food, decor, location, spa, clientele, and more.... EXCELLENT.  Across from St Stevens' Green Park.  A couple of block from Grafton (where you WILL walk).  This is an excellent choice in Dublin.  If you don't want to pay for a VERY expensive (and arguably only marginal) breakfast.... one block away is a grocery store with a coffee shop in it.  Too easy.  Helped us find something our young son liked to eat!",5,2013,10,18
207,Need to up their game,"We stayed here for 1 night on the build up to our wedding. We had never stayed here before but had enjoyed many drinks and some light food in their lovely bar over the past 10 years. I was quite excited about our stay. 

The pros:

The hotel is lovely and the staff are all extremely accommodating and efficient. The front bar is probably Dublin's nicest room in which to enjoy a pint, watching the people come and go and seeing Dublin move by the window. The location is excellent, right in the heart of the city. The food is of a high quality and the breakfast we enjoyed was the best I've ever had - better than the Westbury where we normally would stay. 

Cons: 

Our room was tiny. It looked like it had been partially refurbished but definitely wasn't what I was expecting. We booked it on. Trivago and in hindsight I think we probably got one of the smallest rooms in the hotel. Still, at 200e a night you are entitled to expect something bigger. Similarly, the bathroom was very small. Nice shower, just too small a room. 

We had considered staying here at Christmas for a couple of nights but we've since changed our mind and will stay at The Westbury instead. 

The Shelbourne is a Dublin icon and you can still see why but quite simply our room wasn't big enough so got the money I'd probably stay elsewhere in future.",3,2013,10,18
207,Fabulous!,"My daughter and I stayed at The Shelbourne for two nights. Every member of the staff was friendly, professional and dedicated to the highest hospitality standards.  Our room, 435, was impeccable - and every detail was top notch.  We patronized the Spa, the Oyster Bar and the restaurant - all were superb.  The Shelbourne Museum in the reception area is a gem and a must-see for any history buff. A great property!",5,2013,10,17
207,Lovely 5 night stay at Shelborne,"Husband and I just spent 5 nights at Shelborne and found it ideal in all respects!   Stayed in a quiet room at back of hotel...no view of St Stephens Green, but all in all worked great for us.  Comfortable bed, plenty of closet and space for folded clothing, loved the convenience of USA plug for using hair flat iron and recharging IPad:-).  Concierge services probably best we have encountered anywhere, other staff also excellent.  Only neg was room was not serviced one day when we left it by 8:30 AM and returned @ 4:30 PM and had to call for it to be tended to.   Response was quick, but less than thrilled to feel the need to vacate so housekeeping could do their thing when we expected to be able to kick back, relax in the room before readying ourselves for dinner.",5,2013,10,16
207,The Grand Dame of Dublin,"You have to feel a little privileged being a guest at The Shelboune.  For one, it is rich in history with its famous and historical guests to its roles in the Easter Uprising in Ireland.  Of course, it goes without saying that this has to be one of the finest Marriott properties out there.  Then there are the little things such as the friendly staff, the one-room museum in the hotel about The Shelbourne's history, the fresh calla lilies, and, oh, the upgrades.  We were upgraded from a standard double room to the JFK suite, a delightful one-bedroom suite.  We had free wifi and free breakfast.  It is a five minute walk to Grafton Street (pedestrian only shopping street). Simply wonderful.
We also stayed in Westin Dublin and paid for an upgrade from a standard room to a one-bedroom suite.  There is just no comparison.  Westin is several steps below in beauty, elegance, amenities, and friendliness.  Wifi was not free.  No free breakfast either.  
Stay in The Shelbourne and you'll understand what I mean.",5,2013,10,16
207,The Shelbourne Hotel Experience,The Shelbourne is an incredible hotel.  I spent one night and really liked it. We stayed in a suite it was very spacious. I loved the bathroom. It is expensive but really nice for a special treat.  We had some treatments in the spa followed by dinner in the Lord Mayors Lounge which was very interesting as you get all 3 courses at once so nice for a couple to order different dishes as you can sample all.  Their are two bars the main bar I thought was nicer.  The breakfast is just great with a huge selection of all kinds and types of food something to suit everyone.  The location is ideal.,5,2013,10,16
207,Truly elegant,"We stayed for three nights and loved everything about it.  Wonderful room, plush and comfortable.  Terrific breakfast buffet with all of the traditional Irish standards. The tea room was cheerful, the bar cozy, and the staff very friendly and accommodating. The location was also ideal for our visit, on the northeast corner of St. Stephen's Green within easy walking distance of Trinity College, Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, and more.",5,2013,10,15
207,"Nice, hotel for your Dublin visit","We spent 5 nights at the Shelbourne and enjoyed the hotel.  The room was comfortable, clean and cozy.   If you can get a room overlooking the park, would recommend asking for it. The hotel seems to be the place to stay for celebrities - - got to see US President Clinton at the hotel during our stay.",5,2013,10,13
207,Grand dame of st Stephens green,"We spent 2 nights at The Shelbourne in Dublin .
The staff were very kind and helpful 
Breakfast was fantastic ,just the best .
Afternoon tea was a wondrous experience .
The main bar on a Friday evening saw Dublin's great and good in all their finery .
We had room 446 ( we paid €60 extra on arrival for an upgrade) the room was very tired, ceilings and wall scuffed and scruffy .bathroom was very nice indeed but their was a bizarre ramp to the bathroom and as the bed was so close it caused a trip hazard ! 
As an old and famous historic venue it was just great .
Thanks for a good time",4,2013,10,13
207,Fantastic Hotel - Great Location,"We really enjoyed our stay here in May 2013 - We stopped for 2 nights and could not have asked for anything more. Staff very pleasant & helpful, rooms and hotel facilities were beautiful. This hotel is in a fantastic location and is only a few minutes walk to the main shopping areas and pubs. We would return and recommend to others.",5,2013,10,12
207,Impeccable,"I choose to stay here because I used my Rewards points. My expectations were not that high. I often find that ""elite"" hotels offer lots of superficial perks to justify their pricing but are just as dirty and unkempt as any other hotel. Not this one. From the moment I got out of the cab until I left, it was a great experience. Friendly and extremely helpful staff (I never carried my luggage), ideal location and my room (and the entire hotel) was immaculate. Close to Grafton Street, across from St. Stephen's and a short walk to Temple Bar and the river. Would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2013,10,12
207,If You Like To Drink - This Is The City 4 U,In all my wife's and I traveling in Europe this is one of the best hotels that we love. The hotel is fantastic and the rooms are not that big but very nice. The hotel is within 10 minutes from the Temple Bar Area. It is also walking distance to Jameson and Guinness factory tours. Also if you are looking for a day trip you can go to Belfast which is about 2 hours by car and 1.5 hours by train. The Hop On Hop Off bus tour is well worth the money to see all the sights.,5,2013,10,11
207,Location location location,"Loved The Shelbourne Dublin!  Beautiful rooms and the location is perfect - just a few blocks in one direction there are fun pubs and great restaurants and in the other direction more great restaurants and tons of great shopping.  Plus, right across the street on St. Stephen's Green is a stop for the hop on/hop off bus which gets you all over the city.  Our reservation included a full Irish breakfast each morning.  The entire staff was great as well.",5,2013,10,10
207,Beautiful hotel,"We enjoyed our stay.  It is a beautiful historic property in a central location.   Their high rating is also no doubt due to the service which we found to be truly exceptional, except for the concierge who seemed a bit overwhelmed and abrupt.   Despite this issue, we found everyone else to be very friendly and offering to help even if they may not have been as knowledgable as the concierge. I should note that we were first put in a room that smelled of smoke (I don't think the TV worked either?).    The porter who brought in our luggage noticed the smoke right away too.  He left to tell the front desk that we wanted to move, but I decided to also call them.   Within a short time, we were moved to another room and upgraded (the new room looked the same except it had larger bathroom and better TV).  The front desk apologized that the housekeeping staff should have made them aware of the smoke problem before they let the room.   In any case, they handled it very well so I would have no concern in staying there again.   We do enjoy having a cocktail at the end of the evening and found no room in the bar on both nights (Friday and Saturday), but they have a lovely lounge just for guests where you can get a drink and listen to a pianist.  There were some guests playing cards at one of the tables too.   There is also another small bar that we thought would be fun for meeting some people, but it was too hot to stay even for one drink...this was a disppointment.   We also ordered a light breakfast (fruit, bagels, smoked salmon) in the lounge one morning which was fine, but if you have time, I do recommend you walk the few blocks to Bewley's...another historic landmark.",4,2013,10,10
207,Horrendous hotel,"We stayed here the night of our wedding recently and regret not staying in a hostel (!) or just going home. Absolutely ridiculous situation. Incorrect record of booking; no record when we arrived of having been checked in earlier by a family member; and, refused a drink (at c. 3am when there are clubs in the city still open!) until I practically begged explaining it was our wedding night and we wanted to wind down after a long day. The room was nice - clean and spacious. I especially liked the bathroom actually! Other than that, the hotel had no other redeeming features. Over breakfast we had a waiter train a new staff member in next to us. The food was also nothing to write home about. When checking out, the receptionist made all of the same mistakes as the staff member the night before. Absolutely ridiculous!! I could not believe that for the money we paid, something as straight-forward as our booking was botched up - three times!! Despite being given an upgrade because we had just been married, I would rather have not have to beg for a glass of wine and have the correct booking details in the system so as not to have embarrassing conversations with staff re. money. If you are looking for somewhere nice to stay in Dublin, don't choose this place - paying for the name only, not a high standard that you may be lead to believe. Minus one out of five from us.",1,2013,10,10
207,Lovely Treat,"For our 20th wedding annniversary we recently stayed at the Shelbourne, we arrived quite early to make the most of our overnight stay. Our car was promptly taken from us and allowing us to go and avail of some shopping and lunch, we asked for a phone call  when our room would be ready, however no such phone call ever came and we arrived back to the hotel to pick our room card at 3 pm anyway, which was the scheduled check in time. 
Not to worry, we had a heritage premium room. Which was huge. LOVED it. After settling in room service complimented us with a lovely plate of macaroons and 2 chocolate bars and some soft drinks. Nice touch for a special occasion.
We enjoyed dinner in the evening and returned to No 27 bar and looked forward to a Mojito my favourite cocktail, however we were told the bar had run out of mint leaves at 9.10 pm, oh dear,a little disappointed I just picked something else. 
Tired and weary travellers retired to our gorgeous room and had the most fabulous sleep in the king size bed, so so comfy. We weren't quite ready to return home at check out time 12 noon, so we just left our car and returned after we had lunch at our leisure. A great advantage. my husband had order some difficult to get flowers from the hotel florists which were so helpful and it was much appreciated. A fantastically located hotel for anyone wanting to stay directly in the heart of the city. Loved the stay and would stay again.",5,2013,10,07
207,Afternoon tea in style,Went for afternoon tea on Friday with my two adult children to celebrate my daughter's 18th birthday. I arrived very early and the staff could not have been nicer to me- they made my daughters birthday very pleasant with a special dessert plate and the afternoon tea was delicious with plenty of variety in sandwiches and cakes. We were not rushed in anyway and fresh tea was provided in an unobtrusive way. It's a really pleasant experience and while not cheap - very nice for a special occasion.,5,2013,10,07
207,"Great place,  Great location, nice staff Historic location, spa & hip bar.","We loved this place.  Not sure where to start...

People meet you at the door and help you to check in.    The front desk staff could not have been nicer.  ALL of them.  They were out of home made cookies so a manager lady went to get more.

Our room was very comfortable and very old world.  

We could walk everywhere because of the great location.  

The Concierge showed us the room where the Irish constitution was written.

Lovely pool.

the breakfast was unbelievable.

The place was hopping every night with hip people.  Normally locals do not go to a hotel for dinner or drinks but this place was the exception,  The hotel was ready for this because they have a special room just for guests to have drinks or eat light,

Every person we came in contact with was nice.  I admit that all the people we met in Ireland were nice people but the hotel staff were extra nice.  It was like they knew they worked for a premier property and they were proud and happy to be extra nice.",5,2013,10,06
207,Bedroom small,"Stayed for two nights,full of history.Staff very helpful.Disapointed  in small bedroom and bathroom and view.Breakfast large selection though you had to walk a long way from our table to buffet.This is a five star Hotel and think breakfast should be served by waiter.",4,2013,10,05
207,Beautiful hotel in perfect location,"Stayed here for 4 nights in September and loved every minute of it.  The staff is wonderful, food very good and location is great for hop on bus, shopping and restaurants.  Short walk to Grafton Street.  Room was a good size for an old European hotel and well maintained, even if we were far from elevator.  One night I called for a bucket of ice, within 3 minutes it was delivered to room!  My husband is an early riser and he could get coffee in the lobby and relax there with the morning paper while I slept in.  Would recommend this hotel, especially if this is first time to Dublin.",5,2013,10,05
207,Perfect style and location,"We had 2 nights at the Shelbourne on a busy weekend at the end of September.  We were seeing Fleetwood Mac at the O2 and then watching the All Ireland final in a bar on the Sunday.  We picked the Shelbourne for its location and style and we were not disappointed!!  

The service from the minute we arrived on Saturday until leaving on Monday was excellent.  It is a beautiful hotel in a great spot and has an outstanding Breakfast Buffet (the white pudding is ""to die for"") - my wife is still talking about the breakfasts!  Sunday we perused the artists work around St Stephens Green (we were helped by a sunny weekend) and sat in the park enjoying the sun before watching the game nearby in the afternoon.

We sneaked a view on the first floor (conference room floor) to have a look at the historic rooms including the constitution room - the paintings were stunning.  

The bars in the hotel are very good and a lovely way to finish a long day with a baileys/whiskey before bed!  

We were on a package offer that included breakfast and was excellent value for this quality of hotel - we will definitely be going back!",5,2013,10,04
207,Grand Old Hotel,"The Shelbourne has a long history.  There is even a museum about the hotel in the lobby. That said, it has some of the drawbacks one finds in old hotels - small rooms, strange floor plan, crowded lobby space. But it also has the charm that you would not find in a modern hotel.

The staff were lovely and full of Irish charm.  As a Platinum member, we were offered the breakfast buffet in lieu of the concierge lounge, which this hotel does not have.  The breakfast was good and featured all of the items one would expect. We were also offered two complimentary drinks in the bar, which allowed us to sample the famous Jameson whiskey that everyone talks about.

The location of the hotel is excellent and within walking distance to shopping and attractions. It is also across the street from the hop on - hop off tourist bus.

The room was furnished in a traditional style and perhaps in need of a freshening.  The bed sagged a bit and the shower handle came off in my hand. But somehow, being in Ireland (and having that Jameson) made it quaint instead of objectionable.

This is the only Marriott branded property in Dublin, so I would certainly say that it is worth staying here if you want the Marriott benefits.  Dublin is a lovely city and this is a very good hotel.",4,2013,10,04
207,Fav Dublin Hotel,"The Shelbourne has been and remains my favourite Dublin hotel. Truly second to none - great location, great staff and great rooms. 

One really feels like you've stepped back in time - staff are courteous and friendly and really give the impression they can't do enough for you. Check in (early check in) has never been a problem - breakfast is hearty and plenty of it. Bars are lively and for my money, make the best Bloody Mary. A late drink is never a problem for you or your company. The concierge is always able to arrange a table where and when you need it or tickets or just give you some general suggestions on where the craic will be. 

I spoil myself every year when I fly into Dublin with a few nights stay here before I head West and I'm already looking forward to my next visit. 

Do yourself a favour and spoil yourself with a stay at the Shelbourne!",5,2013,10,04
207,Old world charm,"This is a beautiful hotel, I love the history attached to it and all public areas are beautiful.  They kindly upgraded me to a suite which was a nice touch as I was studying for an exam the next day.  I had asked for a wake up call and a particular newspaper but received neither.  This was a little disappointing.  I had a room service dinner which was ok - burger and fries - edible but not terribly inspiring.  Breakfast was good, nice variety and good quality ingredients used.  1 small issue - egg shell in my scrambled egg...not what I expected.

In terms of staying here again, I would not rule it out.  I have stayed previously and returned.  I have also had the afternoon tea which was a wonderful experience.  However there are a lot of good hotels in Dublin so the small irritants do need to be ironed out to gain solid repeat business.",4,2013,10,04
207,A Wonderful Place,"A truly wonderful ""old-style"" hotel that caters to your every essential need in the way Marriott properties do. A great location, near to everything and across from St. Stephens Green makes the location a great starting point for the Hop-on-Hop off tour bus.",5,2013,10,03
207,Great Location,"The Shelbourne reminds me of some of the classic Fairmont Hotels I have stayed in. The location is great for exploring Dublin. Room was spacious, clean, and beautifully furnished. Be prepared to pay top dollar though!",4,2013,10,02
207,Excellent hotel in a great location... a bit faded,"Firstly, this is a really nice hotel and the location is quite good. The rooms are spacious and the bars are lively. The place oozes charm and history. The only downside is that it feels a bit faded, like parts of it really need a redo - not big changes, frankly new carpet might be all it needs.....

I would stay here again and we enjoyed the Parnell Suite!",4,2013,10,02
207,great location for a dublin break,"We got lucky with a late cancelation giving us a chance to stay here.
A big improvement on the last time we stayed with the decor given a much needed once over!.
we used the valet park service which was seamless. On Sunday morning we took a walk around the corner to Merrion Sq to look at the artists showing their paintings on the railings. A great way to send the morning.",4,2013,10,02
207,Old World Charm,"I have not visited the Shelbourne Hotel since iy was re-furbished. What a pleasant surprise. The staff were very friendly, nothing was too much trouble. The room was large and well equipped. The breakfast was everything you would expect from a top hotel. A very pleasant experience.",4,2013,09,30
207,Tasty Sunday Brunch & interesting pre-show menu,"Took my mum to Sunday brunch here.  Very tasty food (recommend pancakes & bacon).  Old style service and lovely decor in The Lord Mayors Lounge.  Background music created great ambience and after was live jazz band next door.  Menu and setting for pre-show early bird menu also looks good, though did not try ourselves.",5,2013,09,30
207,Despite Grand Hotel - not grand service,"I was very excited to stay in this hotel. We arrived on a Friday night and the hotel was bustling. The bar and restaurant was busy and pumping and provided a lively atmosphere.
We checked in - but this is when the problems started. They had the wrong booking. We had booked three people. They also had not received the right details about the check out. Sunday night one person would be checking out leaving two people left. After a few minutes - we had the manager come out and try and get us to move to another hotel for one night, and then to come back to hotel. We declined. We were offered a king room with  a roller away. It was about 1030 at night and so we were tired.
We got into our room and we had a note on the counter addressed to someone else.
The room was small. - we had to move the furniture around to accommodate the roller away.

Despite all that we thought - let's just enjoy it. 

The next day - we left the hotel in the morning for breakfast about 10am. We didn't return until 3pm. the room still hadn't been made up. We had to call to get the room serviced. We also made a reservation with the concierge for a restaurant at about 3pm. We never received confirmation about the reservation, even after calling him twice about if we had a reservation or not.
we called to say we were having a nap but if they could pop a note under the door.

again - never happened.
we got up from our nap (we were delayed going to sleep due to the room service) and got ready. we got down to reception at 710 and asked the concierge if the booking had been made. he said it was and it was for 10 minutes ago. I was quite annoyed that we were late for the booking. I don't like being late and I would have appreciated being told about the reservation.

the next day - again the room wasn't made up until after we called down at 3pm. we were really  annoyed at this. 

I was disappointed with how noisy it was. the corridors of the hotel. everyone slamming there doors and when people walked past and talking  - felt like they were shouting in the room. obviously no sound proofing

as you can appreciate - three women sharing a room, we needed fresh glasses, sheets, mugs etc... more toiletries... tea/coffee etc.
being a 5 star hotel - I expected so much more than the service we received.

positives - bar and restaurant lively and good atmosphere, big bathroom, comfortable bed.",3,2013,09,30
207,Excellent,"Stayed for two nights. After a mix up with our room (queen room not a deluxe room) everything went very smoothly. Room was of a good standard, but very warm despite having the air-con on full blast. Comfortable bed. Great bathroom including bath and shower. All of the staff were polite and said hello. Cookies and lemonade at check in. Fantastic breakfast, nothing was too much trouble. Used the pool, which was great, and I had it to myself! Drinks in the bar were reasonable, but the staff here did appear under pressure. Whole hotel smelt amazing as well!

Some other posters have mentioned the lack of views from the back and internal rooms, yes our room did overlook and office block but there were good net curtains and it's pretty much what you would expect for a city centre hotel. 

Already planning our next trip next year.",5,2013,09,30
207,Excellent Brunch,We had Sunday Brunch at the Shelbourne hotel whilst visiting relatives in Ireland.  The atmosphere was superb as there is live ballard music with a singer who has a fantastic voice. The food is of good quality and quantity  and also excellent service.,5,2013,09,29
207,"Pricey, 2 stars","It may be the preferable hotel, perfect location and rest, but the room is tiny, deco tired looking, musty smell, and air con is not working, blowing hot air on hot summer day. Though all severe shortcomings are buffered by courteous staff, it is not worth the rate paid for.",2,2013,09,29
207,Old world charm amidst the city centre buzz,"Located in the city centre, this property has 5 star rating. At the time of check-in, guests are welcomed by a host of staff impeccably groomed. Cookies and chilled lemonade was served. While waiting at the reception, large LCD TV displays photographs of celebrities and dignitaries that have stayed in this hotel. There's museum room which houses ledgers with names of all the guests. It's interesting to browse through those pages; take you back in time.

The room was comfortable with all the  basic necessities, however there was no view to rave about. In fact, we faced an old commercial building with offices. Which meant, the drapes had to be shut. That said,there's an extensive menu with great choices of food even in the wee hours at the Horse Shoe Bar. The drink menu is vast and the has the best Irish Coffee in the city. The staff are friendly, professional and knowledgeable.Finger food was plated well.

Overall, this one's for those with wanting to splurge and enjoy Irish hospitality.",4,2013,09,28
207,Afternoon coffee,We did not stay just popped in for a coffee. Excellent location opposite the park. Staff were very nice and friendly . The coffee and cakes were extremely nice . All enjoyed in a plush setting. We did not have time to eat but the menu looked nice and not to expensive . If you want a nice relaxed coffee go here and not to the famous Bewleys coffee house.,5,2013,09,28
207,"The Shelbourne, Dublin","An excellent choice of hotel.  I am led to believe the hotel has recently undergone a refurb.  I can't fault it.  The leisure facilities, i.e. pool/steam room/sauna were really beautiful and pristine.  Our room was lovely.  Breakfast was included in our stay and extremely tasty.  We stayed for two nights and unfortunately didn't get the time to have dinner at the hotel.  All staff were very pleasant and helpful.  I can't say anything negative and would definitely like to stay at this hotel again in the future.",5,2013,09,27
207,Luxe in Dublin.,"If you want to splurge and enjoy old world luxury, this is it.  From check in to our departure - all first class. We were treated to tea and pastries as we waited for our room to be ready.  The room was very comfortable and beautifully decorated including robes. Breakfast was extensive including salmon eggs, sausage etc or eggs cooked to order.

This is a five star hotel.

Bravo. ",5,2013,09,27
207,Pampered!,"Cashed in hubby's Marriott reward points to stay here the last couple of nights of our trip to Ireland.  Even for a hotel this nice, the customer service was beyond our expectations!  Can't ever remember being treated more royally by all staff miners we came into contact with.  Great location, too!  ",5,2013,09,27
207,First Class Experience,"This is a Dublin landmark hotel in the city center, and the Shelbourne lives up to it's reputation as a world class hotel on every level.
Consistency is the key to the Shelbourne.  The doormen always greet you with a direct and welcoming gaze.  There is always a beautiful and lush arrangement of flowers in the lobby to capture your attention.  Check in procedures are generally efficient and smooth.  Even if there is a bit of a wait, the staff chats you up like a VIP so you don't really mind so much after all.  Once you are in your room, you will notice how well appointed it is.  The heavy draperies, the high thread count of the sheets and the amazing down pillows.  Additionally, but most importantly, the rooms appear soundproof to almost any outside noise.  Temperature control is easily adjusted to the proper degree you desire in a matter of minutes as well.

Having had the pleasure of staying in the Shelbourne on many occasions, I find that the staff is what sets this hotel apart from the rest.  They make every encounter seem like you are an old friend and any request is met effortlessly.  

Feel confident in booking into the Shelbourne for your next visit to Dublin and begin the tradition of having this be your home away from home. You will not be disappointed.",5,2013,09,27
207,Superb stay in our own city,"We decided to treat ourselves to a decadent stay in our own town for our anniversary and the Shelbourne didn't disappoint.  Wonderful staff, great ambiance, super room and excellent breakfast... it was everything we hoped for and more.  Don't need to big up the location... it speaks for itself!",5,2013,09,26
207,Top Class Hotel with Irish Hospitality,"We enjoyed our 3 day visit to Dublin and this Hotel. If you have never driven in Dublin, it is a great deal of fun finding the hotel and ending up in front of it without a GPS that knows about one way streets. We were greeted by a very nice doorman who took care of our luggage and the rental car. All the employees were very friendly and professional. It was pricey but enjoyable including the buffet breakfast. We could get anything we desired for breakfast. Hope to come back some day, but will not drive in the city again.",5,2013,09,25
207,Forever in my heart!!!,"My fiance and I stayed here during the last leg of our Ireland trip. We stayed for 3 nights (9/15 - 18/13). Having no point of reference (as our first time) in Dublin, we made the PERFECT choice for a hotel and location.  The Shelbourne is directly located across the street from St. Stephen's Green Park.  This park is extraordinary and a ""must see"". This hotel is also near a ""hop on/off"" bus stop, which was an ideal way for us to see this great/interesting/beautiful city.

THE HOTEL:
The Shelbourne - from the moment we arrived, which was pretty late at night (we had our hotel, from Scotland, let them know we would be a ""late arrival""); to our departure (which elicits homesickness); this hotel is spectacular.  Not only in the architecture, history and service.  But in the nuances of their specialty drinks in their bar.  Their breakfast buffet is magic.  Not only do they have a ""banana smoothie"" on hand, each morning, but a nice fellow made me (and others) a FRESH juice with the juicer.  It was quite a treat to not have to make at my home (and clean my juicer:)).  Each morning, I asked the chef to make me a sunny side egg and they were always so enthusiastic.

Our room was so delicious - from the soft comforters, the umbrella (which we needed to partake in); the slippers next to my bed - this and more, made our stay so memorable.

THE PEOPLE:
In the end, it will always be the people assisting/working at The Shelbourne.  From Alexandra - their new trainee at breakfast (what a great assist to their team); to Ashling - the hostess at morning breakfast - to Alan - the concierge - and to the wonderful/exciting/creative bar staff - who made us the great tasting, original and creative drinks and for teaching us about Middleton Whiskey.  I even ""lost"" my fiance (from the bar to the lobby) and the staff helped us reunite.  EVERY ONE at The Shelbourne (from the doormen to the front desk and ALL, in between) where so professional, helpful and friendly!

We are DEFINITELY going to stay again, in the near future, but bring more time.  This is a hotel which is a stand out among accommodations!!!",5,2013,09,24
207,Saturday night stay at shelbourne hotel Dublin,"Service very slow , I think it was  staff shortage overall , bags not delivered to room after 2 calls , 
Food in bar was very good buy service poor . 

This is not as good as it was previously .The breakfast has deteriorated , as there were no fresh berries on offer , just chunks of apples , melons and the like .

The afternoon tea is superb and there is no one rushing you out the door .",3,2013,09,23
207,My Choice Hotel in Dublin...Return Regularly,"Returned this year to the Shelbourne Dublin, a Marriott property, for maybe my 7th stay. Always helpful and friendly staff.

When I arrived early from US at 8 am, early-checkin rooms were not available. So was offered complimentary access to the Health Club to shower and change clothes. Then luggage was stored. Room was available by noon, and much appreciated. 

Room also has one plug for US power. Nice touch. Still helpful that you bring an adapter to use other outlets.

Breakfast buffet in the Saddle Room is a standout, but pricy at €29. This is not a Sunday Brunch price, but a daily price. You'll need to take out a loan if you're a family with kids. Lots of fresh fruit options too. Chef even made for me hash potatoes on request.  

Small Detail That I Enjoy about the Property:  You can open your windows and enjoy the Dublin Air.

Tip:  In the morning, complimentary coffee is offered, but you have to find it hidden in a hallway. Advertised as using Brazilian Arabica beans.

Small Gripe:  Free Wi-Fi requires constant re-logon. A major annoyance, and technically unnecessary. Others had the same problem, so suspect a stupid policy.",5,2013,09,22
207,Class Act,"Its been a society staple and retains its standards and position well. 
The service deliverd and atmosphere created is top notch and their management of a hotel full of ( to be fair ) drunks is simply superb.the horseshoe bar is an institution that continue to deliver to its lifelong customers who flitter in from overseas or just down the road.
Love this place ......",5,2013,09,21
207,A wonderful stay at a lovely hotel,Our time in Dublin was based from The Shelbourne. This is a top of the line establishment.  Every staff member is professional and makes certain that the guest is fully accommodated. Thank you for a lovely stay.,5,2013,09,20
207,Afternoon tea well worth it!,"I took my wife to The Shelbourne for afternoon tea last weekend for her birthday and I'm so glad I did. Afternoon tea at the Shelbourne is a 2 hour experience really. We went for the champagne option so we started with this and I must say it was a very full glass. You get the menu then to choose what kind of tea you may like and it is very extensive.

Your sandwiches arrive with you tea. These were lovely and a selection of very filling sandwiches. Not your typical cucumber sandwich that would not fill a hole in your tooth.

Next came the tiers! Warm scones and ginger bread covered in linen. Plenty of raspberry and clotted cream to go with these also. Absolutely gorgeous!

And finally the cakes. I can't even remeber what they were called but there was a merangue, a mouse, a chocolate mouse in the shape of a pear. One of them each by the way!

The atmosphere is very peaceful and the Lord Mayors lounge is a very ornate and comfortable room. All in all an excellent experience that I will be doing again.",5,2013,09,19
207,The shining Heart in Dublin,"This beautiful landmark hotel knows how to care for an international set while still maintaining the charm of the Irish. Centrally located just off St. Stephen's Green, and near to Grafton Street and Trinity College - this grand dam pampers to your every need. Yes she is pricey, but for comfort in a city center she is well worth the cost. Enjoy a comfortable stay here.",5,2013,09,18
207,Can't do better in Dublin.,"This hotel is beautiful with all the 5 star amenities. Rooms are spacious with very comfortable beds. Location is central and easy walking to most anything you'd want. The hotel restaurant is exceptional and if you want a little personal pampering, there is  very good spa with very reasonable rates.",5,2013,09,18
207,Excellent,"I travel a lot for business all over the world. Most of my stays are at Marriott properties. This hotel has the most unbelievable service of any hotel Ive ever stayed in,equal to the Ritz Carlton. It also has character,for the last 100 years dignitaries from all over have stayed here. The food in the hotel was excellent and so were the drinks. The location could not be any better.
I never have time to write reviews but I had to for this one. ITS % STAR ALL THE WAY.",5,2013,09,17
207,Just plain wonderful,"Cannot think of a nicer place we have visited.  Staff knowledgeable and friendly.  Well positioned hotel just off St. Stephans Green.  Easy walk to Grafton St. for shopping.  Great restaurant in the hotel as well as a comfortable bar.  They also had the availability of a ""High Tea"" in the afternoon but at 55 euro, a bit on the pricey side.  
Rooms large (realtively speaking) and comfortable.  
Just cannot say enough about the quality that Renaissance has at this facility.  Way to go Marriott.",5,2013,09,17
207,Excellent city center hotel,"I have stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel several times over the last five years, and the most recent stay was just as good as the last.  The hotel is centrally located across from St. Stephen's Green, around the corner from Grafton St, and an easy walk to any location in central Dublin.  For those who want to use the Hop on Hop off bus to tour Dublin, it stops just across the street.  The level of detail to furnishings and decor is impressive, and as good as any hotel you will find in Europe.  

The hotel manages to maintain a level of elegance that remains comfortable and inviting.  The bars and restaurant are very active, with attentive service.  The morning buffet is extensive, and the white linen table service is always a nice touch.  For a great pub experience go to O'Donoghue's, about a block and a half from the hotel, which almost always has live traditional music.  For a good steak dinner go to FXB, about two blocks from the hotel.

The hotel can be more expensive that other hotels in Dublin, but as they say - you get what you pay for.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2013,09,17
207,Central Location Beats Property Flaws,"Hat's off to the top staff at the Shelbourne and in my opinion the most friendly and knowledgeable i've experienced. Clean and efficient with attention to detail. Nice main bar with small secondary bar for those who like more of a pub feel. Breakfast buffet was fine but basic for about 18 euros. Decent size rooms.
The cons: room views of back of hotel look straight at an office building...i could read the titles of the manuals stacked on desks. Bed was a bit mushy. Weekday rate shot up a 100 euros!
Would I go back? Sure, but, i would check other hotels with modern amenities without sacrificing location.",4,2013,09,17
207,Wonderful staff and great location...,"We stayed here for two nights last week and had a nice stay.  The staff are wonderful and helped us move in to a better room after they stuck us in a pretty terrible one the first night.  (We got in super late the first night and they gave us the last room they had with no tub and a view of the back alley full of kegs behind the restaurant.)  Great location on a huge park, so if you're a runner, it's perfect.  Also super close to downtown so you can walk everywhere.  The biggest drawbacks are price related.  I thought the rooms were pricey for the smaller size that they are and they absolutely over charge for car parking.  Get ready to shell out $25 euro a day which I think is ridiculous.  Overall, great staff...",4,2013,09,17
207,Perfect place to spend a romantinc weekend,"Perfect place to spend a romantinc weekend. Very nice hotel, lobby and employees. Buffet for breaksfast is just amazing, I have never ever seen such a big buffet with high quality food and juices. Room was not that impresive but the hotel was amazing in general.",5,2013,09,16
207,An oasis in the middle of Dublin,"Warm, friendly, upscale Marriott Renaissance hotel right in the heart of Dublin. Rooms are excellent and service outstanding. Right in the heart of the city with great access to all sights and attractions and with walking distance to Trinity College. Concierge very helpful. Highly recommended!!",5,2013,09,14
207,Beautiful historic hotel near everything in Dublin but breakfast too late,"When I booked this hotel using Marriott points, I did not expect it to be so lovely. It is a beautiful historic hotel on St Stephen's Green (great location).  It even has its own history museum of events at and guests of the hotel.  The staff were helpful with directions and dining suggestions.
Everything in the hotel is traditional decor - which suits the building.  It appears to have merged with another building as there are stairs in the middle of the hallway (the staff offer to help with bags if that is an issue).  The rooms are a bit small but not more than one might expect in a big city old hotel.  Some of the hallways are very narrow. Our room was fairly far from the elevators.
Check in was a bit confusing as for some reason they had me registered as someone else with the same last name.
As a Marriott Platinum, my rate included breakfast.  It was a true European breakfast - a gorgeous buffet and a la carte.  Everything was delicious. There was even a juice maker for goodness sake!  
The spa was quite lovely and serene in the middle of the city.  There are mid-week specials for hotel guests.  It is a bit confusing to get there because of the mix of stairs and elevators.
The hotel bar is lively and gorgeous with fabulous cocktails. It was the perfect place to start the evening with a drink before we went out to dinner.
The only negative was that the weekend breakfast opened later than during the week.  I had hoped to eat before my morning flight to the US but it was not yet open.  In retrospect, I should have just asked for a piece of fruit as I trust they would have given it to me.",5,2013,09,14
207,Everything excellent,"Last minute booking secured us a small double room at an excellent room rate. The room was very much smaller than we are accustomed to but it was perfectly adequate and for what we paid it was very good value. Compact bathroom, super comfortable bed,quiet corridor,excellent breakfast. Efficient , helpful and very friendly staff everywhere. Great location for easy access to everything .",5,2013,09,12
207,Eating at the Shelbourne,"Called in for evening meal at the early bird price.  Stunning, and incredible value.  Staff could not have been more welcoming. Each course was exquisitely presented.  It was fun to watch the chefs at work and the training the new staff were being given.",5,2013,09,11
207,Absolutely stunning,"Stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel, off St Stephens Square, Dublin for three nights.  Stunning history to this hotel, it was established in the 1800's the hotel is beautiful with a great history, pop into the small museum showing pictures of past residents from Errol Flynn to the Kennedys, through to Bill Clinton and Princess Grace. The Room 27 Bar is very popular, has a lovely feeling about it and does a great daily curry special.  All the staff were lovely, helpful and very very friendly even though it was extremely busy at the time with the Hurling Final on Sunday.  Large room, gigantic comfortable bed, fluffy robes and slippers and the most enormous waterfall  shower head you've ever seen.  Great location, fantastic food, lovely staff. A great experience all round, and cant wait to go back.",5,2013,09,10
207,"Great location, but some rooms are pretty average","I am going to give a slightly different perspective.  I would give this hotel a 3.5 if I could- really between average an very good.  It has a great history and the public rooms are pretty, however as a tourist who stayed in an average room - it wasn't as special as the other places we stayed in Ireland.  I love architecture and one of the disappointments was that there wasn't really a lounge to hang out and read in and enjoy the architecture.  Aside from the tea room or the bar, there are only 2 chairs and a small couch in the entryway.  I saw other reviews about marble bathrooms and I am sure they are nice and a view of the green would be fantastic, but we were in a deluxe room but it was at the back of the hotel with no view and low ceilings (compared to everywhere else we stayed in Ireland).  It had a nice shower and temperature controls (we actually needed the air conditioning), so it was perfectly comfortable.  The bed was very comfortable.  Our room however could have been any Hyatt, Marriott, or Westin in America.  The breakfast was fine - probably my least favorite of the trip.  The staff however, is fantastic - very friendly and helpful.  Choose your room carefully and I am sure you will be happy.  The hotel certainly hosts just about ever celebrity to hit Dublin and has a fantastic history.  The location is great too for shopping and sightseeing.  For us, the room just lacked the charm of the other places we stayed on the trip.",4,2013,09,09
207,Outstanding,"Location, service and staff all made this a truly wonderful stay.  Our two nights at the Shelbourne lived up to what we had read from other travellers. Although it was extremely busy at the hotel the staff were friendly and very responsive.  A huge thumbs up to the Doormen who went out of their way to be helpful and offer assistance in what ever way they could.   We stayed in an Executive heritage suite and it was very spacious and had old world charm.  Definitely a great place to stay in Dublin.",5,2013,09,09
207,Great service under pressure,"Stayed three nights, very friendly staff, good service, on night one had a room with a disability  bathroom / shower, normally would not bother us but it did this time, they where very full and had no problem moving us next day, the park right opposite is beautiful. Our breakfast was included and very good.",5,2013,09,09
207,Brilliant birthday weekend,"Have just returned from a weekend trip to The Shelbourne. What a wonderful hotel. Every single member of staff was polite and helpful. The city was busy with football on Friday and the All Ireland final today and yet we were made to feel as though we were the only ones that mattered. The food is fantastic and we particularly loved the jazz brunch today. 
Would definitely go back and would recommend this hotel to you all.",5,2013,09,08
207,My favourite hotel in Dublin....,I love this hotel and try to ensure I stay here whenever I visit Dublin.  Of late the Shelbourne has been booked solid but worth the wait if you are able.  The Shelbourne is located in the heart of Dublin whilst being far enough away from the loud party croud so you can get a peaceful sleep.,5,2013,09,08
207,"Iconic Landmark Hotel in Centre of Dublin, facing St. Stephen's Green","Beautifully restored hotel, right in the heart of Dubliln.  Facing St. Stephen's Green, Dublin's main park.  Excellent restaurants and bars in this hotel.   Rooms beautifully appointed, lovely marble bathroom.  Beautiful spa and treatments.  Staff and service at this hotel is top notch.  If you can treat yourself while in Dublin stay here, if not simply go and either have afternoon tea, a drink or some food.  Prices for food are comparable to many of the restaurants in Dublin but service is excellent.  Horseshoe bar is famous and you might likely bump into celebrities at this watering hole.",5,2013,09,08
207,Best in Dublin,"Stayed last week at the Shelbourne. What a great experience. First of all, the staff was the most helpful and profession staff I have ever experienced, start to finish, from the front desk all the way to housekeeping. The hotel is beautiful and really classy. It is well maintained, and in a perfect location. Loved the Horsehoe Bar!  This will be the only place I will stay in Dublin, without a doubt. Congratulations to the management. Cheers!",5,2013,09,07
207,Historic Dublin---Afternoon Tea.,"You will fail to discover all of Historic Dublin unless you visit The Shelbourne Hotel.  If you can't room there, you can certainly visit for Afternoon Tea.
Once in the hotel, you can see draft copies of Treaties that reveal the hopes of the emergent Nation.  There is also a roster of Hollywood Stars who made The Shelbourne their home.
Afternoon Tea is served in The Lord Mayor's Lounge, so named because the incumbent Lord Mayor ( who lives around the corner) visits here at least once a year.
The room itself has the appearance of one furnished for comfort with little regard to cost. When. you add good taste to the equation, you regard a sparkling setting.
When there, you can choose from a great number of different teas.  The food is a delight.
I went with my two adult daughters, they praised the charm and skill of the Parisian Maitre d' who supervised, or rather choreographed the service, with absolute discretion.
It was a sparkling scene; thus I would recommend the Champagne version of the Tea: so you will feel sparkling too!
As you relax, enjoy, and appreciate this luxurious setting; you could be forgiven if your mind drifts back, to a much earlier time: when it was possible to plan an insurrection in such comfort.  You still can.",5,2013,09,07
207,Never thought I'd get instant coffee in a 5 star!,Around 2006-2008 we stayed a lot in this hotel and loved it. Ut was luxurious with great customer care. In 2010 we had dinner in the restaurant and service was so poor/rude that I wrote to complain and never went back...until we got a gift of a night + dinner . So we went last Saturday night. Our dinner included coffee and petit fours.. arrived instant coffee and 4 biscuits. Our waitress confirmed it was instant coffee (aparently they don't have ground decaf!). The biscuits were swiftly replaced by a plate of very nice macarons through. Service in the restaurant could be a lot warmer (a smile is always nice). The rooms are lovely but we had to move room (at our insistence) after midnight as ours (room 773) was noisy with what felt like turbines. We were told initially they did not know what the problem was but we found out later this has been a recurring problem giving us the impression that customer care is not their priority. Coffee was incredibly weak at breakfast and toasts were cold (again all changed but after we made it known!). Not great for a five star. Pity as we used to love it.,3,2013,09,05
207,Afternoon tea,"From the moment I entered the hotel I felt special, the upkeep is fantastic, we had a beautiful table.
Started our tea with two glasses of champagne in love intrinsic flutes and was served by the most darling waitress  ( I think her name was Abigail) . The selection of teas and food was fantastic.

Wish I hadn't had my breakfast that morning however as we had to take some home with us.

Absolute perfection!",5,2013,09,05
207,Perfection.,"My wife and I traveled to the great city of Dublin for the first time. This hotel is in a  great location, close to many of the best areas to visit. We were just a short distance from Trinity College, across the street from St Stephen's Grren, a couple of blocks from Grafton Street,  and the Temple Bar area. The staff at the hotel was simply marvelous. They really took the time to help us on any need we may have had, and did so with a smile. When we go back, we will surely stay here again.",5,2013,09,04
207,Beautiful & Historic,"This is a beautiful place to stay in Dublin.  The history here is a bonus.  They have a small museum in the lobby, check it out.  The rooms are your standard Marriott room.  Good bed & linens, nice toiletries.  Our only complaint is that we were put in an accessible room & the shower would run over & onto the carpet in the bedroom which made the carpet outside the bathroom door wet( it was wet when we checked in).   Our kids had a ""regular"" room & it was very pleasant.  
The location is great.  Across from St. Stephen's Green which is lovely.  It is also close to the tour busses that take you around the city.  And lots of restaurants within walking distance.
The bar was busy the night we checked it out but the bartender was attentive & nice.  The breakfast buffet was excellent & service was friendly.  It seems like locals & tourists were there dining during lunch & dinner so it a popular place for all.",4,2013,09,04
207,Amazing Ireland Trip,Three days in Dublin at the Shelbourne was wonderful.  Service was top notch with wonderful staff.  Excellent food at restaurant and bar. Rooms were very good size and beds were extremely comfortable. Convenient location for walking to almost everything.,5,2013,09,04
207,Fantastic charm and atmosphere,"Stayed in the Shelbourne for two nights in August and it was great. I love the atmosphere once you go through the door. The staff are great especially at reception. They are very friendly and make you feel very special.
We had a fabulous room on top floor with great view. I love the charm, classic, sophisticated feel to the hotel. We didn't eat here as it is in such a good location there are many restaurants on its doorstep. 
This was my third time since Dec 2012 to stay here and it never fails to disappoint me. I look forward to our next visit.",5,2013,09,04
207,The Best of Dublin,"As an airline crew member I stay at hotels all over the world.  The Shelbourne Dublin is truly one of the best !  Best location, friendly staff that goes out of their way for you, beautiful accomodations with probably the most comfortable bed ive ever slept In.  The Hotel and its people are stunning in every way.  She is a grand old lady rich in history.  I truly experience the world on a hotel level and when asked my favorite hotel, I tell everyone the Shelbourne, Dublin.   Special thanks to an amazing employee Jack Fitzsimmons who always exceeds expectations in his customer service delivery.  I have never seen a hotel employee walk the halls of a hotel with such reverence and truly loves and respects not only his job, but the amazing historic building he works in.   He is a complete asset to the Shelbourne Renaissance and most crew members of this airline look forward to his smiling face upon arrival.   Could not ask for a better representation of the Irish people and the heritage of the Shelbourne.    Look forward to many more stays in the future.  I can't thank all the staff enough. The bring the word Gracious to a whole new level.",5,2013,09,03
207,"Wonderful Service, Great Location","Very nice hotel in the heart of a beautiful part of Dublin. Easy walking distance to Grafton St, Temple Bar Area and of course St. Stephens Green.  Hotel was nice, we stayed in a King room with a courtyard view. Room was a bit dated but renovations start on the Hotel September 2013. I think this will bring it to 5 stars. Service was excellent across the board.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,09,03
207,Charming and lively,"We stayed in the Shelbourne for 3 nights and the accommodations were fantastic.  Very classic and sophisticated decor, comfortable rooms, and extremely friendly staff made our stay special.  The only reason I did not give this hotel a 5 was because of the noise.  They were extremely busy with weddings and the volume was very high.  Our room was near the staircase that leads down to the lobby and the noise rose up to our room making it difficult to settle down and go to sleep.  Even with this, we would stay there again!",4,2013,09,03
207,What dreams are made of,"There is certainly a reason why the Shelbourne is the first port of call among celebrities and royalty alike. I have stayed twice in this fabulous hotel and on both occassions have been treated like royalty from start to finish.

The foyer area is reminisint of a French palace and the rooms are so spacious, clean and luxourious that you are instantly taken to cloud nine. The decor is second to none and the beds are the most comfotable beds I've slept in to date. The baths are elegant and spacious with many having a view overlooking St Stephen's Green Park.

The bar serve the best cocktails in Dublin and the food and breakfast is divine. The location is ideal for anyone sight seeing, shopping, going to the theatre or for those who just want a central location. 10/10.",5,2013,09,02
207,"Good hotel, good location but no lobby and a charge for room service","The premier room we stayed in was nice. It was spacious and clean, and everything about it was perfectly adequate. There was nothing fussy nor complicated - just a plain decent room with high ceilings and an OK bed (not the most comfortable bed in the world). There was turn down and water, as you'd expect, but there was a 4 EURO charge for room service - not something you'd expect. When we pointed out that this was an unusual policy for a hotel, they gladly waived the 4 EURO charge, however, the point was obviously not registered. We don't really care that the fee was waived - it was more the principal of the thing. When you pay 500 EURO a night for a hotel room, you expect room service as standard - not only if you pay a 4 EURO charge. That is one ding on the notches.

The other ding was simply the lack of a lobby. We wanted to sit somewhere to have tea yesterday afternoon. The bar was busy and you could only sit in there if you ordered a drink, the room across the hall was in the middle of serving afternoon tea - which meant that you had to order the full tea service (40 EURO per head). Leaving nowhere for guests to use as a lobby once they had checked out of their room. In hindsight, we should have asked for late checkout. 

Fortunately for us, there is a very nice hotel within a short walk with an extremely nice lobby where they welcomed us to sit for an hour with tea and a paper. If we come back to Dublin, we'll be staying there and not at the Shelbourne.",3,2013,09,02
207,Superb,"There are only a handful of hotels in Dublin where you can expect such a high level of service.  The rooms are great, the food is great and the cocktails are brilliant as well.

My only concern is the rest of the clientele that are allowed in at the weekend solely to use the bar.  They sort of drag the place down a bit.  Maybe a stricter door policy?",5,2013,09,02
207,A dream come true:,"We stayed at the shelbourne hotel for the Ireland vEngland rugby game.Such a buzz at the hotel.The team stayed there also,and I had a photo with simon zeebo at the lift after he returned from hospital after an injury..much to my disgust my photo was blurred,i know it was him mind so it's my memory of the Shelbourne ,and also a family link,my mother;s gran aunt is Maureen O Hara the actress who also stayed at the hotel.....I treasured 2 wonderful nights with my lovely man paul and hope anyone going to this hotel knows just how very proud Ireland should be to have THE SHELBOURNE HOTEL ,to offer all coming to such a beautiful country,the best hotel,staff all wonderful and would bend over backwards for you,which is rare,but here in the heart of Dublin a treasure,,,,,so 100% To the Shelbourne Hotel,without the wonderful staff it would be nothing.So well done all at The ShelbourneXXxxxxx Will be back soon",5,2013,08,30
207,In The Heart of the City,"our stay at the Shelbourne was excellent!  The hotel is in City Center and convenient to everything.  Grafton Street is a short walk and so aren't many pubs and restaurants. The hotel had very friendly and efficient staff. Wake up calls, extra service from housekeeping and information about attractions etc. were only a phone call away.  When we arrived at 5:30 in the morning, they quickly found a room for us to sleep in until ours was ready. Great service in an historical and gracious hotel.",5,2013,08,29
207,First trip to Ireland,"We only stayed one night at The Shelbourne, but wished we had booked more nights here. Everything was first class all the way.  The location is perfect.  The front desk staff went out of there way to make our stay very special.  We were upgraded to a suite.  The only negative is the sevice in the Bar 27 can be a bit slow....it is very crowed and a good people watching spot....still loved everything about it.",5,2013,08,29
207,Excellent hotel,"I love staying at Shelbourne hotel on my business trips to Dublin.  Great location, extremely beautiful hotel with so much history.  Having a pot of tea in their cozy tea launge is always my preference after a busy day.",5,2013,08,29
207,Great place to stay in Dublin Ireland,"Beautiful decor, great staff, good location, wonderful breakfast. Stayed on Arrival in Dublin and again night before departure. I couldn't believe that most of the staff recognized us and remembered our name, after travelling around Ireland for a week.  I highly reccomend staying here. They had their act together, always.",4,2013,08,27
207,"Centrally located, gracious property, but be careful of the rooms...","The Shelbourne is centrally located on St Stephens Green. The park is across the street and lovely. You're minutes from everything-- Grafton Street, Trinity College -- everything is within walking distance. The hotel is a grand old dame-- the facilities quite lovely. The people at the fromt desk were very nice. However, the double beds in our rooms were very small. We booked the hotel through Aer Lingus and clearly those bookings get lesser rooms. Throughout Ireland, we've had lovely large rooms or two rooms for my family of 4. We arrived here and our room has the smallest double beds I've ever encountered. Even my children were on top of each other. We all had difficulty sleeping. Couple that with a view of interior walls and other people's rooms-- this was a great disappointment. I asked about an upgrade and was told no-- unless we paid an additional 100 euros. I was surprised that empty rooms go empty as opposed to satisfying guests. If you book here, and I don't know that I will again, be sure to specify the size of your bed-- not a double - and request a view of the park or or of the city. 
I contacted guest relations and received no response.
Breakfast came with our room and was a big buffet style. There was lots to choose from and we were quite pleased with it.",3,2013,08,27
207,A Lovely Place to Stay,Myself and my husband stayed in the Shelbourne Hotel last Saturday night. We really enjoyed our stay. Our room was beautiful and the staff were very friendly and attentive. We ate in the Saddle Room and the food was delicious and reasonably priced too. The spa area is very nice and a welcome addition to the hotel. A lovely experience all around and the service in the hotel was second to none !,5,2013,08,27
207,"The Shelbourne, a classic, lovely distinguished hotel.","Stayed for our wedding anniversary at the Shelbourne. Guest Relations and reservations were great in arranging my requests for arrival to surprise my wife. 
It is a busy Hotel, but they coped well, taking good Care of us all through the stay.
We would love to return!",5,2013,08,27
207,Always a favorite hotel in Dublin,"I had the great pleasure to stop over en route to a wedding recently, and as on previous occasions, The Shelbourne did not disappoint. The room could only be described as sumptuous, with a lovely view out over the city. Staff were as usual excellent, managing to be attentive and friendly, yet understated.  The location is perfect for walking around town. I managed to squeeze in a spot of shopping, catching up with friends, attending a gig and some late night dining, get a good night's sleep, have a great breakfast from the largest selection I've ever seen and still be on my way the next morning (although it was SO tempting to stay longer at breakfast!)",4,2013,08,26
207,Far exceeded expectations,"Beautiful rooms, luxurious and comfortable.  Wow - much nicer than I anticipated.  The staff were friendly, very helpful and the service was on par with what you would expect in Ireland... the very best that service can be.  Room service was prompt and the food was good.  This place has a very nice pool, spa and exercise facility.  Again, much more and better than I expected.  I felt like for the price, they over-delivered.",5,2013,08,24
207,The shelbourne a historic luxury hotel,Staying in the shelbourne was a special treat. Very upscale and treated with the utmost attention. The rooms are luxurious and the bathrooms are beautiful marble!  This is a hotel that has been stayed in by many well renown people throughout the world. Location is key here as you can walk throughout dublin and hit many great spots or catch a sightseeing bus right across the street. You have st. Stephens park one block away which is wonderful.highly reccmmend this extravagant hotel.,5,2013,08,24
207,Excellent Location -,"I stayed there for seven days and was really looking forward to staying there based on all the positive reviews.  I was traveling by myself so I only reserved the Queen room.  The room was so small that I could not imagine more than one person with luggage sharing the room.  There wasn't a dresser or chest of drawers so I ended up living out of my suitcase the entire time I was there. My television broke the second night there and was never fixed even though I reported it at the front desk twice.  The mini bar in the room was completely empty.  I really wonder if I was put in a room that wasn't supposed to be used.  Even with the negatives, the bed was very comfortable and I slept very well.
 
The location was convenient for everything.  It Is directly across the street from St. Stephen's Green.  I really miss walking over to St. Stephen's Green in the morning before the crowds got arrived.  

The breakfast was included in my rate.  It was very good and I cannot say enough good things about the Saddle Room morning staff.  Every one was very friendly and attentive.  

I really enjoyed the Relaxation Room at the Spa.  It was quiet and overlooked the street.  The view of the park and the traffic was almost hypnotic and was exactly what I needed after a long day of travel.

The concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable.  He was always willing to give you suggestions and directions.

I spent almost every afternoon in the No. 27 bar and cannot compliment the drinks and the staff enough during the week.  They were fantastic.  The atmosphere of the hotel completely changed on the weekend.  Every thing was crowded and they didn't seem able to handle the weddings and the crowds.  The  weekend bar staff were not very attentive at all. 

While I was disappointed, I think my experience was an exception to the great reviews on this site.  I will definitely consider giving this old gem another try.",3,2013,08,22
207,Inconsistent,"By international 5 star standards I would have given the hotel an Average rating for the total experience. However, given the experience with the service, I would mark it below average.
The room is inconsipicious and so forgettable that on my 2nd visit in the second half of my visit to Dublin I could not remember anything about the decor of the room. The mattress and pillows are so soft you sink into them and wake up with a sore neck and back
While conveniently located to shops and the sights, the location also meant that the rooms faced other buildings, and at close quarters as well... so much so that you could see into the rooms of the adjacent buildings. (this somehow takes away from the 5 star experience ... although there's not much the hotel can do about this, I guess) 
Never mind the room, poor sleep quality, inconsipicious decor or looking into your neighbours ,... service would have made up for most of the 'downs'. 
There are customers who do have a preference of where they sit, as it adds to their dining experience - and if the customer requests for the table, especially if it is available , not reserved and if the alternative they offer is a table that is 6 inches from the next., it would be prudent for the manager to allow them the table.
Not good value for the money",2,2013,08,22
207,Luxury and style in Dublin,"We booked a three night stay at the Shelbourne through the hotel direct, first two nights were discounted to a great deal with the third at standard rate. It is pricey but as they say you get what you pay for and in our view worth the extra. Staff are excellent, very friendly and helpful - rooms spacious and clean. The hotel is steeped in history with many famous guests staying there. The location puts you opposite St Stephens green park and close to Grafton street and Temple Bar. All the tour buses stop and pick up opposite the hotel.",5,2013,08,21
207,Highly Recommended,"This is a very busy place (one of the busiest lobbies I have ever seen) but the location is ideal for everything you want to do in Dublin.  It's pricey, but well worth it, as the rooms are exceptionally clean, spacious, comfortable, and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful.  Breakfasts were good, but seemed to be overpriced for what you get; however, there are many food options nearby if you decide to eat away from the hotel.  Free Wifi worked well, which kept the kids happy in the evenings, so no complaints there.  I would happily stay here again.",5,2013,08,19
207,Room that smelled of smoke - yuck,"When I first went into my room it really smelled of perfume.  I opened the window (only opened a tiny bit), hoping to air it when I went out for supper.  When I came back it really smelled badly of smoke.  It appeared they had sprayed perfume over the smell of smoke to disguise it.  I tried to get to sleep but the smell was too strong and the window wouldn't open wide enough to let air in.  Even the bedsheets smelled of smoke.  I called at midnight and they changed my room.  Had to pack up all my stuff to move room, then the key they gave me to my new room didn't work.  It was pretty disastrous, especially given how expensive the hotel is and I had a meeting the next day I really needed to be wide awake for.",1,2013,08,19
207,Wonderful luxurious weekend stay,"We booked at weekend at the Shelbourne through trivago, which gave us a great deal on 2 nights on a room only basis.  When we arrived, the excellent valet parking allowed us to hand over the keys and stroll in, great start. Then when we were checking in, the receptionist told us we were booked in for Bed and breakfast.  Not wanting to be charged 30 euro each, I showed her my confirmation letter, and she advised us that breakfast would be complimentary! The room was lovely, and all the staff were genuinely helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was superb, full buffet plus eggs benedict, pancakes, etc could be ordered fresh.  The Spa and health club area exceptionally clean and well kept. Good value massage and facial combo with a wonderful beauty therapist. Grafton street on your doorstep, honestly I could go on. Dont hesitate to book here for a luxury break for a couple. We didnt eat in the restaurant but we went to Il posto on the next block, which is a great little intimate Italian place.",5,2013,08,19
207,Wonderful experience,"We hosted a family event in the Shelbourne Hotel recently. Every aspect from planning to the actual event on the day was handled professionally and expertly. From the door staff and the reception who welcomed us warmly, to the event coordinator, Cathy, and her team, who saw to our every need, to James and his team who served us a superbly delicious dinner, we cannot find fault. We stayed overnight, the room was spacious, bed was comfortable and facilities were perfect. It was truly a wonderful experience...and we cannot wait to go back.",5,2013,08,19
207,Another Amazing Stay!,"We have just returned from spending two nights in The Shelbourne over my birthday weekend. All I can say is that we had an absolutely amazing weekend made all the more special with the help of JD and Mirta!
Upon arrival in our beautiful upgraded room there was a complimentary bottle of wine and beautiful dessert plate with happy birthday written on it. These touches is what make this hotel amazing and mean that people like myslef will return time and time again! 
Thank you once again for making my weekend so special!",5,2013,08,19
207,A wonderful stay!,"My wife and I spent 5 days here in July - our first visit to Dublin.  What a fabulous hotel! We arrived off a very early flight, getting to the hotel at 0830am. Assuming we were just going to leave our luggage, the receptionist informed us that a room was ready for us and she had upgraded us.  She gave us a choice of a room on the first floor or the 5th floor.  We opted for the first floor overlooking the street.  The room was stunning! The bathroom with its walk-in shower was larger than most living rooms and the daily supply of Elemis toiletries just made it even better. We also loved the fact that the maid carried out a turn-down service every evening - drapes were closed, lamps were put on and a bottle of water and a chocolate was left on each bedside cabinet.  OK - this hotel is pricey but, let's face it, you get what you pay for. The service from every member of staff we came into contact with was second to none. They could not do enough for us.  Nothing was too much trouble. The food is excellent - we had breakfast every morning in the Saddle Room and dinner in Bar 27 and also the Lord Mayors Lounge.  The buzz in Bar 27 is fantastic - have a cocktail and just take in the atmosphere and people-watch!  A wonderful stay in a historic hotel.",5,2013,08,18
207,Service should be a 6,"Stayed here last night for anniversary. Was greeted by guest relations manager upon check in. Staff couldn't do enough and everyone so polite and customer service focused. 
Location is superb. Front bar as usual full of people and great atmosphere. I was in the pool for the first time and it is very nice.  Breakfast this morning in the saddle room had only one problem. Too much choice. 
Looking forward to returning. ",5,2013,08,18
207,"Historic, luxurious hotel on St. Stephen's Green","Loved it.  Gorgeous room, attentive staff, great location.  Excellent breakfast included.  Electrical outlets work for all countries.  Who could ask for more?!  This is a Renaissance property and we have never been disappointed when visiting their hotels.",5,2013,08,18
207,Favorite hotel during two week stay,"The Shelbourne is a magnificent hotel from start to finish.  Although our rooms were not ready upon arrival, all was quickly forgiven upon checking in to our magnificent accommodations.  The staff are extremely friendly and cheerful and anxious to assist in any way.  The service staff in the dining room and pub are outstanding.  The pool and health club facilities are first-rate for athletes at any level.  Proximity to the park, shopping and great restaurants (Thornton's) is perfect.  Enjoy your visit to this classic hotel.",5,2013,08,18
207,Staff great. JD is a great manager,I found JD to be very helpful and engaged. He works very hard to make guests happy.  Breakfast has been great and location is wonderful. I would recommend this hotel and if you have an issue.  See JD.  Enjoy.,5,2013,08,18
207,Classic stylish Hotel,"The Shelbourne is a stylish hotel full of Irish history and charm. The staff are all friendly, helpful and pleased to assist. Other reviews mention that the drinks are expensive, but they are all over Dublin and it's worth paying a bit more for the ambiance of the surroundings. We were on a short break for a family birthday celebration and the hotel were very accommodating and friendly when we checked in. We felt privileged to stay in such a beautiful hotel in a brilliant location, where most of the main attractions are within easy walking distance.",5,2013,08,17
207,Best accommodations in Dublin,"If you are making a trip to Ireland, this is the hotel for you.  A little pricey, but totally worth it.  Rooms are fabulous, staff throughout the hotel, maids, front desk, concierge, doorman, rooms service, restaurant staff, all A plus performance.  Made you feel like they wanted you to be in their lives. They lived to serve and went above and beyond to ensure you stay is perfect.",5,2013,08,17
207,Five Star all the way!,I have stayed at The Shelbourne several times over the last 25 years & have never been disappointed. I have stayed at most of Dublin's five star hotels but nothing comes near this. The location is perfect & there is always a buzz about the place. On a 3 day visit this week we were upgraded (without asking) to a Heritage Suite. It was amazing with beautiful views over St. Stephens Green & the Dublin Mountains. If you want to treat yourself to a little bit of old style luxury this is the place! The food is fabulous. We had breakfast in our suite each morning & had supper each evening in the Lord Mayors Lounge where there is a wonderful light supper menu. Don't be put off by negative reviews this place is still No.1  in Dublin. Looking forward to my next visit at Easter.,5,2013,08,17
207,Disappointing stay,"We arrived at this hotel only to find they did not have a room for us their excuse was the air conditioning was broken in our rooms ,so they had booked us into the Four Season for the night and that they would pay for our taxi as this hotel was about 15 mins out of town the next day we were booked on a tour so we couldn't come back in the morning so they paid for a taxi to bring our bags back to the hotel, we arrived back there about 6.30pm and checked into our room the bags were there after waiting about 20mins my husband had to go down and show them which ones were ours we were told on the first day we would be looked after as far as an upgrade but that never happened no other compensation was given as the hotel has ducted air I think they were just over booked",3,2013,08,16
207,Classic older hotel in good location,"This hotel was built in the early 1800s and has been brought up to modern standards within the physical limits possible.  The entrance is small and difficult to negotiate with suitcases and you cannot escape the smokers crowded around the place and making it smaller.  The entrance lobby is also usually crowded and awkward but after that everything gets better. The registration area is more open, though usually very busy and the concierge is knowledgeable and helpful, as were all the staff we met.  Rooms are well appointed and spacious, though some have unexciting views (but who goes to a city hotel for the view?).  Breakfast buffet is enormous and extensive, with full fat, healthy and cold options.  Service is good.  The tearoom is very relaxing and enjoyable with good, gracious and helpful staff.  All in all the experience is very good, though it is quite expensive.",4,2013,08,15
207,Exemplary service & location,"This was our second stay at The Shelbourne and once again it did not disappoint.  From the moment we arrived early in the morning and travel weary, the quintessential service impressed.  We had requested an early check-in yet given the very early time the room was not ready, understandable.  Mirta really took care of us, we had breakfast in the restaurant and complimentary drinks while we waited on the room.  

If you like a larger room, request an upgrade to premium room. We stayed in room 550 and it was large enough to accommodate our five suitcases. The bathroom is very large, clean, elegant with marble and has plenty of storage. Carpet is a little worn in the hallways.  The first night there was an issue with the air conditioning but we opened the window and adjusted. Of the four hotels we stayed at in Ireland, The Shelbourne was the only one with air conditioning.  

The Saddle Room Restaurant is beautiful and the food quality.  We had breakfast here most mornings and there is a buffet that has a wide array of fresh fruits and typical Irish breakfast fare. The No. 27 Bar and Lounge is a hip place to share a cocktail and is popular with Dubliners.  I love the atmosphere, old world decor and ambience.  

Denis and Keith are the concierges and they provided excellent service, recommendations and reservations.  They set us up with a rental car and their contact Tim delivered and picked up the car. 

Fitness center is large and has all the essential equipment.  Machines overlook the indoor pool and has multiple areas with cardio & weight machines.  We used it everyday and typically had the place to ourselves. 

The location on St. Stephen's Green places it within minutes of all the key attractions, shopping on Grafton street, restaurants and pubs.  We will always choose this hotel when in Dublin.",5,2013,08,15
207,"Lovely, old school luxury with modern ammenities","I stayed for four nights with my husband and two children in a jr. suite at the Shelbourne.  First of all, the location is outstanding.  You can walk to all the tourist attractions in Dublin, there are ample hotels within blocks, shopping is just a few blocks away and the park is across the street.  There are three several on site options for food and drink so it's a great place to meet friends or unwind.  The morning breakfast is outstanding and there is plenty of variety for everyone.  The rooms are large, comfortable and well appointed.  Overall, this is an excellent hotel with everything you would expect from a 5 star and you get Marriott points too.",5,2013,08,15
207,outstanding location and ambiance,"What a marvellous hotel. Wonderful historical significance if you're interested in Irish history. Gracious public areas staffed by courteous attentive staff. We had dinner in the Saddle Room, and it was a lovely experience. Delectible food, served by trained serving staff who offered helpful advice re wines and menu selections. 

After dinner, a stroll through Stephen's Green, just opposite the hotel is a delightful experience. It's great to think that this kind of hotel with its exemplary staff still exists to pamper guests with such lovely aplomb.",5,2013,08,15
207,Very attentive,We stayed at the Shelbourne while in Dublin and the first thing I noticed was the attentive service by all the staff. We didn't need to lift a finger. Check in was easy and they accommodated our odd check in times. It's an old hotel and has some quirks but very clean and nicely appointed.,4,2013,08,14
207,Second visit,"I can find little fault in the rooms, breakfast, afternoon tea ,the supper, beautiful lounge and staff in this well located hotel. The floral displays are some of the best in any hotel I have visited. I arrived early and was unable to assess the room but this was not an issue as check in is from 3pm.  I left my bags and set off to explore one of the friendliest cities on the planet. I was however disappointed that my room was still not ready at 3.50 pm. I had to wait a further 20 minutes in a busy lobby before I was given my key.  Compensation : a half glass of lemonade- a bit disappointing!",4,2013,08,11
207,"Fantastic hotel, old-timey European elegance","We had a five-night stay at The Shelbourne and loved every minute. The hotel has a warm elegance that just feels special and welcoming. The location is great, right across from the beautiful St. Stephens Green and just blocks from Grafton Street, Trinity College and many other go-to spots. The breakfast buffet is seriously top-notch and we enjoyed drinks in the Bar 27 one night. You can just feel the history oozing out of the hotel and we will definitely be going back one day. Five stars all the way. ",5,2013,08,11
207,Luxury & Location,If you are looking for prime location to sightsee in Dublin with a luxurious stay The Shelbourne is a great fit for you!!  We enjoyed our visit here tremendously and will definitely be revisiting our next time in Ireland.,5,2013,08,11
207,Great Finish to our Trip!,"We just had a whirlwind visit of five European capitals and I must say I was very impressed by Dublin and particularly by the Shelbourne. The hotel was bustling every night with interesting events and we loved the lounges. The people were very helpful and courteous. My wife had the misfortune of having her wallet stolen in a nearby restaurant so our shared credit card became invalid. No problem for The Shelbourne. They offered to delay billing until I could get home and obtain a new account. A classy thing to do, and I appreciated it very much. My highest rating and a tip of the cap!",5,2013,08,10
207,"What a Hotel, 5 star","Stayed here with family for 3 nights earlier this year, for a wedding.  Always wanted to stay in this hotel but could not justify the price as I lived close by.  everything from the entrance lobby to the decor, leisure facilities, to the rooms did not disappoint.  This hotel is worth the money, book it now!!!!

Our party stayed in rooms facing the green which is simply splendid. You can absorb Dublin and all it has to offer from here, so ask for a room facing the green ( St Stephens Green is a park) if you can.

The wedding was bliss, we reserved the ""Constitution Room"".  It was here the Irish Constitution was drafted and signed, a real piece of history.  There is also a small museum in the lobby, where the register of hotel guests dating back nearly a century can be examined, as well as other artifacts. 

Food, weather breakfast, lunch or dinner was the best Ive had in any hotel, and I have traveled extensively. 

The leisure center has been added recently and is very modern.  When we stayed there, we had the place to ourselves as it was quiet.  Gym is well equipped, and although the pool is`nt massive, it does the job.  Really looking forward to staying here again.

Nespresso machines in the room, excellent",5,2013,08,10
207,Average Stay,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in July and used our Marriott points to pay for it.  This is a well known hotel in the Dublin city center.  The location was good and we were able to explore Dublin on foot from here.  The rooms were clean but outdated, but the bed was very comfortable.

Our check-in was a bit unorganized and at check-out our bill was wrong.  They changed it quickly for us with no issues.

Overall it was just an average stay for us, nothing special.",3,2013,08,09
207,A true high class hotel,"Staying at the Shelbourne was a great experience for me and my family. We were there for two nights. The staff was so friendly and cared about what you needed. The rooms were very clean and spacious and the beds were comfortable. The location was great as your right near the shopping mall, St. Stephens Green, and Grafton street. The hotel is beautiful and elegant. It truly lives up to its reputation. Definitely give this place a go for a true experience in Dublin",5,2013,08,08
207,Outstanding,Really nice hotel with impeccable service.  Good location.  Breakfast that is included is amazing - normally we don't eat breakfast - we might only catch it once or twice.  Here we went every morning once we knew how great it was.  Choice of ala carte or buffet.  The hotel guests tend to be of the upper class - which definitely was not us.  If you can get by that you are good.  The beds are unbelievable - so comfortable.  The bellman are not the greatest here; for a high service hotel I have seen way better.  They took my tip and never did show up at with the luggage rack for the room.  The hotel is steeped in history - even has a minnie onsite museum.  Every famous person imaginable has stayed there.  Across from Stephens Green - a beauty of a park.,5,2013,08,08
207,Elegant historic hotel that is well located.,"The Shelbourne is an elegant historic hotel well located across the street from St. Stephen's Green. Within two blocks you will find the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Museum, and three blocks away is the main pedestrian shopping area, Grafton Street. Rooms are spacious with extra comfy soft beds ( a puffy feather bed is placed on each mattress which is already equipped with a pillow top panel), flat panel tv, double sinks in the bathroom. Only negative was thatwe  arrived at the hotel after a transatlantic flight at 5:30am. We of course didn't expect our room to be ready. We were exhausted and sat down in the large lobby area off the entrance of the hotel to wait for breakfast to be served at 6:30am. We were promptly chased away by a female employee who told us we couldn't sit there even though no one was there and nothing was going on. This was not a very hospitable welcome to Dublin for weary travelers.",4,2013,08,07
207,Afternoon Tea - A nice treat,"Took mother and father here whilst visiting some family in Dublin. 
I was a lovely afternoon tea and offered good value for money... but not just as special as some of the London treats i have experienced. 
Started with some prosecco and we were offered a selection of hot drinks - the tea selection was adequate..in fact... quite extensive. 
The savoury started were tasty. Sandwich fingers in a choice of fillings. Including egg mayo, ham and mustard and Guinness bread. We had prob about 4 small savouries each and were not offered any more before the sweet selection arrived. 
Big home made scones - Both fruit and plain with butter, jam and clotted cream - yummo! very fresh. Still warm from the oven. At this point our tea was topped up and we were offered to try an alternative. 
We then had a selection of lovely cakes. We had 1 each of 3/4 cakes and we were not offered any more. 

The tea was lovely - the service was friendly and all in it was good value for money. 

In my experience it certainly was a good afternoon tea - in a lovely environment - But nothing new or exciting. No quirks... Also... i like to be offered another round and even a goody bag when I go for afternoon tea. This is normal if you go for tea in the big London hotels such as The Berkeley and The Ledbury.",4,2013,08,05
207,Elegance and Comfort,"The Shelbourne is a beautiful, historical hotel in an excellent Dublin location.  We arrived from an early morning flight expecting to have to park our bags until our room was ready later that afternoon.  Instead, we were able to check right in and freshen up before enjoying a full day in the city.  Our room was clean and comfortable and the staff were very helpful and polite.  Breakfast is very pricey but worthwhile if you are up for a splurge; otherwise there are several small cafes serving breakfast within a short walk from the hotel.  We loved the Shelbourne and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",5,2013,08,03
207,A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE AND GOOD SLEEP,"We stayed for 2 nights in room 430: a big suite with a view of the park.  We ordered a chocolate cake for my birthday before we arrived and there it was: a very delicious treat and a bottle of wine on the table.  The staff were very professional and friendly.  We enjoyed our stay and will certainly go back.

Special thanks to Mirta (Relations Manager) who was at the front desk always with a big smile willing to help.  I believe she is one of the best assets of the Shelbourne Hotel.  It is reassuring to know that there is someone you can go to in case of need.  Thank you Mirta for making our stay a memorable one.

We did not have breakfast at the hotel even when it was reduced to 15 Euros.  We went to the Bank for breakfast one morning and it was excellent.  

I want to suggest to the hotel to provide either proper milk for tea and coffee or more mini milk cartons.  We had only 4.  Another thing, why not provide proper coffee sachets instead of that ridiculous machine that makes 3 small cups of coffee?

All in all, stay at the Shelbourne if you can afford it and ask Mirta to help you.  She will make your life a happy one!!!!.",5,2013,08,03
207,great wedding venue,"My niece had her wedding reception in the Shelbourne last Friday. Everything was first class.
The moment the newly weds arrived the staff seemed to shift into top gear. The heavens had opened, but a half dozen staff with umbrellas were quickly around the car as kilted piper played.(exciting and New Yorkish). Staff and guests clapped as newlyweds walked down red carpet with glasses of Champers. The cannapes were great with plenty of Champagne. The function room was beautifully decorated fresh flowers etc.The wedding dinner was excelent, food, wine and service all first class. The Shelbourne's wedding organiser very professional as is all the staff.
A credit to all.",5,2013,08,02
207,Great Hotel - Fantastic Location - Impeccable Service,"The Shelbourne Hotel is located just around the corner from great bars, restaurants and the night city scene.  The hotel itself is regal, clean and very impressive.  The history is interesting and the lobby has it's own museum that showcases the history of the hotel.  The concierge was always helpful, rooms were clean, restaurants were ""happening"" and we loved staying there.  Highly recommend if you want to be in the heart of Dublin city.",5,2013,08,02
207,Comfortable  and ideally located for a city trip to Dublin,"Perfectly located right at St. Stephens Green, just a few easy walking minutes away from Grafton Street, Trinity College, Temple Bar and such. Beautiful classical building from 1824. Comfortable room with all amenities, very hospitable staff. Asked for a quiet room and got one out to the side with a little balcony facing office building next door. Drawback is it tended to be quite crowded in the public areas - most notably during breakfast: longer wait to be seated, but that was easily made up for by the breakfast itself (don't miss out on their signature eggs benedict with beef fillet and their french toast).",4,2013,08,01
207,Simply Marvellous,"We stayed in a King Deluxe Room. it was lovely. It was clean and well maintained. Every member of the Hotel  Staff was friendly and Polite. The location is just perfect. The Hop on Hop Off bus stops just outside the Hotel. The Green Bus was the best as it has live commentary by the Drivers and very funny it was too. St Stephens park was opposite the Hotel and is definitely worth a walk around. Shops are a few minutes walk away. Loads of Restaurants and obviously the odd Pub  too. Our room was on the 5th floor, it was nice and quiet even though the Hotel was very busy.

We had a full Irish breakfast both mornings and it was delicious. A wide range of food was available, continental and also food cooked to order. We didn't eat there in the evenings as there were too many places to try

We  were delighted with our stay and would thoroughly recommend this Hotel to Family and Friends",5,2013,07,30
207,Proper Hotel vibe in an awesome location,"Stayed during July on a very reasonable corp rate.  Shelbourne for me is all about where it is, the bars, the lobby experience, the superlative service.  I've blagged my way into the residents bars more times than I can remember so it was a novelty to be able to saunter in at 2am with full confidence that I would not be turned on my heels.  The room was a little dark and while clean and very pleasant they could do with something extra.  I've stayed in nicer rooms but not very many nicer hotels...if that makes sense.  We didn't do brekky because there are too many good options we wanted to try within a short walk.  Gem of a hotel in a gem of a city.",4,2013,07,29
207,The epitome of old world charm........but could be so much better!,"I was very much looking forward to staying at the Shelbourne, the ""grand dame"" of Dublin hotels. We were in Dublin for a city break, so we arrived, dropped our bags and headed out. When we returned to get ready for dinner we couldn't get any hot water for our showers, reception offered an engineer but we were in a rush so we simply got changed and headed back out. The next morning, the hot water issue continued and we couldn't get washed before breakfast. Again we were offered an engineer and declined as we knew this wasn't just a localised issue for our room. Regardless of the fact we had said that we didn't want the engineer at that time, the hotel sent him. He ran our tap for 10 minutes and we were told that the issue was then sorted. We were absolutely livid! We are not idiots, had we been told that running the tap would resolve the issue either the previous evening or that morning, we could have worked that out for ourselves. 

After the great thermal improvements we went for breakfast, my husband spoke to reception and advised them of our problems. To their credit we were upgraded to a far superior room, the pictures of which I have attached.

In terms of the hotel itself, the Horseshoe Bar is legendary. It is a joy to have a drink in and watch the world go by. The floral display at the front of the hotel which is changed each week is simply awesome. 

All in all, this is a beautiful hotel. It is an honour to stay there, it is a huge part of Irish history, an amazing piece of architecture. Sadly with Marriott assuming control it is now aimed at our American counterparts, it lacks some of the charm and warmth it once had. Whilst I will always go through those beautiful doors to partake in a drink at the Horseshoe each time I visit Dublin, it won't be where I rest my head.",4,2013,07,27
207,Great hotel close to all,"Super hotel near everything. Shopping ,eating, drinking. St Stephens Green very nice. Staff very helpful and courteous. Hop on hop off bus way to get about and see the sites . Swanky hotel overall. Would recommend to all.",5,2013,07,27
207,The Best Afternoon Tea in Dublin!!!,"Went to the Shelbourne for Afternoon Tea as part of a surprise weekend in Dublin for my Wife's Birthday. I had researched on the internet possible places for Afternoon Tea and decided on the Shelbourne - and certainly was not disappointed. The setting and history of the Shelbourne alone makes it special......and the staff were very helpful and polite. The Afternoon Tea itself was excellent - cakes, sandwiches, scones, tea, coffee and champagne. The two and a half hours we were there seemed to fly by as we indulged in what seemed like a bygone age. If you are looking for a special treat for a loved one - look no further!!!",5,2013,07,26
207,5 star let down,"I've lived in Dublin for eight years, so when I recently married thought the Shelbourne would be the ideal location for our wedding night, but was very disappointed with the overall stay. 

Check in was very good and the room a nice size, but the bed was very uncomfortable and when I looked under the sheets, it appeared to be an old beaten up mattress with a lumpy duvet on top of it, so not a very nice nights sleep.  

The next morning we went for the buffet breakfast and were made to wait almost five minutes only for a women to walk us through the restaurant explain how a buffet works (like we wouldn't know) and seat us pretty much exactly where we would have gone ourselves.  The breakfast was only okay and we were already halfway through our food before a server offered us and coffee or toast.

On a side note, I realize there is a recession, but the restaurant was completely saturated with advertisements for their jellys, jams, etc. which definitely felt more appropriate to a country bed and breakfast kitchen than a 5 star hotel.

Based on the value for the price I will definitely not recommend.",3,2013,07,25
207,Great location and that bit of class-but you pay for it,"Ok this is where I come across a bit tight. Breakfast at 30 euros per person is far too much, as is 6 euro for a bottle of beer.....that out of the way the hotel is class, the staff phenominal, the beds comfort personified and as its in st Stephens green one of the best Georgian greens in this hospitable and beautiful city, so handy for just about everything. Turn left out of the hotel and you are soon in the quiter most sophisticated end of town with quieter bars and eateries than you find in temple bar....turn right and beyond grafton st and your in temple bar in 10-15 minutes.....a great weekend and make sure you see some sights...there are plenty close...trinity college, the cathedrals, the Liffey (although not looking its best these days as the north of the city seems a little tired)....it's all in a mile circle of the hotel......oh and to avoid the hiked up hotel breakfast charge, the Kildare inn five minutes away gives you a hearty brecky followed by a Guinness for about 10 euro....only in Dublin can you get funny looks at 9 in the morning for having a cup of tea....have to love this place....also a must go pub is the bank in college green....food better than average pub food, great decor, central and meal for two with a few blue moons for under 50 euro.....bargains and quality to be had if you look......p.s. avoid the tourist traps in temple bar.....they will kill your pocket.........have a great time.......",4,2013,07,23
207,Was a very pleasant trip,"One of the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. They make you feel very posh. The staff is extremely helpful and always have smiley faces.

Breakfast was standard and is served in a very nice lounge.

Overall experience was very good.",4,2013,07,23
207,I found my favorite place!,"I cannot wait to go back to The Shelbourne.  Everything about this hotel was perfect.  After a long 15 hour flight and layover from Phoenix to Dublin we were ready to get to our hotel.  After a 40 euro bus ride from the airport to The Shelbourne the 5 of us finally arrived (my husband and 3 adult sons in tow).   The location of the hotel cannot be beat.  It is directly across the street from the entrance of St. Stephen's Green and a few block from Grafton St.  This location is easily walkable to Trinity College, Temple Bar, museums, shopping, restaurants, etc.  We felt very safe walking during the day as well as at night in this area.
 We were upgraded upon check in to a corner suite since we are Marriott Platinum members.  My sons were in a regular room so I can review both on here.  The regular room was nice sized, bathrooms were nice sized and beds were very comfortable.  The room was plenty big enough for 3 adult men.  Our corner suite overlooking St. Stephen's Green was beautiful.  We felt like royalty (we have good imaginations) with such an awesome view and such a beautiful room.  There was large sitting room with a sofa , desk and coffee table.  The bedroom was very large as well as the closet space.  I wouldn't normally mention closet space but we were on a month long holiday and brought a lot of things with us.  The bathroom was huge as well!  Beds were comfy, TV worked great and a decent amount of channels, and no issues with the internet.  Internet is very important to us as we work while on the holiday and must be connected every night to check email and get programming work done.  
The staff at The Shelbourne is very friendly.  It might just be that everyone in Ireland is friendly, but at the Shelbourne they are both friendly and professional.  They didn't even yell at my husband who would not stop going by the front desk every few hours for more cookies!  It was Christmas time when we were there so I'm not sure if the cookies were for the holiday or if they have them all the time.  We enjoyed the sight seeing tour that picks you up right in front of the hotel.  It is a double decker bus and is a great way to see Dublin.  You can jump on/ jump off at several different locations. I know at the time we were there, The Shelbourne was running a special room rate that included this tour.  
We did enjoy the buffet breakfast at the hotel every morning of our stay. We were there for 5 days.  The food was very, very good.  My husband and I enjoyed it every morning, my sons made it down maybe for 1 breakfast (they are in their early 20's and enjoyed Temple Bar area every night into the early morning hours).  The breakfasts really were enough to keep you full until an early dinner.  We didn't eat dinner there since there were so many restaurants we wanted to try nearby.
My last comment on this hotel is pretty much summed up by this: After leaving Dublin and going over to England and a few other countries we came back to Ireland to finish our last days of vacation.  We had planned to go to Galway but after visiting Killarney we decided we didn't want to drive anymore.  My sons and I agreed to finish our vacation back in Dublin as long as we could stay at The Shelbourne.  It was a great decision as we turned the rental car in 3 days early since there is no need to have one at the hotel.  This allowed my husband to enjoy the last 3 days of vacation even more with no need to drive every day!  
Although this hotel can be quite expensive, the days we stayed here in early January were not too bad.  We thought the location more than made up for the price and seemed to be about the going rate for the area.",5,2013,07,22
207,Top class hotel in cracking location & definitely worth a visit,"Stayed there for 2 nights recently (couple) & it's a brilliant location beside St Stephens Green. The weather being absolutely amazing, it was lovely to chill & relax in the park just across the road. The rooms are extremely comfortable & what you would expect from a five star hotel. Beds very comfortable, robes provided etc. The mini bar is expensive as is the main bar (€5.75 for pint if Guinness...) but no complaints, happy to pay a slight premium particularly when you see the number of staff in the hotel.. It's like a personal service and everybody is so friendly. Simple good manners such as ""Good morning"". ""Did you have a nice day"" etc & while they may not really care, the fact that they ask with a smile AND wait for a response, is certainly very nice to witness as its a declining trait in the hospitality sector unfortunately. My only gripe is lack of parking.. I know there is valet parking but I don't like others driving/parking my motor... Overall, definitely recommended and will certainly be back. ",5,2013,07,22
207,"One, if not The Best","Just stayed there for 4 days for a bit of sightseeing. was met at the door, bags carried to Reception, we were checking in very early and our room was not ready, so the cases were left there whilst we went for lunch, came back, picked up the key. bags already in the room, spotless, not much of a view but I had no intention of looking out of the window, The pool is great, afternoons really quiet, breakfast was a pleasure, well looked after and a huge choice.

Everyone was polite, and helpful, nothing too much trouble, would we go back? yes probably September",5,2013,07,22
207,Luxury Meets Friendly,"The warm welcome from staff was impressive especially when we arrived not looking our best (road grime). We stayed for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The location is perfect to  walk to Temple Bar, Gaiety Theatre, shopping and other popular sites.  

The hotel offers a great breakfast...great way to start the day off.

Highly recommend.",5,2013,07,20
207,Shelbourne July 2013,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights in July 2013.  It was outstanding.  The staff was super - they greeted us when we arrived just like we were old friends returning to the hotel.  The service was terrific.  The location was great - walking distance to most places and bus stops/hop on/off tour bus stops located very close by.  If we return to Dublin, this is where we will stay.",5,2013,07,20
207,Lovely stay at the Shelbourne,"We stayed here in March, it was our first stay at this hotel. We arrived on a very wet/windy night and the stafff came out to the car and made a great effort to ensure that we didn't get wet getting out our bags. We went with the valet parking which I would highly recommend. We were in for a lovely treat when we checked in. We had been upgraded to a suite which was beautiful. The room service was excellent. We had breakfast and lunch here, both of which were very good. I found all the staff we encountered to be very courteous and friendly. All in all a fabulous stay and the first of many I hope. My only gripe is that they don't have a bar that is for the exclusive use of guests.",5,2013,07,18
207,Old World Elegance in the Heart of the City,"Our 3 day stay at The Shelbourne was a perfect introduction to our first visit to Ireland. First class all the way. The hotel is stunningly beautiful, every staff member is professional and warm, the room is quiet and comfortable, the breakfast and service is excellent. Right across the street is Saint Stephen's Green, a pretty park with waking paths. Walking distance to many major sites, including the Dublin Castle, Christ Church, Dublinia, Grafton Street, and Trinity College. I highly recommend staying at The Shelbourne, a wonderful experience in itself.",5,2013,07,17
207,Platinum member - mediocre stay,"I stayed here for seven nights in July 2013, in a room with a King and a full bed. The room overlooked a concrete roof of adjacent buildings.

This pros:

1. The property is beautiful and in an excellent location.
2. The rooms are quite large by European standards.
3. The bath amenities are plentiful and high quality.
4. The beds are soft and comfortable, with excellent linen.
5. The breakfast is quite good, and the waitstaff if friendly (albeit hurried).
6. Dinner in the saddle room was superb and fairly priced for a five star hotel's restaurant. The staff at dinner were exceptional.

The cons:

1. Upon arrival, they had misspelled my name and lost my MR number and status. Not as huge deal, but the receptionist's demeanor changed perceptibly (from VERY rude to acceptably cordial) upon discovering I was Platinum Elite. 
2. I would describe the maid service and highly inconsistent. Some nights we had turn down, but no chocolates. Other times, the room was cleaned, but no water was left. One other day, they took one robe and left the other. Not a huge deal but kind of amusing.
3. While I absolutely understand this is a five star property and generally caters to business folk (being that I myself, am most often a business traveler, I understand). But, we did not feel comfortable here in casual, vacation attire (even relatively dressed-up vacation attire). The morning we left, I wore Lululemon pants (not yoga pants, but their regular black pants) to breakfast and the host literally sneered at me, lol. Just a bit of advice, plan to dress in a manner consistent with business attire clothing if you wish to feel appropriately dressed. 
4. The bar was extremely crowded every night we were there, and it was impossible to find a table or a place to sit. 

My overall impression of the hotel was that while the property was beautiful and in an exceptional location, the service was not consistent with what I expect for either a five star or a Renaissance property. It was like the staff simply could NOT believe that two, well groomed women in their 30s could afford to stay in their hotel, let alone have MR status. Inconsistent would be the most accurate descriptor, in my view.",3,2013,07,17
207,Tea at the Shelbourne,"Originally wanted to have tea at The Clarence but it was closed for renovation, so we decided on The Shelbourne.  Very delightful, beautiful classic presentation, well appointed room and nice live pianist.  There is a fantastic selection of tea to choose from and the tray of delicacies is very unique and yummy and scones are the best! I highly recommend this hotel because of its rich history and reputation whether its just a visit for tea or to stay here.",5,2013,07,16
207,Such a treat,"Had a lovely day out at a  friends bridal shower in the beautiful St. Stephens Green Suite.  The afternoon tea was excellent, I had pre ordered the gluten free Afternoon tea which was amazing ( well done as gluten free normally means tasteless and fruit salad).  The staff were very friendly and helpful and even provided lovely take away bags as the food was so good we didn't want to leave it behind.  Just need another excuse to go back for another treat..",5,2013,07,15
207,Excellent location in Dublin,"I had a free stay on Marriott points and got a great room and treated like royalty.  Always had turn down, chocolates and a welcome bottle of wine.  Very comfortable bed and although I didn't have a view of St Stephens Green I did have a balcony.  Generous room.  I wish the bathroom had some drawers.  it was hard to keep it neat and I put away my stuff back into my bags everyday.  it would have been nice to unpack the bathroom.  No outlet in bathroom so had to dry and curl hair out by the desk.  No need for  electric outlet charges they have a strip in the wall to accomodate US electronics.   No need to take an umbrella, one is provided in your room for your use.  Nice and big too.  I was especially impressed that I was allowed to check in at 9 am since I had an early fight in - that made it easy to take a nap insead of wandering around til 3 pm.  Rooms are very clean and updated.  i would stay there again.",5,2013,07,14
207,Amazing hotel!,The lobby is gorgeous. Our room was beautiful. The beds were so comfy. The bathroom was very modern. The room was great. The breakfast was delicious. They had everything that you could ever want for breakfast! I would definitely recommend this hotel. ,5,2013,07,14
207,Royalty,"The best staff service ever. Without exception every member of  staff at The Shelbourne, was professional , courteous, helpful , friendly and very smart. They made you feel so welcoming without being intrusive. Our room  was a decent size, spotlessly clean with high spec furniture. The shower was amazing, with a good size bathroom, and  lots of quality courtesy toiletries. View from our room  a little disappointing as it faced a dreary office block(fourth floor) , however the standard of the room made up for the view.
Great location, lots to do within walking distance.Breakfast had a great choice on offer , which was  of the highest standard.
Would love to return for a special occasion. I'd ask for a front facing room next time.
Watch out for the mini bar , prices are very expensive. (Three fifty for a Kit Kat!!).
Customers definitely come first at this hotel .Worth treating your self.",5,2013,07,12
207,Lovely location but I would not recommend,"My husband and I stayed for 10 days at the beginning of July. The location is stellar across from St. Stephen's Green and in the heart of best walking areas in downtown Dublin. Here is what I found favorable about this Renaissance hotel:

1) The staff genuinely tries to please. They are cordial and eager to help.
2) The concierge, Keith, is extraordinarily knowledgeable and helpful.
3) The hotel is clean, the beds are very comfortable, although the pillows are not always the newest  but this easily remedied, so just ask if yours are flat!
4) The breakfast buffet is quite extensive, and of good quality.
5) The location is fabulous!

Here is what I found less than ideal for a hotel in this price range and cachet:

1) The breakfast buffet is often overcrowded and difficult to maneuver as it serves more people than the room can handle comfortably. The staff does their best to oblige but the feel is of people running around and/or jockeying to get what they need in a line and then navigate back to the table without being bustled into.  A solution to this might be to have the hotel use their large bar and/or tea lounge as an overflow breakfast area for those who might just want coffee, tea, cereals and fresh fruit, or, just set up another breakfast area!  This would be the right thing to do, especially on weekend. It seems a poor choice that two large and lovely seating areas are empty while the breakfast room is crammed and busy.

2) During our stay there was a pervasive lack of communication for what we requested and what was done.  It was almost as if, we joked, they didn't speak English! For example, on our second night a party of drunken laughing young women were in the room next to us and after waiting a while for them to settle down, we called the desk to ask that we be allowed to sleep in another room for the rest of the night (it was 1:30am.)  The desk attendant said he would call us back.  Thirty minutes later, the girls still laughing and listening to loud television, we called the desk again. The attendant said he called to speak with them and they said they would quiet down.  Not what we requested!

We again requested another room to sleep in. We got a call back stating that it would take a while for someone to get our bags.  We clarify, several times, we just want to SLEEP in a different room; no need to move the bags.  We waited another 15 minutes and then got a call stating there was a room with two beds, would that do?  it was now 2:30AM and a bench in St. Stephen's Green across the street would have done just fine!

To add to this comedy, after settling to sleep in our temporary room around 3AM, we got a wake up call for the previous guest who had checked out as the hotel neglected to let the wake up service know that the guest was gone.  When I explained this to the operator at 6:30 am, she really asked, ""Are you sure?""

Continuing miscommunication occurred the next morning when I determined our party next door wouldn't be checking out for two more nights. I requested a new room, and was told that we should pack up our things and the staff would move them.  We could go out for the day and when we returned, we would have a new room key and our bags would be moved. We did this, and when we returned, there was no new room assignment, no room key and the bags were still in the old room. Since I had turned in the old room key, I asked for it so I could shower and change for a show that evening. I was told I couldn't get do that, BUT, the bags would be moved promptly to the new room. I was told, ""The bags will likely be there before you get there!""  When I asked why they hadn't been moved, the reply was that the staff thought I wanted to look at them in the old room before they were moved.  I asked, genuinely, ""Why would I want to look at my bags?"" and the desk clerk admitted it didn't make sense. Thirty minutes later, there were NO bags, so I called the desk and said I would get them myself. I was told I could not; there were 'in transit'.  It's a seven floor building! This wouldn't be so bad overall if I hadn't been told otherwise, and, I had tickets to a performance so I just wanted to shower and change.  In all, it took nearly an hour to get my bags from the 5th floor to the 4th floor, not including the six prior hours when they should have been moved in the first place.

We arrived back in our room another evening at 6pm and it had not been cleaned.  We called to request that someone should clean it at the time of the turn down service at 8pm as we would be leaving in about an hour. Instead, an eager person arrived at our door in 5 minutes looking to clean it.  She smiled and apologized as someone told her to get there ""right away.""

In closing, everyone TRIES very hard, but this hotel did not deliver the high touch, high service experience commensurate with its reputation. The building is grand, although the common areas are often overrun with people without preference for hotel guests (meaning, you might not get into the bar or tea room because they are often full due to other visitors or events at the hotel). The bedrooms are spacious by European standards and again, the location cannot be beat.

Perhaps I expect too much for the money, but I believe there may be a more luxurious option in this price range in Dublin that would deliver a better experience. My husband is a loyal Marriott resident as he is a frequent business traveler, so he has been in Marriotts of all style in many locations. He concurred that while it was not a bad experience, it was not the experience he expected for a Renaissance hotel.",3,2013,07,11
207,GREAT!,"Used Marriott Reward Points for our stay.  The only problem was the night before the hotel was full.  When we arrived at 9:30 a.m. our room was not ready.  They stored our luggage while we went out to play.

The hotel staff, every single one, was outstanding.  

Great location.

You could not do better",5,2013,07,11
207,Extremely Disappointing. Never again.,"We stayed here for two nights at the end of June. This hotel has a great historical feel and atmosphere, and I have stayed here several times in the past - including before it was a Marriott property. However, we arrived and checked in, only to be assigned a room that someone had smoked in. The bathroom toilet room contained an extremely strong smoke odor and there were cigarette ashes on the baseboard and floor behind the toilet. This raises two issues - How did nobody notice it when servicing the room and how well did the housekeeping staff clean the rooms? We reported it and were assigned another room (after waiting 30 minutes), only to find that the second room was even smaller than the first. After finding that surprising and not acceptable, another room was requested and was still of the smaller size but on a quieter wing of the building. At that point (over 1.5 hours after we arrived, might I add), I just decided to keep that room since this was taking away from the limited time we had to spend in Dublin. **Business & Marriott Elite members: There no longer is a Concierge/Club Lounge at this property any more. The hotel replaced it with a health/workout facility/small spa. Being a Marriott Gold member, I found this very disappointing -especially compared to all of the other Renaissance properties I've stayed in and the service received elsewhere. There's no compensation for this either, such as the snacks in your room being complimentary. To me, this shows that this Marriott property doesn't value it's Marriott Elite  members. 

The location is excellent. Directly across the street from St. Stephen's green and within walking distance to everywhere you'd want to go in Dublin. It's about a 5 minute walk to the top of Grafton St.

The room we finally settled in was nice (although not the upgraded room I had reserved). The bed was very comfortable and the room had blackout blinds, but the bathroom didn't smell clean and had a musty smell like it hadn't been cleaned recently (especially in the toilet room-I think I'm seeing a pattern here). 

Breakfast was good, with several hot offerings on the buffet and an adequate order menu. Typical Marriott kitchen breakfast. I didn't have afternoon tea or use the lobby bar at all this trip. The public spaces are decorated nicely and have an old historic-yet-modern feel, but they were very crowded.

The doormen, valet, and concierge are all very friendly people and were helpful. This is no longer the elegant stay it use to be, and I'll be staying elsewhere in Dublin on my next visits (Westbury or Four Seasons). It also has me thinking of switching hotel loyalty. It was a disappointing end to an otherwise wonderful trip to Ireland.",2,2013,07,10
207,Good old world hotel,"Stayed here in December great atmosphere, very good service and an excellent location the only problem was I was with my elderly mam and the afternoon tea area was booked up and she did not want to sit in the bar so there was very limited places to sit so ended up going to our room. My mam loved it and there was a great buzz in the hotel so all was well",4,2013,07,09
207,Majestic stay,"Beautiful historic hotel and in a perfect location across from St Stephens Green.  Excellent and friendly staff.  Rooms are interesting and the beds are amazingly comfortable. Wish the windows would open all the way, they only open a crack.   So many famous and historical people have passed through the halls and there is a museum in the hotel lobby to check out.  Great place. Love the Irish people !",5,2013,07,09
207,Luxurious and great location,Really enjoyed our 2 nights here. Service and attitude of the staff had a very 'high end' feel - attentive and courteous. The hotel has an impressive history too with some illustrious guests through the years. Room was spacious and the bed extremely comfortable. Great sleep both nights. Only slight let-down was the standard of the breakfast. The range of food was superb but both my menu choices were overlooked - hard-boiled poached eggs and a dried out omelette. Expected better when everything else was pretty much perfect.,4,2013,07,09
207,"Pretty hotel, great location, but...","The Shelbourne is a historic hotel with the exact quaint style that I love. The location is terrific, as it sits across the street from St. Stephen's Green (park) and is a reasonable walk to shopping on Grafton Street, the Temple Bar area, and many visitor sights (Trinity College, Christ Church, etc). The rooms are a nice size for Europe and and the beds were very comfortable. The staff is helpful and friendly. Here's the ""but""- if you have allergies to cigarette smoke, you may want to find a newer hotel with better ventillation. I went to bed each night and woke each morning smelling smoke as if someone was breathing it under our door. It was bad enough to keep me up at night, but I didn't complain to management as we were leaving the next day. As much as I like the hotel for it's other great qualities, I don't think that I would be able to stay there again.",3,2013,07,08
207,"Old World elegance, wonderful overall.","The beds were heavenly, breakfast with it's various stations was both filling and delicious, staff throughout was welcoming and always available, despite the commotion and extra work involved in having Michelle Obama and the girls and numerous Secret Service men there.  Exceptional service!",5,2013,07,07
207,Best in Dublin,"I've stayed in several hotels in Dublin and this is clearly the best in my opinion. It may be more pricey than most but worth the extra. Location is perfect, in the centre of Dublin, across the road from the famous Stephen's Green park. It's an institution. The service is very good and concierge are always very helpful. The bar is good fun and a nice place to start the evening. The rooms are comfortable, a little out-dated, but there really isn't much competition in Dublin. They always look after me very well!",5,2013,07,06
207,Wonderful Hotel in a  Beautiful city!,We stayed here our last two nights in Ireland and it was a very nice experience.  Good food and nice rooms and so many sights of the city are within walking distance.  The park across the street is a wonderful place for an evening stroll with it's winding paths and ponds and gardens.  The Little Dublin Museum is just down the street and is well worth the time to take the tour and hear the story.,5,2013,07,06
207,Excellent Service,"Our room in the Shelbourne was nothing special; essentially a standard Marriott hotel room with a few nice touches including a very comfortable king bed.  But we felt the service at this hotel was excellent and the reason for our 5 rating.  The Shelbourne had far better service than we've experienced at other Marriotts.  When we called for an extension cord, it was there almost immediately.  The same when we ordered a bucket of ice.  Service in the Saddle Room, where we had breakfast, was also excellent.  Check-in was quick and we were treated quite well by the doorman and the reception clerk.  Would definitely stay here again.  One note I would add is that they play up all the famous people who have stayed there over the years.   What's important to us, is how we are treated during our stay, not what their history is.",5,2013,07,04
207,Great hotel in Dublin city,"The Shelbourne Dublin is a lovely hotel with a very grand feel about it.

The rooms were a good size and very comfortable. We also had dinner at the hotel restaurant 'The Saddle Room'. It is a pricey restaurant with great food, but the staff were lacking in quality. They forgot our drink orders and were very unfriendly overall.

The hotel itself is lovely, and we would stay there again.",4,2013,07,03
207,Memorable Afternoon Tea Birthday Treat Indulgence,"Last Friday (28th June 2013) was my birthday and one of my wishes was for afternoon tea,  Tony had his work cut out for him.Thankfully The Shelbourne stepped up to the mark and welcomed us into their afternoon tea lounge. No doubt you know Afternoon Tea done well is a delight. Since the onslaught of my food intolerances it’s been nigh on impossible to find anywhere I could enjoy it. 

A huge thanks to the Shelbourne Hotel staff especially the chef who was determined to make it special (check out the starter pic!!) and the two front of house staff looking after us for making a very special birthday utterly memorable. Just out of the world for the elegance on everything and the attention to detail. The whole day will remain in our fondest memories for years to come. One of their mottos is to ensure if the menu is changed due to restrictive diets that the food they present is at the same standard as their regular..As you can see from the pics they exceeded that.

Definitely worth a visit whether you have a restricted diet or not. Be sure though to give them plenty of notice. We arranged it a week before. It takes a lot of background work to pull this off so spare a thought if you want perfection. 

The lunch was delicious too and we could both enjoy two different meals with a very helpful waitress checking out all the queries I had.",5,2013,07,02
207,Stayed on business trip,"I stayed here on a business trip, the food was bloody fantastic, the wine and shots and beers and cider and champaign and shots, and gin, and vokda, and Whiskey and pints of Guinness all washed down with a nice glass of sparking water, they were all great, its the gack decor from 1970 in the rooms that a little er dooly, it reminds me of my mum house, frills on the lampshades and frills on the bed sheets, mind your its bloody €400 sheets and a €2000 lampshade but hea i would like it if it was sleek, modern, crisp, gadets HD flat screen, mad fragrance showers, ice machines, its 2013. If the Rooms matched the foyer then were talking business.",4,2013,07,01
207,Top Grade Hotel,"Top level service started the moment I walked through the front door. I had informed the hotel  that I was due to arrive on an early morning flight and requested an early check-in (if possible). I arrived at 10am and within 10 minutes I was in my room with luggage delivered.

The room was spotless, large and very comfortable. Breakfast was wonderful as was service. 

Excellent location to explore Dublin. One of the best hotels in Dublin",5,2013,07,01
207,Sunday Jazz Brunch,"Lovely Sunday brunch at the Shelbourne. Great Jazz band playing, very relaxing. Went with a group and we just shared some food and a couple of pitchers of Pimms.  We had children in the group, and the staff were lovely and accommodating when we requested just a selection of pastries for them. Looking forward to returning.",4,2013,07,01
207,A great Dublin experience,"The moment you pull up to this grand hotel, you certainly know you've arrived somewhere special. The great hospitality starts as soon as you get out of the cab, and continues all the way to the check in desk, possibly one of the best customer service experiences I have come across.
The room was clean, a decent size, although not the best view from the window (I guess sometimes it's just luck!). The shower (in the bath tub) was great, although personally I prefer a separate shower cubicle, but a minor point. Great to see that even though the room had a traditional charm, it still had modern facilities like iPod dock, wi-fi etc. The dining at the hotel is excellent, from the breakfast to dinner. Location great too, with St.Stephens Green opposite the hotel, and the shopping area a short walk away. If you are staying in Dublin, I would recommend The Shelbourne highly.",4,2013,06,30
207,Grand but a little distant,"The Shelbourne is a Dublin institution and it does come across as very grand. It's well located - tourism & shopping - and our room was both clean and comfortable. Very good facilities and helpful staff. Our only niggle was that, in 4 days there, we never really felt that we 'connected' with the hotel. It's more International than Irish and after 3 weeks in Ireland I think we both felt we missed the local flavour. But, that aside, it's a very good hotel and certainly deserves its top-end rating.",5,2013,06,30
207,great food and ambience,"Thoroughly enjoyable Sunday lunch in the bar/restaurant accompanied with a little jazz music.  The staff were very helpful as we didn't want a table too close to the music so we could chat and relax, and they finally found us a good spot at the bar.  Great atmosphere, old fashioned grandeur and decoration but with a modern touch.  Food was delicious and reasonably priced.  Waited briefly in the lobby area after lunch and the staff, yet again, were helpful and polite.",4,2013,06,29
207,"Timeless elegance, best location in Dublin","I've now stayed at The Shelbourne on two separate occasions. In each case, the stay was truly wonderful. I've been to Dublin five times on business in the past year and can safely say you won't go wrong with The Shelbourne.

The staff here is really top notch -- incredibly pleasant and helpful. In a country of very friendly and helpful people, they still stand out.

As everyone has mentioned, the location is perfect. On St. Stephens Green and just seconds to the best restaurants and pubs and three minutes to shopping on Grafton Street, the Gaiety Theatre and Trinity College.

The hotel is appointed like the historic landmark that it is. Top hatted footmen. Spectacular chandeliers. Giant flower vases everywhere. While it is historic, it doesn't feel worn or old at all, like other places I've stayed. If you're looking for something more chic, like the W, you will be hard pressed to find something like that in Dublin. The Fitzwilliam and The Westbury are probably your only options. 

The rooms in my two stays were giant by European standards and a bit above average for the US. Not sure about some complaints about smaller rooms -- maybe they haven't traveled to Europe before (or NYC!)  Staff does a great job with the rooms -- beds are turned down, bathrobes laid out, towels refreshed. The rooms do have US plugs in them -- thanks Marriott!

The breakfast buffet is really terrific -- the full choice of anything you could want -- hot or cold. Fresh squeezed juices. Five different breads. Meats/cheeses. Cereals. Fruit. Not sure I'd ever pay 29Euro for breakfast anywhere out of my own pocket but as a splurge, or on your business account, there's no better way to start the day.

There are several bars, restaurants and tea rooms to choose from and they always seem packed with the more affluent Irish crowd. The place is revered by the locals and you can tell that it is a big deal to have an event there -- everyone gets dressed up in ways that you rarely see in the US. I haven't eaten here, as there are too many interesting options around, but the Horseshoe Bar is both beautiful and pulls a good Guinness. It can be pretty lively in the early evenings too.

The clientele is heavily skewed toward Americans (and older ones at that). That would be my only knock on the hotel -- I like to be more native. But if you don't mind rubbing elbows with pleasant American couples on anniversary visits to Ireland you'll be fine.",5,2013,06,29
207,"Lovely hotel,small room.","Stayed overnight. Beautiful hotel, extremely friendly staff,but was a little surprised at how small the room was. It had all ammenities but was quite tiny. Otherwise could not fault the service. Like all buffet breakfasts it is very difficult to get it hot.and this was no exception. By the time you got back to your table and settled down the food was going cold. Not the hotels fault by the way, just the curse of Buffets.",4,2013,06,28
207,Food portion too small for big appetite,"We had to wait an hour at 3pm to have the room ready- Hotel was great, a bit grandiose for the average tourist, but we decided to book here with our mileage [30,000 miles +]- Very nice bed, comfy mattress, all amenities were great- International staff of 30 nationalities, so it is fun to guess where someone comes from- We got there 1 day after the Obamas' stay, and thanks to the Irish Times, we knew that it had been an expensive stay. Staff was hush-hush about it, no-one could give us any bits of info-
But the dinner menu was not up to par, very small portions, suited for a child's appetite rather than for an adult having toured the town all day- Food was OK, just a bit disappointing.",4,2013,06,27
207,Great location with great history!,"This hotel is stunning. I stayed here with work for a week, and could not fault the staff. It truely is 5 star. Help was offered as soon as I stepped out the taxi - everyone was super friendly. The rooms were great - flat screen TV, large bathroom, nice toileteries, and huge comfy bed!

The hotel is really close to a huge array of shops, restaurants and bars, and a truely relaxing atmosphere inside.

I had a breakfast-inclusive room rate, which was absolutely delicious - I wish I could have eaten more! There were fresh teas/coffees, juices, fruits, eggs cooked to your liking, pastries, toast, cereals, the list goes on. The service was top notch too.

I also ate in the restaurant downstairs, as well as having room service - all of which was delicious.

i also had a card sent out to me from UK while I was staying here, however unfortunately it didn't arrive for another week after I had checked out, but the hotel rang me and arranged for it to be redirected to me, which was hugley appreciated (and no extra cost to myself).

Would definitely come stay here again!",5,2013,06,26
207,Great place-good location,"My husband and I are both Marriot platinums so we got upgraded.  The room was small but comparable to the size you get in NYC or other big cities.  The bathroom was wonderfully appointed.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We left our luggage so to site see and came back to find it in our room, drink coupons under the door and front desk staff who rembered us.  We had a drink in the bar and saw many business people making connections while enjoying the modern but classic setting.  The location was ideal for our site seeing around Dublin.  Top of our list of teasons we liked this place was when we returned from site seeing we asked for a recomendation for a local bar - but not one of the usual tourist places.  The manager gave us directions to a local place including an ally that had been converted into casual bar seating.  we spent the night cheering irish a champion football game and guiness.  We had to fly the next day but would have enjoyed staying longer.  ",5,2013,06,25
207,"Historic, Great Location, Service is top notch","I spent a week at this location.  The front desk staff was friendly and quick to help with restaurant recommendations, tour highlights and little touches that make you wonder why ever 5 star hotel is not this way.  The greeting at the front door, lads in top hats make eye contact with every guest, Wisk you to check in and the sometimes magical arrival of your bags and in my case coffee delivered to my room.  The lobby / bar areas were always busy, not what I am used to in the hotel bar, this place was packed into the wee hours every night, all were dressed biz class and above and to impress.  The Sunday brunch here had live Jazz and great food.  There was never a request that was made that was not fulfilled.  Outside the hotel every recommendation that was made for me was a hit, no duds here.  They even took the time to print me a menu to preview, call ahead for me where most restaurants were waiting with open arms to welcome me.

Breakfast- was included with the room, you have to try the shelbourne pancakes, they are slap your mama good, I think they put granulated sugar in the batter.

Spa- I visited the spa, reasonably priced, great pool, steam room and sauna.  Full workout facility with drinks/protein powders if you wish.  The relaxation room following massage had a great view and quiet.

If you are looking for 5 star services in a great location you will not be disappointed with everything in walking distance.",5,2013,06,24
207,Great hotel with a lot of history,This is pretty much a 5 star hotel right in the heart of Dublin.  Easy walk to many of the sights and restaurants.  The service was first class.  Everyone was very friendly and attentive to our needs.  This is probably the best hotel in Dublin and they have a list of all the famous people who have stayed there.  You will be treated well and have a great experience at this hotel.  A group of 30 stayed with us on a tour and this was one of the highlights of a 2 week trip.  Pretty expensive....,5,2013,06,24
207,"Beautiful, elegant and special","Simply put, our stay at the Shelbourne was AMAZING.  The staff was warm and patient and completely helpful...especially Una (I hope I spelled that correctly), our Elizabeth Bowen suite was gorgeous, the food was delicious.  

Thanks for everything and to everyone!!  :)",5,2013,06,24
207,Lovely place to stay,"We loved staying here. The staff are incredibly friendly and go out of their way to provide every thing you could possibly need. Location is perfect, right across the street from St. Stephen's green and quite near Trinity college and many other attractions. Rooms are furnished well, beds comfortable. Not bothered at all by noise in or outside the hotel. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2013,06,23
207,"Sense of History, great location","When you walk into the Shelbourne Hotel, you sense the history of the magnificent building.  The location is excellent, right on St Stephens Park across the street to the South, and a 5-10 minute walk to Trinity College or the Temple Bar area to the North.  Unfortunately, while we were there last month, there was construction going on, with scaffolding blocking one full side of the hotel; this resulted in us being in a North-facing room, looking into an office building across the street (but obviously this is temporary).  Other than the lack of view, our room was very comfortable.

The hotel is pricey, but on a par with the other top-rated hotels in Dublin.",4,2013,06,21
207,A very nice hotel.  Keep your expectations in check and you'll enjoy your stay.,"The Shelbourn is a very nice hotel in an incredibly nice country.  Expect Irish hospitality as it will be generously provided.  But keep in mind it's a hotel.  You sleep there.  It's an old historic building in the center of Dublin which creates certain trade offs.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and well appointed.  The staff is anxious to please.  ",4,2013,06,20
207,Luxury at its finest,"Spent two nights here and couldn't have been happier.  From the moment we arrived, the staff provided us with excellent service. The concierge gave us a lot of good advice on where to eat and how to get around.

The room was hard to leave.  As soon as you lay on the bed, you never want to get back up.  

We also got the breakfast option, which is well worth it if you enjoy a bigger breakfast.  There are a ton of meal options to choose from, including made-to-order items.

The hotel is right across from a large park, so if your room is on the front of the building, you have a great view.  It is conveniently located right near the major shopping and eating areas, and for farther destinations, cabs/buses are right around the corner.",5,2013,06,19
207,Now This Is a 5 Star!!!,"From we arrived in this hotel we where greeted with nothing but friendly, helpful staff who literally bent over backwards to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable.  We will most definitely be returning to this hotel for another special occasion.  The Obama Family where staying 2 floors above us, you would not of known such a high profile family where in the vicinity yet alone in our hotel just a little added security,  The hotel was so clean, breakfast was delicious with plenty on offer and the chefs whipped up anything on the menu to your preference with a smile.  The hotel had such a lovely atmosphere.  The lady on the front desk I can't remember her name but she will remember us we where attending the Robbie Williams concert and got a lot of helpful tips from her.  Can't wait to return in the very near future.  The Beds wer the most comfortable I have ever slept in!!",5,2013,06,18
207,First rate hotel in excellent location on St Stephens Green,"This is a first rate property with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in a hotel. Breakfast was included and quite extensive. The bars were always full so we didn't use them. But the location was top notch for the sites of Dublin. Only negative was check out which took three calls for a porter who never showed and our car took thirty minutes to be brought around. Otherwise, great experience.",4,2013,06,18
207,"Location, Location, Location","The Shelbourne has the best location.   It's across the street from St. Stephens Green, the National Museum of Ireland-Archeology and History is right behind it and everything else (Trinity College, restaurants, shopping, etc) is a super easy walk.  It was clean and the staff was friendly.  I can't say it's a five star because it needs some updating, but it's a good location and if you get a room for a good price, you won't be disappointed.",4,2013,06,17
207,Great Location In City Centre,"We started our two week holiday in Ireland staying three nights at the Renaissance Shelbourne in Dublin.  We were using Marriott Rewards points so were given a standard room that was very comfortable and had all the amenities one would expect at a Renaissance.  The staff were very helpful and attentive and the location was excellent; on the north side of St. Stephens Green park, close to shopping, pubs, great restaurants, public transportation, Trinity College, etc.  Definitely a good hotel to base out of in Dublin.",4,2013,06,17
207,Afternoon tea,"Booked for our last afternoon in Dublin, special treat for our Husbands as it was Fathers Day.
We were seated in comfortable armchairs by the pianist.
We were explained the menu and selected our tea.
Sandwiches were superb,egg&cress in a small brioch bun, a cone filled with goats cheese & sundried tomato, smoked salmon on Guinness bread & ham on white.
Next were fruit & plain scones with jam & cream.
Then the fancy pattisiere cakes.
Tea was refilled as many times as you wanted.
We were so full we were given the surplus cakes in a bag to take home!
Take a look at the mini museum by reception it is very interesting.
Beautiful flower arrangements everywhere and sparkling chandeliers
Stunning hotel.",5,2013,06,17
207,The best place to stay in Dublin if youget a good deal,"Almost everything about the shelbourne is the best. The location is central overlooking Stephens Green and an easy walkl or short taxi ride to shipping, restaurants, theatres, pubs and other Dublin attractions. The staff are amongst the most obliging and pleasant that I've met anywhere in the world. The breakfast experience is special in the wonderful Saddle Room but I think my favorite spot in the hotel is the Horseshoe bar where you can sit on a high stool and watch the world go by while enjoying one of the best pints in Dublin. It's expensive but deals are out there and can cut your cost by a significant percentage. The one small problem we encountered was with the valet parking where despite asking for our car to be brought round 2 hours before it was required the was a delay of some 40 mins which the porter tried to unconvincingly blame on the traffic even though it only had to come 50 years from the garage at the top of Kildare St. This potentially was disastrous of we had bed going to the airport to catch a flight. Overall we loved or short stay in the shelbourne and it really didn't break the bank. ",4,2013,06,16
207,lovely hotel,"I was allocated a standard room on 3rd floor which was fine.I then got a phone call from reception asking if I would mind swapping as a family wanted  rooms together.I had no problem with that and was pleasantly surprised when they upgraded me to a larger room on the 6th floor.

rooms are quality furnished and turn down service each night

well located in Dublin for shopping and sightseeing

I was there on a business conference and meetings rooms were lovely",5,2013,06,15
207,Excellent five star hotel in city centre,"This is a real five star hotel, located right in the city centre, opposite St Stephen’s Green. The rooms are big, spacious, and with all the features you would expect from a five star hotel. 
The museum, Grafton street, Dawson street, Trinity College are all few minutes’ walk from the hotel. As it is in the city centre, there are a variety of restaurants nearby. I stayed here for a business meeting, but when I go to Dublin on a family holiday, this will definitely be my hotel choice. 
There is also a small museum in the hotel, where you can see some material from their archives. The draft copy of the Irish Constitution is also on display. The Irish constitution was signed in a room on the first floor, (now known as the Constitution Room). 
The business centre offers free printing, which is a big help. The Ulster Rugby team was staying in the hotel, when I was there. It was nice to see the enthusiastic Ulster supporters giving them a great send-off just before their match with Leinster.",5,2013,06,15
207,"Service, Location and Spotless!","We had the opportunity to stay at the Shelbourne in Dublin on the last four nights of our two week trip to Ireland.  What a way to wrap up an amazing visit!  Excellent location, close but not too close to pubs and shopping. Easy walking distance. Beautiful park across the street.  We were traveling with our mom's and the staff anticipated our every need!  Directions, transportation and dining suggestions, all precise and on taget!  This hotel is an iconic landmark in Dublin, significant historic value, beautiful architecture, chandeliers, marbels winding staircase.  Elevators were available and frequently used.  It was a great blend of old and new. The staff, everyone from the Front Desk Manager to the housekeepers, all displayed outstanding service!  If your budget allows, it's worth the splurge!  It was an experience in its' self!  We only dined at their Breakfast Buffet, excellent assortment, beautifully displayed and items cooked to order, great way to get a day of walking/shopping or sightseeing off to a good start! Almost forgot...the best nights sleep for the whole trip...you can not beat the bedding!",5,2013,06,14
207,Fantastic Venue,"I attended a wedding here at the weekend, it was a fantastic venue, situated close to some great bars, the hotel has it's own amazing bars and function rooms. The rooms are spotlessly clean and look fabulous. The staff all very professional and friendly. Certainly a lot of history within the building, if only the walls could talk! Certainly a must see location even if you can't stay!",5,2013,06,13
207,Great Place,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for a conference recently. Not only is it at a perfect location in Dublin, close to all you'll probably need, but the rooms were really nice, the food was excellant, the staff extremely friendly and helpful. I loved the twisty halls giving, giving the hotel character. The only thing that I really missed was any decent views from the room.
The conference rooms were quite good although maybe not quite with the perfect layout as a newer conference hotel would have.",5,2013,06,13
207,5 star in all regards,I travelled from Dundalk to Dublin for a night out with my wife and stayed with the shelbourne.They had my details as a previous guest and upgraded me without a request.This hotel boasts a professional staff who marry extreme competence with a friendly can do attitude.The hotel is a great location for some shopping and a good night out in the heart of Dublin.A first class experience.,5,2013,06,10
207,Sheer luxury,"Lovely treat for Bed and Breakfast for a family party and so central for the city centre. Bars very relaxing and classic elegance at all times. You feel special staying there. Lovely staff and service very good. Quick check in. Walking distance to St Stephens Green, Grafton Street  Baggot Street for food and pubs - O'Donoghues and Doheny and Nesbitts. Shops close by and Luas to Dundrum five mins away.",5,2013,06,09
207,Shelbourne hotel Dublin,"lovely Hotel slightly dated in Room Areas however once inside the room it was lovely.

service was great.

Breakfast was far from great for such a high class hotel the area to self serve was too cramped and the quality of food was not any better than a hotel half the price.

the tables for breakfast were far too crowded with glasses and cutlery and did not reflect a classy hotel.
it seemed the only chance of getting a good breakfast was to have a chef ordered one.

also bear in mind you are paying 60 euro's for breakfast for a couple so i hope you understand why i am being so picky.",4,2013,06,09
207,Comfortable and Convenient,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for three nights in August 2012 part of our 25th anniversary celebration trip.  The hotel is in a great location, close to several museums, Trinity College and Grafton Street.  It has a great vintage luxury feel to it.  Staff was very friendly and helpful. After check-in we were given a little tour of the restaurant, the Saddle Room.  We felt pretty out of place in blue jeans and t-shirts, but the hostess reassured us and continued the tour. 
We were given a large room on an upper floor with a courtyard view, so there was NO street noise.  Heavy curtains kept the light out, too.  The room was very clean, and the king bed was VERY comfortable.  However, we were given a room that shares the common wall with the elevator 4th floor lobby.  We didn't hear the elevators at all, but there are doors that close the little lobby off from the hallway.  The doors weren't adjusted properly so they banged together when they closed, which was heard through the wall (and the headboard) in the early hours of the morning. That's the only thing that lowered the ""sleep quality"" rating - that bed was amazing!
There is a large dressing area between the bedroom and the bathroom.  Plush robes were provided.  The standard amenities (shampoo, etc.) were available in the large bathroom.  Water volume in the shower was very good.  The water temperature could be varied from way too cold to way too hot but stayed constant where it was set.
Afternoon tea was excellent and very posh. Service is in the front room, the Lord Mayor's Lounge, with a view of St. Stephens green across Merrion Row - a nice afternoon drizzle made the atmosphere idyllic.  We were able to try several different types of tea; they have a very good selection.  We were served a number of finger sandwiches (salmon, cucumber, etc) that were very tasty.  The small fruit tarts were very good and the Scones with clotted cream and strawberry preserves were excellent!!  
When we return to Dublin, we will definately stay here again; longer next time so we can have dinner in the Lord Mayor's and also the Saddle Room.",4,2013,06,08
207,"Grand old historic hotel, you must stay here!","We stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights at the beginning of our two weeks in Ireland.  What an experience!  My husband is a Marriott retiree, so over the many years we have stayed at a lot of great hotels with great service but this place eclipses them all.  From the time we got out of the cab, till we got into our room, we were accompanied by someone who gave us the most attention in a very discreet way.  It made checking in into an event!  Likewise after that, they knew us and greeted us every time.  Beautiful public rooms and an important place in Irish history, check out their small museum.  Location is excellent, you can walk to everything.",5,2013,06,07
207,Our past-due anniversary celebration!,"For health reasons, we were unable to take a special trip for our 25th wedding anniversary.  This past Christmas, our daughters took care of all that!  They pooled resources so that we could go on a dream vacation to Dublin.  The Shelbourne Dublin is just such a fabulous, romantic and convenient hotel.  Elegant in style, phenomenal service orientation and close to everything we could want to visit -- even to the fabulous St. Stephens Green across the street -- we could not have asked for better. I hate to single out anyone as to service, since the personnel at this hotel across the board are first rate.  

Expect to be pampered and treated royally.  The (included in our rate) breakfast was spectacular.  The restaurants, particularly 27, was wonderful, even for quick meals.  If we had one suggestion it would be to have an executive lounge for high points Marriott Rewards members.",5,2013,06,06
207,"Like Home from Home - Warm, friendly, attentive","We were staying at the Shelbourne for almost a week, the reason for our visit not a happy one.

The whole staff from manager to footmen treated us with great attention and deep sympathy which was felt in every detail.
We took the wonderful Afternoon Tea, as well a drinks at the grand bar, had dinner with dear friends at their excellent restaurant.

We enjoyed staying on the 6th floor in a spacious suite overlooking St. Stephens Green.

Everything made for a perfect stay!",5,2013,06,04
207,Comfortable with great breaksfast,We enjoyed staying at this lovely hotel.  It was nice to look over St. Stephen's Green.  It's in walking distance to most of the attractions.  Great breakfast buffet which is included and lasts you all day.  The hotel as a certain old fashioned elegance and the rooms are of a good size.  All in all a nice hotel.,4,2013,06,03
207,Afternoon Tea at The Shelbourne Hotel,"Myself and two friends over from London for a recent work trip had been looking forward to afternoon tea in the Lord Mayor's Lounge at The Shelbourne Hotel.  It had become a mini-ritual of ours to find the best spot for afternoon tea in whatever city we found ourselves working, if our schedules allowed.  Dublin was hosting the Heineken Cup that weekend and the hotel was a hub of atmosphere and activity.  The sun shone into the elegant and gracious drawing room, a welcoming and relaxed space, ideal for a post-work chat and idle conversation.  I chose the afternoon tea for one and my companions chose to have tea and scones.  The service was relaxed and professional.  The scones and tea were good but the afternoon tea was definitely more 'is that it?' rather than 'aaah marvellous'.  The sandwiches were not as fresh as I would have hoped and the selection of desserts were unimaginative and not very tasty.  At €30 per person, I expected more.  However, to spend time here at The Shelbourne is more about being both an observer and participant in the colourful side show at Dublin's most famous hotel.  We felt revived and relaxed when we eventually left, grateful that we were left to simply pass the time in peace.",3,2013,06,03
207,Good Ambassador for Dublin,"Stayed 3 nights, had a good experience.  Big convention (SPAR stores) was checking out when we arrived, thank goodness, and thing calmed down after then.  Our room was large & so was the bathroom.  Only thoughts were the carpet was worn in places, paint chipping, etc. but I'm sure they'll get it all spiffed up before Mrs. Obama arrives!",4,2013,06,02
207,An experience of afternoon tea.,The service was excellent.  Staff were friendly and very helpful.  Afternoon tea consisted if a small selection of savoury items and a very large selection of sweet items. Everything was fabulous.  We took our time and whiled away a couple of hours enjoying the experience. We were given choices of teas and coffees from a good range. Anyone looking for a treat this is for you.,5,2013,06,01
207,Lovely Staff But Really Disappointing Accommodation,"Was really looking forward to a stay at this five star hotel and the friendly staff were lovely and welcoming at reception.....
We had planned the stay as a birthday treat and had requested a nice room. However my enthusiasm soon waned and I was really dismayed and disappointed by the size of the room allocated; shabby, stained carpets, old stickers attached to the side of the bedside table and a fridge that didn't work.  Not exactly what you would expect for the cost. 
In addition, the bathroom was minute, mould on the shower surround and nowhere to really move around at all.
Having stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels I can say this is by far the worst room I have ever come across. 
Not being the complaining types, we just got on with it and made the most of our stay.
The location of the hotel is great. The breakfast was lovely and we again had brilliant service in the morning.  It's a real pity that the quality of the room and the general shabbiness of the carpets in the communal areas let the hotel down.
Will stick to the Westbury the next time.",3,2013,06,01
207,Glad I stayed!,"I was hesitant to stay at the Shelbourne due to some reviews noting the service at this hotel lacking; however, my experience was that the service warm and as good as expected.  Upon check-in, there were no rooms ready (early morning arrival from the US) but I had a spa appointment reserved which allowed me to use the facilities for a shower and change of clothes.  My facial in the spa was quite nice, the facialist very pleasant despite my inability to stay awake.  The spa is beautiful (smells great too!) but is located up and down a myriad of narrow stairs and hallways with a lack of signage in my opinion.  The Minotaur had no chance of finding me in this labyrinth!  The workout facilities are far above average for a hotel with machines, free weights, very new cardio machines, cable machine, cardio space and large pool with steam and sauna rooms.  I was really impressed and had a great workout too.  The buff staff were helpful and willing to assist where necessary.  My Jr. Suite room was spectacular, no view though which was fine as I was looking for comfort and sleep.  The bath was perfect with very deep soaking tub, proper separate shower, beautiful fixtures, Elemis products and large vanity area.  All in marble and granite.  The living room area was beautifully decorated and comfortable and the hallway opened up into the very comfortable and inviting bedroom.  The bed was wonderful, couldn't have been better.  My stay  included breakfast was able to be delivered to my room for only 5 euro add'l which I was so happy not to eat in the restaurant.  Breakfast was whatever I wanted and delivered very quickly, hot and included a delicious pot of coffee which couldn't have been better.  A friend joined me later that day for a drink in the pub.  The food here was very good as well although service was a bit the opposite which we actually found throughout our trip.  Servers were very disinterested in checking up on their patrons.  We had to flag down for more drinks or to get the bill; they walked right past us several times while empty glasses sat in front of us.  The following weekend, I joined friends in the Horseshoe Bar which was very relaxing and a nice setting within the hotel.  I've stayed at four hotels in Dublin now and would highly recommend the Shelbourne although be prepared for the reception area, its a bit like a train station with so many guests in the small space.",5,2013,06,01
207,Mixed Experience,"The staff at this hotel were amazing but we actually had a mixed experience during our stay. We don't usually stay 5 star so maybe our expectations were too high.  Given the other reviews I assume our experience was not the normal one but still I felt I should share it.

The initial room we had was very noisy due to its location. It sounded all night like we were in an airplane due I believe to being located close to the air conditioning unit on the roof (we were 8th floor). When we opened the window to let in fresh air the was a constant noise from a neighbouring building. In the morning we were awoken by someone else’s alarm so the sound proofing didn’t seem up to 5 star. Later we could hear conversations in the hall.  The bathroom light in this room was faulty and would dim and eventually turn off for periods of time before coming back on again.  The extractor fan was not working at all. Finally the TV in this room had extremely poor reception, as it is was analogue TV signal, which was well bellow the expected standard for 5 stars.
We were then moved and upgraded to a new room. This room really was impressive and was more like what I was expecting initially for the price we paid.  However, it still had a few small maintenance issues. The bed side lamps both flickered and made arching noises as you turned the switch off and the bath plug constantly leaked so if you ran a bath you would constantly hear the noise of the water leaking and could not relax.
Finally we received a letter about being upgraded for breakfast to room due to work to the normal breakfast location. This meant no menu to order from, less breakfast to choose from, only omelette available for eggs which took ages as only one chef was cooking this, and also having to negotiate around a cramped restaurant with staff un-sure of what exactly they should be doing.  Moreover, this breakfast was not at any discount that we were aware of. This was very far from 5 star standard and not the expected upgrade that was written in the letter.  The letter should have apologised and said that breakfast was on the house for that morning due to the re-location and that hopefully this made up for the difference in service. It was an insult to be treated like an idiot by calling it an upgrade when it clearly wasn't.
Overall the staff were excellent and helped with the upgrade. I was satisfied with the result but it was disappointing for this to occur in 5 star accommodation.  Moreover, the TV reception (which is more obvious that it doesn't meet the correct standard) should never be allowed to be that bad.  Finally the breakfast was not what we were told it would be and we were not compensated.  We never actually complained about the breakfast that morning as we were checking out and in a hurry so in fairness maybe they would have taken it off the bill.",3,2013,05,31
207,The Shelbourne a genuine five star experience.,"This grand old lady has style and panache.  The staff were so delightful and unbelievably helpful.  I asked for a room with a better view and they upgraded me and moved me to an even more sumptuous room.  Elemis products in one of the biggest bathrooms that I have seen. The pool and spa abilities do not disappoint and are equal to the hotels well deserved five star status. Have I told you about the food?  Afternoon tea, is not to be missed. Push the boat out and have the Champagne.  It is so worth it.  If you just want a quick but tasty supper, try the supper club.  All three courses served on the same slate.  Hey, don't knock it until you have tried it. The main bar has a fabulous buzz, everyday of the week.  However, you may not want to be in a room above it.  The Saddle restaurant is fabulous for seafood and steak.  Check out their seafood platter and Chateaubriand, for an extra special treat. The small seafood platter serves two as a starter, it isn't small stall.
All in all, a genuine five star experience at a wonderful five star hotel.  Thank you...I will be back!",5,2013,05,31
207,Oh wow!,"Stayed here recently with family for one night and it was everything I imagined it would be.  We were very fortunately upgraded to a large sumptuous room which contained two large queen size beds; a beautifully furnished room with large bathroom.  It was amazing comfortable and luxurious.  

I totally agree with a previous reviewer who stated that the staff were more ""real"" than ""trained"" and seemed genuinely interested in being friendly with us whenever we encountered them.  We began our stay with a leisurely lunch and a glass of wine.  We had our dinner in a local restaurant and returned to the bar for a nightcap.  At all times there is a lovely buzz around the hotel.  The location is fabulous being just about 10 mins. walk from the lively Grafton Street area.

Following a most comfortable night's sleep we had a long lazy breakfast sampling everything on the menu both from the buffet table and also some dishes served by the waiter, e.g. crepes with berries and French toast. 

It was with regret that we had to leave the comfort of this hotel and enter back into the reality of the real world!  Would love to go back!",5,2013,05,30
207,A proper 5 star,I stayed in here in January the staff were excellent the food and service fab it is exactly as a 5 star should be. I have stayed in most of the 5 stars in Ireland so far it is the best will be back in november if not before,5,2013,05,29
207,Stayed for lunch,We dropped in to The Shelbourne for our lunch. Delicious French onion soup and freshly made sandwiches. Price is very reasonable for a five star hotel. I personally love the atmosphere in this hotel and when in Dublin I always visit for a glass of wine. I love just sitting and relaxing in the bar. Ivan and Stephen gave us excellent service. Ivan was very professional yet also very welcoming. Hopefully at some stage I will stay here for a weekend.,5,2013,05,27
207,Pure Luxury Right in the Centre of a Great City,"Stayed recently with a group of friends for one night and can only speak really highly of the experience.  This was my third stay at this hotel and my best to date.

From the moment we arrived we got the treatment that I presume is experienced by all VIPs and celebrities when they stay at hotels - I could easily get used to it!

The hotel itself is really beautiful - while of such a high status, each staff member we encountered was most friendly and helpful in a 'real' and not 'trained' manner.

Our room was not ready when we arrived (which was not a problem as we arrived before check-in time) but our bags were taken and carefully put away for us.  They were later brought to the room so they were in the room for us when we returned from a lovely stroll and lunch on Grafton Street (only a 1 minute walk from the hotel).

If I am to be very honest, there was just one element of our stay which we would have changed - we were a party of six in total and had booked two rooms - on the basis that each would accommodate three adults comfortably in three separate beds leaving comfortable space in the room.  The rooms which we got each had two double (not queen/king) beds in them and would have been absolutely perfect for two people.  A fold-out bed was brought into the room for us for the third person but was really only suitable for a child.  Also, the room was not large enough to have a fold-out bed in it with the furniture that was already in the room.  This was a slight pity but we did not let it hinder our stay in any way at all.

Dinner was good (some of the party did not enjoy their meal but I enjoyed mine).  Breakfast was just excellent.  We all commented that we would love to have sat around the breakfast table for hours going back and forth for the most fabulous breakfast buffet.  I can probably say that it was the best breakfast experience I have ever had in a hotel - well done Shelbourne.  What choice and catering for every taste - I had a most beautiful healthy option.

Unfortunately we could only stay one night but I will definitely be back again and will be recommending to others (have already done so but hotel was full for the date they wanted!)

Thank you to all the staff and well done.",5,2013,05,27
207,Amazing,"I was here for a family wedding and can not recommend this hotel enough. It's expensive, especially the bar, but for a 5star hotel I expected that. the hotel is beautiful and really well decorated, and the room was perfect. The bed was the most comfortable bed i've ever slept in, I almost forfeited breakfast to stay in bed. It was such a nice experience, we were made feel really welcome and really well looked after.",5,2013,05,27
207,Excellent Location & Staff,"This hotel is amazing, the rooms are amazing. One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. Stayed here with 3 of my children, so we had 3 rooms, one in the oldest section, which was also very uniquely cool and charming.",5,2013,05,25
207,Great Dublin hotel!,"If you are looking for elegant accommodations in the best part of Dublin for museums,attractions,restaurants,pubs, and shopping, the Shelbourne is the place to stay! It's pricey but worth it! All of the staff are very pleasant and helpful. Our room was spacious enough, well appointed with a very,comfortable bed and all the amenities you need. The Shelbourne is worth a visit even if you don't stay there ",5,2013,05,24
207,Nice Hotel - Dangerous Bathtubs,"The Shelbourne is a nice hotel but their showers are very dangerous.  My sister slipped and fell and she was out of comission for one day of our vacation. The showers have a clear glass partition (that serves as a sort of shower curtain) which partially blocks the water from going on to the floor.  However, this partition moves so it swings away from the top of the tub but you don't realize that it moves until you grab it to keep yourself from falling.  The tub bottom has raised bumbs on the portion directly underneath where the water falls which keeps you from slipping.  But when you walk on the other portion of the tub bottom, there are no bumbs so you slip and slide . .  very dangerous.  

I had tea at the Shelbourne and was disappointed in it and I have been to many teas in many cities.  Presentation was very nice but the food was lacking.  This should be easily rectified.

On the positive side, good location, rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and service is quite good.  The conciege suggested Milanos (on Dawson Street) for pizza and that was very good.",3,2013,05,24
207,Dublin's most exclusive address...,"I am not sure how to word it other than this place is old school baller to the max.  Seriously, an amazing hotel with amazing bars with great whiskey selections.  Stayed here over St. Patrick's Day weekend and had an amazing time.  The service was tremendous as well as they even helped book us our hotel and black cab tour in Belfast!  Can't say enough about this hotel.  Great location near St. Stephen's Green and is perfect unless your total plan is to just get loaded on the Temple Bar.",5,2013,05,24
207,Fantastic Hotel that's close to everything.,"Hotel staff was more than friendly from the moment you walked into the doors. The hotel restaurants and bars are amount some of the best in all of Dublin. Lastly, you will be within a short walk from most tourist sites and only a short ride to others. If you can, stay here! ",5,2013,05,24
207,"Great Service, Amazing Staff","Besides the fact that this is in a beautiful part of the city, the Shelbourne had possibly the nicest and most helpful staff I have ever encountered.  From the front desk clerk to the bar tenders, everyone was nice, helpful and genuinely interested in us.  The rooms were standard.  The restaurant was very good for breakfast.  
The most helpful employees were the doormen.  They were always asking our plans for the day and then giving helpful suggestions.",5,2013,05,23
207,Good location,"We have stayed here a couple of times and it is really well worth a visit. The Hotel has plenty of charm and some great views. It is an excellent place to stay of you are going out in the city centre. The rooms are fairly big and well maintained. The staff have character and provide a nice welcome. They are a bit pricey, but worth it for a special occasion. I used Marriott points for my stay and they were very attentive to our needs",4,2013,05,23
207,Perfect,The Shelbourne is better than ever!  Just stayed there for one night and the service was fantastic. Rooms are clean and bright and the bar is the place to be on St. Stephen's Green.  A great experience with great staff and facilities.  Highly recommended.,5,2013,05,23
207,A step back in time,"Such a nice hotel. Everything is pristine and no details forgotten.

My room was so small, but it was just laid out so well that I didn't feel cramped. It was just me - if I had my husband with me, that would have been a different story.

Rooms are well appointed with all amenities.
Staff is professional and gracious.
Great location across the street from park. 
Regally decorated.
Be sure to make time for the tea service.
Niceties include fresh lemonade and cookies at the front desk.
Ask front desk about the complimentary guided history tour of the hotel. What a fascinating and famous past this hotel has.

This hotel is a destination in itself.",4,2013,05,23
207,Splendid,It's still the place to stay in Dublin and I think it's now better than ever. Rooms well furnished with top of range furnishings and amenities.  Service from check in to check out flawless  food and drink a very high quality. I have to say this hotel is more like the Autograph collection Marriott has been spinning off.  This place is absolutely first rate.  Only strange complaint they are a bit stingy with the soap. The room had only a single bar of hand soap and it was replaced every day.  The other odd thing was they were also a bit stingy with the towels.  Strange the one per person policy at a hotel that is lavish in all other respects. I requested extra towels and they sent 1 to the room and it kept disappearing each day.   It really stuck out because every thing else was so perfect it seemed odd.,5,2013,05,21
207,"Great location, great service.","Quick review.

Great location to explore Dublin, great service. Prices are accordingly.
Great beds, linens, amenities, pillows, shower.
Internet omni-present and fast.
Some minor wear and tear on the carpet etc. in the public areas. 
Very enjoyable, but I am not giving it a 5 dot, because there just was not the wow factor feeling.",4,2013,05,21
207,History in the making!,"Wow, what a property! We stayed at the Shelbourne using our points in May 2012 and loved it. I'm a Platinum @ the Marriott and they valued Platinum's really nicely - the room was good, breakfast was top notch and so was the service. The location is something you can't beat - right across is St. Stephens is right across from the hotel and Grafton street is couple of blocks away but very walk-able.

We decided to do a hop-on/hop-off and the bus stand is right across the street from the hotel, and glad to say we enjoyed the hotel to the fullest. The hotel itself has a lot of history to it and they kept it very well maintained. While there is no Executive Lounge, with so much to do at the restaurant, mall nearby, and Grafton Street - you're bound to be outside and enjoy the amenities at the Shelbourne. Worth staying here and if you can't, worth checking out the property as its amazing!",5,2013,05,20
207,Absolutely Perfect!,"Dublin is a great city and this is an outstanding hotel conveniently located with beautiful rooms - well deserving of it's 5 star rating.  From the moment we were greated at the door to the moment we left, we had superb service in a beautiful location. The staff couldn't not have been more helpful.  Press the ""At your service"" button on your phone and you would think that the person had been standing outside of your door with the ice or whatever you requested. The staff was friendly and helpful and just delightful. Breakfast was lovely with so many good things from which to choose. We hated to leave and will be back - and not just for the chocolate chip shortbread cookies that are always at the front desk!",5,2013,05,18
207,Fantastic hotel and service.,5 star quality all round. Service was amazing and the rooms were lovely. Best hotel breakfast I've ever had. Gym was great too. Very nice turn down service too. Can't fault it! Great Guinness too! Staff were very willing to help with everything,5,2013,05,17
207,Historic hotel in the city centre,"First off, this may be a 5 star hotel, but that doesn't extend itself to the standard rooms. Despite that fact, it is still a great hotel nonetheless.  The hotel has a rich and amazing history (the Irish constitution was drafted here in 1922) and also hosted some very famous guests over the years.  A small room just off reception is filled with great memorabilia from the hotel's long history. It has a great location overlooking St. Stephen's Green and it is right where you want to be in the City Centre. 

The common rooms are elegant and sophisticated so when you enter the lobby from the street, you begin to feel a 5 star experience, but it just didn't carry throughout when I opened the door to our room. I booked a standard room and that is what is was - a small, unremarkable room overlooking nothing.  Granted, the price was not cheap even for standard rooms.  With two adults sharing and large suitcases, it made it someone tricky navigating around this small room. The bathroom, made for one person, was tiny with a sliding door.  It was somewhat impossible to store your toiletries on the counter if you are sharing.  However, the walk in shower was top notch and you had a rain shower water head as well as a hand held one which worked fabulously.  

Overall, the room was clean and tidy. The heavy drapes seemed out of a scale for a room this size.  The standard furniture had some nicks and the carpet had a stain or two making the overall appearance look tired.  The room was quiet and rarely heard any noise from outside or from other guests which is always a good thing.  

What is worth noting is the staff at this hotel.  Everyone here is top notch and truly deliver 5 star in terms of service.  Checking in was quick, warm, and friendly.  They make every effort to ensure you have a great.  The gym/spa was amazing with great equipment and the equally competent and friendly staff.  

I would stay here again, but certainly would not pay the standard rack room rates.",4,2013,05,16
207,Traditonal hotel with personality,"Why I would stay again:
- excellent fitness and pool
- great hospitality
- excellent location
- good restaurants and bar

Why not:
- noisy rooms
- bed too soft (prefer harder)
- breakfast too simple for the hotel (costs 15€ if booked beforehand)",4,2013,05,16
207,A Very Pleasant Stay,"We loved our stay at The Shelbourne, but it was way too short.  The hotel is full of history and is beautifully designed.  The rooms are spacious, comfortable and the beds are great.  The bar and restaurant were very good, although you have to watch your accent.  My New Zealand partner ordered a Grand Marnier and was served an Irish whisky with a name that you could sort of see where the waitress was coming from.  All part of the experience though.  We had a great time in Dublin and the Shelbourne was excellent.",5,2013,05,16
207,Why the wait???,"We were here last Saturday 4th May 2013 for a family occasion.The food was very nice & presented well.The staff I felt gave the impression that I was lucky and honoured to be in their hotel.The wait of 20 minutes at the main bar was very bad and way over priced,seeing as there were three bar staff serving and six people waiting for service.It was as if they did not know what to do.Working in slow motion.The suite was ok,nothing to be writing home about.I think this historic hotel has lost it's sparkle and it's a terrible shame.Shame on managment and shame on the staff for taking the people that visit for granted.They cannot run The Shelbourne on it's past.How many hotels have gone to the wall thinking it's history will keep it alive.Very sad.",3,2013,05,14
207,5 Star from start to finish,"Beautiful Hotel, we booked in to one of the Heritage Park View Rooms overlooking St Stephens Green. Everything from the Valet parking our car, to the Consierge, and the staff were warm, polite, friendly, and helpful.
Our room was beautiful, and immaculate. The furnishings were impecable, and the bathroom huge covered in acres of marble.
Also visit the Horseshoe Bar and try their cocktails...wonderful.
We will definitely return very soon.",5,2013,05,14
207,Afternoon Tea at the Shelbourne,"I was recently treated to afternoon tea at the Shelbourne Hotel  There were four of us in total. Overall it was a very pleasant experience.  Lovely ambience in a beautiful room which also benefitted from glorious evening sunshine. There was piano playing in the background which added to the feel good factor and it felt utterly relaxing soaking up the atmosphere. In relation to the food, the savouries, ie sandwiches were complerely uninspiring.  We requested a round of ham xandwiches without mustard and had to wait a long time before they eventually arrived. Granted it was busy, but the staff were in no way overwhelmed and there seemed to be plenty of them buzzing around.  As this is a five star hotel I felt we should have had a much quicker response. This was only a small blip in an otherwise wonderful evening.The scones and cakes that followed were absolutely delicious. Also the staff were so polite and pleasant. I would thoroughly recommend it!",4,2013,05,14
207,The Shelbourne,"Lonely Planet says some folks are unhappy with  The Shelbourne after they affiliated with Marriott.  Apparently the knock is they aren't trying hard enough.  We didn't find that at all.  This is a lovely old property with typical city views in arguably the most ideal location in Dublin.  We could walk across the street for tour buses or the wild & crazy Viking tour, for carriage rides, or to stroll through St. Stephen's Green.  Our room was a ""superior"" room, not sure what a run of the house room would be like but ours was big enough (not generous) and the bed was comfortable.  Our view was of a building about 10 meters away.  Presumably the rooms overlooking St. Stephen's would have a nice view, though the street below could present noise problems.  Service was among the best I have ever experienced.  I somehow managed to lose some very important meds between Chicago and Dublin.  The hotel concierge hooked me up with a visiting DR on a Sat at 5 PM.  The doc prescribed the meds and I was able to replace them by 6 PM, essentially saving the trip.  And, the guys at the bell desk know everything about Dublin.  Ask them any question, they will answer it.  I know, I asked about 20 questions in 3 days.  The restaurants and pub are excellent, both as to food and service.  Overall, a top notch property.",5,2013,05,13
207,Nice hotel,The receptionist was lovely with a frendly manor. It was a nice little touch having complementary home made lemonade and mini biscuits at reception on arrival. The room was lovely and big as was the really large bathroom. Being picky I did think the bathroom tiles were a little dated compared to the rest of the decor. I was so lucky I visited the hairdressers before checking in as the room had NO hair dryer which I thought very strange. Maybe as the hotel have a salon it is expected that you use the salon instead incurring more expense. Breakfast was OK poor seletion of bread. You can't beat the Wesburry hotel for breakfast so much nicer.,4,2013,05,11
207,WOW EXPERIENCE,"My husband and I have just returned from a 1 night stay at the Shelbourne Hotel and we were blown away by our experience.  As it is an old hotel, we feared that it might be quiet ""stuffy"" and old fashioned but far from it.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was a most uplifting experience and has restored our faith in customer service.  It was our first visit to the hotel and on checking in we were greeted by a fabulous receptionist who told us that she had upgraded us to a superior room which was a lovely surprise. The room overlooked the green, was quiet a big room and a lovely comfortable feel to it.  Dinner in the Saddle Room was probably the best meal we have ever had in a hotel-the food was incredible, the wine list very extensive but again it was staff who excelled.  Service was impeccable, staff were very discreet but thoroughly professional, nothing was a problem.  Breakfast was equally good (sorry to see you didn't have your own home-made muesli!!!) with a huge choice.  On checking out I asked if there was somewhere I could change later as I was attending a function in Dublin that evening and again I was advised that this was not a problem and on returning to the hotel in the afternoon to change, we were given the use of a bedroom to shower and change, again above and beyond what we had expected.  All-in-all I would have to say that our experience at the Shelbourne was incredible, we have stayed at many fine hotels in many countries but this was right there at the top.  Congratulations to the management and staff on running such a fine establishment, it is a credit to each and everyone of you and I look forward to returning there again in the near future.  Well done to one and all, its no wonder you are as busy as you are",5,2013,05,09
207,Airconditioning,"I stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel last weekend, the hotel was impressive looking. We hada a mojor problem with the Air Conditioning noise. It could not be turned off and was very noisy from the bathroom as it ran constantly. Also semed to be a noise from the units on the roof (we were on the fifth floor). I rang reception at 1 am and the said they would check with an engineer as there were no other rooms available, but no response. Later I ran back and said I was leaving the hotel, they ran back and moved me to the second floor which in fairness was better. I expected more from a 5 star hotel and also in their response to my complaint. The elevators were also giving problems. The hotel itseld is nice and the staff friendly but when staying in a hotel I think a good nights sleep is one of the more important things.",3,2013,05,09
207,Dublin grandeur,"A grand and imposing early 19th century hotel in the heart of Dublin, facing St Stephen's Green so very quiet. The Shelbourne has a luxurious but comfortable feel thanks to its traditional furnishings and decor (recently renovated). Attentive staff, and a really excellent breakfast (I didn't eat at any of the restaurants so can't comment on other meals). I spent 3 nights here - a perfect base for exploring Dublin and the surrounding area. It's very close to the main tourist and shopping areas - a short walk to Trinity College (Book of Kells), and 10 minutes from the main shopping street. The hotel staff gave me excellent advice and maps on nearby tourist sites. It's in a very safe area so you can walk back from the city centre at night without any problems (iconic Dublin pubs are about 15 minutes walk away - there's a wonderful ""Literary Pub Crawl"" the hotel can help you book, following in the footsteps of James Joyce etc). The Shelbourne is fairly expensive, but good value for money. I'd definitely stay again.",5,2013,05,08
207,Meeting Family,"Excellent! Service,Food & Very Friendly Staff. ...Afternoon tea was superb!! Bar very friendly...

Near to shops & theatres...

Easy Hotel for family to meet with us.

All round an excellent Hotel to stay in....Would stay again with no hesitation....",5,2013,05,08
207,Great weekend break,"Went away as a group of 6 for a birthday, hotel gave a free upgrade as it was a 60th!
Location was good and service in the bars and restaurants was top class. The buffet breakfast was really nice and had a good selection. The ladies went for afternoon tea which they really enjoyed and came back very full! While us guys went to watch the football in a bar rounds the corner.
Great stay and would definately return.",5,2013,05,08
207,Lovely old hotel,"This hotel is centrally located on St Stephens Green, near Trinity college and close to shopping and hop on hop off stops.  The staff was accommodating and courteous, the hotel itself was lovely, clean, many restaurants and bars to choose from.",5,2013,05,07
207,Very Good Quality Hotel,"Only stayed for one night in March would have happily stayed for many more.
Room, food and service were all of a very high standard, throughly enjoyed the excellent breakfast.
There was a bit of a mix up over my mini bar usage but it was sorted in less than 2 minutes with no fuss and a smile, would most certainly use again.",4,2013,05,07
207,Never disappoints!,"Fabulous time here...have stayed many times and hope to stay many more. Deluxe room very comfortable, clean and well equiped. Breakfast was delicious and all staff were very friendly. Perfect location to explore Dublin from.",5,2013,05,06
207,Great family stay!,"We are a family of 5 and stayed in the heritage one bedroom suite.  Kids are 15, 12 and 9 and the room was still spacious enough and the two rooms made a nice separation.  The hotel was lovely and the included buffet breakfast was great - lots of selection and great service.  We had afternoon tea at the hotel and the whole family enjoyed it.  Great stay!",5,2013,05,04
207,Hire the hotel chauffeur,"I was traveling alone on my stay at this hotel. All the rooms with a view were already taken. I will say my room was the perfect size for one person. The view was not great of a courtyard, but I was so tired after traveling that it did not matter. The queen size bed and room would have been tight for want Americans are used to, but since it was only me I did not have the energy to switch rooms. I was impressed with room service because I did not know how to work the coffee pot in the room, the man in came right away to show me how to use it. The breakfast was great the next morning downstairs. I hired a driver to take me around Dublin. Ciaran McBride who is the main hotel chauffeur with Irish Chauffeurs really did an amazing job showing me the city and the history. I recommend asking for him. Tell Ciaran his Quinn relative ""somehow"" from Louisiana in the US recommend him. You will not be sorry.",5,2013,05,03
207,Lovely,"A great weekend. Super hotel with wonderful character. We visit this hotel annually for a rugby international. The hotel was busy which was to be expected a a few minor blips such as our room not being ready, this was quickly rectified and a bottle of wine given as an apology. Location is excellent and not too noisy. Beds and pillows are amazing, you will be guaranteed a wonderful nights sleep.",5,2013,04,27
207,"Upscale, Clean, Across from Park, Great bars and seating areas","Recently visited for 5 nights.  In the center/edge of the shopping and entertainment district.  It's alway a 1 to 5 blocks walk from the hotel.  Close to dozens of pubs, coffee shops, and shopping.  Days worth of entertainment, all within walking distance.  The hotel itself was outstanding, recently refurbished rooms, and the common seating/dining/bar areas were all very comfortable.  Great for individuals, important business meetings, or groups....when only the best will due.  Also, a great place to incentivize/rewards your top achievers, or spend a week with you top customers. Hotel is good for couples, families, businesses, and individuals.  My room was quiet.   The doorman was very cordial, and manager of the hotel was very friendly and recognized by my name when I walked by.  He made me feel special.",5,2013,04,26
207,Well intended but failed in execution,"The hotel has a lot of historic value and from that perspective I'd recommend staying there one night, but for a longer stay opt for more modern accommodations.  We arrived very early in the morning, and while check-in wasn't until later, they agreed to accommodate us.  Over the course of the next five hours we got shifted from person to person, and got conflicting stories about our reservation for a room with two beds.  Finally, five hours later, they gave us an ""upgrade"" that had only one bed, with a roll-away.  Not what we were looking for.  
The room was large, but the bathrooms are stuck in the 80's.  The breakfast that is included in the hotel rate is good.",3,2013,04,24
207,The Oyster Bar,"Fantastic lunch,great service,we really enjoyed sitting at the Oyster bar for lunch.
This is an excellent example of how to do it up with the best oyster bars we have visited.
Wish we had gone back for dinner instead of Thortons which was dreadful?",5,2013,04,24
207,"Very Good, not excellent","We stayed two nights here. Although I do not feel that it is a 5 star, only because of the rooms. The carpet needs to be changed the shades in the bathroom were broken, the room was tired. But the hotel is in a great location the staff is very friendly, excellent spa service, good food and great bar. I think the hotel is managed well. I have no regret staying here, but if you are looking for 5 star you may want to try The Merion, although it may not be a fun as the Shelbourne",4,2013,04,23
207,Lovely Night away,"Stayed here recently with my partner for a special night away together. From the doormen, to the concierge to the reservation & front office staff, everyone was so polite & helpful. There was a great buzz in the hotel when we arrived and after a swift check in, we were helped to the room with our luggage, even though we only had 2 small bags!
Our room was beautiful & clean and the bathroom and shower were huge! I could wait to try it out, especially after getting caught out in the rain that evening!
As we were dining elsewhere that evening, we didnt get to try out the restaurants but we did enjoy a few late night drinks in the residence bar which was lovely & relaxing. Our bed was super comfortable and hard to leave the next morning!
We ordered breakfast to the room for the next day. My only criticism was that i thought the breakfast would have been better for a 5 star hotel. I didnt think it was great quality.

Otherwise we were very happy with our stay. Lovely hotel, friendly staff and great location! Next time il make sure to check out their new spa & pool!!",4,2013,04,22
207,I love Dublin,"We stayed 5 nights here. We visited Dublin for a wedding and were recommended this hotel. We are so glad we were.
The hotel is very traditional and genteel. The bar areas are very good. 
We had afternoon tea one day, we felt the sandwiches had been made in advance and were a little dry around the edges. And the little fancy cakes were just a little too fancy. We didn't eat them. But the staff did package them up so we could take them with us. But we still had a lovely time.
We ate in the restaurant one night. The food was excellent and the service faultless and very attentive without being overbearing. 
The room was lovely and overlooked St Stephens Green.  It was roomy albeit a little dated. But very in keeping with the overall feel of the hotel. The bed and pillows are the best I have experienced outside my own home. We struggled to leave the bed each day, and we slept better that we have in ages.
The spa is an Elemis Spa, I tried to buy a product but was informed that it hadn't been with Elemis for long and didn't carry a lot of stock. It was little disappointing but certainly didn't influence our opinion of the hotel.
Te restaurants in the area are many and all seemingly very good quality.
We will definitely stay here again, and we look forward to it greatly.
I will just add that as we were leaving, there was scaffolding being erected.  I would just check that any work has been completed prior to booking this hotel.",5,2013,04,22
207,Had much higher expectations,"You know, at the end of the day, it's not about _everything_, it's about the things you really need.
This time around, I arrived in a taxi, who didn't take credit cards, so I walked into the hotel to the reception to ask for an ATM. First problem, there isn't one in the hotel. Ok, fine, so can they get me some cash and put it on the room? Second problem, ""no"". Ok, so I walk out again, taxi drives me to an ATM, I pay and I walk back.
Third problem, when I get back to the reception, they can't find my booking. I bring out the reservation number and show them the booking email and still they can't find it. After 20 minutes of ""technical problems"" they find it. Awesome.
So I go up to my room, decide that I'm hungry, and go down to the reception to look for a restaurant. Turns out there are a few choices in the hotel. The steak place mentions organic meat so I think that must be someone who knowns his way around the kitchen.
So I sit down, and look at the menu. Kind of sucky, nothing really exciting, and it doesn't mention anything about the organic nature nor where the meat is from, and nothing about the source of vegetables either. So I go with a goat cheese salad and the onion risotto. Against my better judgement (never ever order risotto unless the chef is italian).
Goat cheese comes in, a sorry looking thinly sliced something and another that would all fit on one fork for 17 euro. Not awesome.
And the risotto turned out to be overcooked underprepared mash of things. Definately not awesome.
So I head out, and wanted to go to the gym. I follow the signs and, well, don't find it. Walk back to the reception and ask for the gym, and they tell me it's closed (6.30am-8pm). What the hell is that about?
I go to the gym in the morning, and the exercise bike I sit on has a hardly usable screen, and noisy ball bearings. It looks quite new though. 

Am I being to picky? Not really, it's not about what everyone else needs and gets, it's about what I need. And it wasn't this.",2,2013,04,22
207,A real grand dame with girl next door hospitality,"I last stayed in the Shelbourne 12 years ago and was distinctly underwhelmed then.  How times and the Shelbourne have changed.  The makeover has resulted in a tasteful and comfortable hotel which feels elegant yet homely.  I travel frequently and stay in mainly 5 star hotels but the staff in the Shelbourne are up there with the best due to their warmth and natural professionalism.  Our stay was not without incident.  Staying in a few Heritage rooms for a family get-together, I was discomfited to find a strong smell of cigarette smoke coming through the vent from the outside.  However the hotel responded quickly and on completion of a Marriott questionnaire when I returned home, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a lovely letter from the Shelbournes Guest Relations manager within a couple of days.  As a family we spend a considerable amount annually with Thomson & BA - yet I have never received any personal service or acknowledgement.  These companies would do well to take a leaf from the Shelbourne management & staff. In short, a lovely hotel which although not perfect deserves five stars for it's great service & lovely staff.",5,2013,04,19
207,Brings Out the Irish in You,"The Shelbourne is a lovely old hotel in a great location.  A friend and I stayed there recently and were impressed by the attention we got from the staff.  Everyone, from the maids to the bartenders to the reception staff, were just great.  It is located right across from the village ""green""--although Dublin is hardly a village anymore.

There were some stains on the carpet in the hallways which looked old.  But generally, the hotel is in good condition.  The included breakfast was wonderful.  If I return to Dublin, I will certainly want this to be the hotel I stay at.",5,2013,04,19
207,Lovely Bar!,"Stopped in the iconic Horseshoe Bar (now known as No. 27 Bar & Lounge) earlier this week for drinks while on holiday with my sister.  While we did not stay at the Shelbourne, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience in the bar.  It's known for fabulous drinks and a great scene, and did not disappoint.  Ivan behind the bar is a genius!  He made us some amazing cocktails that were his own creation and was so kind and enjoyable to talk to.  A master mixologist....definitely have him create a one of a kind cocktail for you!  Always a must visit for drinks when in Dublin and will certainly be back on my next visit.  Thanks for the spectacular drinks & service Ivan!",5,2013,04,19
207,Love This Hotel,We travel to Dublin once or twice every year and this is the only hotel we ever stay in.  It is such a wonderful experience.  The service is second to none and the food amazing.  Breakfast is an experience all of it's own.  If there is something that is not on display then all you have to do ask and it is there.  The two bars are really lively but for a quieter drink you can use the smaller one called the Horse Shoe Bar.  They do amazing cocktails too.  This is not a cheap experience but there are deals on offer at times.  All in all a truly magnificent experience.  If there was a downside to the hotel it that the rooms and bathrooms are getting a little tired but they are still beautifully decorated.,5,2013,04,19
207,Fabulous Dublin,"I have been visiting the Shelbourne Hotel for many years and have loved every stay. A perfect location on the green, old world charm, and staff that are delightful. Treat yourself to breakfast or lunch, the food is excellent. The Horseshoe Bar is delightful, and if you don't drink, don't worry, they make a great pot of tea. This is the place to celebrate St. Patrick's day with visitors and locals.",5,2013,04,17
207,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed at the hotel 3 times on business. The hotel has a great location in a safe and beautiful  part of Dublin, close to everything but not too noisy at night. Best bed i ever slept on, great bar, spa, restaurant and room service. I did have a few issues during my stays (heating did not work, bath leakage) however the staff was so helpful and made everything they can to fix things as soon as possible. I would like to mention Jane and Mirta from the reception for their outstanding service. I would not stay in Dublin in any other hotel.  One point for improvement- more vegetables  for breakfast, and pastries not always fresh.",5,2013,04,16
207,Great Location,"Very nice, upscale hotel.  Room was large, very clean and comfortable.  Location was great, you could catch the ""Hop on and off"" tour bus right outside the door.  Breakfast was a huge buffet and was delicious.  Although expensive, I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,04,15
207,Venerable old Dublin gem,"History laden, but renovated to modern standards (except for a paucity of electrical outlets near the bed) the Shelbourne is very centrally located and a comfortable place to stay.  I had a 2-room suite named the ""JFK"" suite that was a bit quirky with the living room on one floor and the bedroom and bath down 4 steps, but in the end it added to the charm of the old hotel and its grand furniture.  Since it's a Renaissance, you get your Marriott points and benefits - though there is no longer a Concierge lounge in the hotel -- instead you get a free drink ticket and free Continental breakfast in the dining room if you are Marriott Gold or above.",5,2013,04,15
207,Disappointing bedrooms and average breakfast,"Was really looking forward to staying here but the room (Queen double) was somewhat disapointing. Room was quite small with no seating and a very small desk area. The bathroom comprised very small basin and shower, no bath. When I ordered room service they had to put it on the bed as there was no space. That said the public rooms are full of character and the service is excellent. Breakfast was also quite average (no potatoes, hash browns, rolls quite stale). I was expecting more from what is supposed to be Dublin's best.",3,2013,04,15
207,Fantastic hotel.,We stayed here again in March 2013 and has a wonderful time. The staff at this hotel are superb and welcoming. In particular the restaurant staff are very attentive and professional. I would highly recommend this hotel if visiting Dublin. ,5,2013,04,13
207,Christmas 2012,"We travelled from London and stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights over Christmas 2012, Christmas Eve night and Christmas Day leaving Boxing Day. Our experience from start to finish was superb even though we had to wait a few hours for our room initially the staff made our stay well worth the while. Not a single opportunity was left for complaint as any potential creases were ironed out immediately at this very busy time of year in a hotel full to capacity. The staff responded smoothly to all our requirements with a smile and sincerity demonstrating their exceptional training and professionalism. This was our first stay and we shall be back again without hesitation as this is a superb location. We were lucky enough to find parking on the street which was free after certain times, restaurants close on Christmas Eve around 9pm so we reserved dinner in the hotel, they have a fabulous wine list and the horse shoe bar is a great place to meet friends early and then as would be expected is only open to residents after a certain time during this busy period. We stayed on the 5th floor, street side with views of the Green and Dublin mountains in the distance. The spa had been recently added, however, on this occasion we did not manage to experience this facility in full and look forward to trying it out next time we stay at this lovely, friendly hotel. The staff at the Shelbourne are exceptional and made ( my fiance and I ) feel very welcome, we had a great time indeed!",5,2013,04,10
207,Olde World Elegance and Opulence,"If it's good enough for Billy Connolly it's good enough for me!!!  The famous comedian was staying at The Shelbourne Hotel when we were in town to see him at The Gaiety and he is just one in a long list of celebrities who have graced the corridors of this fabulous establishment.  From the time we arrived at the hotel we were treated to a world that no longer exists in most modern hotels.  The staff are, without exception, highly trained and professional and could not do enough to ensure that our stay would be a memorable one.  Our room was clean and comfortable and situated at the rear of the hotel where it was nice and quiet.  We dined in The Saddle Room for both dinner and breakfast and the food on both occasions was second to none.  We had drinks in both bars and the atmosphere was really good in all areas of this stylish hotel.  This is a top class hotel and I hope that I can visit again really soon.  I can highly recommend it.",5,2013,04,10
207,Practically perfect,"We stayed at the Shelbourne while attending a wedding held there.

It was fantastic.  Just beautiful.

From when you arrive the staff are very attentive with every member you walk past greeting you.  Our room was beautiful.  Quite large with a lovely large bathroom.

The next morning we had breakfast at the hotel which was delicious.  Once again the staff were great.

Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend a stay there if you have the chance.",5,2013,04,10
207,great hotel,great hotel. good service. very historical.good location in the heart of the city. staff was very nice and helpful. full service breakfast was excellent.near all the shopping and bus stop. has small museum to explain irish history.,5,2013,04,10
207,Loyalty upgrade,"Returning to the Shelbourne for the second time on March 23rd because of its excellent location, we were happily upgraded this year to a junior suite facing St Stephen's green on the second night of our 4 night stay. Included in this year's price was the complete breakfast buffet. What a wonderful start to each day!  If the fruit, cheese, ham, granola, scones and breakfast rolls of all types weren't enough, a full Irish breakfast was also served buffet style. Then, a 6 choice menu including omelettes, pancakes etc was handed to us. Needless to say we did not need another bite to eat until well into the afteroon. 
Fresh water and chocolates arrived each evening at turndown. However, for some reason there was no turndown service on Sunday. (reception staff told us there should have been) 
The 2 televisions in the suite allowed me to watch a French channel while my husband watched Irish programs. As a retired Fr. teacher I appreciated that. 
As last year, we found the staff very service minded and professional. 
There is a hustle and bustle to the lobby area that I did not experience at the Merrion, but then again I like a lively atmosphere. 
Even though our room was on the busier side of the hotel, the insulated windows blocked the noise and the wonderfully comfortable bed insured a fine night's sleep. 
My only question is whether the Shelbourne would match the great price I got by using an internet  booking company. I guess I'll have to wait until next year to find out.",4,2013,04,08
207,The bees knees,"This hotel is top class. It has great staff, great food, great atmosphere and an all round high standard. Love to stay here when I'm in Dublin . The rooms have plenty of space and they are spotless. The bar is the highlight. Its always buzzing. Would highly recommend .",5,2013,04,08
207,supper in lord mayors lounge.,"We stayed in Shelbourne Hotel overnight two weeks ago - stayed a few times before and was always very happy with everything. This time we were not as lucky.  First at check in we were told we had a lovely room - room tiny, ensuite tiny - very disappointing! It was my husbands birthday  and I had booked supper in lounge for us and friends -so bad , we could'nt believe the portion size - starving after - had crisps in pub later! Could'nt believe the residents bar could charge 10.90 for a glass of house wine! Next morning we arrived down for breakfast at 10.15 and was told we would have to wait an hour! Was worth the wait though! We had an appointment for the spa at 1.00 -big queue for check out so left case with porter and told him room ready for cleaning ( 10.15) - when we went to pay after spa (3.00) we were told it was taken from credit card given at check in which we did,nt want done so finally they cancelled it and used the card we wanted to use!",3,2013,04,08
207,Stay number four and hoping for more.,"Yes, we went back for another memorable stay at the Shelbourne. It did not disappoint. Its cheery buttercup room awaited us, weary travelers from the US. The quiet that surrounded us in our room for our entire stay was wonderful. The room is equipped with a very comfortable bed, modern bathroom, a tea and coffee set-up out of Downton Abby, and an air of well-preserved times gone by. The location cannot be beat and the manner of the people who work there and hotel interior are elegant. From the Shelbourne, the city centre shops, museums, restaurants, and transportation are all within a short walk. The charming St. Steven's Green opposite is a respite from the busy city sidewalks. What else can I say? It's our favorite getaway hotel in Dublin.",5,2013,04,08
207,Lovely stay in the Elmerald Isle !!,"We stayed here over the easter and didnt realise that good friday and easter sunday most of the places were closed, glad the hotel was clean and comfy to a very high standard . and provided us with food and drinks in the very regal no 27 bar . The hotel has much history of past celebs and other vip's in the shelbourne's very interesting little museum . Lovely room and bathroom that was perfect for our easter getaways, Just a short bus ride to the centre of town from outside a a twenty minute walk on a nice day , recommend to anyone looking for a descent location and the five star standards of a hotel!!",4,2013,04,08
207,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel amazing decor, staff exceptional. food amazing, Rooms out of this world 
right in the heart of Dublin. would truley recomend. this hotel is one that you would not want to leave. the bar area is lovely and grand.",5,2013,04,08
207,Expected More,We recently had a family dinner in the Shelbourne .Overall the experience disappointed me. While I would say the staff were excellent and could not have been more attentive I feel the food let the hotel down. The portions were very small particularly for the men in the group.I personally had the goats cheese starter and  trout for main and both were very very small but tasty enough.I definitely needed a dessert . The Saddle Room is however a nice dining area and the hotel is very nice since its major refurbishment some years ago.I must say I saw no sign of a recession as both the bars and dining room were busy.,3,2013,04,08
207,Afternoon Tea!,"I recently had afternoon tea here and it wad five star. The service was excellent and the atmosphere is amazing. A beautiful room with lovely feautures. The chairs were comfortable and we didnt feel rushed at all. The pastries and scones were delicous. However, on a negative note, the sandwiches were not my cup of tea and i didnt think there was enough. The ham and mustard was very plain.
Other than that our sugar bowl was dirty and we had no cups. The waitress was very discreet in quickly giving us cups when she realised so that was a plus. 
When we were finished, we were waiting fifteen minutes to recieve our bill and in the end we had to call a waiter over. He was pleasant but when paying with card he very boldly asked how we were going to tip.
Of course i was leaving a tip but i didnt want to be asked about it by our server! 

All in all the experience was amazing except for a few little things. The staff are very polite and professional. ",4,2013,04,07
207,Thanks to Ashley my trip was amazing!,"Myself and my husband stayed here recently to celebrate a significant birthday of mine. It was a gift from my siblings. My sister liased with Ashley to ensure that we haD the best experience possible and we certainly did. Not only were we upgraded and given an early check-in but a bottle of wine and macaroons were delivered to our beautiful room to wish me a happy birthday !
It is a class place with amazing service. It fulfilled a dream I had for years of staying  in the Shelbourne and it lived up to my expectations and more. Thanks to all , but especially who is a consumate professional. We will be back for sure!",5,2013,04,06
207,Gold star service.,"We have just returned from what started as a four day visit that had to be extended to a nine day one due to a health emergency.  The hotel were extremely efficient and very caring during what was a difficult time.  
It is a hotel we have always wanted to stay at and it did not disappoint.  The location is ideal for sight seeing and shopping. St.Stephen's green is across the road and offers good jogging paths for those who like to keep fit amid pleasant surroundings.  
If you want good service and helpful staff this is where you'll find it.",5,2013,04,05
207,Historic Property - Superior Service,"We recently returned from a 6 night stay at this historic downtown Dublin hotel.  We booked our very first trip to Ireland through United vacations and I chose the Shelbourne for two reasons - I am a Marriott Platinum member and the excellent reviews.  Prior to our visit I emailed the concierge and filled out some check in paperwork and asked that my Marriott number be added to the folio so I could receive some benefits from any funds I spent at the hotel outside of the rooms (rooms booked through 3rd party agents are not eligible for rewards).

We arrived after our overnight flight to the hotel at 10 AM.  As described by other reviews, the property is beautifully restored and smartly decorated.  The lobby areas are very small and provide for some occasional bottlenecks.

Check in was what I would describe as chaotic.There was really no queue type of arrangement and people checking in or out were trying to be assisted by the 3 guest associates.  There were no rooms available when we arrived which was understandable.  We were told to ""check back in two to three hours"" and they would see if something had opened up.  As we were exhausted from the flight, we plopped down in the few chairs available in the reception area and waited.  At 12:10 I got back into the make ship line and someone asked how they could help me.  I told them I was checking if my room was ready and he told me to wait and he would personally check to see if it was  The first sign of the service I had heard so much about.  In a couple of minutes I had our room key and we headed up to our beautifully appointed room on the third floor in what I was guess was the second worst location in the entire building.  (the first being one floor below us).  Our room looked directly into an office building.  (I could wave to the people during the week) and was directly above the trash/recycling cans which we could hear them fill and empty late in the evening and early in the morning.  Except for the location, the room was top notch, much bigger then our room in London last year, and spotless.

A few words about dining.  Our package plan included breakfast which was a buffet with some made to order items - I believe the menu price was 28 euros, not a value if we had to pay out of pocket.

We also had afternoon tea one day which regardless of the price was an experience not to be missed.  The tea was excellent, the food ample, and the service first rate.  No live piano music though.

Wife and I visited the attached health club on two days to use the equipment.  Everything was clean and spotless and the areas, although a little small, were more than adequate for the amount of people in there.

A few additional comments on the service:

- Turn down with a chocolate and water on the first night then nothing after that.  Quite odd.
- Everyone highly professional and friendly (as was all of Ireland).  They seem to genuinely be concerned that you were enjoying your stay and were glad to have you as their guests.  I don't think you could ask for much more.
- Check out was much smoother, although it was only 7:20.  We were asked how we enjoyed our stay, and was checked out in just 2 minutes.  
- Concierge was hit and mis.  Asked to have some things booked and one was left off.  Nice getting a confirmation in your room by letter.  Taxi to the airport that was requested with the concierge the night before also got missed.

On a future trip I would consider staying here again, but I would have to have some input into the room, or I would make a different choice of a hotel.  It really wasn't pleasant to keep your curtains drawn all day so the office building couldn't see in.  Also since there was no recognition of any Marriott status, I would entertain trying a different venue next time, although I can't imagine anything topping the Shelbourne service.",4,2013,04,05
207,Excellent hotel,"This is a very nice hotel, excellent rooms, if you are not unlucky... Which I was. I got a room where there was a problem with the drainage in the shower (only shower and no bath tub). I told at the reception and they said it would be fixed. When back the evening after work I checked, but to my big disapointment it was stilla problem, meaning that after 45s the whole floor in the bath room was flooded and the water was going into the hallway of the room. To my bad luck I could not get another room! I had to stay one more night without being able to have a proper shower! Only after 2 nights I was moved to another room, as they realised I was staying 2 more nights..... But The new room was very nice, comfortable and pleny of space. The breakfast was great and I didn't miss anything. Cooked to rder for some things, fresh fruit and lots of other things. Would recommend it, but make sure you get a room with a working drainage.",4,2013,04,03
207,living the good life,"our experience at the Shelbourne Hotel was grand!  we stayed one night at the beginning of our Ireland trip and ended the trip there also. both nights were very pleasing.  the second visit there we were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful. breakfast was very good and staff were so friendly and helpful.  since i had an early flight out, they made me a breakfast box to go! nice being close to so many sights and the hop on hop off bus is great for sightseeing. hope to return for another visit someday",5,2013,04,02
207,Brilliant,"We went to Dublin for 3 days for a bit of a pub crawl and a laugh,well what can i say,firstly the Shelbourne was perfect,some of the customers are a little stuck up but we ignored that,the staff were lovely the room was lovely and as we had paid for Breakfast,that was the icing on the cake,set in a perfect location for what ever you choose in Dublin",5,2013,04,02
207,A nice place to stay,"Breakfast - very good service and I really liked how each staff member said morning in passing even though they were clearly run off their feet. 
Saddle Room restaurant - very good food and service. We dined here on Good Friday and the restaurant was very busy. I did find it disappointing that the 7 course set menu was not available due to this. The restaurant is pricey and whilst this is expected in a five star hotel, I have been to Michelin star restaurants which are a similar price. Very good food none the less.
Rooms - the rooms are a little run down in comparison to the rest of the hotel.
Overall we had a very enjoyable stay - though the hotel is expensive, i felt it was worth the money.

207,"I have read most of the average, poor and terrible reviews for this hotel.  Here’s my take:","Let me qualify this review by saying I have stayed in many 5 star hotels over the years, however as a fairly new member, this is the first time I have reviewed one on tripadvisor.

The hotel is very centrally located with a lovely position across from St Stephen’s Green.  She is the Grand old Dame of Dublin and is dressed accordingly, if you want modern and minimalistic there are other 5 stars which deliver this. 

A family of four staying in a room with two queen sized beds, our room was the largest we have ever stayed in, with a little side room which housed the wardrobe and chest of drawers.  The chest of drawers might have been a little small for our needs, the wardrobe however was more than sufficient. Our marble bathroom had both bath and separate shower. Being nosy types, we did have a look at a standard sized room across the hall one morning when it was being cleaned for new guests and although much smaller I can honestly say if we had been travelling as a pair we would have been more than pleased with the space.

We did not have a room with a view overlooking the green, obviously not every room can.  It overlooked what was probably a rooftop.  Sheer curtains meant this ‘view’ did not offend the eye, but we were there to enjoy facilities other than the view. The room had all the usual 5 star prerequisites including an ironing board and iron and free unlimited wifi for up to four appliances.
Our room was very clean.  I would not say it was spotless.  I believe spotless is an impossible state to achieve in any lived in facility with soft furnishings unless it has been very recently refurbished, but I feel the standard of cleanliness in the room we had was very high. Housekeeping was a little late in the day, we returned to the room at 2:30pm on our way to the bar for a coffee and it had not been made up, however an hour later it was pristine. The public areas were not filthy, or anything close to it.

We had turn-down service each night which included chocolates and bottles of water.  As we were celebrating a family event we also had an unexpected rose petal turn-down, complete with complimentary chocolate bars, macaroons and pink lemonade.

Our rate included breakfast in the Saddle Room; there were a la carte and buffet options or a mixture of both. You could basically have whatever you wanted and as much of it.  A personal favourite was the Shelbourne Eggs Benedict – two poached eggs, each on a grilled beef fillet steak topped with hollandaise. Add to that a selection of cereals, porridge, fruit juice, smoothies, tea or coffee, fresh fruit, a wide selection of breads, pastries and toast and a variety of cold meats and cheeses and I think it was worth the price! We did have to wait one morning to be seated, we were shown to the Lord Mayor’s lounge, offered tea and a newspaper but within five minutes (yes, I timed it) a table was ready for us.  We were never rushed from our table, nor did we feel under pressure to leave before we were ready.

We stayed over Easter weekend, a busy weekend. Licensing laws in Ireland dictate no alcohol be served on Good Friday so with bars and many restaurants closed we expected the hotel bar (which is allowed to serve alcohol to residents only) to be extremely busy.  I worried about the perceived ‘rugby scrum’ situation but this never materialised.

The facilities in the Spa and Fitness centre were excellent.  Exceptionally clean and everything you could have needed provided.  The hotel is a bit of a maze, and we did get lost the first time we made our way back to our room from the pool.

I think this is very important to say. We did not encounter one unfriendly, unhelpful member of staff our entire stay.  From the moment we stepped out of our car and were greeted by the valet until we pulled away at the end of our stay to waves from the doorman, we could not fault any member of staffs attentiveness, politeness and helpfulness.   We found the concierge most helpful and he went the extra mile to find us information on two separate occasions.  The bar staff in No. 27 were neither stand-offish nor unfriendly, in fact went out of their way to make my children feel very comfortable and special.

When you look at how hotels are awarded star ratings, the Shelbourne ticks all the 5 star boxes.  However, any hotel is only as good as its staff, and in my opinion this is currently a very good 5 star hotel.",5,2013,03,31
207,Beautiful but don't become complacent,"Here I am at the Shelbourne Hotel Dublin on Good Friday. Probably not the night to decide to stay in the capital but there you go. Such lovely staff at the Shelbourne. Polite, attentive, enthusiastic - definitely a credit to the establishment. 
On the other hand I think perhaps housekeeping could do with a little tweak. Our air con wasn't working. The engineer had to reset it. The phone in the lounge of our suite wasn't working but only discovered this after attempting to phone room service, seven times, the concierge four times and the operator twice in a quest for ice & fresh milk which was eventually achieved through using the bedroom phone and waiting upwards on 15mins for the service.
Upon trying the bedroom phone and succeeding, a dud phone seemed apparent.

The upholstery, particularly the sofa arms were in great need of cleaning as they are visibly grubby and I hate to say it but a child's white socks are such yardsticks! My daughters were absolutely filthy after walking around the carpeted floors of the bedroom and lounge of our suite.
I'm also unsure how I feel about clear glass on the window of the actual toilet looking out on to St. Stephen's Green. Roman blinds are lovely but privacy glass or at least mottled contact plastic would feel much more comfortable.
 
Finally, having been told upon checking in, that the pool was not open to children after 5pm and between 10am-12pm daily, only to discover at 8:15pm that there were children allowed into said pool, and being told children permitted after 10am only when it clearly states in the room services book that on Sat, Sun & B/H entry is from 8am-5pm. All in all confusing!!
For a five star hotel there are always exceedingly great expectations and that's why ye have a hotel....but the are some definite areas where improvement is needed. 
Staff = a resounding 10
Cleanliness = 7
Quality = 8",4,2013,03,29
207,"Should be Five Stars, but","The Shelburne Dublin is a very fine hotel situated directly across from a beautiful park and not far from all the sites in Dublin.  I have stayed there numerous times and always found it to be a very good business and holiday hotel.  The rooms are large, but they are a little worn at the edges and dark in appearence.  The staff is great, but during my last visit they seemed to totally ignore the fact that I'm Platinum Elite with Marriott Rewards.  If they don't want to get with the program; maybe management should consider changing their franchise?  The bar is a great place to relax and meet business associates before dinner (many fine restaurants near the Shelbourne).  I had breakfast one morning at the hotel with associates which was first class, but pricey.  I was asked if I wanted the a newspaper, but was told I would be charged for it??  For what I paid for breakfast, the newspaper should be gratis.  I'm going to be in Dublin on May 9th/10th, but will be giving The Westbury Hotel a try; which is a little closer to town center and hopefully more customer friendly.",4,2013,03,29
207,Just Fine,The hotel itself is truly amazing and most of the staff are very friendly although the staff behind the bar seem quiet rude. I sat by myself at the bar while waiting for a colleague and not one of them tried to engage in conversation or even crack a smile .Drinks are quiet expensive here but i guess that`s what you expect to pay in as 5 star hotel but I definitely expect friendlier service form the bar team. The food in the restaurant is average at best and also the service here was below expectations. The experience itself was nice but i wouldn't return when you would get a better welcome in Eddie rockets,3,2013,03,29
207,A home away from home in Dublin.,Love this place. A home away from home in Dublin. Staff are great and the hotel has a great atmosphere. Great location. One gripe. Change the room service menu. It's not extensive and has not really changed in 3 years. This is an issue if you are a regular guest.,5,2013,03,28
207,Perfect in every way,"The Shelbourne was the perfect place to stay for 3 days and nights. Beautifully maintained, lovely and nice staff. Perfect location to see central Dublin and walk to all major attractions and feel totally safe. Expensive but a worthwhile splurge!",5,2013,03,25
207,The Lady Vanishes But Now Returns,"First time back in this historic and iconic Dublin hotel after its revival and refit. We went to Dublin for  6 Nations rugby game and elected to stay at the Shelbourne as it has been the centre of international rugby weekends for as long as I can remember and long before that. I went with a mix of hope and trepidation wanting to show off a great hotel to my beloved and fearing that even if it was great for her I would find things to criticize that would detract from the memories (I am notoriously critical). I am delighted to report that while the old lady has had a facelift she is fully recognisable as the elegant grand dame of hotels that she has always been.  

Located in the heart of fashionable south city centre Dublin and within walking distance of the elegant shopping in and around Grafton Street this is the ultimate location for your visit to Dublin. An outstanding hotel which has retained all its style and decor while boasting all the modern pleasures of a Spa, Gym, Pool etc. Everything, from arrival to departure was a joy and the staff in particular were outstanding. It is a magical experience, for someone who knew it in its heyda,y to meet staff who are too young to share my memories but who have adopted the ethos of the hotel at its peak and who try to live that ethos from first to last. 

An outstanding experience from arrival to departure. A statement in hotel management and a remarkable accomplishment by the team there. Only thing missing for me were the ""characters"" who made it the wonderful quirky place it was and who have sadly passed on but sitting in the Horshshoe Bar on Friday night I could see andhear tha,t in it's new manifestation, the Shelbourne is building up a new generation of characters to embellish it's historic reputation.

Nowhere else comes close.",5,2013,03,25
207,Beautiful building and atmosphere,"The hotel has everything going for it. Great central location. Stunning architecture. Friendly staff, Although clearly the thrust for 'delighted to serve' became as a slogan a tad patronising. The Rooms are not huge but the decor is great. The spa although appears to be expensive is fantastic value and the girls worked really hard to make it an experience to remember. The food couldnt have been nicer.
A top hotel in every respect. ",5,2013,03,23
207,A Dublin icon,"The Shelbourne has always been a magical place and it's great to see how this has been maintained as well as improved upon. Located in St. Stephen's Green (cross the road to enter the park) it is perfectly placed for exploring Dublin's south city and for going further afield to places such as Dun Laoghaire etc.
DO have breakfast if you stay here - it's served in the Saddle Room restaurant and they do a very good Eggs Benedict. Rooms were spacious and the bathrooms too. Despite staying in a room at the front overlooking 'the Green' the noise levels were well muted by appropriate glazing. Staff are superb and it's a great place to have afternoon tea, lunch, dinner, a drink in the bar(s) and learn about the history the hotel has been part of.",5,2013,03,23
207,A Grande Old Dame,"The pipes...the pipes were calling...literally, the day I stepped from my Taxi arriving for two nights  at this Dublin landmark Hotel!  Immediately swept up with the excitement of Ireland's Rugby team, also Shelbourne guests, leaving for a big match...The Staff still made little old me feel totally welcome and found me a spot at the crowded dining room...with a birds eye view of their brilliant young Chef handling a bustling business...Chicken dinner was perfect...No pretense...just delicious basic fare.....Spa was my next stop and although a bit dark for my taste, a lovely way to spend a rainy Dublin afternoon....The room I had was probably one of their least opulent ...after all, I was staying on Marriott points, but it was cozy and comfortable with a new marble bathroom...

Drinks in The Lord something front room was memorable...After the match, still buzzing...but with soothing piano player and the hostess made me special tea sandwiches..and it was past tea time!  

Maybe it's just the warm friendly culture that made me feel so good staying here...
The young, congenial Staff...even the General Manager introduced himself and extended his hospitality.....

All I know is that next time in Dublin, I couldn't stay anywhere else.....

Experience Ireland with at least a night or two at the Shelbourne...You won't be disappointed.",5,2013,03,22
207,A Grand Hotel worth it's reputation,"If you've seen the pictures of the Shelbourne, you know what to expect when you walk in-- gilded, grandior.  The service matches the decor and is excellent.  Unlike most old hotels it usually ends when you leave the lobby but the Shelbourne rooms are very nice also.  Clean, large and updated.  The bar is always a bit crowded but the residents' bar opens now at 7 and only to residents and is a cozy pub off the main lobby.  Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and the rate we got was surprisingly affordable.  Also recently stayed at the Westbury and although there was a debate as to which was better (both being great), I would say, it depends on your taste.  The Shelbourne seems to be more posh and elegant (think marble and gold) where the Westbury seems to be a little more trendy and stylish (think more muted colors and rich fabrics).",5,2013,03,20
207,DeLuxe in Dublin,"2012-12-30

We arrive at noon to a sunny Dublin in Ireland (Éireann in Irish). where the friendly taxi driver Noel picked us up and gave us a mini tour on the way to the city centre with a quick history lesson to go with it. It is a small world, his old man and my granddad use to drink beer together at one of the local pubs in Manchester. 
After checking in to the historic 5-star Shelbourne Hotel at Stephens Green, built 1824, on Dublin´s most distinguished address, right in the heart of the city, this national flagship hotel offered a lovely 3 course lunch at the steak and fish restaurant, The Saddle Bar, one of the hotels various high standard bars and restaurants. The highlights of our both meals being the Chicken & Osyter Mushroom Terrine starter, the both mains; Rib-eye steak and the halibut not forgetting the mouthwatering dessert; the Chocolate Tart, with Raspberries and Pistachio Ice Cream, which should not be missed. 
After lunch we had a little stroll around the hotel giving us a nice warm christmassy feeling we had a glance at The Shelbourne Hotels own museum and outside the entrance to the museum is a huge hand made gingerbread train station, it was one of the biggest ones we have ever spotted our eyes on. In Sweden they stick to building pretty small houses not an entire train station and mini city.
Next stop was off to the Jameson Distillery for the museum tour and some very important whiskey tasting. We are now official whiskey tasters with a certificate to prove it. It was one of those visits that made you feel that you wanted to stay all day learning, tasting and finally rolling your way home if not on a barrel as one. 
Arriving back at the hotel waiting upon dinner, we learnt that the hotel was very much a very popular choice for all kind of guests, from well know writers to, JFK and his wis wife Jackie, Michael Collins, Eamon De Valera, Orsen Welles to moviestars such as Elizabeth Taylor and John Wayne. Now with some of the suites named after them. A beautiful piece of Dublin´s history!
A 7 course dinner at the popular L´Ecrivain followed with endless good wines at the well known Michelin star restaurant just down the road from the hotel hosted by Mr Leo Varadkar, the Minister of tourism, transport and sport. After a 3 hour dining sitting where we were very well taken care of we rounded it off with an evening stroll thru the eye-catching historic city. It has been a grand start to this bubbly warm old viking city, looking ahead to the big day, the big investment that started last year that became a success that now is the start of an annual celebration festival. The New Years Festival. That combined with Gathering Ireland 2013 establishment to bring back the 70 million Irish tribe of abroad and new visitors to this eye-catching green island! A impressive element by both Ireland as a country and the population of it bringing 2013 in to a one big festive year!

2013-01-01
The Shelbourne Hotel gives us a well needed New Years gift, a complimentary 2 hours extra sleep in before check-out. We jump into the our rental car and enjoy our way through the gorgeous landscape towards the city of Limerick near the west coast of Ireland",5,2013,03,20
207,Stylish St Patricks lunch!,"What a treat for us after a busy morning watching the parade on St Patricks Day stepping into the entrance of this Landmark Hotel. The formal diningroom was elegant but not too stuffy. The service was excellent,the staff friendly, extremely polite and professional!  Our lunch was delicious from our starter to the dessert. The attention to detail by the staff something you don't really come across everyday.Amazing Ice Sculptures depicting the Irish flag in the Oyster Bar!",5,2013,03,19
207,Past Present and Future in one place. Your future home from home in Dublin.,"Traveling from Dublin Airport by Air Coach drops you off at the side of the Shelbourne. 

Being greeted by the bellman as they take you around the side so you can avoid the revolving door with your luggage was a treat.

On either side of you are just some of your dining options for your stay, before you reach the lobby to check in. 

I would definitely ask for a room overlooking St. Stephens Green, if you are choosing a romantic getaway. 

The hotel itself is very centrally located with a short walk to St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street and Trinity College. 

Absolutely adored the Romantic Weekend Tea in the Lord Mayors Room. 

The Pianist was fantastic and should become a solid booking at the Shelbourne if he is not already. His playing was unobtrusive but at the same time captivating. Atmosphere is not only about location, but from all those that worked in the Lord Mayors Room that Sunday, it was an experience I will never forget and that was just the people.

The food itself was magnificent. I can honestly say I have never had such great tea as the Darjeeling at the Shelbourne. Their choice of sandwiches and desserts are what an afternoon tea is all about. An example that should be the course to follow for all of those that offer an afternoon tea experience. 

I would like to thank JD who helped me plan my trip, and I appreciate his patience working with me. I would also like to thank Paul the Concierge who took me on a tour of the Shelbourne and went through its history with me. 

Overall I cannot think of anywhere else I would rather stay in Dublin, it is truly a home away from home.",5,2013,03,19
207,Other hotels take note this is how to do it!!!!,"From our arrival to be greeted by the valet the tone was set for a truly memorable stay. Whoever is in charge of recruitment and training of the staff at the Shelbourne is worth their weight in stars. The Shelbourne truly is a 5 star hotel, however the staff account for at least 4 of these. The warmth and sincerity of the welcome and customer service is not only consistent throughout, it also seems to be utterly effortless!
We arrived expecting to be told our room would not be ready (as our check in time was not for a couple of hours). How wrong we were. We were greeted by Grace who was welcoming, engaging but not over the top as is often the case in some less salubrious, more pretentious hotels. This girl is a natural at her job and an absolute asset to the hotel. Not only was our room ready we were given a free upgrade. 
After settling in we went down to No. 27 Bar where there was brunch and jazz. Whilst we didn't avail of brunch we certainly enjoyed the music, again the atmosphere was more than matched by the helpful and friendly staff. 
Our room was spacious, spotless and beautifully decorated. Breakfast the next morning was a real treat; fresh, tasty and plentiful!
I could wax lyrical about the standard of decor, cleanliness, location etc. etc. but these are obvious and beyond question. 
I could go on and on but I think it's clear the Shelbourne is in a league of its own but everything it boasts in amenities, location etc, are built firmly on foundations of an amazing, energetic and truly natural staff team. Thank you for a really memorable stay. Going to book our next stay as soon as possible!",5,2013,03,19
207,Excellent Hotel,"An excellent hotel for both business and pleasure. I was in Dublin for business and the hotel was perfect in every way. Good business Center, excellent service from most of the staff, fabulous afternoon tea. The restaurant and lounge was very busy with both hotel guests and external guests which contributed to the nice atmosphere. I was able to check-in at 093.0 am and also got an upgrade to a giant deluxe room, which of course contributed to the nice experience. The location is perfect in the nicer (safer) part of town close to the shopping streets. I would definitely stay here again if I were to visit Dublin.",5,2013,03,18
207,wonderful time,"Stayed here for five nights in December. A wonderful stay---Excellent Staff,Hotel, and Location. It certainly was a fine way to enjoy Pre- Christmas festivities. So much Holiday energy at this Hotel and a lovely  holiday display in their lobby.The concierge was so helpful with our day trip itineraries as were the Staff with our other concerns. The two lobby lounges were bristling with people enjoying the Holiday Spirits,both liquid and ethereal.Afternoon Tea, arranged by the Missus, also was a most pleasant experience. The room was wonderful and no complaints with it or  other Hotel facilities. Enjoyed the location and  across from the HOTEL is the   beautiful St Stephan's Park---so enjoyable to stroll through.Grafton Street is only several blocks away and is so full of life as well as stores of all varieties. An easy walk to the Theatres( Gate and Abbey),Temple Bar area, and O'Connell Street. Had delicious Fish and Chips at a restaurant located in the Gresham Hotel as well as terrific Irish Stew at the Hairy Lemon Pub.Plenty of Restaurants near the Hotel and the nearby Cliff Townhouse Restaurant has excellent service, decor as well as fine Steak. A fine wine store is  nearby on Dawson Street .Also the Airport Bus is convenient and inexpensive --- drop- off at Kildare Street and pick-up at Dawson street both within a block or two of the Shelbourne.

Will certainly stay at  the Shelbourne Hotel when in Dublin!",5,2013,03,18
207,St. Patty's Day in Dublin,"We are loving the Shelbourne! Every single person working here has made us feel welcome and appreciated. Room service has been top notch. The rooms are nice, and clean. There's a towel warmer which is the best thing ever! Bed we have is quite soft, good for me, bad for hubby. Breakfast in the Saddleroom is nice, not a huge buffet, but there's oatmeal, fresh fruit, biscuits, yogurt, cereal, cold cut meats with cheeses, scrambled eggs, black & white pudding (not sure what that is, but its good,reminded me of meatloaf?) ham & bacon. Sorry, not sure the price. 
If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend staying here.  The hotel is in a great location; within walking distance to many popular places, pubs and museums.",5,2013,03,17
207,Underwhelmed,"The Shelbourne is a great place to grab a drink but the accommodations were not five star.  Small rooms and even smaller bathrooms.  I had a window view of a courtyard, so no view at all.  The Staff were very friendly and helpful but that's to be expected.  For the price, I would stay at the Westin but it does not have the same air of history or 'poshness"" that the Shelbourne puts out.",3,2013,03,17
207,Very Disappopinting Afternoon Tea,"At €30.00 a head the Afternoon Tea falls way short of what your would expect from a 5 star hotel. We have treated ourselves to Afternoon Tea at the Shelbourne for the last 20 years and have always had a fantastic experience however this year it was more of a nightmare. The sandwiches were boring - a tiny square of guinness bread with a tiny bit of smoked salmon, roast beef and horseradish and finally a small brioche which was dry and crumbly (stale?) with cheese and tomato relish. The scones were dry and too big, the only saving grace was the cakes. The waitress struggled to get our tea order right and in the end we gave up. If the Shelbourne is going to charge €30.00 for Afternoon Tea then they need to urgently improve the quality of what they serve",3,2013,03,17
207,Amazing Place..,"We stayed at the Shelbourne the first two nights in Ireland, and it was quite a treat.  The history the hotel has, the luzury it offers, and the location all add up to a great choice.  The staff was very friendly and helpful also.  The concierge was very helpful in getting us tour passes, and telling us where the best fish & chips could be found.  We loved the time spent there, and thank you...",5,2013,03,16
207,Short Break.,"My husband and I stayed in the Shelbourne for two nights,as we were attending the theatre.Check in was very quick,all staff are extremely friendly and helpful.Anything we requested we got within minutes.The restuarant is delightful,tastefully decorated with a very relaxed atmosphere and the food is superb.The bedrooms are well equipped and very comfortable.The only thing I would make potiential guests aware of is,the hotel does not have a carpark,therefore it costs 25 Euro per night to have your car secured in a valet park.The hotel do provide staff to drive your car there and have it taken back for you,but it could turn out quite costly if you were staying any length of time.Apart from that,I would highly recommend this hotel.And we both shall return in the future.",5,2013,03,16
207,Outstanding,"I stayed in the Shelbourne last night 14 March for 1 night with my mother for her 85th birthday.  I told them it was her birthday and we got an upgrade to a heritage de luxe room which was about 500 sq. ft.  It was furnished to a very high standard and there were 2, 4 ft bes which is an un usual size for a bed these days.  The bathroom was furnished to a very high standard  with seperate shower, bath and a toilet with  a door for privacy within the bathroom.  From the moment we arrived the doormen, reception staff, conccierges could not have been more friendly or helpful.  They would not let us carry our bags.  They kept on asking us and my mam particularly were we having a great time for her birthday.  The dinner in the restaurant was great and there service excellent.  The wine waitress knew all about her wines and got us to taste some wines before we made our choice.  I had the French onion soup and the sirlloin steak from the table d'hote menu.  The soup is the best French onion soup I have ever tasted. The steak was so tender.  The beds are very very comfortable and the duvets are heaven.  They must be duck down.  The biggest surprise of all was the spa.  It is brand new and furnished to the highest standard.  We each had an hour massage.  The relaxation room looks onto stephens Green which is amazing.  The towels, bathrobes and slippers are to a very high standard.  The steam room was lovely and hot, as was the sauna.  The pool was lovely also. This was the best hotel stay I ever had.  I cannot wait to go back to the shelbourne again. One down side is the bars are sometimes so busy that there are no tables available for residents to have a re dinner drink or aafter dinner drink.",5,2013,03,15
207,"Luxury, History and Friendly","We stayed at The Shelbourne on the 3rd & 7th March. Our welcome was fantastic from the moment we arrived. Saema on the front desk was very helpful. She assisted my husband with our Afternoon Tea reservation and gave us a tour of the Constitution Suite and the musuem. We had Afternoon Tea, my very first, and it was such an experience from being in The Lord Mayor's Lounge to the gorgeous food. After indulging in the tea, we strolled the short distance to Grafton Street, the main shopping area, and then around the surrounding area. The room was perfect and well decorated.

Our second night was even more exceptional and the hotel made us feel very special by putting us in the original part of the hotel where we could see St Stephen's Green. The room was gorgeous and huge! The bathroom was amazing with a lovely deep tub perfect for soaking and powerful shower. We spent our second evening in The Lord Mayor's Lounge as we became too comfortable to leave! We also spent some time in The Horseshoe Bar and soaked up some of the history there. 

The hotel is very beautiful and overflowing with history. The bed was so comfortable that I did not want to leave it in the morning! I think this hotel is the whole package and I certainly intend to stay there next time we are in Dublin in a few months time! A completely amazing experience all round. A massive thanks to The Shelbourne staff who made us feel welcome and special.",5,2013,03,15
207,Most helpful staff!,"I know I will sound like I'm gushing, but we can't say enough good things about the staff at the Shelbourne. they are well-trained, efficient, warm and completely helpful at every step. Just made our third visit and we felt like we were back with old friends. Concierge Denis and Jane on the front desk took extra good care of us. This is definitely our home in Dublin.",5,2013,03,15
207,exceptional service and attention to detail,"Check in was an absolute delight which is a rare experience these days. Check in staff were friendly, helpful and informative and just wanted to please.  

That intro really set the tone for my stay. A lasting memory is spending a few minutes in the museum reading the correspondence regarding damage caused by the South African Rugby tourists in 1952.",5,2013,03,15
207,You should stay in THe shelbourne,"Although a Dubliner I had never stayed in the Shelbourne Hotel. No reason, always assumed it was too expensive but I was pleasantly surprised considering the outrageous prices I have paid in other city centre hotels. Valet parking is handy. The rooms maintain an historice feel but also very luxurious. Great atmosphere and the food at the dinner was excellent and what a breakfast you are set for the day. Next time in Dublin you have to stay",4,2013,03,15
207,"Nice, central and old hotel","Stayed here for 1 night on business. It's centrally located - close to a park and the town, plus many attractions. 

The room - nice size, good 4 or 5 star amenities such as robe, slippers etc. TV had lots of channels and bed was comfortable, plus a safe and plenty of electric points. 

Staff - always helpful and good service

Reception/common areas - a big bonus here, as it was lovely and a great place to meet people.

Bars and restaurants - really nice too. 6 of us ate here on a set menu for lunch, was very nice and reasonable, for Dublin. 

Overall would stay again. They also organised some early morning coffee (4.30am) which was good.",4,2013,03,15
207,Jazz Brunch Mother's Day,"My Mother's Day couldn't have been nicer.  I was treated to Brunch at the beautiful Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin.  The food was exquisite, and the jazz music was fantastic.  We had planned to have a quick bite then do a little sight-seeing, but ended up staying for the entire 3 hour brunch, as we couldn't tear ourselves away from the music.  The singer's voice is lovely, and he was very accomodating with all of our requests.  Quite a charmer, and a wonderful day overall.",5,2013,03,11
207,Simply spectacular!,"My company booked my 3-night stay in a single room but upon arrival I decided to splurge a little and buy an upgrade to what I believe they call a junior suite.  Wow!  There is so much to say about this hotel, and it is all 100% positive.  The hotel is a class act all around.  The staff is superb, the rooms are beautiful, the beds are divine, the bathrooms luxurious, the food fabulous, and the overall experience could not have been better. I loved the traditional and tasteful room decor, and appreciated the nice, big TVs. As for anything and a staff-member will be at your door right away with a smile.  The bathroom was incredible, it had wide marble countertops and granite floors, deep tub for luxurious soaking, a nice separate shower, and wonderful bathroom amenities.  Loads of thick towels and, of course, a thick robe. Of course, the history of the hotel is wonderful, and the staff is justly proud of it.  They all seem to know the stories behind the history, too, which is such a nice touch.  Ireland is one of my favorite places on earth, and to be able to stay at the best of the best was such a treat.  There are a couple of down sides, but they are to be expected, and are the things that the hotel has little control over.  The location is fabulous, facing out onto St. Stephen's Green, but being in the center of all the action brings noise with it.  The windows have all been outfitted with nice, double-glazed interior windows while still preserving the original outer windows, so this offers a little extra noise reduction.  I do like the fact you can open the windows for fresh air, so, if you are like me, you will happily put up with a little street noise to get the cool air.  There are courtyard-facing rooms; several of my colleagues had those, and reported that they are blissfully quiet.  The other thing is that parking is quite limited and is by valet only.  Yes, it's expensive, but, hey, it's a European capital city, so expensive parking should be no surprise.  (Tip; if you valet park, you should call early for your car, as weekends and evenings - especially if there are events at the hotel - can be very busy for the staff, and the wait for the car can exceed half an hour.  But the wait can be half the fun, as the doormen are so accommodating, entertaining, and helpful!)  Beware:  they say that the traffic flow around the hotel is going to be changed, and that the parking situation could get worse, so be sure to ask about it before you go.  Of course, you won't need your car if you plan to stay in the city...the hotel could not be better situated, and attractions, shopping, restaurants, and historical sights are all within walking distance.  The city's wonderful tram system is centered just a couple of blocks from the hotel's front door, and catching a cab is a snap, so getting around is just not a problem.  The only other negative I can think of is that you should expect to get lost in the corridors.  The hotel is an absolute maze of hallways!  Although there are several elevators, some rooms require navigating a short set of stairs, so mobility-impaired guests should be very clear that they need a room with level access.",5,2013,03,05
207,"Great location, great service","My family were all staying in the shelbourne at New Year and what a great place to spend Hogmanay. It's hard to fault the shelbourne, the staff, service and experience was all very good. It has a very rustic look from the outside but don't be fooled, the minute you step foot on the red carpet and walk through the doors the staff will see to your every need. The hotel is spotless and I suppose the only bit of criticism I have was the room was pretty small and had no view. We were just looking at another wall. However I'm sure if your room is front facing the view from the room would be fantastic. It's had to get value for money however that's Dublin for you, more expensive than Paris and London. Overall if visiting Dublin stay at the shelbourne, it ticks all the boxes and you won't be disappointed.",4,2013,03,04
207,Part of History,"Probably one of the oldest hotels in the town and still maintains its historic charm; Aptly displaying its history through a small museum in the lobby and showcasing the list of celebrity guests it has hosted. 

The hotel is just a 10 mins walk from the main temple bar area and is right opposite to a huge and beautiful botanical garden. The service and staff are really good and lives upto the hotel standards. Rooms are a bit small but nicely done. The breakfast spread is average and pretty much same everyday. Free wifi is available only at the entrance lobby and signal strength is really low. Over all a good place to stay ! 

Travel tips: Beautiful city and fantastic people! Unpack and hit the temple bar area…weekend starts from Wednesday ☺",3,2013,03,02
207,Wonderful stay,"We enjoyed a wonderful one-week stay at this hotel and the peace and tranquility of this place!  The location of the hotel was great for access to nearly all of Dublin's great places to visit, many are actually walking distance.  The staff is exteremly pleasant and helpful. no matter the task.  They helped us on every facet of our trip as we asked for help.  This hotel, staff and trip was worth our time and hope to visit again.",5,2013,03,01
207,Afternoon tea at the Shelbourne. A delight!,"We experienced wonderful service at The Shelbourne hotel last weekend. Myself, my brother and my mother went for afternoon tea. I had phoned earlier that week to say I was intolerant to milk and eggs. We arrived and I had sandwiches followed by fruit. My mother and brother also had lovely scones and pastries. We were all happy with our food.When we got the bill we noticed we had only been charged for two. We drew attention to the mistake and were told that they felt they had been unprepared for my food intolerances and thus had decided to only charge for two afternoon teas.
With service that attentive we will surely be back.",5,2013,02,28
207,"Perfect Location, Old World Charm.","Spent one night here before moving to another hotel for a conference.   The Shelbourne is a wonderful and centrally located hotel.

The whole atmosphere surrounding the hotel is classic, professional and elegant.

The Shelbourne met and exceeded every expectation we have for a luxury hotel. From the moment we arrived curbside the service, attention to detail, and staff attentiveness never faltered. From the offer of lemonade and a brownie at check in, to our wonderful bathroom complete with bath salts and luxury robe, every portion of our stay was excellent. 

Room service, housekeeping, bellman, and check-in staff were all pleasant, professional, and discreet. Room service from the Saddle Bar was fantastic and they accomodated things that were not on their menu easily and cheerfully. No doubt, we will stay at the Shelbourne again and again. Although it may be on the pricey side for some, we believe it's worth every penny.",4,2013,02,27
207,treat,for a special time in a special city this is the place for you. Expensive yes but everobe who is anybody stays there except Bono who has his own hotel in town. The location is near everything shopping Temple Bar etc,5,2013,02,27
207,Christmas Eve's Delight!!,The Shelbourne Hotel lives up to it's reputation as the place to be on Christmas Eve.  The champers was flowing and the spirits (non alchoholic) were high.  Dining in the Saddle Rooom was so special.  A meal fit for a king.  The staff were so pleasant and festive.  The banter was mighty.  Finishing up in the bar with a hot port was magic.  We took a stroll down along Stephens Green and Grafton Street was the finishing touch.  What a memory.  I was happy to go home and prepare for Santa coming.,5,2013,02,26
207,A Unique and Beautiful hotel.,"We (wife and I) had the pleasure to stay here for a night in December. 
My wife surprised me with afternoon tea, a beautifully elegant experience. And then to top this she informed me that we were also staying the night. 
The whole atmosphere surrounding the hotel is classic, professional and elegant. The cast of Downton Abbey wouldn't be out of place here wondering the beautifully decorated hallways. 
This hotel is steeped in history and has been beautiful restored to its former glory. The rooms are luxurious and in keeping with the feel and tone of the hotel. 
I liked the book with the history of the hotel in the room it really was a nice touch. 
I would defiantly recommend a stay. If not a stay over just experience the Afternoon Tea service. ",4,2013,02,26
207,Elegance almost,"The rooms are lovely. The people who attend them are perfection. The only issue I have is that lovely and perfection mean over-crowding in the restaurant. One is knocked off into another room to dine. Great location. Yes, I would go back and stay there and recommend the hotel to my friends. We all live with a tad of disappointment in this life.",4,2013,02,25
207,Excellent if you get a decent sized room,"Well placed Dublin Hotel within easy walking distance of everything.

This olde worlde Dublin Hotel is a real treat and a unique hotel experience.
Staff and service are very old school and excellent and the museum touting the history and past of this famous old girl a nice touch.

I have stayed here 3 or 4 times over the last year and if you get a deluxe or large room it really can't be beaten.

I've also been allocated a corporate room which is no more than a shoebox sized enclosure and suitable for only sleeping. 

Linen, beds and service excellent. Also a good breakfast.",4,2013,02,25
207,A true Dublin experience,"Staying here to take in the part it played in Irish Independence is reason enough.
But, that is just the start.  We have stayed at the Shelbourne twice before in 2010.  The staff was outstanding.  After I twisted my ankle on a tour of the city, we asked about going to a hospital.  The staff offered to call their medical service to have an on-call doctor to come to our hotel room.  (Much better than spending 6 hours in a emergency room while you are on vacation.)      
And the rooms!  Both times we stayed Heritage rooms.  They were spacious, elegant and well-appointed.  The bathrooms have both a bathtub and a shower.  
The location is also perfect.  It is right on St Stephen's Green and a couple of blocks away from Grafton Street.",5,2013,02,24
207,Feels like home,"Great old hotel, with reasonable updates.  Love the breakfast, and the new fitness center has everything I need.  Great location, walking distance to alot of very good restaruants.  The staff is very helpful....",5,2013,02,23
207,lovely hotel,"i stay in dublin a lot and this was my first time to stay in the shelbourne but wont be my last. the room was very comfortable and clean, breakfast was good and staff were very friendly and professional. the bar was buzzing and had a very relaxed atmosphere.
5 star all the way",5,2013,02,23
207,The Night I proposed to my Wife,"The ring was in my pocket. I carried it on the airplane from NYC. We arrived at the beautiful and historic Shelbourne. As is the case with all Marriot/Renaissance hotels there are so many room choice and options when booking online. I didn't choose the cheapest room because I was planning on proposing, but I just couldn't afford a suite. Call it luck or fate, but the hotel upgraded us for free to the Michael Collins Suite (there was no mention of a proposal or anything of the sorts). White marble bathroom, sitting room with fireplace, beautiful bedroom with all antique furnishings, crystal chandeliers hang from the tall ceilings overlooking a balcony view of Stephens Green. We walked through the park and I got on one knee. The rest of the evening was spectacular (she said yes). Drinking champagne in the gorgeous ballroom downstairs and having breakfast the next morning in our sitting room was like being royalty. It's a trip and hotel experience I'll never forget. I was so nervous when we arrived that I put our passports in a bedside drawer and remembered nearly a week later when planning our journey back to the airport. The Shelbourne staff found them, stored the passports in a safe and couriered them to us that evening. Could have been a nightmare story had the staff and the hotel been less honest... But not at the Shelbourne.",5,2013,02,22
207,Everything was perfect,"Stayed a few times over the years and last month again.  The room was nice and the bed was majorly comfortable.  Room service was prompt and delicious.  The bars are old world and full of history.   Afternoon tea is magnificent.  Walking distance to so many areas of the city, makes it super convenient. 

Only thing...the rooms are expensive for Dublin.  If you can't stay overnight, just going for the afternoon tea or a drink will make your day.",4,2013,02,21
207,Excellent Evening Meal at the Shelbourne,"Went to the Shelbourne on Monday evening for our meal with some friends,  The food and service was first class, could not complain about anything, and we had a lovely table also very private and we where not rushed to vacate it, will be back,  give it a try.would book a table to avoid disappointment",5,2013,02,20
207,Exquisite,"5 star. it does what it says on the tin! Excellent accomodation and service.
Very efficient staff and very helpful. The bars are beautiful and bright and very eclectic surroundings with lots of interesting people. You will also bump into the odd celeb if that's your thing.",5,2013,02,17
207,Seriously needs to be re- rated and downgraded.,"Stayed on 14th February as a Valentine Treat.  As Dublin is my ""hometown""  a stay at the Shelbourne was something I have looked forward to for quite some time and it was in my Bucket List of things to do!

I had booked a Queen Room and understood it was one of the smaller rooms etc and this was not an issue.  I was quite taken aback when I saw the allocated room. It was facing a brick wall with no view whatsoever , and had endless water/heat marks on the bedside lockers. Certainly, not what I was expecting in a 5 * establishment! I returned to reception and was dealt with very professionally and was allocated a different room which was nothing special in comparison to other 5* establishments in which I have stayed.

On check in I had requested an ice bucket and 40 mins later when it had not arrived I rang and requested it again!!

All staff I came into contact with at reception/in the Restaurant/ and in the bar were all very friendly, polite and professional.

We went to the Theatre in the evening and on our return to the Hotel went into the bar to order a night cap, we were advised that the bar was closed and if we wanted a drink we ""had"" to go to the Residents bar .  The Residents bar is a sort of ""open"" drab area with no atmosphere/personality.  The arm of my partners chair was loose and appeared ready to fall off -a health and safety risk and once again not what I was expecting from a 5* Hotel.

After our drink we retired to our room --again disappointment, no turn down service, no chocolate on the Pillow , no drapes drawn,  the first 5* I have stayed in where this service was not offered
 
Our breakfast was very good with lots of choice. When we were shown to our table ( which had been set for breakfast)  the table cloth was badly stained and I had to request it was changed.  I noticed a free window table which I requested and which we were allocated.  The carpet leading into the Restaurant is very tired and worn and in my opinion needs replacement.  Whilst waiting at the serving area for the cooked part of my breakfast I noticed one of the Breakfast supervisor's/manager putting bread into the toasting machine in the kitchen, this was being done with bare hands, I would have thought that gloves should have been used!

We took advantage of the very nice Leisure facilities which I believe is a recent  addition to the hotel, all very nice , however, the water in the pool could have been warmer.

Having now stayed and experienced what is on offer I am no longer in ""awe"" and certainly will not be repeating the experience.",3,2013,02,15
207,Very Elegent,"My husband and I stayed here for a week using points.  It was a very beautiful hotel with excellent service.  We did have a bit of a problem when we first arrived getting a room, but it was due to us checking in early.  They offered us one room that was ready, but the A/C was broken.  We opted to wait.  The manager was super nice and even offered us a drink to make up for it, which we turned down.  The concierge staff was excellent as well.  They booked all of our excursions for us, and took care of everything when we had to rearrange the schedule.  One of the staff even stopped us on the street as he was leaving work to let us know one of our tours had been cancelled.  The room was very comfortable and I loved the huge bathroom.  We paid extra for a room with a view of St. Stephens Green, which was nice, but if we return I wouldn't not pay the additional price for it.  Only possible downsides were the hallways were a little confusing to navigate at first and for some it might be too elegant.  I didn't have a problem with either, but my husband felt a little out of place.",5,2013,02,15
207,Excellent for business,"Very welcoming, accommodating, organised. Fantastic breakfasts and ideal facilities for business meetings. Excellent location. All rooms with ironing facilities, umbrellas. Feel really comfortable, a home away from home.",5,2013,02,15
207,elegant hotel with staff to match,"We stayed Monday and Tuesday night this week, my husband got a great midweek rate, I have always wanted to stay in the shelbourne and this was a birthday treat for me.

I know that five star hotels should have excellent customer service but I have stayed in some five stars that couldn't match the shelboune, each and every staff member that we met over the two days made eye contact and were genuinely friendly.

We had drinks the first night in the large bar, no. 27 and the horseshoe bar the second night, you can feel the history all around you, the First irish constitution was signed here but we couldn't see the relevant room as it was occupied. 

We had afternoon tea in the lord mayor,s lounge and it was superb, it wouldn't be my husband's idea of an afternoon but he really enjoyed it, we spent two hours relaxing, reading papers and eating great food.

Breakfast on both days was great, the restaurant is truly beautiful.

From the doormen to the cleaners to the waiters everyone was wonderful, we are hoping to stay here twice a year as a treat and while it is a little pricey you get what you pay for. I'm in business myself so I understand how important customers are, well done everyone you could show many a hotel nationaly and internationaly a thing or two.....",5,2013,02,13
207,Amazing - Thank you Shelbourne!,"I booked my parents into the Shelbourne for a special milestone anniversary. I was so pleased with the lovely reception they received as guests. A very kind and nice Croatian lady at the front desk upgraded them to a suite because of the special occasion. Their upgrade was a wonderful large suite with views of St.Stephens Green, it had an entrance hall, living room, bedroom and bathroom, all of which were large and luxurious. With the turn-down service they received wine and chocolates along with rose petals on the bed. They really enjoyed the breakfast in the saddle room the next morning, as well as their evening drinks in the Horseshoe Bar. My parents told me how all the staff were so welcoming and polite. I'm thrilled that all the staff made such a fuss of them and made them feel so special. My family and I will always make a point of visiting and bringing any business to this great hotel. Many thanks Shelbourne, from a very grateful daughter!",5,2013,02,13
207,Worth a drink in the bar,"Didnt stay, was up the road, but had a few drinks in the bar. The setting is classic and the hotel has a fascinating history hence our visit. The bar was full and the table service was annoyingly slow, but still had a good time.",4,2013,02,12
207,Lovely hotel in central Dublin,"Stayed here for one night in February, on a business trip to Dublin. Eating in a private dining area in the restaurant the service was excellent and the food was high quality. The room was well appointed and comfortable. Speedy check in/out too. A good choice for a good value but upper end hotel in Dublin.",5,2013,02,10
207,Fantastic!,"I've stayed at many Marriott's over the years, and this one rates in the top 5. Great rooms, great location, friendly staff, new health club, it has it all. The location is central, so you can walk to many restaurants and pubs once you get there. Me and my colleague were lucky enough to time this out with the managers greeting that they do once a month for frequent guests and platinum members, and it just added icing on the cake. The only problem I have with staying here is that I know the next night out is going to be an unbelievable downgrade, when I move to another town.",5,2013,02,10
207,Ladies who lunch!,"On a beautiful February Saturday afternoon a party of 8 ladies sampled the treat that is Afternoon Tea in The Shelbourne. First you select your preference of teas, lots to choose from, then the sandwiches arrive, which on first glance looked disappointing but are more than enough, egg, ham, cheese, smoked salmon...no cucumber?? More tea followed, lots of pinkies waving in the air, the tinkling of the piano in the corner, people spotting..Gabriel Byrne, Declan Kidney, the Irish Rugby Squad...very thrilling for our assembled group. Cakes then arrived beautifully displayed, warm scones with clotted cream and jam,chocolate cups, plus two others ..sinful and delicious. We left full and charmed. Great service and an experience that delivered what it promised.",5,2013,02,10
207,"""Historical Beauty""",My husband and I had the opportunity of a lifetime last September traveling to Ireland.  Our experience with The Shelbourne Hotel was wonderful!! The hotel is beautiful the staff were warm and welcoming.  We enjoyed the resturant and bars atmosphere.  I would give anything if I could remember the coffee's that were provided in the rooms they were excellent! We traveled to the Cliffs of Moher this was the highlight of our trip this is a breath taking scene!!,5,2013,02,07
207,Foreign object in scone and terrible customer service,"I don’t generally agree with posting complaints on this site however I have given the Shelbourne Hotel ample opportunity to deal with my complaint and time and time again they have shown poor service.

I visited the Shelbourne Hotel on 13/10/2012 for Afternoon Tea with three friends. The experience itself was okay but the level of service afterwards from a so called 5 star hotel was appalling.

I received a “goody bag” of the afternoon tea selection that I could not finish. When I got home my boyfriend tucked into a scone only to find a piece of wood in it (about 1.5 x 0.5).

I immediately called the hotel to notify them in case there was more elsewhere in the batch.  I missed a call back a couple of days later but I returned the call and left a message. I heard nothing from them until I phoned the reception this time and was given an email address to which I sent an email outlining what had happened. Once again I heard nothing.

It was only when I emailed a second time saying how disappointed I was at the level of customer service, that I managed to speak to the Director of Food and Beverage on the phone. He started the conversation apologising for the delay in getting back to me-for which as in his own words he had no excuse for. Then further into the conversation he implied that they in fact had tried numerous times to contact me (I had no missed calls or voicemails that I hadn’t responded to).
In the end I offered to bring in the “foreign object”, which I did.  

On 15/11/2012 I received an email saying that they had received the “foreign object” and would “be in touch again shortly”. Once again I have heard nothing since.

Is this really the level of 1) food and 2) customer service from a 5 star established hotel?",1,2013,02,07
207,A wonderful experience,"A stay in this hotel is a truly worthwhile experience.  The location is unbeatable, with beautiful rooms and a swimming pool.  However what you are really paying for is the experience of such a beautiful hotel full of amazing history and elegance, and of course the best breakfast you are ever going to eat!!!!  The reason I only gave it 4 out of 5 is because the hotel was always so busy that we could not get a table to eat dinner there or even have a nice drink at the bar!!",4,2013,02,07
207,Charming Quality,"We stayed for two nights at the Shelbourne hotel and had a truly wonderful time, beautiful hotel, and lovely staff, with first class attention to detail. Its location is very central, walking distance to Trinity College and all the main attractions in the city. It is an historic hotel with all the modern connivances needed when traveling for business or pleasure. The Horseshoe bar is a must for a pre-dinner cocktail. This is the hotel we will stay in from now on for all our visits to Dublin.",5,2013,02,05
207,"Need to sort out housekeeping, management and service urgently","The positive first: having lived the first 25 years of my life in Dublin I always looked on ""The Shelbourne"" as somewhere special. Since the renovation a few years ago The Shelbourne has indeed returned to its rightful spot: an Irish institution, Dublin's front parlour.

The problem is they seem to be losing their grip on running it. I have stayed here on 3 visits over the past 3 years and things seem to be getting worse. This time I stayed for 10 days before Christmas in a heritage room with a lovely view over Stephens Green - something I had always wanted to do. I am not sure I will be staying in the Shelbourne again.

Housekeeping: I loved sitting at the window of my room looking at the sun set over a wintry Stephens Green. I didn't love it so much when I returned to my room at 4pm (happened twice) only to find my room had not been serviced yet. Forewarned we tried to liaise with housekeeping on other days to make sure this did not recur - housekeeping were not too happy with this.
Turn down service was hilarious. Once or twice is was comprehensive. The rest of the time it seemed up to the maid to decide what to do. One night we were sure no one had been in only to find the telltale chocolate by the pillow! Turn down = leave chocolate?? In a 5 start hotel?

Service: We booked Christmas afternoon tea one tea. In theory this should be the easiest meal on earth to serve. Everyone arrives at the same time, they all eat the same things. Yet the service was chaotic and some of the sandwiches were dry from being left out.

Management: We are early risers so had no problems with breakfast in the Saddle Room. After breakfast we could entertain ourselves watching the chaos building as the capacity of the Saddle Room was overwhelmed. This was chaos on a biblical scale - I dont think I have ever seen more dissatisfied residents at one time. There are ways round this: offer breakfast in the room without adding room service charge - maybe incentivise this with sparkling wine. Youre the managers, you come up with ideas.

There were other oddities. I really took exception to being rudely grilled by some yobbish doorman on returning to the hotel late one Friday night. They are forgetting that residents are the life blood of a hotels survival.

And there seemed to be an odd dishevelled type who occupied a table in the Lord Mayors room every single morning, weekdays and weekends. He wasnt a resident yet the management seemed happy to make residents loiter in the cold hall waiting for breakfast while this guy held court inside. Am I hallucinating or was this guy around on previous visits too? Come on management, sort this out!",3,2013,02,04
207,drink in the bar,We didn't stay here but next we come to Dublin we will! It is in a great part of the City. We spent a lovely evening sampling the cocktails in the bar. Beautiful decor great service and fabulous cocktails. I would recommend that you come if only for a drink!,5,2013,02,03
207,Good but not as good as they think they are,"All the reviews on this site are pretty reasonable.   If you are easily enamoured by the architecture and history of the hotel, you will really enjoy the buzz.      I have easily over 50 nights in this hotel over the past few years on business travel but I shifted to the Westbury and other hotels once they closed their Marriott Platinum lounge (the Heritage lounge).    Don't show up as a Marriott Platinum and expect the USA treatment or a business lounge.

A pretty hotel with many good features but when they closed the business lounge and jacked up the prices, it just turned me off....     Yet, for a few days on vacation, it is a decent place if you can get over the price tag.",3,2013,02,03
207,Great location but ...,"I stayed in this hotel for one night when hosting a table in the Saddle Room restaurant.  The rooms in this hotel are far from 5 star and the building will simply never allow the proper standard to be achieved.  This hotel is in a fantastic location and the atmosphere in the bar etc fantastic.   However the service is over fussy and not genuine and it is not a hotel I would like to stay for an extended stay.  The air conditioning is retro fitted and right beside the bed.  On and you have it in your face - off and you wake in a ball of sweat.  I was awoken in the middle of the night by an argument going on outside my door between a staff member and a guest - the guest was asking for the police to be called.

When I checked out to pay the very high cost I was not asked if my stay was ok.  At the same cost the Merrion is a much better bet.",3,2013,02,03
207,always a class act,"My family and I have stayed here on numerous occasions over the past few years. The standard of service and courtesy shown by staff is second to none. It has charm in buckets and never disappoints.
From the moment you are met at the front door to the moment you leave you are treated to the most exceptional personal service",5,2013,02,02
207,"Top to bottom, check-in to check-out...outstanding!","This was my fourth stay at this hotel, and I have NEVER been disappointed: great service, great location, great 'everything'!  

All of the people who work here are incredibly friendly, professional and customer-oriented, but Merta is the best of the best!

I very much look forward to seeing you all in September, if not sooner.

207,Only the price is 5*,"Call me traditional but when somewhere claims to be 5* it should be trying to do so at every juncture, and sadly the Shelbourne does not.

Yes it is very elegant, but €188 for a small room with a sliding-door bathroom? (because the room can't fit a hinged one) When you're paying top dollar for a hotel then it's simply not good enough. When you're charging €32.50 for breakfast by golly it should be amazing but I'm afraid it wasn't. Try going to Le Manoir (which has 2 Michelin stars) and their £25 breakfast will leave you feeling on top of the world. 

Service was good. The problem is that it doesn't matter if you're 5* or 1* customers need to feel value for money and frankly the Shelbourne doesn't deliver. If bed and breakfast was €100 then perhaps you'd think ""fair enough"" but at nearly double that, it's out of its league.  ",3,2013,02,01
207,Fantastic place,"Firstly the location is great, but the hotel just gets better once you step through the door. The warm greeting & attentive service makes this place feel very special. The bar although pricey is fabulous, the atmosphere & buzz have to be experienced! Had a lovely weekend despite the weather. Didn't eat at the hotel on an evening as I knew about Peploes a few doors down which as always was fabulous. Also dined at Marco's just round the corner which was also v good. Breakfast at the Shelbourne was excellent followed by a lovely walk round st Stephens green opposite. ",5,2013,01,31
207,Comfortable Classic Hotel let down by Variable Service,"Just spent a Saturday night here with friends. It's a lovely, albeit pricey, hotel that gives a great first impression: the welcoming doorman and attractive classic lobby, bar and lounge areas. 
Our view was further enhanced when we received a room upgrade on check-in from a very friendly front desk team; we dared to think we were getting a room with a view over St Stephens Green but had to settle for one over an internal roof. However the Heritage Room was very comfortable; spacious, comfy firm bed, large bathroom with both bath and separate shower and lots of power sockets for all the various chargers that seem to accompany our trips these days.
The hotel is in a good central location, close (5 mins walk) to the Grafton Street shops and to the sights of the museums, Trinity College and Temple Bar as well as numerous restaurants.
My wife thought the spa very good and its staff excellent with the gym/pool area also a strong point.
However, although the service from the front desk, spa and the doormen was excellent (especially escorting us to taxis in a down-pour and gale), the service in the bar and at breakfast was well below what you would expect from this type of hotel:
In the bar, the waiter managed to spill some of our €115 bottle of Veuve when he was both opening it and then pouring it, without apologising or cleaning up the latter and then getting his or anyone else's attention to pay was difficult.
At breakfast, they were very slow in taking our tea/coffee order and then one girl was rude to my wife when we asked her to remove my original coffee cup (see below). When my wife pointed this out, she then laughed before giving a very brief apology. Although it is probably their busiest service of the week and they were rushed, her attitude and reaction were disappointingly poor.
The breakfast buffet was also disappointing; the cold spread was minimal: no yoghurt, minimal fruit choices, no water, only two choices of ham and no smoked salmon (how can one of the supposed best hotels in Dublin not serve smoked salmon, one of Ireland's most renowned home-grown products?). The hot selection was better although food temperature was variable. The coffee served was undrinkable (no taste of coffee) so I had to order a replacement cappuccino, which was slightly better.
Overall, we were fans of the hotel although it is a let down by some of its staff. If we revisited we also might going for the room only option and looking for breakfast elsewhere.",4,2013,01,28
207,"Restaurant Service very poor, unhelpful and rude.","We stayed one night mid week, and invited two oversea's visitors too join us. Check in, valet service all very good. Rooms as usual clean, quiet and too a high standard. View poor. 
In the early evening we ate in the main restaurant, the waitress was very rude and unhelpful, it was actually embarrassing! We could not understand what she said to us and vice versa she clearly could not understand us. In conversation the waitress was very dismissive to us, which was very rude, i could only appolgoise to our guests for this. On ordering, we asked for a selection of veg for us all with our meal-we received a dish with 5 tiny baby boiled potatoes between four people and all I can describe as a spoonful of orange puréed mess, that had no taste or substance. We requested another portion which arrived when the meal was finished. We found the whole experience very very disappointing and left hungry!!",3,2013,01,27
207,Classy and Friendly,"Just the one night, on business. There is a man with an umbrella outside, so even though it was raining, getting from the taxi to the foyer was a dry experience. Check-in was friendly, I declined the offer to take my bag and went up to my room. Apart from the view (a yard, but they can't do too much about that) it was a lovely room, very comfortable, well-furnished with a nice bathroom. Using the lift is advisable, as it's quite easy to take a wrong turn in the corridors (which I did). The breakfast was very good, plenty of choice, but a little pricey. Check-out was fun with the clerk going off and filling a little gift box with the home-made biscuits for us as a parting-gift. I gather they do offers, which I'd be looking for if I went on holiday, but altogether a very nice hotel indeed, and of course a great city.",5,2013,01,27
207,Excellent!!,"This is our second visit to the Shelbourne, our first experience wasn't great but l have to say that on this occasion the staff couldn't have been nicer from the door man to reception , bar and restaurant staff which made for a really enjoyable stay. Yes it's not cheap but you get what you pay for and if you want to treat yourself then you'll not go wrong staying here.
The deluxe double room is vastly different to the standard double so if you don't mind the extra spend then would recommend, great central location and a great atmosphere whether you're in the bar, restaurant or lounge you'll not be dissapointed.
Very pleased with everything and looking forward to going back sometime again.
Go on ......treat yourself!! 
",5,2013,01,27
207,Live a little and splash out on an experience!,"Just stayed here last night. The staff were so friendly and kind. Ok it's pricey but I'd say well worth it just for the experience. We're not rich or important but were treated with the same respect as anyone else. The drinks are expensive (€24 for two) cocktails! But you have to live a little! Champagne was also costly but we took a bottle and had ice delivered to the room. Oh and extra great, no expectations to tip! They also sent up some lovely pistacho chocolate and some lemonades and a really nice hand written welcome card. Don't listen to the whingers I'd go tonight again if I could afford it!! Thank you for such a lovely time the Shelborne! Oh and check out the draft of the constitution in reception. Will be taking my lads to see it! ",5,2013,01,27
207,"Average, nothing more","We stayed one night at the Shelbourne before heading west. The hotel is located right at the town center and not very well accessible with a car due to bad traffic conditions all around the area. The room we got was awful, dark and a view to a backyard with an ugly business building 20 meters away. It felt actually like a jail. The furniture and bathroom was mediocre and not as expected. We stayed at the Merrion after our round trip which is much recommendable for the same price and class.",3,2013,01,22
207,Shelbourne Dublin - beauty and quality,"The Shelbourne is our hotel when traveling to Ireland for business. We love everything about it: the timeless elegance, always quality service from all departments, great food, Horseshoe Bar for a Cosmo and the No. 27 Bar, which easily rates in my top 5 bars anywhere. Rooms are well appointed, have good linens (important!), maid service has great attention to detail and room service is delicious. Concierge staff is very well versed and has, on more than one occasion, surprised us with added value or enhancements to our experiences.",5,2013,01,21
207,A magical Christmas at the Shelbourne,"We booked this hotel to celebrate Christmas in Dublin.  It did not disappoint.  We were in awe of the beautiful decorations, especially the wonderful candy train scene in the check in area.  The staff was extremely helpful, the coffee machine around the corner from the front desk was a delight.  Homemade cookies, excellent food in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner, and top notch room service made us decide to come back to the Shelbourne the day before we left Ireland for one more night of pure bliss.  An excellent experience all around.",5,2013,01,21
207,Pleasant and enjoyable but questionable value.,"We got off to a bad start when there was a mix up as to whether or not breakfast was included. Thankfully I'd brought my booking confirmation! Being upgraded was a nice touch but the room was still on the small side. 

The hotel oozes history and its location is hard to beat. There is a great buzz and it is clearly very popular with the more well heeled locals. The drawback with this is that it was impossible to get a seat on the Saturday night or Sunday afternoon. We couldn't access the bar for the jazz brunch and the area opposite the bar was reserved for those having tea. Surely a 5 Star hotel should have more expansive seating arrangements for guests.

The breakfast was superb, with a wonderful array of fruits, cereals, cooked and cold meats, eggs etc. etc.

Nice stay but other hotels offer better value.",4,2013,01,21
207,Lovely hotel,"This is a great hotel and location in dublin. The breakfast is very good, table service no less. The staff are nice and the bars are good too. Good for a rugby trip or the like. Rooms are clean but very small. A pice of old dublin class.",4,2013,01,18
207,The jewel in Dublin's crown!,"A memorable 2 night stay at The Shelbourne (hopefully the first of many) to celebrate my 50th birthday on 16th January. This beautiful hotel ticked all the boxes for us...location,style,charm,  comfort,quality and a staff second to none. Throughout our stay we were made to feel welcome by everyone and nothing was ever too much trouble. 
When booking my husband requested a room with a view but the spacious and luxurious accommodation allocated (a 3rd floor junior suite overlooking St Stephen's Green) was way beyond our expectations. The icing on the cake was a 'happy birthday' plate of delicious macaroons and a lovely bottle of merlot left in our room with a welcome card. Steeped in history this centrally located hotel provides a perfect contrast to the hustle and bustle of Dublin - a calm oasis where we relaxed with a mouth watering afternoon tea in beautiful surroundings and roaring log fires...no better escape from a cold winters day. 
We've always enjoyed our short breaks in Dublin (previously at The Westbury) but this has been the best ever. The Shelbourne is without doubt really special - roll on a return visit next January!",5,2013,01,18
207,A old modern lovely!!,"Marvelous Hospitality!  Surprisingly modern for such an old historic hotel!  The charm of the lounges with roaring fireplaces, the very attentive staff (including a doll of a concierge and lovely bar staff), great free wi-fi in room and good ventilation in each room make this a must stay.  Very comfortable rooms, modern baths and superb location will bring you back!",5,2013,01,18
207,The Shelbourne has charmed Dublin for more than a century,"Of the older Dublin institutions, the Shelbourne is one of the important survivors (Nelson's Pillar, the Russell Hotel and the Metropole Cinema all vanished from the picture, albeit for different reasons, decades ago). But the Shelbourne has been functioning as a hotel for more than a century and much of the original architecture is still intact.  One of the existing function rooms, the Constitution Room (overlooking St. Stephen's Green), was the venue in which the 1922 Constitution was signed. And the Horseshoe Bar (the smallest of the hotel's two bars) has been the setting, over the generations, for several major political controversies in Irish life.

However, the hotel is not just a historic building. I stayed here for four days before Christmas and the main bar was throbbing with life and people for the duration of my sojourn in the Shelbourne. Indeed, apart from drinking the night away, the main bar is also the venue for light lunches earlier in the day, where the sport of people-watching is practised with acuity. Also, if you just fancy a traditional afternoon tea, the fare served in the lounge (including the scones with strawberry jam and clotted cream) is of the highest calibre. 

I paid about Euro 220 a night for my room without a view. If you are willing to invest an extra Euro 50-60, you can secure a room with a view of St. Stephen's Green.  But even the Euro 220 was well worth the expenditure given the comfort of the room itself (and the well-appointed bathroom) and the rhythm of life which is a constant presence in the hotel. As for the breakfast which was delivered to my room, I would categorise it as very good, but not in the great category. However, this mattered little to me given the capacity of the main function rooms and public areas of the hotel to light up my life.

Finally, it is worth noting that the Shelbourne is just a five minute walk away from Grafton Street, home to several elegant stores. And the National Gallery, the Long Room and Book of Kells at Trinity College and the National Museum are all within easy striking distance of the hotel. In addition, if you are in the mood for more modern shopping experiences, the Luas trams are also five minutes away from the Shelbourne and you can catch one of them to visit the famous Dundrum Shopping Centre (beloved of younger shoppers) or simply to head out to the lanes and wooded pastures of rural Dublin or take a trip to see the horse-racing at Leopardstown.",5,2013,01,15
207,A touch of class,"Love this hotel; we can’t wait to go back. Its location is brilliant, just a few minutes walk from great shops, restaurants and pubs (but you probably won’t want to leave). The staff were all extremely professional, helpful and courteous (resident bar floor staff could be excluded from this, but we’ll put that down to tiredness). This hotel is steeped in history and the interior reflects this, there is an attractive blend of the old with the new.  The bedroom we stayed in was spacious, elegant and comfortable. The food,drink and service was excellent.  We would highly recommend this Hotel to all.",5,2013,01,14
207,Superb staff give this beautiful luxury hotel the edge.,At all times during our stay the high level of service and attention to detail from staff for our every need was always available.  The food was exceptional and perfectly served.  Our suite was lovely really comfortable a memorable few days. The view of St Stephens Green added to it all.,5,2013,01,13
207,Perfect,"My partner and I rounded off a short ""staycation"" with a night in the Shelbourne.  From start to finish we had an amazing time in the hotel.  I also attended the spa, for which I have a seperate review.  Check-in was pleasant and the staff were so friendly and helpful.  The museum is very interesting and well worth spending time in.  Our room was so lovely.  It wasn't a huge room but we didn't expect that for the room standard we chose but it was beautiful, clean and had a huge very confortable bed.  Not long after we settled into out room a girl arrived with complimentary drinks and chocolate, a lovely touch.  We had a most enjoyable night, in the hotel bar and then in the residents lounge where we had a late bite to eat.  Very tasty and reasonably priced for the location.  Breakfast was just yummy with great choice and great friendly service.  All of the buffet items were so fresh.  All in all, we had a most relaxing and lovely time and will definately go back.",5,2013,01,13
207,Great looking hotel,"Had the pleasure of a meeting at this hotel. Great ambience and nice to see a place with a real fire in the reception area on a winters day. Free wifi was a definite asset and service in the coffee area was excellent. Location is good, within the centre of the city with lots attractions close at hand.",4,2013,01,12
207,Outstanding!,"Wonderful hotel me and my boyfriend stayed in. We always book with marriott and this has been our favourite so far. Our suite was lovely, nice and clean.
Breakfast in bed great selection.
Bars and lounges also amazing.
Food is delightful and the staff are tip top/helpful.
For the price it is more than worth it!
Will be returning when next in Dublin. ",5,2013,01,11
207,The Shelbourne Hotel,"Had pleasure of staying in this wonderful hotel on 9th jan 2013 on occasion of my  wife's birthday.
A truly memorable experience.
Staff absolutely excellent.
Because of the occasion we were treated to a complimentary upgrade to a magnificent room.
On returning to our room that night we were surprised to discover a complimentary bottle of wine and some treats had been placed in our room.
This wonderful gesture made this a memorable occasion.
Will definetely return.
The bedroom was so clean and beautiful and bed was extremely comfortable.",5,2013,01,10
207,First rate,"Spent a few days here in November, and was extremely pleased.  Everyone of the staff (and there are a lot of them) were not only helpful but also always very pleasant.
Rooms would be considered large, so are huge by Euro standards.
Again, this is a first rate property, and I highly recommend it.",5,2013,01,10
207,If I could give 6 stars I would,"Spent 3 nights here this week.....
Warm smiles greet you and you are made to feel important the second they see you.
Room lovely, First rate clean.
Dinner ever night in the Lords Mayors lounge and atmosphere was so relaxing.

I was here on business and travel on my own and it is the first hotel I have looked forward to coming back to in the evening.",5,2013,01,10
207,Excellent Stay,"It had been a while since we stayed here and with all thats happened over the past few years were unsure of what to expect. There was no reason to worry - from valet parking, through reception and room service the staff were excellent. Our room and sleep quality was perfect. Our breakfast in the Saddle Room topped off a great stay. Highly recommended.",5,2013,01,09
207,Lunch in Style,"One of the iconic Dublin hotels and looking good following refurbishment over recent years. The place exudes elegance from a bygone era. A pre-Christmas lunch for two was greatly enjoyed and their table d’hôte menu provided everything we wanted at a reasonable price. They have a mouth watering selection of wines, albeit many at eye watering prices. The restaurant is a bit formal, but is well suited to its clientele and the staff’s welcome was warm and genuine. I have eaten here several times this year and have enjoyed each meal. I still can’t resist ordering a glass of cream sherry in bar before lunch and watching the bar staff trying to figure out what I want, where the bottle is and what glass to pour it into.  I would strongly recommend a lunch here.",4,2013,01,07
207,Outstanding!,"Our family had 2 wonderful nights at the Shelbourne Hotel pre Christmas. We enjoyed every moment of our stay. The management and staff of this hotel have got everything just right. Professional, attentive, courteous and welcoming. The rooms which were overlooking St Stephens Green were comfortable and relaxing. Afternoon tea was delicious. Breakfast full of excellent choices.  Lunch in the Saddle room is not to be missed. Excellent menu and service. 
The location of the Shelbourne is perfect for shopping and sightseeing in Dublin. We can't wait to return soon.",5,2013,01,07
207,Comfortable calm in a vibrant city!,"The Shelbourne Hotel is very centrally located beside St. Stephens Green in Dublin City. Just a short walk from a range of attractions including the Natural History museum, The Dail(Government Buildings), The National Library (A must for researchers and those interested in the past) , Shopping areas - Grafton Street, O'Connell Street and many other attractions too many to mention. 
The hotel has been upgraded and provides a very welcoming atmosphere with friendly helpful staff and modern well appointed facilities.My wife and I stayed one night and found the hotel a haven of comfort and old world charm. I was particularly impressed by the leisure facilities provided and found the staff there both freindly and helpful.
I have given the hotel a reluctant rating of 4 in the overall assesment (I would like to have given a 5!) due to two particular organisational aspects of the services provided which I found disappointing. The residents lounge (a great place to ""people watch"") is closed to residents, who just want to sit, recuperate and read, most afternoons because ""afternoon teas"" are reserved for those wishing to pay for the privilege and no alternative arrangements are available. The suggested bar does not provide the same ambience! Secondly there is no area set aside for those waiting , with luggage, for their car to be returned to them.
However I wouild still feel that this hotel is ideally suited for a short stay in central Dublin and apart from the aspects I mentioned, I enjoyed my stay.",4,2013,01,06
207,Superb service,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for one night during the Very busy period before the Christmas holiday.  I found my room and the service at check-in, car concierge etc. to be excellent.  I travel the world on business and stay in many 5 star hotels - this hotel is up there for atmosphere, service and location.  The new fitness centre is a terrific addition and reviewers who have been negative need to factor in the history of this hotel and where it is situate in the city - this is a far cry from the many bland 5 star hotels around the world that offer very little in the way of Atmosphere or warmth.  An excellent choice for a short city break.  Keep up the good work.",5,2013,01,05
207,Just fabulous,"Just exquisite, the service was incredible. We even got drinks and chocolate brought to our room free to wish us happy new year. The room was fab, great tv, clean, lovely bed, quiet. Don't miss this hotel!!",5,2013,01,05
207,All that glitters is not always gold,"As a regular visitor to the bars within the Shelbourne, we were rather looking forward in what had been deemed Dublin's premier 5 star hotel, having stayed in the others e.g. Westin, Westbury etc. this was a nice treat ahead of attending a wedding in the hotel.

Booking in at 3:00pm (the advertised check-in time), we were advised that we'd be contacted when room was ready... 4:50pm came the call, I then queued at about 5:30pm for 10 minutes, got my 2 x room keys and off I went to check the room... neither of the keys worked.  When I returned to reception the same gentleman that had served me, informed me that the system had been down for most of the afternoon (none of our other friends staying had this issue) and why on earth not mention it there and then! Anyway - he said he'd sort it, off we went to the room... but he had no functioning keys with him, he was just opening the door - I told him the lights won't go on unless I have a key - A shrug of the shoulders and a ""come back later, I'll have everything ready""... At 9:30pm my fourth attempt at getting entry... the desk hadn't prepared my keys... I might have just walked in from the street.  Then between 3:30am and 8am we were awoken by barrels and glasses being moved from the alley/street outside - belonging to the hotel - we could even hear the guys whistling as they removed the glasses and rolled their barrels... next morning - we noticed, no hairdryer, lack of hotel or local information and even a low level issue, (but paints the picture) no pens! The room itself was very small & didn't seem if it was of the class of the hotel.

I called the manager in the morning, Mr Paul Hartmann, who thankfully was appalled by our experience.  We met him when checking out with Raphael the Guest relations manager - and were given some Marriot points and the service charges to the room, breakfast and car park valet removed, which I feel was the correct course of action - I did ask if this room (261) was usually for staff, but he did say that 261-263 were used for ""trials"" or some such... 

The rest of the hotel service (outside of the accommodation) we found as always to be first class. Food and waiter service is as expected, however this review is of our experience, and was unfortunate as if you read my other reviews they are always, I feel, balanced and usually we have a great experience wherever we are.

We can stay in a Dublin Westin Junior Suite for less than the Deluxe room we stayed in, likewise the Westbury is less expensive, on this visit I can't say why the Shelbourne would be a preferential choice for us - perhaps we will try again, thanks more to Paul and Raphael's response than the poor experience at reception and with the room we were possibly just very unlucky to get.

I suggest staying away from these rooms and lower floors of any hotel.",3,2013,01,05
207,Disappointing,"We stayed here for one night in a double room. I have to say that I was expecting much more from a 5 star hotel. The public areas are all lovely but the room was a joke. It was tiny with no room to move around once our bags were in it. The worst thing about it though was that it smelled of vomit. In hindsight we should have complained about it but we were attending a wedding elsewhere so literally dropped our bags in the room and left and weren't back until 2am so didn't have the time. For a 5 star hotel, charging so much per night, I would have expected much much better. 

On the positive side, the location is excellent, right in the city centre and breakfast was very good. However, there are plenty of other hotels close to the city centre at a fraction of the price so there's no need to stay here for the location.

Definitely would not stay here again.",2,2013,01,05
207,Disappointing finish,"I approached the Shelbourne with high hopes, and, to be fair, I wasn't disappointed. Our room was beautiful, the food was good, if a little exclusive. Even the staff were friendly, to a point. Where things went wrong was at the very end of the two-night stay. Our car was brought around and the cases were apparently packed into the boot. with night approaching and a lengthy journey ahead, as well as being beside Stephens Green in the centre of Dublin at rush hour, we weren't going to wait around, so off we went. When we arrived at our first destination, we noticed the problem. Most of our bags hadn't been packed! My laptop, iPad and other items were missing. When they arrived home, my mother and brother discovered that a large quantity of my mother's jewellery was also missing. When I noticed the laptop missing, my heart sank as thievery seemed the only likely cause. However, I still phoned the hotel to see could they find anything. I started b telling them the problem, and asking would they look. To their credit, they looked around and were back to me within minutes, but empty handed. I asked them to recheck the room and scour the lobby which they did, but turned up nothing. ALL our bags had been in storage behind reception ALL day, so I knew that if it was anywhere, it'd have to be their. That didn't occur to the Shelbournes staff of course, but that's a different complaint. The first check, they found nothing, the second they did. I went to collect the stuff the next day, and was refunded the cost of getting to Dublin from where I had been in Maynooth, then getting home to Kilkenny, then getting back to Dublin, then back to Maynooth, a series of Journeys which took up my entire day and all it's lectures. 
My complaint is three fold. I was and am annoyed, to say the least, and expected some sort of conciliatory gesture in compensation for their mistake and my lost lectures, but it didn't come. If I'm in Dublin, I normally stay in the Four Seasons. Sufficed to say that I be making the mistake of changing again anytime soon!
Second, the mistake itself. That it was made at all is an atrocious security lapse. I can only assume that whichever porter had put the bags away in the first place had neglected to put tags on them, hence the fuss. This shouldn't have happened and, hopefully,won't happen again in future. 
Finally, the attitude of staff once the mistake was noticed. Immediately, blame was being shifted and I was being told I shouldn't have left the bags on their own in a busy lobby, even though an hadn't touched them all day! It was insinuated that, first, they had been stolen, and that, second, it was my fault! Thank God they weren't taken, but on the off chance that they had been, it would surely be some sage advice for the Shelbourne to employ some lobby security! The rooms are pricey, so anyone staying there would probably have some valuable items with them. Would it be too much to ask for the hotel to employ some security to make sure nothing gets stolen on their supposedly 5-star premises? Hardly. 
I hope the Shelbourne will pick up on these tips. I can't imagine you will maintain a wealthy clientele for much longer if you porters develop a reputation for sloppy negligence, your staff one for self preservation or your lobby one as a hunting ground for common pickpockets. ",2,2013,01,04
207,Hello neighbors!,"I got the surprise of my life when I opened the curtains of my room to find myself face to face with the office workers in the building next door.  The net curtains are flimsy and very see through and neither the windows of the hotel or the office building are tinted for privacy.  I'm sure the staff have some good stories to tell about the hotel guests.

The public areas of the hotel are very grand but the rooms behind the facade do not live up to the same standard.  Our twin room was very plain with 2 sagging double beds and no full length mirror.

On the positive side I would have to say that the service I received from all staff members I interacted with and the cleanliness of the hotel is second to none.  There was not a scuffed wall or stained carpet in sight.

The hotel is within easy walking distance of Trinity College for those who would like to see the Book of Kells. There is also a loads of restaurants and a shopping precinct near by.",3,2013,01,03
207,Wonderful Weekend!,"My family (wife, two little kids and my mother-in-law) stayed at the hotel for a quick weekend get away to see the city.  Although, the cost was a little on the high side, it was definitely worth it!  The staff (and I mean everyone we interacted with) was wonderful to us from the moment we checked in (they even corrected a costly mistake I made to our reservation).  They treated our kids like they were special which really made our stay special.  Again, it was little on the pricey side, but we definitely got what we paid for, the service was excellent!  I highly recommend this hotel to any travellers on business or pleasure.",5,2013,01,03
207,If affordable non can beat Shelbourne,"I have stayed at Shelbourne on business for several weeks over a period of months in the year 2012.

As you approach the Shelbourne you are looked after from the minute to step on the entrance right through to reception and then to your room.

The atmosphere and ambience when you walk in is quite soothing and the cookies at reception always fresh and delicious.

The staff were very friendly and professional in dealing with all guests. I have stayed in many hotels world wide and non can surpass the way myself and indeed all guests were looked after.

There are various room types, I typically stayed in standard / deluxe rooms. The rooms i stayed in were sumptuous, well maintained clean and well presented. I did get one room which I would call a box room but was easily moved to another.

Breakfast was unbeatable with lots of fresh food to choose from and service was great.

If you have a lot of money to spare,  the restaurant is good too but there are many nearby restuarants to choose from in Stephens Green so I would just go out instead.
Room Service is good.

I couldnt have stayed at this hotel had I not been on business but certainly would dig deep into my not so deep pockets to stay her for a weekend break.

Worth staying here if you can, for the hotel and location.",5,2013,01,03
207,Sleep tight,"As I was preparing to write this review a huge smile came across my face, dont you want all your own reviews to start that way?
From check in to check out I felt warm, safe, comfortable, and it was like visiting an old friend.  I dont know how I got so lucky but I was in a beautiful authentic room that had been updated but kept the same charm of the hotel looking over St Stephens Square.  
The bed was super cozy in true Westin style.  The bathroom was perfect and it was nice to have fresh  warmed towels and turn down service every night.  My waters were replaced and when the house keeper noticed I had drank them all she left a couple more.  Its the small things like that the customers remember. Another thing about housekeeping, they work in pairs, no messy cart in the hallway just a nice woman walking along with a smile on her face. It took me a couple of times till I realized it was housekeeping.
Breakfast was delicious and was severed late enough that even battling a touch of jet lag I didnt feel rushed in the morning to make it down.
During my trip I didnt want to drive so the connoisseur said he would help me find transportation. While he was looking I was making phone calls and getting prices.  We met back up and he had 1/2 the price that I had found AND the driver was waiting right outside bc he just had a drop off.  PERFECT!  I step out side the antique double doors of the lobby to be swept into a Mercedes S class.  Kerin, the owner and driver, gave me a detailed travel tips from Dublin into the country side.  He was so sweet, funny, professional and knowledgable, as a woman traveling alone its a huge reilief when you know your in safe hands.
The next day as I was trying to pack I called for the bags that I thought I had packed till I went to zip them up. Rapping on the door I was embarrassed to open it and not be ready.  In true Shelbourne style the gentleman smiled and helped my zip up my bag of shoes ;)
This hotel is perfect bc it is in the City Center and within walking distance to fine dinning and shopping. Just steps across the street was a beautiful jogging path.
Well done, Shelbourne Staff!!!",5,2013,01,02
207,The Shelbourne - the best hotel in town!,"My wife, our two year old son and I stayed at The Shelbourne from the 17th to 20th December.
One word to describe our experience at this hotel would be “outstanding”.

Location wise, it is superb!

We found the staff at The Shelbourne to be brilliant (doormen, receptionists, room service, cleaners and bar staff ), always extremely helpful and courteous.

Food at the hotel was fantastic and the service and attention to detail was admirable.

Something priceless at this hotel is the atmosphere. It’s tradition is well noted in the museum which is located near reception. 

We will definitely be returning on our next trip to Ireland.",5,2013,01,02
207,Fantastic,"I travel frequently for business, and am always staying in hotels. I can safely say that this hotel is one of the best I have ever stayed in. 
The service is very personalized, everyone knows your name, you are made to feel as if you are the most important guest they have ever had staying there. 
The location is fantastic - directly opposite St. Stephen's Green",5,2013,01,02
207,In a class by itself.,"One of the finest hotels I have ever stayed. Everything is done to the highest quality. Staff very friendly and helpful in every aspect. Food was excellent, a number of choices. The history if the hotel makes the stay even better. Like any flagship full service hotel, you pay for what you get. ",5,2013,01,02
207,Irish Christmas,"My wife and I stayed 6 nights at the Shelbourne during Christmas and it was the best choice we could've made. The restaurant, both bars, and lounge kept their own, separate ambiance despite being close to each other. Anytime we requested something the staff was exceptional in responding. We also had another guest who had one to many Guinesses try to talk and the bartender notified the manager who was gracious enough to divert him elsewhere. It was very nicely handled and showed the attentiveness of the staff. As far as location, we couldn't have asked for a more perfect spot. Our Dublin Christmas was very memorable and the Shelbourne did nothing but add to the experience.",5,2013,01,01
207,Best Dublin Hotel,"Belated review following a family stay in September.  Great location, and atmosphere. Bars great...but remember they won't reserve space for residents as they rely on the (small) horseshoe bar. Rooms vary - the smallest is tiny but suites are exceptional and worth the extra for special events. Front of house and check in staff very pleasant. Wouldn't rate the restaurant but there are plenty in walking distance, so it's not an issue. I stay here at least once a year on business, but this time Staff went the extra distance to help make a family occasion special, so thank you Shelbourne! ",5,2012,12,30
207,Nice hotel but really lacking in a number of key aervice areas,Stayed here twice in December and the most striking failure on each occasion is the chronic inadequacy of facilities and services such as dining and reception vs the number of rooms.  Bottom line is that they do not have enough capacity in the breakfast room or at reception when they approach full occupancy. It can take up to one hour to queue to get into the breakfast room in the morning. Checkout out also takes an inordinate amount of time. It took me one hour to queue to checkout and retrieve my car from valet (30 minutes each).  The lobby area is like a train station. Have never seen anything like it in a five star hotel.,3,2012,12,29
207,Best service and staff,We will never forget this night !!! The staff at the shoe bar are amazing... We were girls having a drink at the bar when an old guy  harrased us  but the staff were watching and caring .. The manager came and apologise twice! It was impressive ... Thanks to the staff for caring for the client ... For sure we will come back there... ,5,2012,12,28
207,Great place to stay in Dublin,"We stayed here twice within a four week period in nov/dec 
We booked through Internet sites which gave much better rates than those on the hotel website
The cost was less than two hundred euros per night for b&b for two people
The service in the hotel was great and the location is of course fantastic
If the hotel is busy you may have to wait for breakfast but at least you are given warning of this by the staff and the breakfast was worth the esit
We had the room service breakfast on one of the mornings and it was excellent
In summary a great place to stay and far less stuffy than the merrion the other five star in the vicinity ",5,2012,12,28
207,"Good, traditional hotel in a great location","Good hotel - does everything you'd expect to a high standard. The atmosphere is traditional and formal but not too stuffy. Rooms are very good size, beds comfortable and the lobby and bar areas are great meeting places although they do come with the ridiculous prices you expect to pay for drinks and food in similar joints around the rest of the world. New gym and pool facilities are first class. Staff throughout the hotel friendly and welcoming.",4,2012,12,28
207,"Great, friendly place at the heart of Dublin",Loved this place - I felt compelled to call this hotel out. It is close to all attractions in town. Staff is friendly and courteous. I was there during the week prior to Christmas. The hotel/ bar was happening. I inquired with the attendant at the front door as to what hot whiskey is. He ended up serving hot whiskey to four of us on the house. Room was classy as well! I would gladly stay there again if my travels take me to Dublin.,5,2012,12,26
207,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location!","Stayed here for 5 nights as part of a birthday celebration for my husband and it exceeded expectations.  Service was outstanding: from the doormen, to front desk, to concierge, to bartenders in The Saddle Room  - all made us feel welcome and special.  Additionally, location was spot on for exploring the city.  Have raved about The Shelbourne since our return and highly recommend it to anyone looking for luxurious accommodations in Dublin!",5,2012,12,19
207,Great Historical Hotel with a contstant buzz in the bars and lounge,"I stayed here for the weekend recently with my wife.  The location, opposite St. Stephens green is ideal having Grafton street and St Stephen's Green Shopping center to the right and Merrion Row and Dawson St. with there many fine restuarants to the left and rear.  The staff are very professional and helpful, the hotel has retained its classic look but is quite clean and fashionable.   Only negative is a glass of wine is 7.5 or 9 for pino griogo so if you are out for the night I would recommend only the one in the bar before moving on to the many, many fine bars in the facinity.  The rooms themselves are small as to be expected from an old hotel and the furniture while modern has the classical look.  You really feel the history of the hotel as you walk its corridiors.  For a couple of nights in Dublin you will not get a better hotel!",4,2012,12,19
207,Top Class,"We had a one night stay to go to the Theater. The Shelbourne Hotel was a good choice. A very warm welcome. Great room and great service. A piece of Irish history given the Irish Constitution was drawn up in it and also the very long list of V.I.P's who stayed there. We liked their little Museum and the Christmas Decor, Cookies at reception, and Chocolates at bed time. Breakfast was excellent. Hotel very busy but all staff still attentive. Great central place to stay. We hope to return, but it is a treat with the price, but worth it.",5,2012,12,17
207,Week-end trip,"Myself and my friend having  a girly week-end treat in Dublin. We arrived early (thank goodness) to a lovely receptionist who eventually was able to give us the single beds we had requested.  No we do NOT sleep in the same bed- ever. The only dinner reservation  available for residents was a 6pm. The dinner 3 course set menu was €59 . We ordered crab starter. Which was green and my friend would not eat it at all. I had about 1/3 . Tasted awful. We had ordered turkey for main (as this was our Christmas treat to ourselves) This arrived it was the vacuum packed job, ham at the bottom, stuffing in the middle and turkey on the top. Catering pack cost approx €1.65 with one potatoe and a small amount of 'other' veg/salad and cranberry sauce. Not good enough for a lunch in a zero star restaurant. Never mind a supposed 5 star hotel. The dessert was also a bought in job, although the best part of the meal. And the mince pies are better from Aldi!! Also bought in.  That was dinner. We were allowed a €20 discount each because of our complaints!!!   Then we come to breakfast... 
served from 7 am to 11am.  We decided not to leave it too late and arrived a approx 9.50am  to find a waiting area with about 50 - 60 people hanging around. The wait was 45 mins. There appreared to be no one in charge either at breakfast time or at dinner. The staff were very slow movers and generally the whole experience was one of great disappointment.",2,2012,12,17
207,Lovely!,"We decided to take a short break in Dublin and do some Christmas Shopping at the same time and stayed in the Shelbourne last weekend.  Being the busiest weekend for Christmas Shopping, the hotel was absolutely buzzing.  I have been to the Shelbourne quite a bit but never stayed, so I was looking forward to it.  It did not disappoint.  Even though the Q for check-in was quite long, we were given hot mulled cider on arrival which took the edge off it and were very quickly checked in thereafter.  Everyone from the reception staff to the porters were very well attired, very cheerful and mannerly and always had a smile on their face.  Our room was well furnished, spotless clean and the bed is one of the most comfortable I've slept in in all the 5* hotels I've had the pleasure to be in.  Well done!  We had a busy view of the alley behind the hotel! The bar was crowded about 10pm when we came back from a show so we didn't go in but had some drinks served very quickly straight to our room.  The hotel seems to be very quiet once you get to the rooms, so a peaceful night ensued.  Breakfast was fine, good quality but not very exciting really.  It did offer a la Carte but I am not sure if this was extra, a few diners were wondering as well as ourselves but in the end we settled for the big fry up.  Again, staff were lovely and very attentive.  All in all, a lovely trip and would definately recommend the Shelbourne and would love to visit again in the not so distant future, the staff definately make the hotel, well done everyone!",5,2012,12,17
207,A grand experience,"We had a late lunch here and were enchanted  by the architecture, the design, the service, the grand stately nature of the place.  We came back for late night drinks and were enchanted again.  Every detail, every possible assistance from any service personnel, so efficient, so charming, whetehr a amall group or a large group.  Beautiful.",5,2012,12,15
207,Absolutely wonderful.,"This hotel is excellent. My friend and i stayed last night for the first time. Great atmosphere,reception staff were outstandingly helpful, nothing was a problem. Room was lovely.This has been the best hotel we have stayed in, in Dublin.",5,2012,12,15
207,Pleasant Stay,"Myself and my sister stayed here for one night over the October Bank Holiday weekend. We had got a very good last minute rate for twin room - B&B. When we arrived to the hotel, it was about 11.30 in the morning, we knew that our room may not be ready as check in time was later in the afternoon. A very pleasant receptionst was dealing with us and she was able to check us in and assign us to our bedroom. Our room had 2 queed beds( a bit too soft for me personally), and it was a very good sized bedroom. The bathroom was also of good size and  the hotel supplys lovely Elemis toiletries. We ate breakfast in the Saddle Room - it is a buffet, very good selection on offer. We also previously had eaten lunch some time ago while in Dublin and it was very good. The night we stayed we had a couple of drinks in the bar  - it was very busy and had a great atmosphere.

The Shelbourne Hotel is truly a Renaissance Hotel. It is in a great location. Staff are very friendly and helpful. We would love to stay here again.",4,2012,12,15
207,Sorry - this is NOT a five star hotel..........rugby scrums in the foyer!,"I tend not to write hotel reviews - we normally stay in Four Seasons properties if there is no ""special"" hotel to stay in..however on this trip we succumbed to the central location of this hotel and so we had a couple of nights there.

I will not aim to identify every single fault with this hotel - many of which were service related (there were too many) - but suffice to say the staff at this hotel are not familiar with the expected standard of a five star hotel.........everything from the doormen not taking your bags from the car......bags being left behind the reception desk with no offer to take to the room!, receptionists who are too busy with whatever else they were doing to serve you, the Concierge who sits on his little throne behind his little tiny desk defying you to have the audacity to ask him anything, the concierge staff who clearly can't understand the expectations of guests and their dining standards.......the surly and inefficient bar staff, restaurant staff....the list goes on.....I cannot remember when I have encountered such poor service - or so widely across an entire hotel.

We did not receive turndown for some reason on the first night - and the second night when I asked for it - it comprised hanging back up our used towels back on the rack??????

The rooms are small (we stayed in one of the ""Heritage"" rooms - and I assume that the ""Heritage"" bit refers to the fact that everything in the room is well past its sell by date). Rooms were a bit tired round the edges shall we say (being kind).........carpets in the hallways and public spaces are truly filthy.....all towels, bathmats etc are very small and almost threadbare..all bathroom and bedroom fixtures and soft furnishings need replacement....

...but the biggest issue ?........and be aware of this....is that on a Thursday AND Friday evening (and I assume its the same on Saturdays) we had to literally fight our way OUT of the reception area to the front of the hotel.....though packs of Guinness wielding locals......and then after dinner to fight our way back in again (my wife picking up a nice series of Guinness stains on her dress in the process!)...I have NEVER seen anything like this!!....it like a really busy nightclub has been deposited in the foyer/reception area of the hotel.....incredible......now I like a bit of 'atmosphere"" and a nice busy bar area is always a good sign......but this is simply ridiculous...

Sorry I will not visit this hotel again....The Four Seasons is infinitely better...and if you need the central location I'd recommend the Merrion....a hotel that DOES know how to look after its guests.",1,2012,12,15
207,A microcosm of Dublin,"Like so much of Dublin, the Shelbourne is nowhere near as good as it thinks it it is. Having supped Guinness from its excellent bar, I decided to have an overnight stay as a treat. What a disappointment. While the staff and service befit a five star establishment, the rooms, alas, are more in keeping with a three star establishment. Small, with ageing and not particularly nice mahogony furniture, there is a shabby feel beyond the glossy frontage of the hotel. A light inside our wardrobe would not go out in the night, disturbing our rest. The shower was little more than a trickle and the tiling was badly in need of a grout. There was a chunk of freshly congealed gum stuck to the carpet just inside the door. And the bar? It seems virtually every office party in the city was crammed in there. It was horrendous, and there was seemingly nowhere for residents to chill out. Thoroughly underwhelming.",3,2012,12,14
207,"Such an amazing, special place, the Claridges of Dublin :)","We were booked to stay on a very busy weekend in Dublin.  The reviews were amazing, the welcome surpassed the anticipation.  We were made to feel like VIP's from the liveried doorman greeting, for the rest of the weekend- regardless of the fact that there was a full house both nights!  We visited due to our wedding anniversary, and received numerous special treats from the hospitality and housekeeping team, including a specially handwritten congratulations card, and beautiful fresh rosé petal turndown service.  A very busy itinery prevented us from indulging in the spa, museum, and afternoon tea, that we had so hoped to partake of, but will no doubt make a point of insisting upon on our next visit.  Bar 27!!! Well, just about the last word in sophistication.  A wonderful place, immaculate service and ideal opportunity for people watching ( mind you, the celebs all go into the horseshoe bar..). Delicious food, cocktails and champagne- one couldn't wish for any more!!

Sunday brunch is a whole other kettle of fish.... This is big time!! Exquisite food- amazing live jazz, flowing champagne and oysters and ice sculptures make this a roaring twenties, Art Deco, opulent experience not to be missed.  Love love love this hotel- the sat word in sophistication- cant wait to return for our anniversary next year! ",4,2012,12,11
207,The Grand Old Dame,"We have stayed at many hotels across the world and have never been moved enough to write a review on Trip Advisor. After having spent one night at the Shelbourne, I felt compelled to write my first review. To celebrate a special occasion, we decided to spend a night at the Shelbourne and it was truly a 5 star experience. We were informed that we had been upgraded to a Heritage Park View room and the room was fantastic. 

Later in the evening, we spent a few hours in No.27 watching the Christmas shoppers while enjoying the seafood platter. This morning, we treated ourselves to a  full Irish breakfast in our room overlooking St.Stephen's Green. Breakfast was fab and loved the fresh flower touch!

All in all, it was the best hotel experience that we have ever had and we did not want to leave! The staff were friendly, extremely accommodating and welcoming and particular thanks must go to Ashley Keegan who was exceptional in all communications prior to the trip.  We have decided that this will be the first trip of many to the Shelbourne and we can't wait to return!",5,2012,12,10
207,can not believe its a 5 star hotel,"i went to the shelbourne on the 8th of dec , Myself and my work collegues were really looking foreward to it. To cut a long story short the whole evening was such a disaster. We  were literally crammed into a ballroom with many other ompanies the entertainment was a joke the food was something they served in schools years ago utterly disgusting, service was the worst i have ever experienced. Toilets were absolutely filthy.A few of my colleques were staying overnight and oh boy did they regret it some 
had to sleep on camp beds. For 100 euros a night this was absolutely digraceful. I would advise people not ot be fooled by this hotels 5 star rateing because it definitely is not.",1,2012,12,09
207,"Friendly, fabulous and fantastic food!","Spent the weekend in The Shelbourne and we were made very welcome from the moment we arrived. The staff never pass you without a friendly greeting. The breakfast is fabulous with all kinds of possibilities on the menu. The old fashioned grandeur of the rooms, table linen and fine crockery is a welcome treat in this age of modern minimalism. The Spa is beautiful and the pool is substantial, so make sure you allow some time for a little indulgence. We had a wonderful evening meal in The Saddle Restaurant and they made a lovely little fuss over my husband who was celebrating his birthday. This is not an inexpensive place to stay but after all it is The Shelbourne, so blow the budget and have a treat. We felt like mini-celebs for the weekend and came away very chilled and already planning a return visit.",5,2012,12,09
207,Weekend at Shelbourne,"We had a wonderful time in this hotel its steeped in history and such a gorgeous well maintained hotel , Staff are very friendly and helpful absolute without doubt the best location for hotel in Dublin . Breakfast was superb had everything you could wish for , will defiantly return had a fantastic weekend with my wife",5,2012,12,07
207,"Exceptional service, friendly, overall great stay","The shelbourne is a great place to stay on a visit to Dublin.  Our room was large and comfortable.  It was quiet but downstairs bus selling with energy and cheer.  Breakfast had a variety of options and the spa, gym and pool were also a good extra.",4,2012,12,07
207,An elegant dame!,"We stayed in the Shelbourne for two nights and found it to be one of the best places we have ever stayed. The service was excellent, the atmosphere was amazing and the breakfast (which is my bug bear with most hotels) was delicious.

 Our room was spacious and spotless and our bathroom was very well appointed. Our room was at the front overlooking St. Stephens Green but was very quiet which was a pleasant surprise. The public areas are simply fabulous. What sets this hotel apart from so many others in the city is that its got real soul and I loved the odd thick Dublin accent which just added to the charm.

Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so special.",5,2012,12,07
207,Great hotel,"Visited the Shelbourne in late November for a conference.  Having visited a lot of hotels throughout the United States and Europe, this is one of the best hotels I have ever visited.  

Pros:
- Best bed I have ever had in Europe
- Great shower (a rarity in Europe)
- Good A/C
- Free WiFi
- Good full, hot breakfast 

Cons
- None really

Cost about 250 euros a night.",5,2012,12,07
207,Simply the best,"We enjoyed two nights of five-star luxury in what has to be Dublin's top hotel. Afternoon tea in the historic Lord Mayor's lounge was delightful, our room was luxurious in every way and breakfast was simply outstanding. 
As a journalist I am seldom lost for words but the whole Shelbourne experience took my breath away.
The welcome we received from each and every one of the staff was genuine and the service exemplery - we will certainly return to this amazing establishment on our next trip to the Emerald Isle.",5,2012,12,05
207,Jazz for brunch,"We didn't stay at the Shelbourne hotel, but visited Bar 27 for Sunday lunch -and aren't we glad we did. From 12 to 3 we were serenaded by a jazz quartet - singer plus piano, bass, drums - playing extracts from the great American songbook. There's a good brunch menu from a full Irish breakfast to a classic Sunday roast via fish and chips, mussels, eggs benedict etc. And then a pint of Guinness to finish it off. A great way to spend Sunday lunchtime.",5,2012,12,04
207,Love it!!,"Having stayed at The Shelbourne on a regular basis, I have to say:

- Reception staff are excellent - Jane especially deserves an award!
- Food is good, if a little expensive
- Rooms are comfortable, some are noisy, so ask for a quiet one...
- New spa is fantastic and really makes this a 5 star hotel.

The thing that makes this hotel great is the staff who are without exception, fantastic.",5,2012,12,03
207,Not 5 Star Service in the Slightest,"Because of a work project, I spent at least 6 nights in every 5 star hotel in Dublin, as well as a few nights in some 4 star. The Shelbourne was the worst of the lot. My upgraded, premium/""Heritage"" room in the ""old part of the hotel"" was the equivalent of a standard to below standard room in some of the 4 stars. Small. Very, very very loud. Lacking in character. Much like your basic corporate Hilton room in a U.S. city. My large complaint, however, is not the room but rather the running of things there. Turn down was often over-looked. (I had to call for it.) My room was not cleaned until 6pm most days.  (After having even requested it earlier.)The concierge was unable to get a few tickets for a rugby game. (Had to call the Merrion Hotel concierge for this. No problem for them.) There was NEVER any available open times for spa services. There was rarely an open table at breakfast, tea, lunch, etc. (In 6 days, I was never able to get a meal or a drink right away. Usually had to wait an hour or so. And was impossible to just sit anywhere in the hotel and just have a coffee. I was actually kicked out of my table a couple times while 1/2 way through my tea.) They seem to put outside guests first and hotel guests last. It was all so oddly snobbish. As a person who makes a living dealing with the best hotels in the world, truly, I was beyond surprised to discover such rude behavior by staff members in general, in IRELAND, a country in which I have come to normally find the kindest, least assuming people. Also, because of my job, a ""V.I.P"" note would pop up wherever my room number came up. This made no difference. I was still treated below average. It was, all in all, strange.
I will never stay here again. I suggest if you come to Dublin, to make a reservation here for high tea. But don't actually stay here. It is embarrassingly over-priced. And of all the 5 stars in Dublin, it's the least celestial.
I am sad about it, too. I stayed here years ago before Marriott took over and it was magical then.",1,2012,12,01
207,Excellent Experience!,"Without doubt, it is the staff, each and every one of them we met,  that breathe life into this magnificent historic landmark! The Hotel itself is impeccable - the rooms are perfect (go for the Heritage Rooms - more spacious overlooking the Green). The opulent Saddle Room Restaurant serving sumptuous breakfasts every morning even with fruit ice sculptures no less! The bar options are lively and 'full of locals' and The Mayor's Lounge must be the most comfortable and famous lounge in 'all of Dublin'. The new Spa is heavenly. Not to mention all the lovely complimentary touches, like wifi, water in the room, tea coffee, latte machines and shoe shine! We would without hesitation say if you in Dublin and want a true authentic Irish experience, stay at The Shelbourne! It is a very historic hotel, perfect location and filled with great staff that will look after you, even if you not one of the hundreds of celebrities that are often seen there!",5,2012,12,01
207,Afternoon tea,"We just went there to have some tea and cake. The food was great, Tea not so great. But the staff was nice and friendly. The interior is very impressive. The bar gets really packed after 4pm, but very good place to rest a little bit.",4,2012,11,28
207,Impressive Hotel,"I ave been staying many a time at the Shelbourne and thus like to come back here.

The hotel has one of the nicest and busiest up-market bars in town! Excellent choice of bevereage and freindly and knowledgeable staff.
We stayed in one of the Heritage suites this time and we can only highly recommend it!",5,2012,11,26
207,Nice hotel but lacking a little,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights.  Although the hotel was picturesque and the staff were mostly pleasant there was a very unpleasant smell in the lobby for the 2 days we were there.  It was almost as if someone has been ill in the lobby and nobody had cleaned it up properly!  The room we were in was quite grand with fantastic black out curtains.  Unfortunately the towels were frayed and pretty threadbare which is something I wouldn't expect of a hotel of this standard.  Although we used our points to stay in this hotel for free so it was great value I wouldn't pay the steep price to stay here overnight again.  I would however recommend the bars in the hotel,  great atmosphere and great craic!",4,2012,11,23
207,Awesome!,"My two sisters and I brought our mother here for her 70th birthday and we had the best time.We arrived at 2.45 and our rooms were not ready so we went for mojitos in the horse shoe bar (as you do !).Anyway, when we went back we were checked in by Jane at Reception who gave us the great news that as it was a special occasion,one of our rooms was being upgraded to the Eliizabeth Bowen suite ! What a beautiful suite, beautiuful light and lovely views onto Stephen's Green. We went for a beautiful meal in Trocaderos and then returned to find a lovely bottle of wine in our suite.Those beds are amazingly comfortable and as for the pillows, I really have to buy some as the one I have is so flat.But those pillows just give you the best sleep.Next day we left our car there after our wonderful breakfast and did some shopping on Grafton Street.On returning back, it was if we were going home .There is such a homely atmosphere for such a large city hotel it's quite special.All the staff just kept asking did we have a nice time.Thank you to everybody who made our stay so memorable, we really loved it.",5,2012,11,23
207,Great place for a coffee,"I didn't stay there. I just visited the hotel which is the oldest hotel in Dublin and we also avoided a storm. We had a coffee and a great salmon sandwich with potato salad and fennel! Very nice, quiet and relaxing area to take your coffee. When we were leaving we heard live music coming from the next hall, which was probably the piano bar. What can I say? Glamorous!

The lobby and all ground floor areas were well decorated",5,2012,11,21
207,Perfect Wedding !!,"We had the pleasure of hosting our wedding reception in the Shelbourne Hotel in October and it was quite simply amazing.
Our first meeting with Sarah Edmonds, the wedding executive was the start of a fantastic and superbly professional experience and I would go so far as to say, it is because of Sarah that we decided to go with the Shelbourne rather than one of its competitors.
During our meetings with Sarah before the big day every detail was planned and organised for us. The menu tasting was a fantastic experience, the staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble.
On the day itself we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by all the staff at the front door who applauded the wedding party as we arrived.
We were then brought to our amazing suite looking over the green and presented with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne. Sarah coordinated with our families and the photographer and ensured we were stress free.
We were also offered any of the many vast meeting room / stair cases etc to take photos indoors which we took advantage of and were told that the hotel was ours for the day to do with as we desired.
During the evening we had the pleasure of meeting more staff. The banqueting manager on duty was superb, the food was exquisite (still been spoken about) and each individual member of staff was courteous, engaging and professional.
The reception itself was seamless. Sarah had also coordinated with the band to ensure the transition from dinner to music was smooth. 
The bar staff on the night were also fantastic. Funny and engaging guys who knew how to work a busy bar.
We stayed 2 nights and were phoned the following morning to enquire when we would like our champagne breakfast and if we would like it to the room. 
I’m in the process of writing a letter to the hotel and will give the dates involved so as they will know who was on duty but we simply could not fault the service. From the days paper wrapped as a memento to fresh flowers being delivered to our parents rooms along with a framed photograph of us and a lovely hand written card arriving in the room the experience was unforgettable
Even our Marriott reward card was set up for us so we could use our points on our honeymoon.
To conclude – The Management and Staff of the Shelbourne are the best around and they made our wedding the special occasion we hoped for.
Thank you",5,2012,11,19
207,Dublin's Finest,"Having now stayed in all Dublin's 5 star hotels The Shelbourne is definitely the best.5star is about service and getting the finer details right - here this is done to perfection.From the warm greeting at reception with the offer of coffee and cookies to the very welcome hot whiskies handed to us on coming back from an afternoon of shopping.You get the impression that the staff are there to help - there was a slight problem with our hotel safe, I reported to reception and within 5 mins a very pleasant gentleman had it fixed.
Location is fantastic being only 3 mins walk from the shopping heart of Dublin - we enjoyed it so much that we've already planned our return trip",5,2012,11,18
207,Excellent afternoon tea,"Even if you don't stay here, consider making a reservation for afternoon tea. It is so elegant and lots of fun! Delicious tea, sandwiches, scones, and desserts - accompanied with a lovely setting and piano. I took my mom there and she loved it!",4,2012,11,16
207,Grand hotel!,"A beautiful, grand hotel with amazing attention to detail. Wonderful service. We stayed in a large suite that was just so beautiful. The bed was comfy, the furniture lovely and the large bathroom with both tub and shower was a real winner.  Located in the heart of Dublin, you're walking distance to Grafton St complete with many pubs and restaurants but the Saddle Bar at the hotel was very very cool, especially for a hotel bar.  A must stay while in Dublin.",5,2012,11,14
207,"Enjoyable stay, excellant customer service","We stayed in The Shelbourne at the beginning of November.  Its a lovely hotel, very bustling to the point of not being able to find a seat in a public room at 6pm on a Saturday night!  Lovely room, very comfortable bed.  We had some issues during our stay, which didnt exactly spoil the visit, but which we could have done without.  However we raised them with Customer Service Exective 'JD' (the name he gave us not me trying to anonimise him) and we got an excellant response.  We had a fabulous meal in The Saddle Room restaurant.  We tried the Autumn Tasting Menu with accompanying wines.  Our waiter/sommelier Francois was excellant and made the whole meal more enjoyable by his great choices of wine.  Some of the tables were too close together for my taste but we were given another one which I indicated I would prefer.  We will definately return to what I think is Dublin's premier hotel.",4,2012,11,14
207,Best use of Marriott points,"We stayed 2 nights using Marriott points due to late minute bookings.  While late minute booking in off season Southern France and Sardinia, our Dublin weekend stay didn't   We couldn't find decent accommodations for under 150 - 200 Euros.  

So I used my points and loved, loved, loved the Shelbourne.  The check-in was quick, staff profession and friendly.  Our room (top floor, #882) was nicely appointed, great temperature, comfy bed with great sheets and bedding, and a view over the office building behind the hotel.  This was really nice given the sunny weather.  The bathroom was spacious (2 sinks), nice tub and shower and had nice marbel. Towels were showing their age, but were plentiful and included wash clothes, a novel concept in many euro hotels/lodging.

The lobby had a good buzz and the bars looked like fun.  The hotel fits prominently into Irish history which was fascinating to read and also see the famous people who have stayed at the hotel.  Its location is good with easy access to many tourist spots -Grafton Street, museums, St. Stephan's Green, Trinity College, etc.  It also is close to the hop-on/off buses and many restaurants.

We tend to go out for drinks and meals, so didn't use the hotel dining facilties, but menus looked lovely but expensive.   The hotel also has a new spa and pool, but we again, didn't use.

Getting to the hotel is simple, with Airbus probably the most direct route for 10 euro each way or else you can take the 747 bus for 6 euro but it lets you off a few blocks from the hotel.  Taxis are expensive

I would definitely recommend this hotel based on comfort, decor, location and staff.",5,2012,11,14
207,Grand old hotel - turn of the century mattress,"She's a grand old hotel in a fantastic location.  But, the bed in my first room was so bad that I had to switch and the second bed was not much better.  They were also charging 19 Euros a day for internet service per computer. Simply not acceptable in this day and age.",3,2012,11,13
207,Great stay at the Shelbourne!,"We enjoyed a 7 night stay at the Shelbourne in Dublin from August 17-24 2012. We arrived after an overnight flight from Boston and checked in at 6:00 AM. We took the AirCoach from the airport which was wonderful and the stop on Kildaire Street was steps from the front door of the hotel. We knew our room would not be ready but our bags were checked for us and were told that breakfast would begin serving at 7:00 AM. An early morning walk around St. Stephens Green before breakfast was the perfect antidote after a long flight. The staff was wonderfully attentive to all of our needs and were able to answer all of questions throughout our week there. Daily breakfast was included in our stay and it was very good. We even got a copy of the Irish Times to read with breakfast. The location of the hotel is excellent. We were within walking distance of shopping on Grafton Street, the National Museum, Trinity College, Dublin Castle and Christ Church to name a few. The hop on and hop off bus was great for other attractions. We found a great walking tour that was free and we did that the first day to get our bearings. We also did some day trips to the Wicklow Mountains, the Ring of Kerry and the Cliffs of Mohr. Some were bus tours and we found The Irish Rail Tours to be great too. We thoroughly enjoyed Ireland and its people and can't wait to go back!",5,2012,11,12
207,wonderful hotel,"This hotel is amazing the staff are very helpful and friendley, we got there at 6am just off the ferry and they let us have our room early which was a godsend as we thought we would have to sit in the car for hours, the rooms are everything you would expect from a luxurious hotel wehad a light lunch in the lounge and it was very good and the breakfast was good aswell lots of choice, next time we stay here we shall try the resteraunt as the menu looked good. they had just opened their spa and swimming pool this week and we didnt have our costumes but it looked lovely and will try it next time.  The doorman Declan was wonderful. The hotel is very central to everything shops and bars etc easy to walk to.",5,2012,11,12
207,The gym is very disappointing.,"If working out is important to you, the Shelbourne might not be a good choice. It looks like they took two rooms on the second floor and put two treadmills in one (filling the room) and some weights in the other room. I've found better workout rooms in Fairfield Inns in the US.",4,2012,11,09
207,Over the Top for My Taste...,"Don't get me wrong.  This hotel is beautiful and fancy.  But I'm more of a plain old Marriott girl.  As an American walking into the hotel in jeans, I felt a little out of place.  

The interior hallway on my floor smelled a little...funny.  Not bad, but strange.  The room was nice enough, but there were signs of wear that needed fixing.  For instance, there were patched nail holes in the walls that needed sanding and re-painting.  Really?  Just fix it already!

The hotel was quiet and I got a good night's sleep.  Internet service was free, which was good.  However, do NOT eat here.  It's a super rip off!  Even for coffee.  There's a Starbucks and a Costa right around the corner. 

Location of the hotel was excellent - very close to several Dublin landmarks, museums, and the sightseeing busses.",3,2012,11,09
207,Dublin's Diva in good shape!!,"A return visit to this Grand old hotel made me feel rather apprehensive. Would it have settled down after its fairly recent over-glitzy refurbishment?; would it have retained its particular personality....but I need not have worried. Everything about the Shelbourne was charming, from the efficent parking staff, to the courteous and helpful receptionist. Our room on the 6th floor was comfortable and elegant, with a large bath room equiped with Elemis products. The bars were as lively as ever, the food excellent, and breakfast of very particular quality...the freshly squeezed and chilled orange juice the best I have tasted for a while. This is a hotel where people matter - the people who work there, and the guests they look after, and this really makes a difference. One point to note is that it can be noisy. Our quality sleep was interupted from just after 5am by deliveries and services, next time, we will request a room to the front. The Shelbourne is an historic icon of Dublin, working with all of its ancient character combined with 21st century standards of comfort and service. Will be back?...we most certainly will!!",5,2012,11,08
207,Superb in almost every way,"Firstly the negatives.  We found the bed too soft (you almost sank into it) and the room too hot.  There was an aircon unit but it was pretty ineffectual.  Personally I would rather have a cool room that I could make warmer rather than the other way round.

Now the positives.  Everything else!  Superb service, great food (the breakfast is ten out of ten for choice and quality), exceptionally clean and very nice decor and fixtures and fittings.

It's ideally located too.  A five minute walk from the shopping mecca that is Grafton Street, the lovely St Stephen's Green directly opposite, part of the museum next door and some excellent restaurants and bars within a few minutes.",4,2012,11,08
207,A very comfortable night's stay despite some initial glitches!,"While things did not get off to the best of starts, it pretty much improved from then on in. 

When I came to check-in at around 4pm, I was first told that they needed to check whether my room was ready or not. I waited around for a few minutes for this answer to be obtained, but no one from housekeeping could be tracked down and I was then asked whether I would like to wait for a few more minutes in one of their bar areas instead. 

OK, at this stage a complimentary drink would have been nice but none was offered. I was assured that I would get an answer in 5 minutes and that someone would come to get me from the bar. I left my luggage at reception in anticipation of a very brief visit to the bar. (You can probably guess where this story is going already). 

So, 35 minutes later no one has come to get me from the bar, I decide to go back to reception to see what's going on. Someone else is being checked in at the time but eventually someone spots me and brings my room keys over. I notice that my luggage is not where I had left it near the concierge desk but the Bellman reliably informs me that my luggage has already been taken to my room. 

The Bellman then looks at my room number and suggests I take elevator No. 1 to the 6th floor. Unfortunately, elevator No. 1 is the worst possible elevator for my room and is nowhere near it; in fact, to get from elevator No. 1 to my room requires a compass and deep skills in orienteering as the elevator drops you into a maze of corridons and side corridors a considerable distance away from the target room in question. 

Eventually I find my room and its a very nice room indeed but as you might have guessed, there is no sign of my luggage. I duly call down to reception to see what's going on. I get an answer that the Bellman is currently bringing up my luggage and should be there shortly. 10 minutes later I get a call from the Bellman asking me what my luggage looks like! I provide a description and the luggage is eventually found and brought up to my room. And that was the end of the check-in trauma. Note for the record: Elevator 2 was actually the correct one for my room number as it drops you some 20 metres away from it, rather than the 1 km yomp that elevator No. 1 demands.

After that everything went perfectly fine. The room was exceedingly comfortbale and the bed was superb - really relaxing and comfortable. The air-conditioning worked and in-room furniture was functional.

I went for the breakfast buffet in the morning but did not find it to be very vegetarian-friendly; mushrooms, potato bread and tomatoes being the only veggie hot options; some Renaissance hotels offer veggie sausages and such like but not this one.

Overall, I had a very enjoyable stay and would come back again when in the area...

Likes:

The very comfortable bed and lovely room

Dislikes: 

Elevator No. 1

Prices are relatively expensive (room service breakfast is around 35 Euro, dinner for two will take you into 100 Euro country)

Lack of vegetarian meal options",4,2012,11,08
207,Small room good service,"I travel a lot for my work and have stayed in many top end hotels for both business and pleasure over the years. It’s against these experiences I feel compelled to comment on my overnight stay in this hotel. I found the first experience with the staff to be just what you would expect and in deed a little bit more. I was greeted with a smile offers of help with my bags flooded in and my car was valet parked quickly and efficiently.  The hotel was lively and gave a good sense of being comfortable and well run. Check in was effortless. The surprise came when I arrived at my allocated room. It was rather small for a 5 star venue. The bedroom door opened from the corridor directly on to the bed and while the furniture appeared on the most part to be in good condition the wardrobe was a small cupboard of low quality and very little room for clothes. It was hard to access without bumping into the narrow desk. The bathroom did not have room for my wash bag at the sink it had to be placed on the floor and no room for a hand towel to be found so it was crumpled under the sink to avoid the floor! The sink itself was tiny!. To add to this there was a constant hum from an air-conditioning unit though I’m getting picky here! The Shower unit was a good size and completely out of proportion to the rest of the bathroom. The bed itself was fine, not the worst however not the best Ive slept in either. In summary the bedroom didn’t live up to the expectations I had built up and wouldn’t be out of place in a 3 star hotel. So Overall I was disappointed is one way of putting it.",3,2012,11,07
207,Beautiful hotel...fab spot for Sunday brunch,"Spent a lovely afternoon in the Shelbourne for a family Sunday lunch yesterday. Reservation wa made for the main restaurant-the Saddle room, although we noted there was also a less formal Sunday bruch available in No.27 the main front bar, where an excellent jazz band were playing.  Saddle room is luxuriant and elegant. Derek was our waiter and looked after us impeccably.2 course lunch is good value at 24.95- plaice was delicious and dessert of pavlova sublime. Had a drink in No.27 bar afterwards and thoroughly enjoyed the background music.Despite a wet,miserable Sunday the Shelbourne brightened our day.",5,2012,11,05
207,A First Class Experience,We had the chance to spend three nights at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin. It was a beautiful place and well worth the expense.  Almost everything worth seeing in Dublin was within an easy walking distance. The staff was very courteous and helpful.  We hada few minor issues that could have become problems but the staff was great in resolving each and every problem.,5,2012,11,05
207,Flawed gem,"I usually avoid hotel bars, but this one is used by the public and hotel guests alike and is lively, classy and fun. 

Splendid location - halfway between the shopping streets and the (rather bleak and desperate) Georgian squares on the other side of town. The park across the steet is lovely.

The spa was closed - no reductions in price were offered. I found this very disapointing, given that I was expected to pay the full whack  and had been looking forward to using the spa facilities.

Service is generally excellent, though check in was a bit chaotic - we were asked to wait in the bar when we arrived at 15.00 because the room was not ready. 45 minutes later and nobody had come to tell us the room was ready - we asked at reception again and the staffer who sent us away had gone off shift.  Nobody knew why we had been asked to wait or which room was being prepared for us. 

Both rooms were large and well appointed. The extra charge for internet access was a a bit much, considering the price of the room

Vegetarians - forget it. The concept seems not to have penetrated the hotel management's thinking. We ate all our meals elsewhere.",3,2012,11,05
207,Jazz Brunch,"In Dublin from Liverpool for a lads weekend away, and just popped into the Shelbourne for a quick drink during the Jazz Brunch.  Well, I tell you, the band was so good that we ended up staying for the full 3 hours. (And having much more than a quick drink!)  The singer's voice is amazing, and he really had us going with his dry wit.  Next time we're in Dublin we'll be back to hear more, absolutely!",5,2012,11,05
207,Historic and lovely place to stay in Dublin,"I highly recommend staying here while in Dublin.   A gracious and historic property with a convenient location right across from St. Stephen's Green, near Grafton Street and the National Museums of Ireland.   Incredible breakfast in the mornings.   I would definitely stay here on a return trip to Dublin.",5,2012,11,05
207,Fantastic hotel and lovely spa,Hotel was very luxious room was quite spacious and the room service was excellent.  The linens and bedding were quite comforting.  The front desk was very helpful and accommodating.  The spa just reopened upon ou stay and it was very accommodating. Prices for spa services were a bit high.,5,2012,11,04
207,Nice hotel but service only so so,"Stayed at this hotel in Sept2012 for 6 nights. The rooms were nice and clean by far the most important thin in a hotel. Service was not so good. When first checking in it was chaos. I get it the hotel gets many guests trying to check in early caiman in on early morning flights but get it together. Need to be more efficient and nicer just was confusing and long lines took about an hour to check in. Concierge was fantastic though! Received a cheese and cracker tray in my room but the maid wouldn't clear it. Finally had to but it in the hall for them to take their dirty dishes away. The service in the restaurants were very poor don't expect to be waited on - ordered drinks and they sat at the bar we finally had to get up from the table and get our own drinks. The worst was I wrote postcards to send home asked at the front desk where I could buy stamps, she said I didn't need to buy stamps as they would stamp the for me and the post them. Needless to say no one ever received a single postcard I tried to send. Granted I thought it odd they would stamp my cards but she said they would so they should've. Overall ok hotel and I would stay there again but just know you aren't going to get good service. Oh also great location across from St. Stephens Green and close to Grafton Street and short walk to Trinity.
Nks.",3,2012,11,04
207,The definition of elegance,"This hotel has to be one of my favorite hotels - it is perfectly located in the heart of Dublin. Walking through the doors I was impressed by the staff in top hats, the courtesy of the people at the front desk, and the sheer beauty of the hotel decor, chandeliers, etc. Everything about this place impressed us - the room was lovely and the bed was comfortable. This hotel is considered one of the best in Dublin for a reason!",5,2012,11,03
207,Fantastic 5 night stay,"Fantastic in all respects.  Very nice and helpful staff.  Spacious rooms.  Just about the best beds and bedding in all my travels.  Great breakfast buffet.  Perfect location.  I can't speak highly enough. Only negative was that the gym/fitness room is under construction and all that was available was the barest of equipment in very small guest rooms, with no amenities.  I assume that the gym/spa will be great when it is completed.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,11,03
207,Tough to find better,"Not a standard Renaissance/Marriott - this property is a beautifully restored historic hotel in the best location in Dublin.

This was our first stop on a 3 week family trip. There was no trouble getting early check-in - no small thing when your flight arrives at 7 AM.

The staff, to a one, were outstanding. They never failed to go out of there way to make us feel welcome and valued. The rooms are a bit on the small side but are beautifully decorated with every comfort built in - they do not feel cramped in any way. The internet connection was speedy (comped for us as Plat. Marriott Members but VERY pricey otherwise). The bathrooms are very nicely kitted out and seemed quite modern compared to the more traditional bedrooms. They run 2 full maid services each day so the rooms were always meticulously clean.

I love to complain about hotel breakfasts (included with our room) but it was perfect. There was a broad selection at the buffet - even the pickiest among us (even the vegan) was happy. There is also a cook-to-order station manned by 2 or 3 cooks so little wait for custom orders. Try for a table in the back rooms away from the buffet - they have windows onto the street and are much brighter than the tables nearer the front.

The lobby is too small but beautifully done. There are only 2 chairs and 1 small sofa. It was difficult for our small group to congregate there before heading out. We found the main bar a bit too hectic for us - much preferred the low key Horseshoe. The drinks/food menus seemed to be mostly the same in both.

We hated to leave and all of us would love to stay here again.",5,2012,11,03
207,A Great PLace to Call Home in Dublin,The Shelbourne is the perfect place to stay in Dublin but it does come with a fairly steep price tag.  The location is ideal- right in the heart of the City Centre.  You can walk to just about all the major attractions and it's very close to the shopping mega of Grafton Street.  The staff is wonderful- friendly and very helpful.  They often times went above and beyond to be of service.  The rooms are a standard size but the beds are very comfortable.  We even got to watch American football- they have a sports channel to accomodate the American viewers.  Make sure you walk around St. Stephen's Green early in the morning- it is just beatiful.,5,2012,11,01
207,The Best,"I have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions, and I have to stay it is one of my absolute favourites.... and by far, the best in Dublin!

From the moment you enter this hotel, you are surrounded by luxury, welcoming smiles, and some of the best hospitality in the world!  Every experience in this hotel is different, and in a positive way!  

The bar's are fantastic, and always have a good, energetic and friendly crowd, and the staff of this amazing property are turely there to take care of you!

I cannot recommend this property enough...it is not just a hotel, it's an experience!",5,2012,10,31
207,A lovely place,This was a beautiful hotel and the staff were most helpful. The room and hotel were clean and kept to perfection. The only thing that was a problem was the coffee service in the morning was really not a good situation. You had to wait until they brought out this machine which brewed one cup at a time. It took a long time for each cup and at the end the coffee was reallly bad. For the price of the room you would think they would improve on the situation. Also only one comfortable chair in the room.,4,2012,10,30
207,Most comfortable bed ever slept in,"Would go there again just for a good night's sleep. Beds are super comfy and curtains block out light completely - sleep heaven. We were there for 2 nights having attended a charity function . Whereas the fiction room is lovely, it was too small for the number of guests which meant that there was little or no room to manoeuvre and I felt so sorry for the poor waiters having so little space to get in between the tables. Would def return to the hotel but not to a function of that size in that particular room. ",5,2012,10,28
207,Amazing,"My daughter and I had afternoon tea with champagne yesterday in the lord mayors lounge. Wow it was a beautiful room with newspapers and books to browse, lovely music playing. The afternoon tea was gorgeous , I am vegetarian and they made sandwiches specially. Nothing was too much trouble. The scones and cakes all dainty and beautifully presented. A real traditional afternoon tea with a modern touch. The staff were very attentive friendly and welcoming. Just wonderful .",5,2012,10,26
207,Lunch with elderly parents,"I booked lunch with my elderly and infirm parents, and my 15 year old daughter - not an easy combination! From the moment of arrival, remembering my Mothers title, guiding us to an easily accesible table, letting my Father be seen to be in control, and even a little flattery to my daughter - the staff were incredible. An event that could/ should have been so stressful for me was a relaxing and pleasurable joy. I haven't even mentioned the quality of the food - outstanding, and excellent value for money.

We were guided to the bar after lunch for coffee, lively but not boisterous and the mixture of clientele and ages captured the universal appeal of this hotel. I would recommend it ti anyone.",5,2012,10,25
207,A Classic Hotel,"Located in the heart of Dublin, right across from St. Stephen’s Green and just a couple streets away from Dawson Street and Grafton Street, sits The Shelbourne Hotel, which is a Renaissance Hotel by Marriott.

The Shelbourne Hotel has a longstanding history of being one of the best five star hotels in all of Dublin.  In fact, in was voted by Conde Naste Travelers as the Reader’s Choice Award as the top 5* hotel in Ireland, and the #1 hotel in Dublin in 2011.

As you approach the hotel, there is a very friendly doorman who will assist with your luggage should you so desire.  The revolving front door is somewhat small and cramped, however there are side doors to use for those with large bags.

Bar No. 27 is off to the left as you enter the hotel, with a small lounge to the right in which afternoon tea is served.  The Saddle Lounge restaurant is also located on the ground floor.  There is a barber downstairs.

To get to the registration desk is somewhat of a maze.  The lobby area is not large by any means, but is well appointed and elegant.  The Shelbourne Hotel Museum is off to the side of the registration desk, delineating the history of this magnificent property.

Registration was quick and friendly.  There are freshly baked cookies at the registration desk, a very welcome sight.

I was given a king room, which contained one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  The room is quite small and is somewhat of a task to navigate around the room.

There is a small desk on which the TV sits, but it would be very difficult to get any real work done at the desk.

There is a small closet next to the desk, which contains an iron, ironing board and slippers.

The bathroom is quite small, with a small sink and toilet.  Surprisingly, the shower is rather large and contains both a rainfall shower head, as well as a hand held shower head.

 Employees are very friendly and address you whenever you come into contact with them.  The concierge is very friendly and helpful.

Although the Shelbourne Hotel is located in the heart of Dublin, it is situated away from Grafton Street and in a quiet area, which is always a luxury when staying in the center of a city.",5,2012,10,23
207,The Saddle room Restaurant,"This was fine dining at its best. We decided on the 6 course tasting menu with the sommelier's suggested paired wines. Each course was exquisite, the Daube of beef was a culinary triumph and Nisa the sommelier was first class with her selections and information on the pairings. The food, service and overall experience were top class.",5,2012,10,22
207,Entrance unsuitable for wheelchair users,"Last month my husband tool me to Dublin on a trip and he was surprising me with afternoon tea in the shellbourne Dublin . We got there an a very excited me couldn't wait to go through the very posh entrance only to be shown to the delivery entrance a big brown door at the side of the hotel . I was horrified and very upset there was no offer to let me go into the hotel like everyone else I was treated like a second class person. 
I am disabled a wheelchair user and my human rights are that I should be treated the same as everyone else, my human rights were refused and I was degraded in front of many people who were going into the hotel
You don't mention on your hotel information or website separate door for wheelchair users, one of the draws to your hotel is the entrance I was denied that . I feel that I was discriminated against my day was ruined as the experience was not pleasant .i have put a trip advisor review on as I feel others may like to know that they won't go through your grand entrance it is reserved for those who walk. Maybe you could review this and make a ramp or provide a ramp that can be lifted many places do that . Such a pity I will not get to see inside but from the first time I came to Dublin Christmas time I fell in love with your hotel all lights and gorgeous trees just stunning. Someday my hubby said I will bring you to stay there . That day was just a treat as I have been having tests sadly now I have received the results which are very bad .but we won't be coming to stay because we can't get in many thanks mrs b davidson",2,2012,10,21
207,Review for restaurant only,"My mom, sister and I stopped here for the Sunday Jazz Brunch as our splurge in Dublin and let me tell you it was well worth it.  My sister and I got the eggs benedict, she got hers with the ham (which was actually the most mouth-watering prosciutto I've had outside of Boston) and I got mine with the steak which was cooked perfectly and so tender you didn't need a knife to cut it, it was amazing.  My mom had the lamb which was really tender and flavorful.  The drinks are way too pricey but the food is well worth what you spend.  The wait staff were friendly and the Jazz band was really great.",5,2012,10,21

207,Top notch,"Stayed here for a wedding and was above expectations. Very nice location and very classy hotel. Renovations were very well done. From when you arrive to when you leave you are treated like royalty. Wish i could remember front door man name, Greg?, but he was very helpful with where to go and what to see. Wedding at hotel was fantastic and my waiter Finn was awesome, get him a raise!! James did an excellent job running wedding and taking care of everyone who was there. Take in the Horeshoe bar for few pints when there. Will be back soon!",5,2012,10,16
207,5 Star Dissapointment,"Beautiful hotel with all the hype and all the glory, but I don't think anyone from management goes in to actually look at the rooms. Heavily soiled carpets - lots of mold in the bathrooms and parts of the shower head - really gross. First room was beside the elevator that we listened to all night going up and down. They upgraded us and that room was much more quiet, but still had many carpet stains, the mold and dirt again. And the real shocker was that you cannot plug your hairdryer or curling iron in the bathrooms.  You have to go into the bedroom for that - some sort of wierd law in the United Kingdom. We did have high tea one afternoon and that was very nice. If they would spend more time cleaning up the very tired and dirty rooms the hotel would be wonderful.  The lobby of course is georgeous - but beyond that not so much.",4,2012,10,15
207,"Historic, luxury hotel with exceptional service, great location","My wife and I spent four nights at the Shelbourne while she attended a conference nearby. Though it’s somewhat of an historic landmark and our taxi driver from the airport said it “used to be” the best hotel in Dublin, it appears to have been extensively refurbished and we thoroughly enjoyed the friendly attentive service, elegant room, and excellent restaurant.

The Shelbourne is a Renaissance hotel, part of the Marriott chain. Although my wife is a gold Marriott Rewards member and I’m a platinum member, the hotel was 100% full the day we checked in presumably because of the World Cup Qualifying match between Ireland and Germany a mile away. Since I had waited till 6 pm to call and request a complimentary room upgrade, they weren’t able to give us one. They apologized for not being able to accommodate the request but assured us they would do so the next day. Still, our first room was surprisingly luxurious and included a comfortable king bed, desk, sitting chair, mini-bar, mineral water, terry cloth robes, slippers and a large umbrella (needed in Dublin!)—all in top condition. Though another TripAdvisor reviewer commented that the rooms are small, I thought ours was just fine. My newly purchased UK-style power plug adapter was defective, so the reception folks delivered a couple of adapters to our room to use throughout our stay.

The next day, the hotel staff moved our bags to an upgraded room while we were away at the conference. The new room was larger, had a separate shower from the bathtub, a few more bath amenities, and a larger safe. It also had an iron and board which might have been in the first room too but I didn’t notice. The original room was so nice we wouldn’t have minded at all if we didn’t get the upgrade. Neither of our rooms had a view of St. Stephen’s Green, but rather of some other buildings. That was fine for us as we were in the rooms only at night. I think there might normally have been a Heritage Club lounge to use, but we were told it was closed due to construction of a spa. We didn’t notice until we were about to check out that there was a box and sign in the closet that offered complimentary shoe shines.

Our room (and that of a colleague) included breakfast everyday (or perhaps it was because we are elite Rewards members, I’m not sure) in the hotel’s elegant Saddle Room restaurant as well as dinner once during our stay (a promo we found on the Marriott web site for staying two or more nights). The breakfast buffet was extensive with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, sautéed mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, black and white pudding, hand-carved parma (like prosciutto) ham, Irish oatmeal, cereals, fruit, cheeses, salami, fresh scones, croissants, etc., juices, and banana smoothies. In addition, there was a juicer along with a selection of fresh carrots, cucumbers, celery and other veggies. That was a nice touch. There was also an a la carte menu which was complimentary if breakfast was included in one’s stay. Their Shelbourne Benedict (steak instead of ham) was excellent. I’ll write up my dinner in a separate review of the restaurant.

The Shelbourne is located within a short walk of many of the tourist attractions in Dublin—St. Stephens Green, Trinity College and the Book of Kells, the National Museum and Library, Leinster House, Grafton Street shopping, and Sweny (the pharmacy featured in James Joyce's Ulysses). Aviva Stadium was about a 30 minute walk. There is a small museum off the lobby which helps you appreciate how old the hotel is as well as a TV that shows pictures of some of the many celebrities that have stayed there over the years. The free shortbread cookies at reception are really good and baked in-house. The reception staff and concierge were exceptionally helpful and friendly throughout our entire stay.

The bellman offered to reserve a large taxi for our airport transfer and suggested a time well before we would have normally planned. It’s good that he did, as we did not realize that if you are flying to the U.S. from Dublin, you pre-clear U.S. customs and immigration in Dublin, adding considerable time at the airport. Even so, we did not have adequate time to stand in line for VAT refunds and opted instead to get our refunds over the Internet and via mail (the two different refund entities use different methods).

We were given complimentary drink coupons when we checked into the Shelbourne, valid at either of their two bars. Both were quite full (and noisy) most of the time we were there so we weren’t able to use them till our third day. That was the only minor disappointment in an otherwise perfect stay.

Though not inexpensive, if you are looking for luxury, service and location for your visit to Dublin, I highly recommend the Shelbourne.",5,2012,10,15
207,great time,"Rooms clean, nice size, bathroom small, but had a hall bathroom that was larger. Hostess very friendly and accomodating, let us check in early and got up early to make us a filling breakfast for our long journey that day",4,2012,10,15
207,Exceeded my high expectations,"After a very enjoyable afternoon in the horseshoe bar over 10 years ago I was detirmined that I would stay here one day. Sometimes you are disappointed but not this time. Lovely room, upgraded to a heritage room. Very friendly staff. Lots of good people watching. Breakfast very good. Can't wait until next time - I won't leave it 10 years",5,2012,10,14
207,Best hotel in Dublin,"What a fantastic hotel! From the moment you enter this hotel's doors, actually, from the moment you get out of the taxi, you feel like royalty. There is a doorman taking your luggage to the reception desk, they have fresh cookies and lemon juice waiting for you, and the check in is done in less than 5 min. The hotel is very impressive, and it looks like the old days luxury hotels. It is almost like you expect to see Grace de Monaco ( who stayed at this hotel) or some other celebrity having an afternoon tea here. 
The room looks very nice, the bed is so comfortable, you just don't want to leave the room! Just great!  Cannot praise this hotel enough, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.
It is right in the center, St Stephen Green park is just in front, and Grafton street is 5 min walk. Lots of places to shop nearby, including a shopping mall. We have spent a great evening as well in the nearby 37 Dawson street, great food and atmosphere.
Just choose this hotel if you go to Dublin, it is a great hotel!",5,2012,10,13
207,Perfect location for visiting Dublin and taking in the sights,"EXCELLENT HOTEL with PERFECT LOCATION!  

We checked into this hotel on Saturday,October 6th. The hotel allowed us to check in early (~10am) and we were able to unwind after a long flight from Boston and before begining our Irish vacation.  The desk attendents were very polite and accomodating.  We were also able to convert some US currency to Euros for a good rate.  

The rooms were very clean, quiet and large.  The bathroom was also very nice with plenty of towels.  The bed was comfortable and plenty big enough for my wife and I.  

We utilized the conceirge, Alan, both days and he was excellent, helpful, and provided excellent advice for restaurants in Dublin and locations to visit.  Just great!

We also loved the breakfast each morning.  They served a large selection of continental breakfast foods (toast, bagel, cream cheese, hams, salami, cheeses, juices, etc).  They also served plenty of hot choices (scammbled eggs, bacon, sausage, cooked to order eggs, and parma ham).  Everything at breakfast was delicious especially the coffee.

Although we did not have drinks at the hotel bar, there was definitely plenty of beers on tap.

As we plan our next Ireland vacation, we will be coming back to The Shelbourne!",5,2012,10,13
207,"Decent quality, good bar, noisy room...","Maybe it was a one off, but they have a recycling and rubbish area out the back and my room (and many others to be fair) back onto it. They emptied glass after midnight and then there was activity early morning again. Pretty annoying. That said, a decent room, great service and a good bar. Good location near some bars etc (not Temple Bar, which was good for us).",4,2012,10,13
207,Truely Outstanding Experience,"Just got back from a truely memorable week in Ireland celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. used Marriott Rewards points for half the stay at the Shelbourne. We had a deluxe room on side of the building but it was perfect for 2 - a little cozy by US standards.  The bathroom was beautiful (though light/fan switch was outside). They gave us robes and slippers for our stay. Staff were about as helpful, polite and nice as you could ever expect, For 233 euros a night we had complimentary full Irish breakfast each day plus one 3 course dinner for 2 during our stay. Try the high tea, expensive but worth it. Hotel's location at St Stephen's Green was perfect for sightseeing. Life should always be like this. I would also recommend buying the Dublin Pass for all the sightseeing (you save a bundle) before arriving. Pick up the passes at the airport. It includes Aircoach transportation to Kildare Street right next to the hotel. The buses run very twenty minutes.  This has to be on anyone's top 10 hotels if you like old world charm steeped in history where your are made to feel very special. Thanks.",5,2012,10,13
207,Excellence in Dublin,We have been to Dublin twice and both times have had the incredible pleasure of staying at the Shelbourne.  It is a luxurious hotel with wonderful service. The location is perfect for a short walk down to Grafton Street. They offer a wonderful breakfast in the restaurant and the hotel faces St. Stephens Green.  They truly go out of their way to take care of their guests!  We can't wait to go back again!,5,2012,10,13
207,Outstanding hotel & location for exploring Dublin!!!,"Having stayed at a not so nice hotel in Galway, when we walked into the Shelbourne...it was divine! Beautiful lobby, very courteous staff & our room was outstanding with a view of Dublin. Concierge were always polite & extremely knowledgeable;  breakfast meals were fresh & lots to choose from.  For our stay of 3 nights, we never drove our car & simply enjoyed all that Dublin has to offer from our excellent starting point.  The Shelbourne is adjacent to St. Stephen's Green & a few blocks from Grafton Street. We shall stay here again!",5,2012,10,13
207,A wonderful Experience - never to be forgotten,I am so sorry It has taken me until now to put up my review in relation to our stay last January at the Shelbourne hotel.  I can only say that it was a most memorable experience from the minute we arrived at the door of the shelbourne untll the time we left.  The customer service was second to none and all of the staff from the door men to the receptionists to the cleaners to the catering staff were exceptional.  It was my husbands 50th birthday and he had a wonderful stay.  Communication seemed to have filtered to the staff that it was his birthday and not alone were we provided with complementary wine and chocs to our room but we also got an upgrade to a spectacular room.  I only wish we could have stayed longer!  The food in the restuarant and in the bar was also superb.  Thank you to everyone in the Shelbourne for making our stay such a lovely one and particularly for making my husbands special birthday a very memorable one.  We will definately be back.,5,2012,10,12
207,Unpretentious luxury at it's finest,"You really can't beat the location, beauty and charm of The Shelbourne. I have stayed at The Shelbourne a number of times over the past 5 years and it never disappoints. Located right on St Stephens green in central Dublin, you are with walking distance of everything - shopping, eating and many fantastic pubs. The Shelbourne staff are incredibly friendly and willing to help with even the smallest of requests. The buffet breakfast offers a little bit of everything for everyone, whether you are in the mood for porridge, cooked breakfast or something more continental. The hotel rooms can be a bit on the small side, however, each room has such a luxurious feel that it really is not an issue at all. If you are fortunate enough to get an upgrade, you will not be disappointed with adjoining sitting room and enormous bathroom. I am already looking forward to my next visit!",5,2012,10,12
207,"Great service, very comfortable","Here on business.  very large room, bed too soft but only grumble.  food and service first class, having a late night bar with food was very welcome after long day of meetings.  They extended my room when I had to stay over for an extra day, very helpful in dealing with that.  Highly recommended.",4,2012,10,11
207,Disappointing,"My wife and I stayed here for a few nights in mid-September.
Our room was fine and the staff were mostly courteous and helpful. However, in its heyday it was Dublin's finest hotel and sadly this is no longer the case.
The hotel appears to have shifted its focus very much to group bookings, which keep it full but puts pressure on the facilities to the detriment of independent guests. On one occasion, entertaining an old friend to lunch, we were kept waiting for two hours before the main course arrived (and even then, only when I threatened to walk out) because there was a large group in the restaurant who received priority service. To their credit, the hotel (unasked) cancelled the charge for this meal.
The residents' lounge was frequently full with party bookings so we were forced to use the public bars or go elsewhere, which is not acceptable in a hotel in this price category.
Nor is there a dedicated area for smokers: they have to stand outside the front of the hotel.",2,2012,10,11
207,Still Reminiscing About This Hotel,"Although it has been two years since my boyfriend and I stayed at this property, whenever we think bank on our trip to Ireland, the Shelbourne never gets forgotten. The rooms are on the small side, but very comfortable and very pleasantly decorated. The location is perfect- we walked absolutely everywhere we wanted to. The bars were a lot of fun and the breakfast buffett was decadent and probably one of the best breakfasts we have ever had. Can't wait to come back!",5,2012,10,09
207,Excellent stay,"We stayed 2 nights recently for a family gathering.  Rooms were great, classic older style kept clean and with modern amenities.  As others have noted an excellent location near to center of activity, but far away enough to be nice and quiet.  St Stephens green is a nice city center oasis.  In all a good example of getting what one pays for, and a good value in that regard.  Be careful of the minibar!  A feature we were not familiar with tracked item removal automatically; taking a bottle out just to have a look caused a charge even though the item was replaced.  To their credit the staff reversed the charge on discovery at checkout.  Suspect they've seen this before...   We would definitely stay at the Shelbourne again.",5,2012,10,09
207,Excellent hotel!,This hotel is excellent. I particularly like the atmosphere in the bars at the weekends as there is always a buzz. The rooms are nice and the hotel itself is very impressive. The staff are very friendly. I would love to stay here again!,5,2012,10,08
207,Great location,I stayed at the Shelbourne for a week during a business trip.  The location is great for exploring Dublin.  I was able to walk to most sightseeing attractions.  The hotel staff was very friendly and the rooms were kept very clean.  My only complaint would be the mattress.  I would guess they haven't been replaced in a few years.  Both sides of the mattress had visible imprints.,4,2012,10,08
207,"Great location, small room","The location, across from St. Stephen's Green, is perfect. Public rooms are grand. Flower arrangements in the lobby and reception area are spectacular. Shortbread cookies in a bowl at reception are fabulous. The bed was typical Marriott: very, very comfortable. But the room was tiny and had only 1 chair.",4,2012,10,06
207,The best beds in the world.......,"We spent Easter at the shelbourne - the service is amazing all our needs were catered for staff are fantastic.  Denis the concierge made sure we got excellent care and attention where ever we went from restaurants to cycle hire in the park. It had been sympathetically restored and the decor and rooms are lovely, the beds were a problem as the were so comfortable we did not want to get out of them!!
The food was really great and the breakfast was probably the best I had ever had.  We will definitely come back yes it was pricey but the quality was suburb.  And as for the cocktails they were epic.  What we didn't realise is that on Good Friday in Ireland no where serves alcohol - however the shelbourne did serve us as we were having a meal.",5,2012,10,06
207,"Pretty good, but very expensive.","I lived in Dublin for 5 years a long time ago, before this hotel was renovated, and used to occasionally pop in to the Horseshoe Bar when I was feeling flush. It had great charm, accentuated by it's slightly shabby appearance. I always wanted to stay there, and now that I'm older and (very slightly) richer, I decided to splash out. I suppose that I held The Shelbourne in hugely high regard for many years, and when one expects a lot, one is almost always disappointed. Check-in was excellent, although the lobby was a bit.... chintzy. Sort of a very middle-aged feel about the place. This was continued and amplified in our room, which looked like it had been decorated by everyone's grandmother. Horrible wooden furniture that would have looked at home in Southfork (in the original Dallas). However, the room was a good size and the bed was huge. Breakfasts were superb, but again the dining room had a certain feel about it - as if it had been refurbished but the people doing the refurbishment didn't really have a clear idea what they were aiming for. It winds up with a strange feeling of a mixture of extreme formality and trying to be 'down with the kids'. It's like your mother wearing hotpants. Residents' bar is even worse - a totally character-free room with a few tables and soft furnishings which wouldn't look out of place in a retirement home.

However, the historic rooms (ie The Constitution Room) are wonderful and do possess a real sense of epic events having occurred there. The building itself is fantastic, an the staff are certainly attentive and pleasant. There's a crazy idea called a 'Genealogy Butler' which is surely aimed squarely at the American market - which isn't a bad thing, but is just ridiculous. Indeed, the whole place is I think squarely aimed at the American market - again, not a bad thing, but it just doesn't feel like a very Irish hotel. The hotel museum is well worth 20-30 mins browsing. 

So, overall, very expensive and a bit disappointing.",3,2012,10,05
207,A fabulous hotel in the center of Dublin,"We spent our last night in Ireland at the Shelbourne & absolutely loved it. It's centrally located, right across the street from St. Stephen's Green and convenient to almost everything you could hope to see while in the city. The service was impeccable, from the bell staff to the concierge desk and everyone else we encountered. Lots of nice little touches, like the addictive cookies at reception & the variety of international outlets built into the wall of the hotel room.

The room was spacious enough for our whole family of 5, the beds were comfy, breakfast was excellent. Can't really think of anything bad to say about the place.

As we left the next morning, our kids were asking when we could come back and stay at the Shelbourne. I couldn't agree with them more!",5,2012,10,03
207,WOW!!,"What is left to say!!  The location is perfect (St. Stephens Green), the service was TOP NOTCH, the food was great, and the rooms were well appointed & quiet.  We enjoyed out last night in Ireland at this hotel.  A nice finishing touch to our wonderful stay in Ireland.",5,2012,10,03
207,Great location. Nice old hotel.,"No complaints here. The Shelbourne is a very nice hotel in an excellent location. I recommend it based on the location since it's close to everything. Within a few minutes walk you have  department stores, drugstores, restaurants, pubs, coffee houses, souvenir shops, major tourist sights/sites, and the beautiful St Stephen's Gardens. We arrived at Dublin airport, so the convenient AirCoach bus dropped us just a block away from the front door of the hotel. The entrance and lobby are very elegant. The history is interesting and they display a collection of old books and photos. Our room (a basic double) was TINY, but adequate; nothing special (see photos). The bathroom is minuscule; the sink was the size of a mixing bowl, but the shower was large enough (no tub). The room is starting to show signs of age. The large hvac vent cover fell off and scared the heck out of me during the night. The staff was very pleasant and we enjoyed our stay.",4,2012,10,03
207,A Piece of Dublin History,"We spent our last night in Dublin and Ireland here and it was the highlight of our 18 nights in Ireland.  A classic hotel with rich history that has been refurbished and modernized beautifully. Service is superb (the best of world standards), bars and restaurant of high caliber, our room was large enough though not huge and was very well appointed.  It is very conveniently located.  We stayed using Marriott Points, and regular room rates are on the high side.  But this hotel is such a classic, in its history and elegance, that it would be worth it. Great breakfast.  Horseshoe Bar is great for a quiet time. The concierge was very helpful getting us dinner reservations at a great place on a very busy night (Arthur's Day).  All in all, a great experience.",5,2012,10,01
207,Fantastic stay in the heart of Dublin,"We had a very enjoyable two night stay at The Shelbourne. I can't say enough about the service. Everyone we met was very polite and went out of their way to be helpful. The room was extraordinarily comfortable and the breakfast was delicious. The hotel is located very conveniently, with easy access to great pubs, restaurants, shopping and tourist sites. We will return to Dublin and will definitely stay at The Shelbourne. ",5,2012,09,30
207,"Great hotel, fantastic location","Love this hotel, right in the center of Dublin, within walking distance of great shopping area, restaurants etc. Service is excellent. Breakfast is fabulous. Great buzz in the bar in the evenings. Very comfortable bed. Only negative was our bedroom/bathroom was a bit tight for space, but we got a very competitive rate so not complaining.",5,2012,09,30
207,Good but not speechless,"After reading all of the reviews here, I expected more from this hotel. The best part was definitely the bed- it was possibly the most amazing bed I've ever slept in, so HUGE points for that. The downside is that it took up almost the whole room. I was not impressed with the size of the room or the decor for the price of this hotel. The bathroom fixtures were definitely fabulous, but the shower had odd/ imbalanced water pressure. I guess I just expected more...",4,2012,09,26
207,Excellent in the heart of Dublin!,"Stayed 3 night in September for pleasure. Had a heritage room with breakfast included. Room was nice and clean with an old fashioned looked. Bathroom was almost same size as the room. Very warm and comfortable feel. 

Hotel lobby and restaurants were good and busy. Friendly staff overall from day to night.
Breakfast menu and buffet was good. Free wifi was a plus.

Overall very pleasantly surprised.",5,2012,09,25
207,Luxury,"The Shelbourne is old world glamour and elegance.  Everything was perfect, we loved our stay here and can't wait to return!  The champagne afternoon tea is a must as is dinner in the restaurant!  The staff are some of the best I have come across in the service industry!  Location can't be beaten!",5,2012,09,25
207,"Great hotel, great location","very helpful staff, we arrived early from  an overseas flight and the frontdesk let us use a room to relax and shower. Later they called us to let us know that our room was ready.We paid with Mariott points !",5,2012,09,24
207,The best location,"Great hotel with excellent location, where you can reach almost all tourist sites in Dublin. The hotel is nice, good breakfast and very nice bars that are always hot spots on weekends. The staff could be more warm and have more informations about restaurants in town. However a special hotel.",4,2012,09,23
207,wonderful experience,"Beautiful hotel in a great location with a rich history. The rooms were nice with comfortable bed, large bathroom and good closet space. Within walking distance of most areas you want to visit or can jump on off and on bus right outside hotel.  Staff friendly and accomodating  -thought it might be stuffy - anything but.  We enjoyed the restaurant and found the bars a nice place to relax at the end of day. Good food and service yet you will feel comfortable casually dressed.  Obviously we enjoyed our stay and look forward to our next stay.",5,2012,09,23
207,Lovely Hotel right in Dublin,Gorgeous historic hotel right in the heart of Dublin. Our suite overlooked the Park and it was very luxurious with huge bathroom. Nice soft towels and comfortable beds were also a plus. The service was impeccable. We paid with Marriott points which was the best part! We are returning next week at the conclusion of our trip to Ireland.,5,2012,09,21
207,Treat,"8 guys on a golf trip through Ireland and we decided to treat ourselves on the last night in town. Great positioning, excellent service, the room I stayed in (twin sharing) was superb. Breakfast rather expensive if you have to convert ZAR  (Eur65!). Will return.",4,2012,09,21
207,A wonderful place to stay in Dublin,"My husband and I spent 6 nights at this hotel in August.  We enjoyed the location which is across the street from St. Stephens Green ( great for an evening walk after dinner).  During the days we were in easy walking distance of the places that we wanted to visit in Dublin, such as Trinity College and Dublin Castle. The hotel is also close to Grafton Street.   We enjoyed breakfast in the hotel, which was a part of our package deal.  The gentlemen at the desk suggested restaurants for dinner that we enjoyed.  Overall we had no complaints and we enjoyed our trip to Dublin.",5,2012,09,20
207,The Shelbourne,"A much more attractive hotel than its own literature suggests.  We did not use any leisure facilities but it is due to open a spa in a month or so.  All staff were friendly and helpful.  The room was exactly what we had asked for.  The bars are lovely, the cocktails strong and the Guiness good.  Two negatives, breakfast was unremarkable and our the valet parking returned our car with a slight prang on the rear bumper (so slight we did not see it at the time and they may well not have either but must have felt the impact).
Neither sufficent to stop us going back and would stay again when in Dublin.",4,2012,09,20
207,A great hotel in a great city,"As good a location as you could want its a classic Dublin hotel.  I had fantastic service from the reception staff / all the staff, one of the best breakfasts you could get anywhere and the room was very comfortable and gave me a good desk to work from.   I was on a mid week business trip and got a very low price for such a good hotel but the full list prices are high if you ever had to pay for those.   I have stayed here plenty of times before and will be back again!",5,2012,09,19
207,Not worth the money,Arrived tired at 3.40 pm to check in for one night to be told the room was unavailable. The receptionist could see my concern and arranged for a drink at the bar while I waited which was nice. However when I finally got to the room it was cold dark overlooking a courtyard full of barrels and rubbish. Most disappointingly there was no bath and all this for one night for over 300 € . So disappointing . I will never stay here nor recommend anyone to here again .,2,2012,09,14
207,I guess we're spoiled....,"We were in Ireland for a business and pleasure trip. We spent the first four nights at the Ritz Carlton, about 30 minutes outside Dublin, in the County Wicklow. Then we spent four nights at the Shelbourne. No comparison, the Ritz is so much better, it's unbelievable, and considering the Shelbourne is just as expensive as the Ritz, I wish we'd spent all eight nights at the Ritz. We had the Michael Colin's suite at the Shelbourne. It was ok, although the a/c barely worked, it took three calls and over an hour to get a few extra towels, and we were not treated very well when we stopped for tea, after a day of sightseeing. When we got back to our room, I felt like a nice soak in the tub, and when I ran the water, it came out brown. Needless to say, I took a shower. My husband doesn't use body wash, but since the only bar of soap was the size of a half dollar, and was used up after one shower, he had to use the body wash. They never did leave an additional bar of soap. We expected more from the Shelbourne, quite honestly. The concierge was rude, which added to our disappointment. If we ever go back to Dublin, we won't stay at the Shelbourne.",3,2012,09,13
207,Breakfast in the Shelbourne,My friend and I treated ourselves to breakfast in the Shelbourne. From the time we reserved it felt like a special occasion. On arrival we were given one of the famous golden booths for breakfast and the service and breakfast host was impeccable. The hotel really has that old world feel with gorgeous decor. Breakfast was delicious. A really memorable experience,5,2012,09,13
207,Great Hotel at the Center of Dublin,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights leading up to the Navy/Notre Dame Football Game played at nearby Aviva Stadium - a great venue in its own right.  The Shelbourne is an historic and wonderful medium sized hotel with very friendly, courteous and professional staff.  We used the bell service, doorman to coordinate our ground transportation, concierge to book restaurants, hotel bars & restaurants, and interacted with housekeeping.  We were very pleased with their breakfasts and dinner.  We had tea here every day, but did not have formal afternoon tea here. The hotel sits across from St. Stephen's Green and the entire area around it is well kept and friendly.  It is also within short walking distance of many of the city's highlights (shopping, Trinity College – Book of Kells, St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc.)  Guinness and Jameson are long walks and/or bus ride, but there is no shortage of pubs nearby to sample either product.  Common areas were very clean and well decorated.  Hotel had to absorb large crowds as the entire city, including the Shelbourne, were full of Naval Academy and Notre Dame Alumni, parents, and fans.  The Shelbourne performed well.  We were very comfortable here and will keep this hotel on our ""A"" list for the next visit to Dublin.",5,2012,09,12
207,""" Champagne afternoon tea at The Shelbourne"" Exquisite!","Enjoyed a wonderful experience at The Shelbourne,"" Champagne afternoon tea"". Our glass of Moet was served to us and then we were presented with the menu, where the selection of teas to choose from was extensive. There were 4 in our party and 4 pots of tea were served to us in a very expedient manner, our tea was poured ( using a tea strainer of course), our delicately sliced sandwiches then arrived which can only be described as ""gourmet"", happily for us we were offered a second helping!.Our tea cups were constantly replenished with the least amount of fuss. The sorbets were served and our 3 tier cake stand then arrived with warm scones wrapped in linen on the first tier, clotted cream and the best raspberry jam I have ever tasted on the second tier. The top tier the ""piece de resistance"" was decked with macaroons,an edible chocolate cup filled with mouse and 2 other varieties of pastries. The food was divine, the ambience was very relaxing and soothing and the service was efficient. Definitely time for a post prandial walk down Grafton Street,"" Bon Appetit""!!",5,2012,09,11
207,Great Location...but,"The Shelbourne is a legend in Dublin, but a bit of work is needed to make it truly a legend. The property seems to suffer a bit from being a Renaissance hotel- a mid-level plus hotel chain in my experience (some good to very good properties, most pretty average). The location of this hotel is superb- within a 5-15 minute walk of a lot of what you want to see in Dublin and good accessiblity to the rest (hop on/hop off bus stop right across the street). But while the trappings of this hotel are good, it doesn't quite carry through. Rooms are ok but a bit faded though comfortable enough, hotel staff is good but not outstanding, and the food is adequate but not memorable (with the exception of high-tea). We might stay there again if we get back to Dublin but probably would consider some nearby alternatives that we suspect offer a bit more- though they aren't a legend, nor not quite as close to the action. It's too bad another hotel brand with a bit more going for it does not operate this hotel.",3,2012,09,09
207,great hotel - great location - outstanding restaurant,"the title says it all - i would stay there again and again,  The main restaurant was superb for dinner.  Being located right in the heart of Dublin's main area added to the pleasure.  It represented classic elegance in an urban setting.  I also found the concierge desk to be extremely helpful.",5,2012,09,08
207,Old World Elegance,"The doorman in their formal waistcoats offer a warm welcome into the old world atmosphere of the Shelbourne, which is beautiful and elegant. Our room was spacious and had a view of St. Stephen's Green. The breakfast was glorious with a rich array of foods. We met with Helen, the genealogy butler, who assisted in us in our search for ancestors. She is both knowledgable and delightful. The location is perfect for exploring most of the major sights in Dublin. We found all the staff to be friendly and helpful.",5,2012,09,06
207,Fabulous,"This is a beautiful hotel, centrally located, near St. Stephen's Green.  Lots of shopping and good pubs with traditional Irish music all nearby.  Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Loved it!  Valet parking was especially convenient.  Dublin is an amazing city.  Great walking streets.",5,2012,09,04
207,Our first experience in Ireland,"My husband and myself stayed here for 2 nights at the start of our honeymoon. We loved it! Everyone was very helpful , the hotel and room was spotless they treated us like kings! We would stay here again!",5,2012,09,04
207,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The Shelbourne is a beautiful hotel.  It is very well run.  We were able to get connecting rooms at a very busy time, the horse show was in town.  The accomodations were very roomy.  We felt very welcome from the moment we arrived from the airport.  The breakfast was wonderful.  The location was ideal!  The hop on hop off bus is right across the street by Stephen's Green.  You can walk to Grafton Street for shopping and restaurants.  The hotel is very alive and the Horseshoe Bar was a great place to have a drink and end a busy day.  It was a great hotel overall.",5,2012,09,04
207,Very American,"We stayed in the Shelbourne for 5 days in August.  It was the perfect location for us.  Everything is right there.
Our room was fantastic.  We looked into an atrium open to the sky and loved it.  We always knew the weather and could enjoy having the windows open and not worry about noise.
The room was large and clean, but the king size bed mattress needed to be replaced.  When the bed was made, you could see the indentations from bodies there long before us.
However, we still slept very well.
The service at the Shelbourne is excellent.  As many have said the internet is just AWFUL, but everyone solved the problem by not buying the service and going to the lobby.  There was always someone stationed there who would help you.  Almost everyone used this person.  Even in the lobby the internet didn't work.  the poor staff had to constantly apologize (we also stayed at the Merrion where it was included and was fantastic).
The hotel is primarily used by Americans and we are really poor dressers.  It was shocking to see what folks wore when touring.  Oh, but they were comfortable!
The breakfast was fantastic!  The staff were great and the food was excellent.  They really knew what service meant.
I had a small problem and mentioned it.  The Guest relations manager solved the problem and then sent me wine and chocolates.  My biggest regret is that I lost his card and couldn't send hime a thank you.
I almost forgot, the concierges were very good!  We never used one before and they did things I would never have expected.  Then they remembered you and asked how it had gone.  We went to the Plough and the Stars and would have never gotten there without their help!  Plus they never put their hands out for a tip!  They just helped!

All in all, we would return in a minute.",5,2012,09,03
207,Afternoon Tea,I booked an afternoon tea for a large number of people. Every single person had a great time. The hotel catered for special food requirements with the utmost of professionalism and no fuss or bother. I have to say that the service was excellent and the location stunning.,5,2012,09,03
207,Treated us royally.,"If it's in your budget, the Shelbourne is so worth it.  We just checked out after the Notre Dame game, and we cannot stop talking about the service on such a chaotic weekend.  The bar manager, Ivan King, was a saint amongst sinners, making sure our requests were met with a smile and that irresistible Irish charm.  Our room, a king, was ample, and even in this storied building, we did not detect the must some aged beauties like this have.  This luxury does not come cheap, mind you, and try to get a package with breakfast.  I will continue to make The Shelbourne my only refuge in Dublin.",5,2012,09,03
207,Elegance in Dublin,"The Shelbourne is a beautiful and historic hotel. We had a great stay and enjoyed a late lunch at the bar.
We had stayed there years ago and were pleased that the updating did not detract from the ambiance of this great old hotel.
Lovely!",5,2012,09,02
207,Definitely a first class hotel,"Stayed at the Shelbourne in September 2010 for my son's wedding. We were there for 8 days and it is a fabulous hotel in a great area of Dublin, close to Grafton Street and the Temple Bar district.  Breakfast came with the room and was a real treat, if you eat a bit later you won't need lunch.  The buffet included lunch meat, and smoked salmon which my husband ate every day.  The only negative to the stay was that the elevator to our room on the 3rd floor had a horrible smell which I was told was from the sewage running below the hotel.  I started taking the stairs (could use the excercise anyway) which solved the problem.
The hotel is pricey but worth every penny.  If you are in Dublin and stay else where you should plan to visit and have a drink in the downstairs bar which is gorgeous.",4,2012,08,29
207,A Special Venue,"When my husband and I were invited to a wedding in this hotel, I was excited to have an excuse to stay here, although it is not that far from our home. I have often visited the restaurant or bar for special occasions but had never stayed overnight.

I reserved a room over the telephone to avail of a special discount for wedding guests. The whole process was very straightforward.

The check-in process was easy too, with the minimum of forms to complete.

Although, I had requested a non-smoking room, the room we were allocated smelled quite badly of the previous occupant's smoke. As we were attending a wedding, we didn't have time to complain or change rooms but it did spoil an otherwise positive opinion of the hotel.

The service throughout our stay was exemplary and the food was excellent. 

One small niggle - if your staff wear white cotton gloves as part of their uniform, they should be spotless. I noticed several grubby pairs of gloves.",4,2012,08,28
207,they know what service is!,"A warm greet is not standard anymore nowadays when you enter a hotel, however these people know how to welcome a guest. Great stay, very nice room (a bit old-fashioned), but nice. The bar is also a good place to be (had a guiness of course).",5,2012,08,28
207,Perfect Location,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for the first 3 nights of our trip to Ireland.  Only a 25 Euro cab ride from the airport, walking distance to shopping, food and pub, 3 minute walk to the Hop On Hop Off bus.  The very large breakfast buffet was included in my rate and was very good.  WiFi worked well.  Good size rooms and Marriott bed.  Would stay again.",4,2012,08,28
207,A fabulous hotel and a perfect location,"This really ought to be a 4.5.  The hotel is stunningly beautiful both outside and in.  It sits right on St. Stephens Green with close access to the most beautiful and interesting parts of Dublin.  The various lobbies and drawing rooms are so classic and beautiful.  The bedrooms are lovely and nicely appointed.  The same can be said for the bathrooms with rich marble and tiles.

Additionally, the beds were so comfortable with exquisite pillows and linens.  We received excellent and friendly service throughout our stay.  The workout room was of low quality.  Additionally, the breakfasts were perfect with chefs preparing anything you would want.

My only caution is we had the worst meal of our trip at the hotel (lunch).  Everything else was great.",4,2012,08,28
207,"Wonderful hospitality, great location","My wife and I stayed our final 2 nights of a 2 week Ireland trip here and were very pleased.  We thoroughly enjoyed chatting with both concierges, who we relied on their advice for local flavor in meals and touring.  Their recommendations were right on for what we asked for.  All staff were friendly and courteous.  Location and atmosphere were excellent.  My only negative was the Internet fee.  After staying all over Ireland in b&b's for less than half the price with free wifi, we passed on the 20 euros for 24 hrs. ...a 
minor inconvenience.  All in all, a wonderful experience.",5,2012,08,28
207,Perfect location for a perfect holiday!,"This was our first time to Dublin and the Shelbourne was perfect. It is located next to the picturesque St. Stephen's Green  and  is within walking distance to The Trinity College, The  Temple Bar area, Dublin Castle and the Grafton St. shopping district.  From the moment the taxi pulled up and the bellman open our door, the Shelbourne never disappointed.
After traveling all night  and arriving in the early morning, the front desk accommodated  us with an early checkin. The room was quiet and the large king bed very relaxing after a long, tiring night's travel.
The staff were friendly and attentive to our every need. There was even have lemonaid and cookies at the front desk at check in.The tuck down service with fresh mineral water and chocolates at  our bedside each evening is a nice touch. After three nights stay, we are looking forward to our next visit.
Highly recommended for your next stay in Dublin.",5,2012,08,27
207,Disappointing,"Despite the fact that it's a 5 star hotel, I somehow was never overly drawn to the Shelbourne, despite it's obvious old world charm which normally really appeals to me. So, we decided to check it out for afternoon tea last weekend. When we arrived early for our reservation we were shown to our table while the waitress set the table. Being a vegetarian and slightly fussy eater I wasn't overly enamoured by the choice of sandwiches on offer (egg and cress, smoked salmon) so I asked the waitress if the chef could do me some plain salad (lettuce, tomato, cucumber and onion). She said she'd ask the chef who said yes but said that as the sandwicheds for the afternoon tea were already prepared it would take longer to prepare mine. I had no issue with this as we were in no rush. The te arrived first followed by my boyfriend's sandwiches approximately 5 minutes later. Mine arrived a couple of minutes after that. By this time the tea had gone slightly cold, which is a real pet hate of mine. I cannot understand why the tea is always served before the food arrives - who wants to drink cold tea with their food? I asked for more tea and a glass of water. The tea came 5 minutes later but no water. Oh, I forgot to mention we'd ordered a bowl of chips, which we had to remind them about. I asked the waitress a 2nd time for a glass of water, which again never came. I was luckier third time round! All in all the food was really nice but the service was very erratic. I've had afternoon tea in the Westbury many times and it seems to run like clockwork but it felt like no-one really had their own ""patch"" in the Shelbourne. We really enjoyed it but something was missing and sometimes you can't explain why a place doesn't do it for you.",3,2012,08,27
207,Perfectly Situated,"My husband and I are returning home after a 3 day break in Dublin. The Shelbourne is situated opposite St Stephens Green and within a 5 minute walk of Grafton Street and all it's wonderful shops. Also opposite are the Dublin City tour buses, a green one and red one. We chose the red one purely because they got to us first. For 18 euros each your ticket is valid for 2 days and you can use it as many times as you like. It runs on a loop around the main attractions in Dublin, including The Guiness Storehouse, Trinity College and all the wonderful Cathedrals. Well worth it. Back to The Shelbourne, firstly it's impressive. Beautifully designed and very well run. The staff are helpful and nothing is too much trouble. We ate in The Sadle Room on our first night and both of us enjoyed a fantastic meal. Again, the staff were excellent. Our room was bright and airy and spotlessly clean. The bed was so comfortable neither of us wanted to get up! With the buffet breakfast you are spoilt for choice. Everything about this hotel is great, we cannot fault it and will definately return. I have loved every minute of being in Dublin. The people are incredibly friendly and it's a buzzy vibrant city with lots to see and do. The food is excellent too.",5,2012,08,27
207,Cannot Fault This Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for three nights.
The Shelbourne is a wonderful luxury Hotel, perfectly situated for exploring Dublin.
Tour buses leave from St Stephens Green and most of the sights are within comfortable walking distance.
There is and interesting little museum inside the Hotel which tells of its illustrious history and famous people who have stayed there.
We arrived early (1130) expecting to have wait for our room and although check in is officially 1500 hrs, the charming receptionist assured us the room would be ready for 1200.
Our room was lovely, beautifully decorated and with an exceptionally comfortable bed
Obviously a lot of thought had gone into providing everything a guest could need - tea making faclities, water, brolly, iron etc.
The walk-in shower was spotless, complimentary toiletries were excellent and the towels were fluffy.
Could not fault the breakfast either, quality ingredients provided and plenty of choice including Al la Carte.
The staff are attentive without being overbearing, nothing is a bother to them.
Downstairs, the bar is lively and again, everything is aestheically pleasing.
Fantastic Hotel. Pricy, but worth it!",5,2012,08,26
207,Utter Shock and Dismay....Dreadful Service,"On a recent family weekend to Dublin we decided to pop into the Shelbourne for a drink in the bar. The youngest of the party had recently turned 18 so when asked, we politely assured the waitress that we were all over age. The 18 year old had left her ID in the car, and since she was a pioneer and therefore would not be consuming alcohol, we did not think this would be a problem. Furthermore, both parents were present, and since we were in a hotel we did not think  not having the ID would cause a problem. The young waitress left to ""speak with the manager"" and when she returned, she firstly asked if we were residents of the hotel, which we were not, and then said ""we cannot serve anyone without ID."" This is a fair point. However, I wonder how if we were members would have changed the situation. I was angry at the manner in which we were therefore forced to leave...she could have offered us the alternative of sitting in the lounge - which she did not. Also, I was angry at her refusal to take our word (the parents are almost 60 years of age) and also at her assumption we would be consuming alcohol. I have read in recent years the Shelbourne has lost money and I sincerely hope this will continue, since you have refused 50 euros from decent people. I will not be returning, and I hope no one else avails of your impolite, unhelpful and positively rude staff. You have belittled the public and hurt all of us.",1,2012,08,26
207,Great for tourists,"Right in the middle of downtown Dublin. About a $20 taxi ride from DUB airport. Plenty to see within walking distance (Dublin Castle, Carroll's souvenir shop, & Irish Pubs abound).  Five euro cab ride to Jamison's distillery or Guiness brewery but walkable if you want.  Good breakfast and club lounge if your a franchise card member. If not, just wait and eat outside. Fair gym.",4,2012,08,26
207,Best location in Dublin,"Having stayed in a few different hotels and areas in the city before I can honestly say the location of this hotel can't be beat. 
While the room was on the small side it was very clean with a new modern bathroom and everything you would need. The bed is in of the most comfortable I have ever slept in in a hotel. 
If you are looking for a bargain look elsewhere but if you want a classy hotel near everything you are looking to do then book here. ",4,2012,08,25
207,Room not up to scratch,"Excellent staff, friendly and highly attentive. downstairs area of hotel beautiful and sophisticated. lovely ambiance in bars.However the room my daughter paid nearly 250 euros a night for, was 3 star at best. windows and sill were FILTHY, very ordinary decor,depressing old fashioned. towels were tiny.tv was slow to operate.and unreliable. wi fi not complimentary. drinks severely over priced. hot buffet breakfast inedible, even though pastries and tea coffee were of good quality. Very disappointed as this was a present for our anniversary.",3,2012,08,25
207,Pampered,"Last three nights in Ireland spent at the Shelbourne.  Exceptional staff, wonderful beds and great location. Loved the bar, which was packed on friday night. Deserving of a luxury hotel.  Friendly staff were extremely helpful. Don't like the funky showers, but found it at other hotels so must be a local thing.",5,2012,08,25
207,"Incredible Location, Excellent Service","We stayed here during our tour of Ireland.  It was fabulous.  After touring Ireland and staying at many bed and breakfasts, this was the final three days of our trip.  The staff were incredible.  The location was perfect for a tourist.  The suite was beautiful.  (We booked a standard room, but as Platnium members they upgraded us to a beautiful suite.)  We were very thankful as it was also our wedding anniversary during our stay!  Breakfast was delicious.  We were originally seated in an open area of the restaurant with many tables with a lot of activity and requested a booth in a seperate area.  We had a bit of a wait, but were very happy with our seating. Worth the wait!   In the evening, we spent time in the lounge which was also enjoyable. I wouldn't stay anywhere else on a trip to Dublin.",5,2012,08,23
207,Shelbourne the great!,"Just spent several nights at the Shelbourne - what a fantastic hotel. The room with king-size bed was very comfortable. Service at the hotel is superb and very friendly. The breakfast buffet is a work of art and the food extremely tasty. We also dined in the restaurant and were very impressed with the excellence of our meal, which was not too expensive. Only gripe is with the air conditioning which does not work well, resulting in the bedroom being overly warm and no ice machines! Apart from that, would thoroughly recommend this hotel. In fact, we have already booked another visit there in May of 2013. The hotel is so convenient for getting around the city and the concierge is extremely knowledgeable and his information can be relied on.",5,2012,08,23
207,Really great Hotel in Dublin,"cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel, starting with the doorman all the way throught he diningroom staff.  Everyone could not be more willing to assit us in anyway, after checkign in and our room was being cleaned (we were early they checked our bagfs and sugested since it was noon a couple of places to eat lunch to get some of the Dublin atmosphire and they were right on.

Upon returning we were greeted by Name and the room was redy and waiting for uw with our bags in the room

cannot say enough about this hotel except to say anytime I ma in this area again I will be in this hotel",5,2012,08,23
207,Great location in the city,"This historic hotel has been a fixture in Dubln for decadesl  We arrived to find exaclty the room we had requested ready for us with a nice view over the park across he street.  Room was evry spacious with tea making facility but only l comfy chair for the two of us.  Nice Desk space and the MOST comfy beds ever.  Bathroom was beautifully refurbished with marble everywhere and great free-standing shower but no  exhaust ventilation which was a negative.  Housekeeping was spotty. Breakfast offers a buffet and anything to order.  Staff is wonderfull and attentive solving eevry problem and offering good directions and suggestions.  We were in the older sectin of the hotel...friends in the new section found the rooms smaller but adequate. Wireless service is available in lobby areas but the ""business center"" computers are outrageously priced for time but they offered some complimentary time when I objected to the cost.",4,2012,08,22
207,Unrivalled Location,"On a sunny day with St Stephens Green across the road it would be very difficult to find a nicer venue for a family event.
 The welcome from the Manager in charge was special and the lady who served our table was the most considerate and could not have done another thing to make a special evening even more special.
The bedroom was decorated beautifully and breakfast was enjoyed totally--if a little chaotic.
but hotel was full so it all added to a great athmosphere",5,2012,08,22
207,Beautiful gem of a hotel; convenient location,"Stayed here as a couple in December 2011 for a long weekend.  The hotel is located right on St Stephens Green--basically in the center of everything--Grafton  Street, Temple Bar, museums, Trinity College, great restaurants, etc.

The hotel was decorated beautifully for the holidays-- a great mix of the traditional and modern.  The bar/restaurant areas were very stylish and seemed to attract a well-heeled over-40 crowd nightly while we were there.  The reception area, while small, was attractive and functional.  Our check in was fine.  Our first room had a smoke odor (a smoke free room) so we went out to breakfast (Bewley's--yum!) and when we returned they gave us a new room.  So not a big deal.  The room was good sized, not huge, with traditional decor and plenty of storage; a balcony overlooking an office building with a tiny bit of a roof view.  The weather did not really permit us to spend a lot of time out there anyway.  The bathroom was large and well-equipped with nice amenities.  

While we didn't use many of the hotel's service, every interaction we did have with service folks was pleasant and professional.  I almost gave if 5 stars but I feel that we just didn't utilize the hotel enough to judge that.  We did not have any meals in the hotel but did have drinks in the lounge one night which was great-- their ginger tea was fantastic!  

The only thing we noticed in the negative was that the outside of the hotel was beginning to look worn in spots which detracted slightly from the luxury image of the hotel but I suspect they will look to take care of that soon.",4,2012,08,21
207,Great location but I don't see the big deal,"Unbeknownst to us, the Shelbourne is a big deal among Dubliners, with literally everyone we know in Dublin commenting multiple times about how we were staying there and how great that was and on and on. We literally chose it because we are Gold status with Marriott and The Shelbourne is a Marriott property. 

Anyway, the location and the service were fantastic. The room was old, small, noisy and dirty. For the price we paid I would expect much better. I am not sure what the big deal is other than that a lot of famous people have stayed there, but I wouln't waste my money if I had to do over again. ",3,2012,08,21
207,Absolutely wonderful!,"There are not enough superlatives to describe our stay in this beautiful property. The location is superb, close to everything you could possibly want to see or do.  The staff is the very best; helpful doesn't even begin to cover it, and so very lovely and friendly.  We arrived from a terrible experience at another hotel in Dublin, were initially dismayed to learn that the double room we had booked was not large enough to accommodate our family of four.  We were immediately put at ease, however, when were upgraded to a king room which would fit the two additional beds we needed.  The room was gorgeous and luxurious.  We were all on wireless devices, and had no problems at all.  Breakfast should be like this everyday!  We will definitely be back to this amazing hotel in this wonderful city.",5,2012,08,20
207,Nice Hotel - Excellent Location,The Shelbourne is an excellent Hotel.  The rooms are nice size for European rooms.  The staff was extremely friendly especially the concierge Dennis.  The main bar is a great place to go and  have a few drinks.  Is pricey but the atmosphere is good.  There is a quiter bar on the other side of the lobby.  The main bar is hoping on Friday afternoons.  The hotel is also located about three blocks from the Grafton street shopping area.  The hotel only has valet parking and its 25 Euros a day.  The only complaint was that the internet was 9 Euros an hour unless you used the internet in the bar area which was free.  That said the beer in the bar was around $9 usd.  A hotel this nice can afford to offer free internet in the rooms.  All in all we enjoyed our stay and the location of the hotel..,5,2012,08,20
207,Phenomenal Hotel!,"Very elegant, old-style hotel with terrific customer service.  Every employee we passed greeted us and made us feel very welcome.  Be prepared for top hats and tails for the doorman, great concierge, attentive bellmen, a comfortable lounge, very upscale bars (no sports attire!).  The breakfast is pricey but the buffet is extensive, no continental here.  The hotel is centrally located, most of the tour busses stop here or just across the street along St. Stephen's Green.  Well worth it!",5,2012,08,20
207,Can't Beat the Location,"It would be hard to find a better location to base a Dublin stay, and the beds are very comfortable, particularly after some rural B&Bs (which were great in their own way, but not this level of physical comfort). It is a shame that the WiFi that a modern traveler depends on was either nonexistent or at an extra 20 euros per day per room (I was paying for three rooms). The main bar was a great people watching spot and obviously a favorite with the after work crowd as well. Recommended but give us our Internet without having to mill about near the entrance to the bar!",3,2012,08,20
207,afternoon tea,"just had afternoon tea yesterday with my mum. i have been before but it was my mothers 1st time. i have to say just how much we both enjoyed are afternoon. the staff where just lovely and everything connected with the afternoon tea was just 1st class. 
I would highly recommend The Shelbourne for a afternoon tea not just as a treat but as an enjoyable experience. Can`t wait to return soon. 
Heather Blake.",5,2012,08,20
207,Definitely a 5-Star Hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights in June 2012.  Everything about the hotel was fantastic.  The staff was so helpful, especially the concierge who guided us on a daily basis throughout Dublin and the surrounding area.  The room was extremely clean and well laid out with very comfortable beds.  We would recommend hanging out in the ""guests only room"" for a late night tea and dessert.  The location was perfect and within walking distance to all of the main areas in Dublin.  We would highly recommend staying here because it is truly a 5-star hotel.",5,2012,08,19
207,Excellent hotel and customer service,"I have stayed here on serveral occasions, some for special anniverary and some just for leisure to visit the local restaurants. From the minute you step inside, the the front desk staff are very helpful and go out of their way to accomadate you. I dealt with Jane, who made sure everything from Room allocation to check out was so simple. This service is the reason I come back and recommend friends to the Shelbourne. I will be visting again in the coming weeks and look forward to the atmosphere in the bar area,and excellent food in the Saddle room restaurant.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody as the warmth of friendly service makes you feel at home.",5,2012,08,19
207,A night in Dublin but,"We stayed 1 night in July in this hotel.we had a beautiful suite ,although the hotel has been refurbished it is still very oldie worldie,.
Big disappointment is the breakfast for 29 euros it is inedible,
Porridge awful,fruit very limited,cereals very much what you would expect in a motel,not a 5 star 
And then you had to queue to take a buffet Irish breakfast where everything was lukewarm.
The last thing is Internet.....there is none in your room,it is only available in the lobby and for a fee.....hardly 5 star....",3,2012,08,16
207,Disappointing Experience for Marriott Platinum Guest,"Although I don't expect a suite as a Platinum Marriott member, I expect somewhat of a special room. My wife and I are currently guests of the hotel. We were placed in a room on a low floor (second floor) even though are profile says ""high floor preferred."" The person that assigned us our room assured the view of the ""courtyard"" was better than that of the outside of the hotel. B.S. There is a low wall outside our room that blocks a view of the courtyard, so all we see are windows on the other side of the courtyard. 

The room is unremarkable. It's small (I understand this is a historic hotel, but still...) I was not greeted as a ""valued Platinum guest"" by the front desk, which is part of the Marriott script. 

I have a return visit scheduled for a week from now, after a car tour of other places in Ireland. I am seriously considering canceling our reservation at this point. I have experienced wonderful stays at other Marriott properties as a Platinum member, especially outside the U.S., but this is not one of them.",2,2012,08,16
207,afternoon tea gift.,Booked afternoon tea for my brothers 70th birthday on June 23rd 2012. I told the girl that he was travelling over from England to celebrate and was assued the hotel would do something special which i assumed would be a cake or some acknowledgement of the occassion. Whilst the tea and champagne was wonderful no mention was made of his birthday. One might be forgiven for thinking that the hotel would has been able to have iced 70 on a little cake when you consider the cost. The e-mail i sent to the hotel later was totally ignored. Not a very good impression. Cath Manchester,4,2012,08,16
207,Shelbourne Hotel Dublin Wedding Venue,"We got married in the Shelbourne Hotel last January 2012. We had the wedding ceremony in the beautiful Constitution room where Michael Collins drafted the new Irish Constitution. We had a drinks reception and then an excellent luncheon afterwards. The setting was beautiful, beside St. Stephen's Green in the heart of Dublin and the organisation by the Shelbourne wedding department was absolutely super. In total, it was a wonderful experience and we would highly recommend it!",5,2012,08,16
207,"Excellent customer service!!! Beautiful, historical property!!","Great stay at The Shelbourne. The staff is professional and kind.  Absolutely stunning historical property in lovely location next to St. Stephen's Green.  I did have some trouble with the internet and talked to the provider, but apparently they are soon switching to a new company.  Also a new state of the art spa is being built and will open in the fall of 2012.  Unfortunately it was not available for this stay.  Overall, The Shelbourne is a fabulous choice with attentive and professional staff.  Rooms super clean and comfortable!",5,2012,08,14
207,Vintage hotel,"We stayed at the Renaissance for the one night that we had in Dublin. The service by the doormen and reception desk was great.  We dropped off our stuff in the nice, clean room and left to explore the city. We cranked up the air conditioning before we left but unfortunately when we got back at 1 am, it was still hot in there. It was late so we didn't call the desk. This would be our only complaint. The breakfast buffet or a la carte (you could do either one) was delicious.",5,2012,08,14
207,"Great staff,but wireless leaves lot to be desired","Loved hotel; hated Internet access.  Only took iPad.  No wireless in rooms or hardly anywhere in hotel....not even in a meeting room I used for private meeting.  Will not stay here again. 

Had advantages of location, nice staff...not enough

207,Absolutely Superb,"This was my first visit to Dublin with two friends and have to say that we will be returning again and staying at the Shelbourne!!!!!!!!.
The warmth and friendliness shown by absolutely every staff member without exception was outstanding.. Nothing was too much trouble.
This beautiful hotel is in a great location,,spotlessly clean, wonderful food and the room was very very comfortable.. And as for the bed and those pillows,well what can I say!!!!!!!!!! I have never ever slept so well,even at home!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This great service even continued after I returned home when I spoke to the Guest Relations Manager to help me find those pillows. Many thanks Raphael.",5,2012,08,13
207,Great Location & Impressive Entrance,"On taking a step up to the entrance we were helped with our luggage by the doorman and taken to reception. Check in went fine but when my card was taken for guarantee/other services etc it was declined, fortunately my husbands was fine. This alarmed me as there should not have been a problem which I told the young lady (Eliza??) She did not offer to contact the company. When I got to the room I called my bank (at my expense) to be told that there was a record of the card being declined , twice and that the hotel had entered an incorrect expiry date - twice!!!!   When I informed the young lady later she did apologise nor even seem to appreciate why the card being declined might alarm me - I would be using this to shop and eat etc on my visit. This immediately took the enjoyment out of the trip as I was really annoyed with her lack of understanding.
The room was a deluxe double, I would not describe it as deluxe , just a standard as found in other good hotels. It was clean and fine for the three nights we were there. The bed itself was comfortable. 
The breakfast is very good with lots of choice. The service at the tables was variable as staff did not appear to have their own tables and we waited quite some time for say toast to be brought to the table. Air conditioning within the breakfast areas would be a welcome addition as I heard several people complain about the temperature and lack of air. 
We had lunch in the Saddle room on our last day and this was very nice.
I would say that there is a difference with service and attentiveness  depending on how you are dressed which in this day and age is rather regretful. They should know not to judge a book ....etc.
The location itself is excellent . 
Do not hesitate to turn right out of the hotel and walk down to some of the more traditional pubs such as Foleys and Toners where you will get a great pint of Guinness and some music .",4,2012,08,12
207,"Ok, but admin errors and extortionate breakfast","Rooms are nice enough with comfortable bedding and good if old school bathrooms. Good location, and highly recommend a jog in st. Stephens green.

Main issues were erroneous items on bill (car parking, Internet), and cost of breakfast (29.5 euros).

Only stay here if you get a good corporate rate (typically unde 140 euros).",3,2012,08,12
207,Beautiful property in a great location!,"The hotel is right across from St. Stephen's Green, and just down the street from Grafton St. shopping.  The Hop On/Hop Off bus leaves from just down the street, and you can purchase tickets from the concierge in the lobby.  We only had 2 days in Dublin, so it was a great way to see many of the highlights of the City.  We were very impressed by our room!  It had 2 Queen beds, a generous sized closet in the hallway leading to a beautiful marble bathroom with full bath and shower.  The window was small, but had a lovely view.  The floor creaked as you walked towards the bathroom, but I do know the age of this property, and found the blend of history and age charming, as all the modern amenities were available at this property as well.  Our breakfast was included in the room rate, since we are Marriott rewards members, and we really enjoyed having the choice to have the buffett or a la carte.  The breakfast was very good, and the service very good as well.  We did not have tea, or dinner, or drinks at the hotel, as we walked to Temple Bar area each evening for dinner there.  The Front Desk and bell stand was very efficient and professional, but I did feel a bit slighted by the concierge.  I saw him attend to other guests in a professional way, but when I approached to ask a question, he seemed to barely give me any attention.  His full attention was not on me at all, and when I returned a short time later to buy my Bus ticket from him, I basically performed the transaction for him.  He wasn't certain of the price, or that he had the money to give me change.  I told him the amount, added it up, and then sorted the money out from this envelope, and he did thank for handling that for him.  I was dressed in a less formal way, as we were going to be touring all day, and felt that maybe if I was dressed up to sit and have tea, or dinner that I might have been treated in a more formal, professional manner.  He wasn't rude, just not engaged in a professional way with my daughter and I as guests.  I would recommend the hotel as the rest of the staff was very professional and attentive, and the rooms very lovely and the location is fantastic!",4,2012,08,11
207,3* Hotel for 5* Rates,"We planned a special weekend in Dublin  and since we usually stay with Marriott, so we chose The Shelbourne. The location is perfect. The hotel is expensive and run down. The entrance is beautiful so you expect your room to be also. The rooms are small and we had an upgrade. The rugs are old, worn and dirty. My opinion is that Marriott needs to stop renovating lobbies and start on the rooms. We are here now and will be for 3 more nights. I am hoping the location makes up for what the hotel is lacking. I do not recommend this hotel unless one only cares about location.",3,2012,08,09
207,"Shelbourne, Dublin","We stayed in a 2 bed room and enjoyed the fine amenities of this grand hotel. The Concierge was extremely helpful with our numerous questions. Across the street from St. Stephen's Green, just blocks away from Grafton Street and Trinity College, the location was wonderful. We literally walked out the hotel and climbed on the hop-on, hop-off bus which whisked us to all of the sights we wanted to see.The only negative point was that we were charged for wi-fi service.",5,2012,08,08
207,Beautiful Hotel,"This is a truly lovely hotel in a fantastic location in the heart of Dublin, we stayed there in February 2010 for 3 nights.  Stayed in a King-sized room, with views of the Wicklow (?) mountains. The room was spacious, good bathroom if a little dark. Breakfast was terrific but pricey if not included in the hotel rate.  The horseshoe bar is worth a visit for a drink. The only reason I would not give 5 stars for this hotel is I feel it was let down a little by the staff who are impersonal and aloof",4,2012,08,08
207,A piece of history in an elegant hotel,"We have stayed at The Shelbourne two different times, once before the renovation and the second time was two years ago.  The hotel sits across from St. Stephens Green and during the 1916 Rebellion a person could sit in the hotel and have tea while watching troops in the Green.  This is a beautiful hotel although a little pricey for a long stay.  I only wish Marriott Rewards would allow members to use points for a stay.",5,2012,08,07
207,My Kind of Place......,"Just returned from 4 days in Dublin and had a fantastic time.  The Shelbourne is in a great location close to all the sights which are easy to walk to.  The hotel itself is beautiful, grand and historic.  We were on a breakfast package and it proved to be a great choice with both buffet and a la carte options included.  We had afternoon tea in the beautiful lounge and I have to say I have sampled many afternoon teas in many 5 star hotels and this was one of the best. Lunch in the bar was also very good and cocktails in the evening-superb.  The room was quiet and spacious with a beautiful marble bathroom and quality bath products.  I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.  When I return to Dublin this will be my hotel of choice.",5,2012,08,06
207,Gorgeous Hotel,"We ended our 3 week vacation at the Shelbourne and had a wonderful experience.  The only complaint was that they charge for Wi-Fi for each device.  So if you have 2 iPhones, an iPad and 2 laptops, you're looking at 100 Euros a day!  This seems a bit antiquated in this day and time.  Because my husband needs Wi-Fi to keep up with work, this really impacts where we will stay when we travel.  Apparently, their contract is changing this month, so hopefully the next time we return it won't be an issue.  Otherwise, everyone was very helpful, the service was great and the room and bathroom were heavenly.",5,2012,08,01
207,"A truly unique, wonderful and memorable experience","My husband and I got married in May 2012 and had our wedding reception at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin. Myself and family also stayed in the hotel in the lead-up to the wedding as well as afterwards. I can't begin to vocalise what a truly magical experience it was. Sarah Edmonds our wedding planner is not only pleasant, highly efficient and a consummate professional, she gave a very personal and bespoke service and ensured our special day was unanimously claimed by all our guests to be the best wedding they ever had the pleasure of attending. You're blessed to have someone so wonderful on your team! I shall certainly be recommending her and the Shelbourne Hotel to any friends and family who are planning a wedding.

 
The wedding day was the best day of our lives and this was in part attributed to the amazing staff at the Shelbourne Hotel. Regrettably it would not be practical to go and thank all members of staff personally but if I had time I would. The kitchen staff, the waiting staff, the people on reception, the room service and concierge staff, the bellboys, the valets - without exception everyone welcomed us warmly and were a pleasure to deal with. Not once did we enounter a member of staff who didn't seem to genuinely love their work and do all they could to help.

 
The food was AMAZING and we relished every delicious bite which was so lovingly prepared by your talented kitchen staff. Our wedding food was simply out of this world and as all our wedding guests without exception are bona fide ""foodies"", one can not begin to decribe how warmly it was received. I personally also found the breakfast in the Saddle Room to be almost a spiritual experience! What a wonderful selection of fresh produce to suit every palate. I also particularly enjoyed the champagne generously supplied on the morning after the wedding.

 
Our stay at the Shelbourne was simply marvellous. The hotel is differentiated through the little (and such thoughtful!) touches which made those days so memorable. The fact that Sarah Edmonds our wedding planner had graced our Suite with a framed photo of us as we arrived at the hotel was such a lovely surprise, likewise with all the innumerable other added touches which make the hotel and its staff so unique.

 My gorgeous new husband and I look forward to coming back to stay again and if not before we definitely intend to come back next year and spend some time there on our first wedding anniversary in May 2013.

 We'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at the hotel from the very bottom of our hearts and to commend you on running a first-class hotel. I simply can't recommend the hotel enough and would urge anyone visiting Dublin to book in and indulge themselves, you won't be disappointed!",5,2012,07,31
207,Our room was next to the loading bay - too noisy!,"Myself and my sister went all out and booked a two night stay in this hotel, the service was amazing, the food and general ambiance was just fabulous and we really felt like we were being treated!  Our room was lovely too, clean and the beds were really cosy.  However as soon as we went to bed, come 0600 every morning these lorries would park up the left side of the hotel and start throwing drink barrells into their lorries and this would continue for about an hour! The next morning it was the laundry and it was just so loud we couldnt get any sleep in it was very disappointing, my sister was catching an international flight and was just shattered going to the airport.",3,2012,07,31
207,The Shelbourne Dublin in the heart of Dublin,"My family stayed at the The Shelbourne Dublin hotel in April.  The hotel is beatuiful, and right across the steet from a city park.
The service at the hotel was Five Star.
There is a very nice restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We had the Irish breakfast every day.  Great food and excellent service.  There are two pubs / bars on site.
The Shelbourne Dublin is within walking distance of many pubs, attractions and bus tour stops.
I would only stay at The Shelbourne Dublin the next time I visit Dublin.",5,2012,07,30
207,"Fabulous, over the top gorgeous!!","My husband and I were so fortunate to experience staying at the Shelbourne Dublin.  You receive such extra special treatment...you don't want to leave. We stayed in a Heritage Room which is larger than a standard or deluxe room. The rooms are spotless!!!  Towels plush, bedding comfy, room quiet, and bathroom exceptional.  We enjoyed daily breakfast in the beautiful Saddle Room with plenty of offerings to choose from, even for this vegetarian. The location of the hotel is ideally located across from St. Stephen's Green, a lovely park for an afternoon stroll. If you can find something wrong with the Shelbourne Dublin, than you quite possibly are impossible to please. We will return!!",5,2012,07,30
207,Fantastic Experience,"We Stayed here for one night while at a concert in Iveagh Gardens, 
Beautiful hotel in a brilliant location, 
We only had a standard room which was extremely clean and tidy, 
Theres always lots going on around the hotel, we had a few drinks in the horseshoe bar which is always nice, Breakfast was lovely, the place seems to be overwhelmed with staff which isnt a bad complaint. Great experience.",5,2012,07,25
207,Nice stay after a false start,"We stayed at the Shelbourne as a birthday celebration a couple of months back but the experience was less than impressive due to a mix up in bookings and a few other niggles that should not really happen in such an establishment (poor sound insulation, too busy at breakfast, freezing aircon in public areas etc...). Anyway we were invited back on their dollar and were well looked after. Surroundings are grand and service is good outside of the self-serve breakfast in a cramped area. If you want quality and are prepared to splash the cash whilst staying in Dublin then this is the place. ",4,2012,07,21
207,Old world class,"Fourth time staying here. Exudes old world charm. Ideal central location. Helpful and very pleasant reception staff. Stayed in heritage wing #546, lovely room , slightly slopey floor(!) , 
Food in bar 27 good, enormous seafood platter and that was the small portion!  Breakfast buffet fine , but nothing special .
But overall , hard to fault.",4,2012,07,19
207,"Great  Hotel, wonderful location","This is a very nice hotel with a wonderful location for exploring Dublin on foot.   The service was very good and the rooms nice, comfortable and roomy.  They even had an American plug in in the room.  Highly recommended.",5,2012,07,18
207,Brilliant Hotel Will Be Back,"This hotel amazing  Dublin amazing Hotel is opposite St Stephens Green you can get the tour bus across road from hotel would strongly recommend the tour bus as it get you to see alot of the city and you can hop  off and on whenever you like.
The staff at the hotel are lovely genuine people, the bar staff were also very friendly we stayed at the Shelbourne in March and the weather was amazing the few days we were here couldnt fault nothing with the hotel hoping to return next year even the breakfast was lovely.",5,2012,07,18
207,Once again the Shelbourne excels,"Stayed at the Shebourne once again and was not disappointed. For me the Shelbourne is Dublin at it's finest. I would never dream of staying elsewhere. This grand eddifice has a way of making you feel 'family'. If all hotels in Dublin were run along such lines they would be as successful. A huge thank you to Jane and Raphael for making our stay so rewarding. Can't wait to return again and I will.

207,Amazing Hotel,"My daughter and I stayed at this hotel in April, 2012.  It was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  Certainly gorgeous, historic building, tastefully decorated but it exceeded our expectations.  Check-in was very easy and we were immediately able to go up to our room.  Our luggage arrived a few minutes later.  We had an issue with the internet in our room - both wireless and wired and a hotel rep came to our room to work on it.  When she wasn't able to fix it, she put us in touch with someone who was.  The location of this hotel is great - walking distance to so many of the sights and just across from St. Stephen's Green.  The staff was courteous, friendly and efficient. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was amazing.  It had all the modern amenities but it harkened back to a bygone era time with the layout of the hallways and the historical touches in the rooms (such as the mouldings, chandeliers, large windows etc.)   I am from the US but have loads of family in Ireland and we always take a few days in Dublin whenever we visit - I have stayed in several different Dublin Hotels and have generally been happy with where I have stayed, however, I will never stay somewhere other than the Shelbourne again.",5,2012,07,16
207,Busy Buzzy Brilliant,Shelbourne Bar. Great service. Great food. Great buzz. Bar food was excellent. You will have to fight hard to get a seat.,5,2012,07,15
207,Depending on your needs - but average value for money,"Yes, this is a very stylish hotel, with a lot of character charm. Staff is friendly and check in was efficient. The room is very characteristic. I had an heritage room. Liked the bed, bathroom was huge and contained all amenities.
The curtains are excellent - no daylight comes through the curtains, so perfect sleeps.

Compared to other hotels - I think value for money can be better. Charging 20 euro for access to internet in the room is definitely something of a past era.

I also found the lifts a bit slow, always had to wait.
All in perfect place to stay for character, service and friendly staff.
Value for money: you can do much better - so it all depends on your needs.",3,2012,07,15
207,Do not expect to eat in the restaurant,"I travel extensively in Europe (and elsewhere) and the UK for work and I am a Platinum Elite Marriott Rewards member so I am very familiar with the Marriott chain of hotels worldwide. This hotel is nice but even with my twice upgraded room, the ""historical nature"" of the room I had was a bit off-putting: the floor was uneven and very soft in some spots, the bathroom tile floor was broken (with sharp edges) near the sink and the shower tiles had a fair amount of black mould in the grout. The most disappointing aspect was their ""Saddle Room"" restaurant: I tried to get breakfast there on Sunday morning but aside from someone who took a few seconds from bussing table to bring me ""fresh"" orange juice (which tasted like concentrate) and some horrible coffee, no one bothered to take my breakfast order and I failed to get anyone's attention to do so. 

Eating is kind of a key element to enjoying a stay at any hotel and if you cannot do that on top of having other issues in the rooms, then I would suggest a re-think for anyone planning to stay here. The historical nature of this hotel faded some time ago and there are much better hotels in Dublin for the money.",2,2012,07,15
207,Fantastic hotel good food and good style,I really loved this hotel it's full Irish is the best I have tested in any hotel but if you are staying here make sure you book a room away from the ballroom if there is a wedding or function you will here the music but overall fantastic staff food and comfort ,5,2012,07,14
207,Elegant,"The Shelbourne is a beautiful old hotel in a great location to visit the main attractions in Dublin.  I am sure you can find a hotel at better rates, but overall a good value.  Room was more than adequate, and in mid June HVAC was not an issue!  We were very comfortable.  It is located in walking distance of Trinity College, the Castle and cathedrals we visited.  Even in the rain it was easy.  The staff was very attentive and we enjoyed conversation as we waited for friends to arrive.",5,2012,07,13
207,Lots of History and tradition,"I liked the Hotel at first sight.. very traditional..old world charm...long history in Ireland Power and Politics...there is even a manuscipt in hotel which is original draft of IRISH Constitution drafted in one of the Hotel rooms ( see pic) .. rooms comfortable.. lunch and breakfast spread was decent, restaurant seems to be famous in DOUBLIN, plenty of upmarket crowd... staff was extremely warm and courteous... I do not find such warm hospitality in EUROPE that is domain of asia...  The shopping market is walking distance hardly 500 mtrs... St Stephens Green in front of Hotel... took a nice jog near lake and lush greens in Morning each day...Free Wifi in lobby..chargable in room..had a comfortable stay...hotel offers all that is needed for business traveller... could see lots of families (tourists) as well... Good Overall Experience..!",4,2012,07,12
207,"Grand exterior, friendly staff, horrific plumbing","Can't fault the room size (not the two I stayed in), but in my first room, the bathroom was handicap-accessible - meaning the shower was merely a corner of the bathroom with a curtain which pulled around.  This would not have been a problem, had the shower drain worked. Instead, the entire bathroom flooded (~4 inches of standing water) and flowed out into the carpeted bedroom (which explained the very musty smell I noticed when I checked in).  I spent the better part of 20 minutes using all the towels to absorb the shower overflow and push it back toward the drain (which eventually, does drain).  I was moved to another room (with a lovely bath and shower with a working drain) but when I checked out, I overheard another guest complaining that his shower didn't drain.  This sort of antiquated plumbing should not be experienced in a hotel claiming to be as grand as the Shelbourne.  I will probably stay elsewhere next time.",3,2012,07,12
207,Good location for the city,Easy access to area and transportation to outskirts enjoyed the quaintness and history though some may find the quarters smallish,4,2012,07,10
207,An old fashioned luxury hotel in the centre of Dublin,"Very centrally located, the Shelbourne is a beautiful hotel. Just on the edge of the St Stephen's Green, the town centre is all walkable and the buses are very convenient as well.
We were here for a few days to attend a wedding that was held at the Shelbourne.
The service was amazing - attentive, polite, and very helpful and friendly. Smiles all round. From check in to check out, we were not disappointed. 
The room itself was not what I would call the best I've stayed in. It was very nice, but old. The bathroom needed refurbishing. We had a very quiet room, so quiet all we could hear was rain. Sometimes we heard people outside in the corridor, but never from next door. The towels were very soft and thick, the toiletries provided of good quality and plenty of it. 
The bed was too soft for our liking, the pillows were either foam or feather. We got used to the soft bed after the first night and it was rather comfortable after that. 
Food was very good and of the highest standard. We had breakfast included and that meant anything from the buffet as well as alacarte. Very fresh food, adequate choice, and even included smoothies and a juicer to make your own veggie juice! Most impressive spread. Restaurant staff were very attentive and polite. 
The wedding reception food was amazing. Best wedding food that I've ever experienced, of the highest quality and display. Well done, Shelbourne!
Why have I given it 4 stars - the Shelbourne needs bringing up to date with facilities. Needs a good gym (big and modern one), a spa (with all the luxuries of  treatments, steam rooms, saunas, jacuzzi), and a good swimming pool. For the price and the reputation of this hotel, it is lacking in what most luxury hotels around the world are offering. The rooms also need to be refurbished. 
Overall a very enjoyable stay in a very elegant hotel. Would I stay again - yes, but it is rather pricey!",4,2012,07,08
207,Shelbourne Hotel great! trip report,"We visited Dublin for 6 days in late June.  Flying from the US we arrived at the Shelbourne Hotel around 9:30am and they happily stored our luggage until our room was ready- after 1:00.  We had not expected to be able to check in until after 3:00.  There was a problem in that we were booked in a king, not double/ double room, for 3 people.   They quickly arranged for a rollaway to be delivered and changed us to a larger (deluxe) room to better accommodate us.  The room was tight with the extra bed, but generous by European standards.  Plenty of storage room and nice bath. Our Marriott elite level provided free breakfast for all of us each day (normally 30eu each).  All the service we received was quick and friendly.The breakfast was excellent, with a good variety of fruit, cereal, parties and hot items.  I'm not sure we would have paid over $100 a day for three of us, probably would have eaten at a nearby coffee shop, if not included.   We did not use the hotel restaurant otherwise.  It seemed to be mainly business travelers.  They had a wonderful "" high tea"" that we did not try, but would have loved to- it was beautifully presented.   Our daughter is gluten intolerant, and most of the tea treats were not wheat- free.
The hotel located in a convenient location near Grafton Street ( major shopping, eating thoroughfare) and across the street from a large, beautiful park.  Most tourist sites, Temple Bar, Trinity College, Cathedrals are within walking distance.
We used the on-off Green bus ( buy one day get one free) to access Guinness, Jamison, and  Kilmainham Gaol.  There was also public transport at corner of park.  But walking gave us a better view of the city and sites.
The hotel concierges, David and Alan, were most helpful in suggesting sites, restaurants, tour of Jamison with tasting, and arranging a rental car for the day- they even had it delivered to hotel.(We used Hertz,  as their usual company, Enterprise, had no availability.)' driving in Ireland is a challenge for us Americans, so highly recommend getting an automatic. Worth the extra cost. It also came with a gps-a necessity in these little country roads. We drove to Irish National Stud and then to Wicklow Mountains, then returned by way of Powerscourt Waterfall. ( A large circular route)
INS is a beautiful farm with amazing Japanese gardens.  The tour was interesting you get to see the million dollar (euro) famous Irish horses and get to see the cute foals in padlocks in a beautiful surrounding.
The drive from there to Wicklow is through beautiful scennery with some typically Irish villages- with sheep frequently as road hazards.  The roads were very narrow, with no shoulder, so any approaching buses and construction trucks were stress provoking.
There are no words to describe the natural beauty of this area.  We stopped at  Glendalough at the monastery ruins and spent quite a bit of time touring the old Celtic cemetery (this area is seen on many travel posters) We had hoped to make it to Powerscourt Gardens, but closing was 5:30. ( future trip!) but did stop by thenPowerscourt Waterfall- amazing!  Since sunset is so late (10:00pm) we then drove the car to the port of  Howth for dinner ( north of Dublin on the point). Easy drive on the motorway. Howth is a picturesque fishing village were there are many restaurants adjacent to the fishing fleet.  We had a wonderful seafood dinner-caught that morning salmon, cod and mussels.  Then walked along the jetty to view the sunset.
We returned the car to the hotel, and it was picked up by Hertz.
The weather was rainy with patches of sun- need to take an umbrella at all times, and good water resistant footwear. My LL Bean waterproof ballet flats were perfect. 
We loved the Irish people and can't wait to return.  I'm not sure if we would spend so much time in Dublin, since we would love to explore more areas.  If we did return to Dublin, i would stay at the Shelbourne again. 
We left Dublin for London via ferry.  It was an easy taxi ride to ferry port about  2 hours to Holyhead, Wales, then the train to London Euston station.  The scenery along the Welsh coast is magnificent. We caught the 8:30am ferry and arrived in London just after 4:00pm.

207,Awesome hotel with history,"Stayed in Dublin on our annual anniversary trip. Was a great experience overall. We were allowed to check in early and got a room upgrade. The hotel is close to all the major attractions.  So we were able to walk everywhere. The afternoon tea was outstanding. Gained a few pounds just from that feast.

There is a lot to do in Dublin.  5 days were not enough to see everything. Recommend some of the restaurants around the hotel -  One PIco especially. We will go back and stay again at the Shelbourne.",5,2012,07,01

207,My First Choice in Luxury Hotels Near St Stephen's Green,"Have stayed at Shelbourne Dublin, a Marriott property about 5-6 times. Plan to return in September. It is a luxury hotel with well-deserved fine reputation located on St. Stephen's Green.  Have stayed at the Weston too, and much prefer the Marriott.

Ideal location, can walk to everyplace.

Suitable for personal holiday, or business. Not stuffy.

Dining in the Saddle Room is a standout in terms of quality of food and preparation. I never miss breakfast. Have booked a private room for dining with business guests.

Drinks at the No. 27 Bar are pricey. Many other fine dining choices within walking distance.

Luas (tram) Green Line is virtually across the street

The place was buzzy with US tourists, a post wedding group, lunch timers and families and couples having a drink or bar food. To call what I had for lunch would be something of a misnomer as it was probably prepared by the same staff who cater for the Shelbourne's Saddle Room next door and it was excellent . I had hot smoked salmon on a bed of cubed new potatoes anointed with a delicious mustardy dill mayonnaise atop lovely brown soda bread and scattered with shaved fennel accompanied by crisp leaves with just the right amount of dressing. The cost of this excellent lunch fare with a crisp glass of Sauvignon Blanc was 20.55 which, considering the surroundings was excellent value.",5,2012,06,30
207,Very enjoyable,"Good staff. Got upgraded to JFK suite which was wonderful.  Food was excellent, very nice breakfast also. Efficient service. Just a little toooo many ""good morning sir"" as I walked about, felt like a parade ground moment !  Would happily return.",5,2012,06,30
207,Excellent breakfast,"Stayed in the Shelbourne for one night. Got a very good rate including breakfast on alpha rooms. The room was nice but nothing special. Breakfast was excellent. One of the best things about the hotel is its location. It is in a nice area, very close to the shopping areas and there are lots of places to eat nearby. All in all if you get a good rate it is a nice hotel, but I would expect much more if I was paying the rack rate.",3,2012,06,27
207,History versus space,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in May 2012. Chose this hotel because I have read about it in the business news in the past few years and also for its central location.
The hotel has a stately presence in the street and a nice lobby area. 
We were starving by the time we checked in after a very early morning start and a flight to get to Dublin. At the counter was a plate of freshly baked cookies. We were not offered one as we waited for the reception staff to check us in. But I was in such a state that I asked if I could have one even if I had to pay for it. Those biscuits were very very delicious!
We have booked for a ""normal"" room. The room is modern but it is very small, After we put our 2 medium size suitcases down, there were not much room to move about. From the room we looked into a non descript back alley.
The breakfast which came with the rate was very substantial and very well presented. We enjoyed them thoroughly.
The internet was not free so we were a bit disappointed with that.
Overall it was a good stay provided one is happy with the tight space. We felt that the rate we paid was not proportional to the space of the room.",4,2012,06,25
207,not as expected,"This was our final and highly anticipated  stop for hotels during our stay in Ireland and while the location is fabulous, the service and amenities certainly did not add up to the quality of our previous hotels. Checking in, the lobby was chaos and loud, with the concierge giving her  spiel as quickly as possible, touting the hotel`s qualities, almost as if she were afraid that she wouldn`t remember what to say. This seemed to be the staff`s theme, which was an ability to give service by lip but not by deed. The place smacked of the word ""chain"" and people responded as they had been instructed and without much enthusiasm. The room was clean but small. like a chain. and the food was mediocre, again with service effecient but lacking any personality. We had an incident in the bar with a drink order that had to be remade 3 times to our satisfaction and it was made quite clear that I was in the wrong. Location is everything, however, and we wre able to visit most of this delightful city by walking. This is not a cheap place to stay and apart from the location, it is living on past merits and reputation. We would think twice before rebooking here.",3,2012,06,21
207,Great Hotel,I have stayed at the Shelbourne many times and it is one of my favorite hotels. I have to compliment the staff who are amazing and attentive to guests needs. If visiting Dublin a stay here is a must!,5,2012,06,19
207,central and great service,"Staff is all about this hotel. Engaged to provide you the best of what you would like... Concirges are great and so efficient.
Room are large, clean and have all you can ask.

The only negative stuff on this hotel ... this is agin one of them that charge you 20 Eruoes for 24 hours wifi ! Would rather pay more my room that feel being over charged of a service that should be included... I do not get the poitn here !",4,2012,06,18
207,Fabulous Historic Hotel,This is a spectacular hotel located in the heart of Dublin!   Stunning bar.  Wonderful drinks and appetizers.  Te tea room is lovely and often has a piano player. The rooms are gorgeous and the staff takes care of all of your needs.  Not to be missed.,5,2012,06,16
207,old world hotel,fine traditional old world accomodations.....service is first class... accomodations all you would expect....perfect location ....restaurant quite good....overall pricey but really top of the line,5,2012,06,16
207,Don't do baby Bowls!!!,"Im a little late but here goes.
last christmas my mother, sister and I decided to bring our young niece and nephew up to dublin to see santy, we had booked two twin rooms. Our rooms were lovely and all but to be honest the attitude of the staff/ hotel was extremely disappointing. our niece was asleep when we decided to go out for dinner so upon our return to the hotel she woke, we decided to ask for a baby bowl for her, it was only 9.30 at night in the hight of the party season so i know the kitchen was open. i approached the front dest and was told ""we don't really do that"" I myself am a hotel manager and i have never heard of a hotel that would refuse to give a baby bowl. i asked the receptionist to please check if they could put a bit of mash and gravy in a bowl for a 2year old, i was told to go to the room and that they would call me. they promised to call even if they couldn't!!!! 
we were in the room all night watching the late late toy show with the kids and nothing!! It was extremely disappointing that such a request was completely ignored!! 
On principle i would most definitely think twice before ever recommending this hotel to any guest in any hotel i work in.",3,2012,06,13
207,Ok but expect more for price,Hotel is pleasant enough. Everything is as expected. Good location and good breakfast.  But 20 euros for 24 hour Internet that is not even that fast is a colossal rip off.  Dear GM - if going charge that much at least make sure it is a decent service!!!,2,2012,06,12
207,Not what I expected...,"Absolutely not what I expected from a hotel with such a reputation.  We stayed both upon arrival to Ireland and prior to departure and neither experience was particularly good.  Upon arrival for our first visit the rooms were not ready.  This is just something to keep in mind if you plan on arriving early.  We were not offered any concession and none was really expected.  During our second visit we arrived later than the posted check-in times and one of the rooms were were given was dirty (the bed was not made, there were personal items in the room from previous guest, etc.).  Further, I had two items which were to be delivered to the room and had to call the front desk several times and even then they took hours to arrive.  The view on both occasions was not at all attractive.  The hotel itself is somewhat tired and could use some work.  Certainly not a 4 or 5 star property although the doorman was very nice and quite helpful.",2,2012,06,11
207,Old world classic,We stayed two nights at the Shelbourne. It is a perfect location & full of old world charm. A pity they don't get up to date by offering free wifi like most hotels these days instead of ripping off their customers.,3,2012,06,10
207,Excellent service and location,"We arrived at the Shelbourne at 9:00 am on a Saturday morning, exhausted after a transatlantic flight and hoping that just maybe our room would be ready so we could nap for a couple of hours.  Our room was still in the process of being cleaned, so we were sent to the Lord Mayor's Lounge for a complimentary light breakfast, which was a welcome touch and perked us up enough to get on with our day.  The room was ready shortly, and while very small by American standards, was equipped with everything we needed to enjoy our two night stay, most importantly a supremely comfortable bed and a powerful shower.  We also appreciated the dual-voltage electrical outlets.  Most of our time in Dublin was spent exploring the city, and the Shelbourne was a perfect base, within easy walking distance to many major sites as well as shopping and restaurants, and with a HoHo bus stop right across the street. Concierge recommendations were spot-on, and we were especially grateful upon returning to our room after a night out to find prosecco and sweets had been delivered in honor of our anniversary.  There may be nicer (larger) hotel rooms in Dublin, but I doubt there are nicer hotels. The Shelbourne is lovely.",5,2012,06,10
207,Lovely blend of past and present,"The Shelbourne is a part of Irish history--the Constitution was drafted there-- and also boasts a guest list worthy of any who's who roster!
Perfect location, across from beautiful St Stephen's Green and a very short walk to Grafton Street shopping and many other Dublin delights.
Our room (superior category) had recently been tastefuly redone,  was a very comfortable size, and also had one of the few balconies available (unfortunately, no great view!) I did however chat with another guest who said her room was quite small.
A special mention for the very helpful, friendly and altogether delightful staff.
We'll be back next year!",5,2012,06,09
207,"Superb location, terrific service!","Stayed for 6 nights last month and my first impression was mostly negative - about the hotel due to the size of the room (cramped, for what my secretary said was a 'deluxe' room - whatever that meant) and more so the extremely cramped toilet/bath that would barely win in a comparison with the one on the flight I took in to Dublin.

However as I spent time in other parts of the hotel it was obvious that they had probably the BEST staff I've come across in all my travels so far.  Extremely friendly, courteous and accommodating. On the two occasions that housekeeping forgot to top up my tea/coffee caddy they were extremely apologetic and went out of their way to make amends.

Other than the space issue, the accommodations themselves were extremely comfortable and well maintained.  Breakfast was good, even if looking at the same menu over 6 days was not very exciting after the first 2-3 days.  There's a strange windowless bar inside with a very friendly barman.

The Hotel obviously has a lot of history on its side (I met a lady whose parents had gotten engaged here about 45 years back), but I'd personally prefer more space over history.

That the hotel is extremely well located should be obvious from (1) the address and (2) all the reviews so far.  You can't get a better location in Dublin (except perhaps the Westbury, but thats equivalent to living on high street).

In short, the location is great and the hotel itself is well-kept and good - what makes it VERY good is the phenomenal service from an outstanding bunch of people who work there.  Would've rated excellent if I had a bit more elbow room.",4,2012,06,08
207,Great hotel needs help,"Just stayed . Room 350. 
This hotel has everything going for it and the potential to shine . 
Here is a few suggestions 
1- iPhone docks in rooms ( coming soon I am told ) 
2 15 minute wait for breakfast belongs in a different century 
3 front  lobby tea room can't operate with one staff member - 

This is a choice hotel - needs a bit of loving managembebt 

Oh those shampoos are a disgrace - cheap and not cheerful 

Bring your own unless your a doggie . 

Excellent receptionist at check in 

",2,2012,06,08
207,Top notch stay,"Stayed six days in Dublin; The Shelbourne is in an excellent location.  The staff were beyond accommodating and the hotel itself was quite charming.  The restaurants/bar in the hotel were also well staffed and the food was quite good.  Probably one of the best cheeseburgers we had and were all over Dublin!  The only minor negatives I had was the lack of spa services (although I read that this is in the works), no pool, a less than superior gym, and spotty Internet access.  The room we stayed in was nice, a bit small and we noticed that each time we showered, it left quite a puddle on the floor, plus there was no vent, so it remained quite steamy and slippery.",4,2012,06,07
207,Wonderful Hotel with Old World Charm!,"We stayed at The Shelbourne our first & last nights of our vacation...absolutely stellar accommodations, service and location.  We absolutely loved this hotel, 5*plus - rooms were spectacular, very clean, spacious, comfortable...and the beds were so fantastic it was like sleeping on a cloud.  Location is perfect - within walking distance to shopping, restaurants and pubs.  Directly across the street was St. Stephens Green, a great spot for a morning or evening stroll or run.  The staff were superb right from the moment you arrive, they could not help us enough.  They were so knowledgeable in providing restaurant suggestions, site-seeing recommendations, and travel directions.  We had breakfast included & it offered everything you could want.  The 'Horseshoe Bar' was a nice surprise...you must arrive early to get a seat but it is a nice quaint spot to meet fellow travelers.  We would definitely stay here again!!  A special thank you to 'Sanchez' who made us feel so special during our stay!",5,2012,06,06
207,"Old world hotel, old world bedrooms","The hotel has charm and its very easy on the eyes, the only downfall is the rooms.  The beds seem to be several years old and are too soft, we sank into it and had a pretty poor night of sleep. The location is great, right on st. stephens green, walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go. I think the hotel rooms  just need to be brought forth from their 80's vibe. I will most likely look to a smaller / newer boutique hotel next time I am in Dublin.",3,2012,06,04
207,Classic hotel,"Loved this hotel, very classic.  If you want a 5 star ultra modern hotel looks elsewhere, but you can get that in any major city and they're all the same.  This is a 5 star classic hotel, with old wold charm but has all the modern upgrades you can ask for.  Wonderful location and helpful staff.",5,2012,06,03
207,A fantastic hotel,"We stayed in this hotel as an anniversary trip back to Ireland.
The hotel is absolutely fantastic. It has been completely restructured beautifully.
Service is super very fast and attentive.
I absolutely love the bar above for it's atmosphere, the evenings are really crowded so you need to get there early to find a table.
Rooms are beautiful and pricey but worth every penny especially for a special occasion.
Will definitely return.",4,2012,06,03
207,Expected more.,"Stayed here for 2 nights in March.
Certainly one of the better hotels in the area but really doesn't feel like a 5 star,
Staff in the Bar/Lounge can be a little cold at times & on more than one occasion asked us would we like to settle the bill and sometimes by just placing it on table without being prompted.

The rooms are fine. Nothing special to report. 

Stairs to the downstairs bathroom by the bar were lethal on more than one occasion as it had been raining & the stairs are made of marble. Lawsuit waiting to happen.

We had afternoon tea in both The Shelbourne & The Westbury around the corner,
Service was much better in the Westbury.
Afternoon Tea at the time of our stay was 'Titanic Themed' which was laughable as none of the staff could give us any explanation as what was 'Titanic Themed' about it.... Apart from the fact it was a disaster?",3,2012,06,01
207,Great place to stay before or after a week guided tour of Ireland.,"Great rooms, perfectly located near most attractions. Across from Stevens Park. Friendly and efficient staff that get results of your requests. Dennis, the head Concierge is very knowledgable, helpful, and get results. The stay was a great experience.",5,2012,06,01
207,Luxuary for the older set,This is old style luxuary and for the more trendy you can do better. The location on the green and 5 min walk to shopping is great. At night the hotel has a nice buzz to it. However if I was younger less 35 I'd think these older folk still know how to have fun. The reception is not visible from the entrance and without anyone telling you it can make you feel unwelcome. Do the dog leg walk and you find a warm and welcoming reception desk lemonade and cookies to soften the blow. Rooms are sumptuous but some of them face a concrete building and are to be avoided.  Attention to detail is lacking no pepper in pepper pot at room service out of burgers. So it is a lovely hotel and would recommend to an older crowd but it lacks that extra attention to detail to make it truly a faultless experience.  Still I will be returning. ,4,2012,06,01
207,Pre-dinner drinks at the Bar,"Following on from a business meeting, we met at the Shelbourne Hotel Bar.   It was a bustling spot.  Service was very efficient even though the place only had standing room.  Drinks are above average in price, but at the end of the day you get quality wines and cocktails.   I have heard the restaurant is very good, and have noted to visit on my next trip.",5,2012,05,31
207,Like an elegant lady,"The Shelbourne is like an elegant old film star, classy and sophisticated, yet the staff are all polite and friendly- not snobbish.  Located right across the street from St. Stephen's Green and just two blocks from Grafton Street, it has an excellent location. It's a 2-5 minute walk to all sorts of places to eat and shop.  The HOHO bus stop is just down the street, so it's easy to catch the bus.
 Our room was located on the side of the hotel so the only view was of the neighboring building, but the room itself was very comfortable.  There was a large vanity area, the room was very quiet (except for fire alarm at 1am, which was a false alarm not initiated by the hotel), the bed was very comfy with good pillows. There was no hot water one morning, but we called the desk and they were very responsive, the problem was solved within 30 minutes. 
The only negative was the wifi access.  I feel wifi should be free when you're paying over $300 a night, but the Shelbourne charges €20 per day for wifi.  There is free wifi in the downstairs bar, but I prefer to use it in my room and I don't feel I should have to pay extra for that.",4,2012,05,31
207,best hotel in dublin,Don't stay anywhere else in Dublin. Everything was excellent.,5,2012,05,29
207,"Fabulous, Grand Old Hotel","We stayed here for four night in late April.  It is a beautiful hotel with a renaissance feel to it.  We arrived early in the morning and our roon wasn't ready yet as they were full.  We had some breakfast and they called us on our cell when it was ready.  We had a king bed room with a roll away for our teenage son.  It overlooked a courtyard between buildings.  It wasn't a fabulous view but we weren't in Dublin for the hotel view.  The bathroom was newly done and quite nice.  Americans should be aware that no where in Ireland is an outlet allowed in the bathroom so you must style your hair using a mirror over the desk area.  The room was a good size for a city hotel.  Lots of special touches: lemon water and cookies all day in the lobby, gorgeous flowers.
Breakfast was a buffet with every imaginable offering.  The scrambled eggs in Ireland are very tasty, way better than in USA.  The lounges were very nice and packed on weekend nights.  We ate in the restaurant one night for dinner with a group of six and everyone seemed very pleased with their meals.
All of the staff were friendly and helpful.  The conceirge, Denis, was wonderfully helpful with all kinds of details, big and small, from how to get around town, to where to eat, to calling ahead to other hotels when he knew someone there to ask them to take special care of us.  Really above and beyond the scope of the job! (Thank you so much to Denis, you weren't there when we checked out).",5,2012,05,29
207,One of the best hotels I've stayed in,"We booked a 3 night stay here and I have to say this was one of the best hotels I've stayed in. We were welcomed by the bellboy who took our cases, showed us around the foyer, showed us where the restaurants were, describing each in detail. He then took us to check in and gave us home made lemonade and cookies. We checked in, with a lovely receptionist who was so friendly and helpful. We had booked a queen room using Priceline and were happy with the price, however we were delighted to be told we had been upgraded to a delux king room for our stay. Our room was beautiful. Dark furniture all in pristine condition, the soft furnishings were in shades of gold. The bathroom was modern with a deep tub, great shower and complimentary Elemis toiletries. We had complimentary bottled water daily as well as a morning newspaper. The room had an iron and ironing board, hair dryer and coffee/ tea making facilities. Wifi was available for a fee. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and the hotel was so quiet during the night I had the soundest sleep I've had in a long time.Check out the museum in the lobby, which is fascinating, the hotel is really old and has ledgers dating back to its beginning. All the staff were friendly and the hotel was spotless. If I return to Dublin, which I'm sure I will as it's a fantastic city this will be my first choice for accommodation. It is ideally situated at St Stephens Green right in the heart of the city with Grafton St a 3 minute walk away and the hop on hop off bus right across the street if you want to tour the city. This was five star at its best. A superb stay.",5,2012,05,29
207,Solid historical choice,"Very nice historic building (I believe the nation's constitutions were drafted here) that is well situated just across from St Stephen's park. 
Great big showerhead (pressure merely sufficient). 
Locally renowned Irish breakfast (not cheap: EUR 30). 
Wonderful pillows; room temperature controls worked well. Plenty of staff in the lobby.
My room, sadly, was above a green trash compacting device that made an odd humming/buzzing sound - didn't really disturb, though... kind of comforting white noise. Some would be driven to distraction, though.",4,2012,05,29
207,"A very nice hotel, but needs some improvements.","We recently stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel for 4 nights in May.  I've stayed in hotels all over the world and this hotel is very nice.  While this was my first trip to Dublin, I found it to be a wonderful city and the Shelbourne seems to be in a great location.

The hotel has been restored recently and was very busy with activity during our stay.  Our room was large and spacious, with a large window overlooking the busy street in front.  The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were clean.  The bathroom was very large (much larger than many hotels I've stayed in), bright and clean.

There seem to be 4 or 5 restaurants/bars/lounges directly off the main entry to the hotel.  There is definitely something for everyone.  While the daily breakfast did not change while we were staying here, the buffet offered something for everyone and the restaurant's wait staff was prompt with anything we needed.

While the Shelbourne was very nice, it lacked in a few areas and could definitely use some improvement.  First off, WiFi is not included with your hotel room.  The charge to use WiFi in your room is 20 euros per day, per device.  I was sharing the room, and we both had laptops.  That meant that we each had to pay the 20 euros per day, just to use our computers in our room.  This is the first 5-star hotel I've visited that charged for WiFi.  I found the cost exorbitant and it was a major disappointment, considering I needed to use my laptop often during my stay.

Apparently there is free WiFi in the hotel lobby, but I was not told about this during check-in, and I didn't find out about it until the last day of my stay.  I even spoke to the reception desk to express my disappointment in the WiFi costs, and they still failed to mention that they offered WiFi in the lobby.  In my opinion, if I'm going to pay for a luxury hotel, then I expect WiFi to be included.

While our rooms were cleaned daily, the small, round bar of soap was never replaced.  I had to call down twice during my stay to request that the soap be replenished in my bathroom.  Also, our glassware was not replaced on a daily basis either.  When we returned to the room each night, our used glassware was still where we left it.  We had to request new glasses at one point, too.

While the Shelbourne is very nice hotel, it was the small details that keep me from wanting to return.  If/when I come back to Dublin, I will definitely try a different hotel.",4,2012,05,29
207,They almost have it right,"Great Hotel, BUT BE PREPARED TO SPEND 20 EUROS a day for wifi.   Here we have a quality hotel (Mel Gibson was there when we stayed at the hotel), but they charge for wifi.   That's just BS.  Even the Sleep Inn gives it to you free.  

If you want to use a free wifi you have to go to the lobby and work there 

Come on Marriott you're getting like the airlines and charging for everything.   

Breakfast good",4,2012,05,29
207,Hotel that has everything in Dublin!,"This hotel has large rooms, great location, very helpful concierge and doormen.  Many celebrities have stayed here.  Very, very nice.  Totally worth it!",5,2012,05,29
207,Great Location & Hospitality,"Really cannot fault our stay at The Shelbourne. Check-in was quick & flawless. Our room was a nice size with a comfortable King sized bed. Bathroom was modern and very clean. It's situated directly across from the charming St. Stephen's Green park and just a block or two away from Grafton Street. It's also steps away from the National Museum of Archaeology and Natural History. The location is really top rate. All staff we encountered were pleasant and friendly, always willing to help in anyway.. Room service was tasty and always arrived in under 30 minutes. We are Marriott Gold members so the free wifi was a great to have in our room and throughout the hotel. Being a gold member also entitles us to complimentary buffet breakfast in their Saddle Room. It had a decent variety with both hot & cold items, and enough to choose from. We especially enjoyed the wonderful fresh squeezed OJ. While we very much enjoyed the buffet, I don't think we would of paid the nearly 30 euros per person being charged for it. All in all a great stay. I would recommend it as a wonderful place to stay to explore this great city!",5,2012,05,27
207,Luxury and Location,"This was a beautiful hotel. We spent hours in the lobby... waiting for our room because we had just flown over from the US and were more than exhausted. We tried to walk around in the park across the street, but alas were to tired and nearly fell asleep on our feet. Lesson learned, make sure that have a room for you don't bank on checking in early.  Other wise this was the perfect hotel location, near the parks, and shopping, and allowed us to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Bathrooms are very posh with heated towel bars and a separate shower. Would gladly stay at again.",4,2012,05,27
207,Great hotel in fabulous location!,I was very pleased with the hotel. The staff was very attentive and the location across from St Stephens park and near Trinity can't be beat. The rooms have one flaw and that is the failure to provide a hairdryer outlet in the bathroom. Fix that and it will truly be a five star!,4,2012,05,25
207,AWFUL,"I had won a night for 2 in the Shelbourne & went December with a friend of mine & I have to say the whole experience was dreadful.  When we got to reception they demanded a credit card which they hadn't told me about when I was booking, I handed over my Laser & was told that they would be taking 100 euro off my card as a security deposit, when I refused she demanded cash.  I spoke to the manager who said that a swipe of my card was ok.  Needless to say I was fuming at this stage.  The receptionist was looking down her nose at us because we had won the stay & weren't paying for it ourselves.  We had requested a smoking room & when we got up there there were no facilities.  Also I had asked for a twin room while booking but got a room with a double bed which made for an uncomfortable sleep.  The next morning we went down to breakfast & we were seated in the restaurant where the waitress loudly told us (& everyone around us) that because we weren't paying for our room we had to pay for breakfast & then left us sitting there for 10 minutes.  Eventually I left the restaurant to complain to management who apologised & sent us complimentary tea & coffee to our room.  On leaving I spoke again to the Manager about the disastrous stay & he took my details & said he would contact me to arrange another complimentary stay.  Guess what, it's now 6 months later & I still haven't received anything...would not recommend this hotel to anybody, everybody deserves to be treated with respect whether paying or not!",1,2012,05,23
207,One of my favorite hotels on the planet,"I love this hotel. It's has the perfect combination of old world charm and new world amenities both paired with an ideal location. You are walking distance from most of Dublin's attractions and those that are just out of reach walking wise are a 10 minute taxi ride away. The staff here has never failed to impress from the top-hatted doorman to the friendly housekeeping staff. The history in this hotel is impressive in itself, some can even be checked out in their little museum in the lobby. 

I average about 100 hotel nights per year so I would say my standards are a little high and this hotel is probably in my top 3 to 5 in the world.",5,2012,05,19
207,Beautiful,We stayed for 3 nights at the end of April 2012......what a magnificent hotel: beautiful chandeliers and just pure elegance. Our room was lovely and the bed simply divine!!! Just one gripe though: we got back to the room on the Friday at about 2-2:30pm to discover that our room had not been cleaned as yet. But this was sorted out with a phone-call to ' Delighted to serve'.  The staff were very friendly and we will be back to the Shelbourne. Fantastic location.......this was truly a wonderful stay!,5,2012,05,18

207,Looking forward to coming back,"I just returned yesterday from the Shelbourne and had stayed there for four nights. I truly took in this hotel in order fully appreciate the location, setting and service. Upon my early arrival from the US on Thursday a gent named fergil(spelling?) at the front desk check. He was superb. I didn't have to wait for my room and he provided me with a map of the city and pointed out all of the various attractions. I instantly felt welcomed and excited for my trip.  The bellhop took my bags up to my room and nicely showed where everything was - thermostat, luggage stand etc.  Very helpful. Loved the spacious bathroom and slept off my jet lag on a great bed in complete silence. Later that night I headed down to both 27 bar and lounge and the horseshoe bar. Both were excellent. Super service and very friendly bartenders. Food and drink were excellent as well. I enjoyed their saturday tea service which was such a greatexperience that I doubt can be duplicated elsewhere with the same elegance without being stuffy. The location can't be beat. Grafton is close as was the gaiety theatre which I went to on Friday to see greener.  Sunday night before my departure I ordered room service whilst I packed. It was fast and the tray was set up very nicely. Some hotels offer a very shoddy in room dining experience. The Shelbourne puts effort and pride into their in room experience and it shows. The only suggestion I have is for the bathroom. I would have love, love, loved a small stool tucked underneath the vanity in the bathroom. The light is fantastic in there for makeup application and I enjoyed the magnified mirror. However, its placed rather low. I handled this by moving the desk chair into the bathroom each morning and then hauling it back out when I was done.  Not a big deal, but would be a nice addition to the rooms. Overall, it was a fantastic trip. The hospitality of the Shelbourne was superb. The shops nearby were also very friendly and interesting.  I plan to come back in the winter and will definitely be staying at The Shelbourne. ",5,2012,05,15
207,Luxury,"This is my second time staying here and I wasn't disappointed, staff are v professional and v well mannered, hotel was luxury from entranced to coffee pot! Very clean and spacious. Location is excellent for night life and shopping. Will def stay again ",5,2012,05,14
207,Who could ask for anything more?,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Shelbourne for 3 nights this past April, thanks to a special rate I was able to obtain through a special travel agency program. Without the discount, I would not have been able to afford this hotel.  Every employee at the Shelbourne is a professional and the service is excellent. Rooms are very well appointed, beds are comfortable and the bathroom was spacious.  It's also seemed to be the sort of place to see and be seen. There was always a lot of activity going on at this hotel. A bit pricey, for sure, but you get what you pay for.",5,2012,05,14
207,A Beautiful Maze,"I stayed here with some colleagues for 1 night in April.  I was very pleastly surprised by the hotel, it's a really beautiful old building with lovely architectural features in pristine condition which gives the hotel an aura of absolute class.

The bar and restaurant areas are fabulous, but not intimidating or stuffy in any way - I put this down to really friendly staff.

My room was great.  Ok, I was lucky, I got a free upgrade to a suite on check in.

I didn't find any real negatives about the hotel, if I was to pick spots, I'd say that some of the corridors are a little dated.

Oh... And it's an absolute maze, I guess that the hotel has grown over the years to take on new buildings resulting in it having a completely illogical layout.",5,2012,05,11
207,Need to Review Policy,"The people were great and the hotel beautiful, however, it started off with a very bad impression when the policy to charge a high amount for internet acccess was stated.  We stayed in the most upscale properties in Ireland over a 2 week holiday and this was the only hotel that charged for internet access.  If you like me have a need for internet this is not the hotel for you.
The room was also the smallest we experienced on the trip.",2,2012,05,10
207,Excellent if it wasn't for the scam deals and farcical reservation service,"My husband and I had a gift voucher and we decided to treat ourselves on a rugby weekend when Ireland was playing Italy as we had VIP match tickets and what a way to live it up than stay amongst the team. The booking and reservation service was what I could only describe as appalling and shockingly impersonal, worst I've encountered ever!! I almost abandoned reserving on a number of occasions.

The problems started when I saw a Romantic weekend deal at 290 per person, (2 nights accomodation, champagne and strawberries and rose petals everywhere, the usual). All good. When I tried to book it on their awful Marriott reservation website, a horrendously techy site where if you go back and forth, it wipes all info you've put in, it wouldn't let me change the room occupancy to greater than one person. Eventually after an hour or so of backward and forwards online to try and change the occupancy to two, I rang the customer service line where an extremely unhelpful individual firstly told me ""My computer must be broken"" and then decided, ah the 290 is the single occupancy price for the romantic weekend (!!???) and the actual price per person if there was two was 320 per person.

 At this stage , there was smoke coming out my ears! I retorted, "" I don't know about you but I generally don't take romantic weekends away by myself, roll around alone in the rose petals which chomping down chocolate strawberries and guzzling champagne"". But 'Computer says no' was having none of it and basically told me to hump off. I had to ring reception to get their crazy techy email address and if it wasn't for the Rugby, there was NO WAY I would have reserved it!!!

The visit itself was lovely, the staff were very friendly, formal but not stiff and made us feel quite a part of it all. We dined in the restaurant on the Saturday  night and the food was gorgeous. However, with sides etc, the bill can really rack up but it was very pleasent. The room was nice, a little small but I had requested (when I eventually used my MI5 connections to get an email  address for reception), a good view and they fulfilled that. Breakfast was mediocre, good for a 3 star, not for a five star, I have had far better. Champagne was good quality. Overall the best thing about the stay was the staff and location (bit too near Brown Thomas for my wallet's liking)

Overall, an enjoyable stay completely let down by the farcical reservation service which I have no doubt is costing them occupancy. To top it all off, when I tried to claim my reward points, they don't look you up on the system if you don't have your card at the time (I was never sent one!!)) I have to post them the invoice. Enough said!! 

A weekend in Shelbourne with enough reservation anguish to tip you over the age versus a week in Marbella (same cost)

You decide.......",4,2012,05,10
207,"Afternoon Tea, a treat!","Bank holiday weekend, what better way to while away an afternoon than to take tea at the Shelbourne Hotel. The setting is a light airy space off the main lobby and the gentle tinkling of the piano welcomes you in.  Very comfortable seats add to the experience.  We were at a large table, with lots of elbow room, nothing worse than constantly hitting off the person sitting next to you.  Not an issue here.  Ample room is needed, as we were all drinking different teas, so different teapots were required! The tea menu is a joy - that's the only reason I didn't give it a 5*,there should be a coffee menu too!.

We treated ourselves to the Champagne tea, and why not, bubbly adds to the whole experience.  And anyone fearing that delicate sandwiches and miniature cakes wont be filling enough, be advised that we ( 4 hungry Irish ladies) were pleasantly full when we left. And I have to mention the scones, which were warmed and delicious, my favourite part of the tea.

Most of the tables were occupied by ladies, to be expected, but I'd recommend it too for a romantic afternoon interlude.  Its a relaxing and restful experience, and you get to eat lovely goodies too.  

So next time you are in Dublin and want to take a break from the hubbub of the city, stroll down to the Shelbourne and spend a relaxing hour or two taking tea.",4,2012,05,09
207,I'll be spending my reward points to come back here!,"I've had the pleasure of staying at the Shelbourne 3 times on business, and it is one of only a handful of hotels I'd consider coming back to for pleasure.  The rooms are spacious and well accommodated, beds extremely comfy, marvelous bath.  My only complaints about the rooms is the occasional maze-like trek to your room and the lack of a view unless you're fortunate enough to land one of the rooms facing St. Stephen's Green.  Location is perfect with myriad of dining, drinking, and shopping options mere blocks away.  Breakfast is spot on (albeit expensive for those non-platinum types), and the bar is a wonderful space, but expect it to be packed on weekend nights.  Can't say enough good things about the staff.  The front desk and lobby crew are the best I've encountered in over 100 properties I've had the pleasure (or displeasure) of visiting.  From the curb I was well greeted, bags cared for, door held open, and directions given - all with such courtesy and respect that I wish they'd bottle it.  Front desk was very accommodating when I ventured in early from the US, no wait on the room!

Great for business, great for tourists - I'll be back.",5,2012,05,08
207,The place to stay in Dublin,"If you are going to Dublin only once and can afford it then the Shelbourne is the place to stay. Great location, excellent service, stylish public rooms and comfortable bedrooms, but it is the history and ambiance that makes it stand out from the other 5* hotels. It's not perfect (it feels a little odd that reception is through towards the back of the hotel, no turn down service, rooms not exceptional) but for a romantic weekend or special trip it's impossible to beat.",4,2012,05,07
207,Why would you stay anywhere else?,"What a delightful place!  Great location, on St. Stephen's Green in Dublin, close to lots of great pubs and fine dining. Seriously, if you can't walk there from the Shelbourne, you might consider not going (except for the Guinness tour, perhaps).  The hotel bar is standing room only on Friday and Saturday nights.
The hotel offers impeccable service, quiet elegance and delightful, ample sized rooms.  Buffet-style breakfast offers healthy choices as well as the ""Full Irish"".  No request was too much for the attentive staff.
Not cheap, but worth it.  Only complaint was the 20 euro daily charge for mediocre internet connection in the room (free in the lobby, but very poor connection).  That said, it is a great place to unplug for a few days.",5,2012,05,07
207,"Location, location, location!!","There is no finer location in Dublin than St Stephen's Green and that is where the Shelboune is located. This location provides easy access to Grafton Street, Nassau Street and is a short walk to O'Connell Street. In addition to shopping, many reasonably priced restaurants are handy; Bewley's Cafe being one of the most iconic. The staff was very efficient and service minded, even providing a copy of the history of the hotel upon request. 
Cookies appear at the reception desk daily. We found  the breakfast room menu  to be rather expensive.  However at the National Gallery of Art, just a few blocks away,  a very reasonably priced breakfast is available in the cafe. 
The Dublin Bus tours, horse drawn carriage rides and even the amphibian Viking boat tour make stops across the street from the Shelbourne.",4,2012,05,06
207,Top Hotel in Dublin!,"This is hotel is an amazing place. First, it is very historical in terms of Irish history but also many celebrities and world leaders have stayed at this hotel.  The lobby impresses you when you first walk in but the staff is so attentive that the make you feel like a king or queen. The rooms are a little pricey but I was upgraded to a suite (since I am a Marriott Rewards member) and I will tell you it was just about the most amazing room (Earl of Shelbourne Suite) I have ever stayed in!  We when arrived we were also whisked off to a wonderful buftet breakfast as our room was being cleaned.  We ate the buffet breakfast both mornings and everything was delicious and the fruit was the best.  It was a wonderful experience staying as this hotel as everytime I came back to the hotel it was greeted by the doorman with a smiling hello!",5,2012,05,06
207,Classy and good value,"From the moment you walk through the door, you're in a different world.  There's old fashioned courtesy from all the staff with great attention to detail.

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an executive room.  It was gorgeous and the huge beds were divinely comforitable.  Our friends stayed in a standard room and it was equally luxurious, just a bit smaller.

The deal included breakfast which was a treat in the dining room full of character.

An added bonus is the location- right in the heart of Dublin.  A second bonus is to stay in an hotel with such historic connections - you won't believe who's stayed there - until you visit its interesting museum by the reception.",5,2012,05,05
207,High Quality & Great Location,"My first stay at the Shelbourne for a one night business trip.  Small but tasteful lobby with nice foyer and livingroom and a small museum nook.  I had the lowest priced category room that looked into an inner courtyard which was ok for me as it was very quiet.  The room was very small but efficiently arranged.  The bed was very comforable with high quality linens.  As the room was so small, it had a ""multi-use"" combination desk, tv stand, minibar, dresser. There was no room to keep a chair at it, but one was nearby to pull over for sitting at the ""desk.""  The bathroom was also very small, but with an strangely large shower (almost half of the bathroom). The sink was tiny with no space to put any grooming items.  Bathroom aminities were on the slim side.  Robes, slippers and iron were in the small closet. Turn-down service only ""on request."" Good selection of tv channels.  
Although very small, it was very well decorated and comfortable.  For a quick overnight trip I would rather be in the smallest room of a fine hotel than a larger room of a lessor hotel and the location is great.  For a longer stay or more than one person I'd spend more for larger room.",4,2012,05,04
207,indulgance!!!! amazing experience,ok travellers this is a hotel and a half. imagine while we were waiting to check in we  were treated to homemade mini icecream cone lemonade and cakes..... i ve never seen that before. This hotel is a full on spectacular feast. you know from the second the valet takes your car to the check in experiece that the rest is more of the same calabre. Beautifully decorated huge floral arrangements everywhere and the famous horse shoe bar is the only place to be if you want to rub shoulders with celebs. Now i do suggest dressing up and be prepared to spend it is pricey but it is a total experience . If your like me a bit of indulgance now and again goes along way to staving off the blues on a wet dull afternoon. Enjoy the sights and sounds of Dublin while staying at a premeire hotel. ,5,2012,05,04
207,A little expensive but worth it,"We found the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin to be very fine and welcoming. The door staff in particular were always ready to advise us on where to go and what to see in Dublin. We only stayed for two nights and yes, it was a little on the expensive side but for location it is practical and close to everything. We could see the ducks in the Stephens Green Park. Denis the concierge is a wonder, a veritable encyclopedia of knowledge. Thank you to the staff!",4,2012,05,03
207,Shelbourne makes for a great visit!,"Yes, this is a Marriott property but it's Irish all the way.  An historic building, the Shelbourne has its own littl museum.  Rooms are large and maybe more importantly, our bathroom was large and well lighted.  The Irish breakfast is plenty hardy to get you through until dinner if you like--bit if you are counting calories there are plenty of choices like oatmeal and excellent fruit.  The staff was always helpful and never grumpy but that seems to be the Irish way. Terrific location, within walking distance of almost everything and across the street from the beautiful Stevens Green Park.  And they complementary post your cards which makes thing easy!",5,2012,05,01
207,nice hotel,"This is our second stay at this hotel in the last two years, and both times we havnt been lucky enough to experience a room overlooking the park.. the first time we stayed we were not as bothered as we thought the hotel more then made up for the lack of view you get at the back of the hotel ie, office block .but im afraid our stay this time was spoilt . we had hoped for a lie inn but as we checked inn on a thursday our first morning we were woken up at seven in the morning by one of the office staff car alarm . it carried on making a loud noise for a whole twenty minute .by this point me and my husband were wide awake . as you can appreciate as a couple who dont get a long lie in it bothered us. if this had happened at the front of the hotel im sure the doorman etc would of acted quickly to sort the problem but as it was the rear of the hotel this wasn't attended too. this has made our decision to maybe stay in another hotel in the near future when we come back this year with other family members for a mini break,i must point out we love this hotel and we would love to stay again but dont want to chance being put at the back of the hotel a third time in a row ...the staff are great and restaurant food breakfast is first class so that is my only negative but it is a big problem .",4,2012,04,30
207,Perfect for our Honeymoon!,"We started a 12-day honeymoon trip through Europe here at the Shelbourne and could not have picked a better place or location.  We arrived at 10am knowing that we would likely have to drop off our bags and wait for the 3:00pm check-in, but upon arrival not only was our room ready but we were upgraded to a Deluxe King Room instead of the standard room.  After a long overnight flight I cannot put into words how comfortable that bed was!  We also had a large bathtub and plenty of space in the room to relax.  Another huge advantage was the proximity to St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Trinity College, Oscar Wilde's statue and plenty of great shops and pubs.  Also, bought the 2 day Dublin City Bus pass and there was a stop just 1 1/2 blocks away from the hotel taking us to everything we wanted to see in Dublin.  The staff was gracious and helpful and the concierge staff was fantastic!  They made several reservations for us and even printed out google maps so we wouldn't have trouble walking to a specific destination.

My only complaints are expensive internet and food.  But there was so much to see and do near the hotel that we certianly didn't mind.  Thanks for a wonderful start to our honeymoon!",5,2012,04,27
207,Very very good hotel,"Background to review
I have spent many an evening in the bar and / or restaurant of the Shelbourne Hotel but this was my first time staying over.

Rooms
I thought the room was lovely, with opulent furnishings and a lovely view over St Stephen's Green, but a tad small. The bathroom was rather spacious though and a great delight.

Food - Room Service
We enjoyed room service on a few occasions and although one order appeared forgotten, the food was fine. 

Food - Restaurant
Dinner in the restaurant was nice, but not outstanding. The service was typical 5 star - attentive without overt friendliness. 

Service
Front desk staff upon check in were nice and welcoming and attentive. Upon check out this service was more abrupt and procedural.

Location
The location is a lovely part of Dublin but is still a good 10 minute walk to Grafton St. It is a nice area in which to stay and central to most attractions",4,2012,04,27
207,Lovely!,"Great hotel, location excellent and staff friendly.
Will be back again

Thank you",5,2012,04,27
207,Luxury and elegance,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights--my first trip to Dublin.  Felt as if I were royalty.  The staff is wonderful.  They couldn't have been more helpful.  Lots of good advice on where to go, where to eat and where to shop.  Breakfast offers enough choices to make everyone happy.  Our room was comfortable and provided so many amenities.  Great starting place to sight see.  We were able to walk to so many of the sights.  Would definitely stay again if I return to Dublin.",5,2012,04,26
207,Only one night but can't fault it - excellent hotel,"Stayed here for my 40th birthday last September. The proximity of the hotel to the main shopping area of Dublin (Grafton Street) and the main attractions made it perfect for us. The hotel staff were as expected excellent. The bar at the front of the hotel was also fantastic and have to say had the best mojito cocktail ever! There is also the horseshoe pub that is kind of behind reception which is a great meeting spot or place for a last few scoops before turning in!
Rooms were perfect - didn't actually notice anything out of place as we only spent one night - worth mentioning the windows were well sound proofed from the main street outside which was important as you'd be woken early otherwise.
Normally I'd (we) would stay outside of Dublin when visiting but as we intended to be in central Dublin on this visit it was perfect.",4,2012,04,26
207,Loved it!!,"Stayed for 2 nights at the Shelbourne and loved it.  The location was perfect for walking along the streets of Dublin, or jumping on the Hop on Hop off busses.   Little grocery store a couple doors down, and no problems taking the aircoach from the airport.  The staff was very pleasant, helping us with all our questions.  The beds are plush and very comfortable, and the bathroom was huge!!  Nice towels, slippers, and lotions, etc. Will definately stay again when in Dublin.",5,2012,04,25
207,Great stay,"Room 180 felt tlike I had thrown a triple top as well! Great place, great city, great staff.",5,2012,04,25
207,Afternoon Tea - abit disappointing,"On arrival we were quickly seated in the lovely tea room and explained the menu. I had been originally told my 9 year old daughter would be half price for half an afternoon tea which was fine, but on arrival I was told that they did not do children’s afternoon tea so she could either share ours or order off the food menu. She was very disappointed but she just shared ours. We were seated right beside the piano which was unfortunate as we could barely hear eachother speak. 

Our food and tea arrived, not followed by the butter, cream and jam for the scones. We had to ask for these. The sandwiches were a big letdown, very basis egg sandwiches, cucumber sandwiches (which we didn’t eat) and salmon which wouldn’t be our favourite but we were not offered the option of changing them for something more to our taste. The cakes were nicely presented and tasted good. We had to ask several times for our teapot to be refilled which took about 15 - 20 minutes in total. 

We really found the service lacking the Saturday we were there which did take away from the experience.",3,2012,04,25
207,You must visit or stay at this hotel!!,"Take a walk through St. Stephens Green and then visit or stay here!!!

The hotel is fabulous!

The staff is even better.

You will want for nothing and truly feel important!!

One of the best I have ever experienced!!!

Enjoy!!",5,2012,04,23
207,Excellent Luxury in Central Dublin,"Stayed 2 nights with my wife and 2-year old son.  The room had a short corridor between the main sleeping area and the bathroom, which was a perfect location for the cot that the hotel provided for our son.  The room was very comfortable and quiet, the bathroom was spectacular.  Service was great, the staff are very prompt, helpful and attentive. Location is wonderful, across the street from Stephen's Green on the south side of central Dublin.  Internet connection was fast and reliable.  We would have stayed much longer, but for the cost!",5,2012,04,23
207,Didn't stay but had a fabulous afternoon tea!,"Visiting Dublin and meeting up with some US friends who were over in Ireland, I would have loved to have stayed at the Shelbourne.  However, on a budget, the costs were a little rich for my blood.
We stayed, instead, at the Marriott Ashbourne (slightly north of Dublin city centre which I will review separately) but compromised by having afternoon tea at the Shelbourne one afternoon.

The hotel itself is situated right oppposite St Stephen's park, slap bang in the middle of the city centre.  We booked our tea via our hotel ~ advisable as this was on a Thursday morning for that afternoon and there were only 2 tables left, so unlikely you can walk in off the street.

There are 2 sittings, an early one (not sure what time guess around 2pm) and the later one we took at 3.30pm ~ although we did arrive a tad early and they accommodated us as people from the earlier sitting had already left so no hanging around for us!

Dress code is smart, no jeans or trainers which adds to the general ambience of the place.
It really is a little bit of heaven in the middle of a busy city.  The tea room is gorgeous, beautiful high ceilings, ornately decorated and each table has enough privacy to be comfortable but informal at the same time.

The tea itself ~ well, wow!
Despite not having had anything to eat since breakfast, we struggled to finish and ended up leaving some bits and pieces ... simply too full!

There is an amazing range of teas on offer ~ they are also happy for you to swop and try any number of different ones throughout the afternoon.

The tea starts with a lovely selection of sandwiches, which can be changed around if necessary ~ I don't eat meat ~ with minimal fuss.
Then bring on the cakes, pastries, enormous scones with jam and clotted cream and also a 'champagne jelly' in a small glass.
Refils of everything, including the sandwiches are routinely offered ~ we only took up the option of more jam and cream!

Dublin being part of the Eurozone, is an expensive city.  I live just outside London and I thought the prices were high.  Whilst a stay at the Sherbourne will definitely bend the credit card a bit, not so the afternoon tea.  When London hotels provide teas, often not as high standard as the one we enjoyed here, routinely they charge exhorbitant rates ~ Browns is currently £75 per head or more with champagne!

We decided against the champagne option ~ although again this is reasonable ~ and ended up paying E24.95 per person ~ astonishing value!

Would I go again ~ just try to keep me away!",5,2012,04,21
207,Classy hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Comfortable property with top notch service.  My best friend and I stayed 4 nights in early April.  Hotel room (King) was spacious and included a US plug in which was helpful.  The bar and food was excellent.  You are literally 1 block from the hop on hop off bus and positioned in the middle of the city so walking to pubs, great resturants, shopping and historic sites is easy.  Cookies are in the lobby in the late evening which is a nice touch.  There are four areas to eat/drink.  There is not a gift shop but there is a 24/7 c-store 1 block down and some items are available through the hotel staff.  There are 3 five star resturants in a 2 block radius.  Donohues pub is down the street and a local favorite.  While there we took 2 tours: Bus ride to Belfast and the Carrik-a-rede rope bridge / Gallway area and then one train/bus ride to Limerick / Burnratty Castle / Cliffs of Moher.  Loved both! They take all day but give you a nice view of the country.  While in Dublin, try the 2 hour Historic Walking Tour which meets at Trinity College (ask for the tour guide Donel; he has a PhD in Irish history and language - he is skilled). The hotel is about a 15-20 minute ride from the airport.  We had no issues, and experienced happy employees during our stay.  I would go back in a minute ;)",5,2012,04,21
207,Lovely Birthday Treat,"My wife and I spent a night in the Shelbourne on April 14th to celebrate our birthdays and had a lovely relaxing time in our home city. The room was lovely, the bathroom was heaven and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast room was lovely and service good. Slight quibble would be the breakfast buffet which was a tad disappointing as hot food was just not fresh enough. Whole experience was a real treat for us.",4,2012,04,20
207,The Best!,"Just back from a week in Ireland. Can not say enough about the the Shelbourne Hotel. First class all the way! The location is perfect, nice safe neighborhood. From the moment we arrived we felt so welcomed. Starting with a really early check in 5:30 am. Our room was large and comfortable. The staff went above and beyond for us. Miss you Jane! Can't wait to go back.",5,2012,04,20
207,Second time lucky,"We went to the Shelbourne last year staying on a Saturday  night with a wedding in flow. it felt like being in a busy station and the bar was too crowded to enter. So we felt neutral when we got a gift voucher for a night.
The experience this time was so different. The room was lovely (a complimentary upgrade). The staff were friendly, efficient and made you feel pampered without being too effusive. The hotel was a nice level of buzz on a Thursday night. It is in a brilliant location and  I do understand why people like the hotel, but I still would avoid busy wedding weekends.",5,2012,04,20
207,Fantastic hotel,"We just returned from a two night break in the Shelbourne Hotel.  It was excellent. The hotel has a central location in the heart of Dublin, the staff are helpful and caring, the room well appointed and the whole experience 5 star.

Eliza on reception was extremely helpful in dealing with a minor issue, which made us feel at ease and affirmed that guests were a priority.

We had breakfast included in our package. This was top quality food with excellent service and a lovely start each day to our adventures in Dublin.  

The hotel is just off Grafton Street (a great shopping area) and looks out onto the St Stephens Green Park (beautiful for a stroll).  The Gaiety Theatre is 500 yds away and well worth checking out to see if there's a good show on. We enjoyed a musical during our stay.

No hesitation in recommending this fantastic hotel.  We'll be back and soon.",5,2012,04,17
207,The Best,"What a beautiful property.  The service was 1st class.  Rooms were great with incredible beds.  Its the most historic hotel in Dublin and you can see buy their guest list why its top rated. 

My son got sick and the Concierge was fantastic in helping me find a doctor and getting us in right away to see him.

You wont go wrong here....its a great hotel.  It even has its own museum that outlines the rich history of the hotel",5,2012,04,16
207,Historic Hotel with great service,"We recently spent 4 nights at this landmark hotel.  The room was spacious for a Eurpean Hotel and the staff could not have been nicer.  If you want a good location this hotel is perfect.  

The restaurant was first class as well and the bar was a nice place to have a quiet drink.  We did not have afternoon tea but there were no shortage of folks taking advantage of the lovely setting.",5,2012,04,14
207,Beautiful Dublin Hotel,The best place to stay in Dublin. When walking into the hotel you are greeted with excellent service and the staff is very friendly. Walking distance to everything! The bar and dining area is breath-taking and I it made us feel special. This is the only place to stay in Dublin.,5,2012,04,14

207,Wonderful trip!,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for our last 2 nights in Ireland. From the doorman, car valets, restaurant staff, concierge, check in staff, housekeeping, everyone was wonderful!! Beds with the pillow tops were so comfortable! The extra touch of the ""easter bunny"" leaving chocolates the night before was so cute!! Breakfast buffet was delicious and we had dinner 1 night in the restaurant which was beyond yummy!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",5,2012,04,11
207,Nice...Overrated,"This was the fourth hotel in our trip, and I was looking forward to a larger upscale hotel, with things missing in the smaller villages of our travels around Ireland.  Upon arrival, it is a great property, formal bellman, and staff, with an impressive entry area.  We had been upgraded to a deluxe room, and it was nothing special.  Now I know we are in a Dublin, which is a bigger city, so rooms aren't going to be big.  The rooms were clean, no turn down service, so if you took a late clean up break, a call for towels had to be made.  The bars were top shelf, food was ""ok"" at best.

Not sure why in a major international city as Dublin, you have to pay for internet in your hotel room.  Even the common areas where WiFi was free, it had odd pass codes, and was temperamental.  We talked to many Americans who stated the same in all of Europe (?).

In all the 4 Ireland hotels we stayed in, this was the first one I wanted to sleep on the floor!  this bed was the worst.  My wife loves these soft, down beds, that have a low settling point in the center of the bed - I hate them, they remind me of an old worn out mattress!

This hotel was an excellent location.  10 minute walk form all the good spots in Dublin, and we had a great time.  Not sure I'd stay there again, maybe look for another 5 star hotel next time.",4,2012,04,11
207,Special birthday,"We stayed at the Shellbourne 16th 17th and 18th March for my wifes birthday which was on St Patricts day . The whole expirence at the Shellbourne was fantastic the staff couldnt do enough for you espicially on such a busy weekend. The little touches such as leaving chocs for me on return on my birthday to having 24hr room service nothing was too much trouble. We throughly enjoyed the cocktails at the end of the evening in the Mayors Lounge such luxuary, we will stay again but not on such a busy weekend, I would like to thank all the staff for making us feel so welcome and to the receiptionist who arranged for us to keep the room on until 7pm as we were not leaving until 8pm.
Thank you for making her special birthday SO SPECIAL",5,2012,04,11
207,"Great, Great Stay!",Stayed in the Shelbourne last week and our experience was well above our expectations.  Great Marriott property.  I have stayed in many Marriott's and this was hands down the best service I have ever encountered.  Extra compliments go to Jane who helped us with everything! Thanks for making our trip to Ireland get off on the right foot!,5,2012,04,10
207,They treat everyone royally!,"We had two nights there for a special wedding anniversary.  We were upgraded to a Heritage Room and had delicious hand made chocolates delivered to our room on the special night!  The Heritage Rooms are excellent, spacious with all you could wish for.  It is well worth paying for the upgrade if you have to.  Breakfast is buffet style but will equip you very well for a long day touring some of the city's great tourist sights.  A special is the home made porridge, with cream and a little dash of Irish whiskey!  The staff are all very welcoming, from the Car Valets, through Check-in, Room Service and Restaurant.  Nothing is a problem, and they are always ready to answer your query.  The Grand Dame of Stephen's Green is a must stay in Dublin.",5,2012,04,10
207,A review of the bar: Fantastic,"We first decided to have a drink after having a chat with the friendly doormen about the cocktails (he recommended a mojito!) and we quickly fell in love with the bar at The Shelbourne.

The bar is large and comfortable and the service impeccable. The bar snacks you receive when ordering a drink are a pleasant touch and served as a tasty filler between meals! I have now also become a fan of frozen cocktails after the waitress convinced me to try one.

The price of a drink in The Shelbourne is surprisingly competitive (it was less for a round in there than in our basic, standard 3 star hotel bar on the outskirts of the city!) and the smart/casual dress code in the bar makes it a delightful place to pass the time.",5,2012,04,09
207,"Terrific, we loved our stay here.and can't wait to come back.","We came to play golf. First let me say, don't come to Dublin just for golf (great courses)...it's way too much fun a town to have to get up early to play. 
We really enjoyed The Shelbourne, even in spite of our rooms not being ready when they should have been, and the bellman mixing up all our luggage. It didn't matter and seemed just a small glitch on what was a very busy Saturday. The rooms and beds are traditional and comfortable, the staff is fantastic and friendly, the bars and public spaces are great, the breakfast is excellent (one of the best), the location on St. Stephens Green perfect. We've been coming up with excuses to get back to Dublin ever since we left.",5,2012,04,08
207,Excellent service and accommodations.,We were treated very well by every staff member we encountered.  I loved the history of the hotel.  The location was perfect.,5,2012,04,07
207,Wonderful hotel!,"We just got back from Ireland and stayed at the Shelbourne hotel in Dublin. It was great. The location is prefect - right in the middle of everything and easy walking. The service was also very good - especially the concierge Dennis. He arranged a private car for us one day and dinner reservations on a couple of evenings. The room was small, the bathroom huge (great shower and the makeup mirror was so nice) and the bed extremely comfortable. We had tea one afternoon and it was very good (finger sandwiches and scones were especially yummy). It was my birthday and they even brought out some treats with Happy Birthday written – so nice! We had breakfast every morning and it was delicious.",4,2012,04,07
207,Afternoon tea just divine!,"I recently enjoyed a wonderful Afternoon tea at the Shelbourne Hotel on a Sunday afternoon.  The surroundings were warm, comfortable and luxurious with an open fire and live piano music. The staff were helpful and accommodating without being overbearing.  At €25 per head it was an affordable treat with so many pastries and scones that we actually took some home!  We sipped our tea (from a generous menu of teas available) and chatted for over 3 hours and never felt under pressure to leave.  It was really a lovely experience... I know where I'm going for my next birthday!",5,2012,04,03
207,"Great Hotel, if a bit pricey !","I was on work at this hotel and due to the late flight only had time for a few Guinness in the bar. Great bar and very popular !
Room was very large even if somewhat ""quaint"" - but eh it’s not a boutique design hotel ! If you don’t have an offer including breakfast I would eat out  - very expensive !

People very friendly.

Spa should now open end of 2012.",5,2012,04,02
207,Fantastic!,"This hotel was sperfect in every way...hospitality, charm, and location!",5,2012,04,01
207,St Patrick's Day,"I just spent St. Patrick Day weekend at the Shelbourne Hotel.  What an excellent location ( St Stephens Green), staff was friendly, breakfast in the saddle room was fantastic and reasonable, great selection of fruits, meat and pastries,  ( I reccommend the scones) and tea by the fire place cozy.  The room were spacious and comfortable,  we had three of us in one room (king size bed and cot).  Most of the guests were from Ireland and in for the celebration..The Bar is a happening place at night with locals coming in to enjoy the hotels atomosphere.  Shopping is right around the corner and the National Concert Hall is jus up the street where we spent St. Patrick's evening watching a live broadcast of traditional Irish Music.",5,2012,03,31
207,Outstanding service in a grand hotel,"Ww spent the final 4 days of our 2 week European vacation and it was the perfect treat to end our trip.  The location on St Stephens Green is central to transportation, culture, music and shopping.  The staff are very helpful, pleasant and plentiful.  We found the concierge especially helpful and worked with them daily.  Breakfast in the Saddle Room is not to be missed!  It was included with our room.  There is a large, fresh buffet as we as a small but delicious menu to choose from.  I would rank this hotel in the top ten that I have ever had the pleasure of staying at.",5,2012,03,30
207,Nothing in Dublin quite compares to The Shelbourne,"This will be my first 5-Star review (I think) after over 20 reviews on Tripadvisor. Our Friday night at The Shelbourne was as close to heaven as we are likely to get - great service, warm welcome, great location and fab room - not to mention wonderful breakfast. 

The fact that we were upgraded from the Heritage Park View room we had booked to a suite may have helped (!), but our experience outside this fab room also gave us so much pleasure. 

First the room - beautifully proportioned bedroom and bathroom. The ""other"" room was big enough to entertain a party of 10 guests in style. Only gripe was that we noticed pillows were extremely firm - at 2am as we were about to go to bed. I called housekeeping, who delivered 4 soft pillows straightaway, with no fuss. Expected that the spare pillows would be of different firmness to the ones on the bed - but couldn't find any spares. 

Enjoyed breakfast - very comfortable surroundings, tables well-spaced, porridge made on milk or on water (!), with honey straight off the honeycomb to sweeten it.  Toast delivered while still warm. Selection of fresh fruit might have been wider and selection of cheese was a bit disappointing - no provenance noted (a lost opportunity to promote our high quality Irish farm-house cheeses). But these are moot points in a really pleasant, relaxing experience. 

We dined elsewhere in the city, but returned for a few drinks to the hotel. There is a buzz in this hotel like no other in Dublin - mostly Irish guests, not normally resident in Dublin, intent on living it up for a night or two in this great hotel.  The main bar here is the place to go to enjoy true Irish craic.

Why will I return? - genuinely friendly staff, stylish and comfortable surroundings, great location (at the nexus between good pubs and great restaurants around Baggot St., with shopping and more casual dining available around Grafton St.).  Would I enjoy it do much in a more standard room - less so, no doubt, but absolutely enough to call me back for a return visit!",5,2012,03,28
207,Still my favorite Dublin Hotel!,"There are many reasons I am always drawn back to the Shelbourne, even after staying in another fine hotel in Dublin.  The service, location, comfort  and beauty are certainly among those reasons.  The staff cannot do enough for you.  As others have said, the breakfast is wonderful (ours was included with our room), and the bar is a fun place to socialize and a reasonable place to eat a light meal.  Only one minor negative about this hotel is the high fee for Internet (wifi) use.  We stayed at three other 5 star hotels on our Ireland trip this month (Lough Erne Resort, The G and the  Ritz Carlton Powerscourt) and the Shelbourne is the only hotel that even charged for Internet service.  This hotel is much too high class to do this.  Other than that, it gets an A+!!!",5,2012,03,27
207,"classic, clean and comfy!","Shelbourne is my go to hotel in Dublin. Although room sizes and layouts vary depending on which part of the hotel you are in, the rooms are always clean and comfortable. The lobby, lounges and restaurants are all very classic and the scene in the bars is memorable. Breakfast is a bit expensive if not included in your room price but is always fresh and appealing. My interactions with staff are efficient and pleasant. Great location and the fireplace in the lobby is a classy touch!",4,2012,03,23
207,Amazing staff & service,Not only was the hotel amazing but the staff took it to the next level! We were treated like royalty during our entire stay. The room was beautiful. The food was great & the bar was a great social setting! ,5,2012,03,22
207,"Classy, understated luxury. A great example of a grand city hotel.","Stayed in Feb '12 on a Saturday night, just my wife and I, and had a very relaxing and comfortable stay.

Everything at The Shelbourne is just nicely done.  The decor, the furniture, the bars, the service.  It's not ostentatious, it's just very, very comfortable, friendly and pleasant.  Everything a good hotel should be.

The rooms are very well appointed with very comfortable and spacious beds, proper blackout curtains, decent sized and well fitted-out bathrooms and good TVs.  Ours (on the 8th floor I thnk) had floor-ceiling windows and view south to the Wicklow mountains.

Overall, I can highly recommend The Shelbourne. I would definitely return and would really look forward to it.",5,2012,03,22
207,Wonderful lobby bar and social scene,"The Shelbourne is a spectacular hotel right on St. Stephan's Green. Although I stayed at the Conrad (right down the street) I visited the main lobby bar at the Shelbourne on several occasions.  Although on the pricey side, it's very elegant and a spectacular place for people watching. The bar is packed every evening from about 5 PM with local business people and tourists. I highly recommend it.",5,2012,03,21
207,"Lovely hotel, but breakfast and wifi prices are a rip off","We love this hotel. It's at the heart of Dublin and always has a lively buzz - even when it's not the 6 nations weekend. You always feel special staying here and this is a grand hotel that's maintained its standards and status. The rooms are lovely and the service from all the staff is delightful.

But, why charge €20 a day for wifi, when budget hotels chuck it in for free? There's something so grasping about charging obscene rates for what is today a utility that is as basic as hot water. Some five star hotels just haven't learned the lesson of the land line telephones (multiplying standard rates). If it's a utility, build it into the price. I probably won't go elsewhere for €20 on the room rate, but I will cavill at seeing €60 extra stuck on to my bill over three days. In fact I couldn't bear to do it more than once.

Same for breakfast - the buffet is €29 per head. To put that into context, Bewleys, the iconic landmark coffee house around the corner charges €9.85 for the full Irish including coffee or tea (with refills) and freshly squeezed orange juice, all freshly cooked and served to your table. It is at least the equal of the Shelbourne Buffet experience and in many respects better. So we just walked out and ate round the corner every day.

Now don't think I am some penny-pinching innocent abroad, who doesn't get the five star experience (or what it costs to provide). You'll see from my reviews that I travel a lot, stay in high end places and don't begrude paying top dollar when you get value for it. But whether it's my money or the company's there's a basic line in the sand of what's value for money and what's not. I'd happily pay €18 and eat in for breakfast. But not €29. Many will, because hunting out an alternative first thing is not very convenient - and the Shelbourne know it. But it rather sticks in the craw.

Shame really, and actually the Shelbourne lost out. We all walked out for breakfast every day, logged onto the wifi just once, but had the whole grand ccentral hotel experience for a very good rack rate (through Expedia).",4,2012,03,19
207,The Shelbourne has history and style in abundance!,"Great hotel, efficient staff and a wonderful bar. Am torn between staying here or The Merrion when in Dublin!",5,2012,03,19
207,great hotel and location,"great stay over st Patricks day.

Breakfast pretty good and the hotel is spcious and has good bars

only thing was we seemed to keep getting a cot put in the room, but saw the funny side of it all the time.  Would def. stay again",5,2012,03,19
207,Shelbourne Dublin Has It All,"This may be the first time I gush about a hotel, but this is the closest to a perfect hotel experience that I have ever had.  I booked the room for a Saturday night, March 3, 2012.  I had reserved the hotel online, trying to get a nice hotel at a reasonable price.  Sometimes, when you show up at a four or five star hotel with an online reservation, you are treated like some other hotel's leftovers, given a small room near the ice machine or worse.  This was absolutely NOT the case with the Shelbourne.  As we left our cab a bellman was at our side taking our bags.   We entered one of the most beautiful lobbies I have seen in awhile.  There were at least two fireplaces, marble and amazing chandeliers.  I am American and many of our four and five star hotels have the same sterile business look in their lobbies.   Not so here.  There were two seating areas, a tea room (with a dress code to complement its antique furniture), a bar facing the street (No. 27 with a full menu and music on Friday and Saturday nights and was open every time we saw it), and a second more intimate bar open in the evenings. They also have a spectacular restaurant, the Saddle Room.  Oh yes, I almost forgot...it has a small museum as well, as it is one of Dublin's landmark hotels.  All of this is on the first floor.  A dramatic staircase leads to a large conference room for catered events such as weddings.

The Bellman escorted to the check-in desk where the manager was both cordial and professional.  He explained that our room had been upgraded for the evening so it was a bit bigger than was stated on our reservation.  (This is another thing I like about this hotel is that it actually tells you in advance the size of the room prior to arrival--no surprises.)  A bigger room, no problem!  The hotel, considered the number one hotel in Dublin, has eight floors, 243 rooms, and 19 suites (these have a private elevator).  It has a work-out room and promises a spa this summer.  Additionally, you can hire a genealogy butler for one hour who will help you trace your Irish ancestors for a mere 100 pounds.  That seemed intriguing to me. 

The room, on the fifth floor, was as advertised meaning it actually looked like the photos on the hotel's website.  The view wasn't so great, but we didn't really care and we didn't lack for anything.   The room was quiet at all times with no extraneous hallway or neighboring TVs noise entering our room.  The king size bed had a firm mattress with fabulous pillows from Germany.  I don't know what they were stuffed with, but they were neither to hard nor too soft/thin.  A down comforter covered the bed.  We were given four pillows and allowed more if needed.  The lighting consisted of several well placed lamps by the bed and TV so you could adjust it as needed.  The TV was a bit small, about 36-inch diameter, but we didn't watch much TV.  Channel selection should please most from the US or Europe.  We were given a hair dryer, robes with slippers, and even an umbrella lest we forgot ours (after all it is Ireland!).  The bathroom was a light marble with a full bathtub and shower.  The shampoo, conditioner, soap and body lotion were well chosen.  Don't be fooled by the soap advertising it will give you ""zest""...it is not Zest soap from the US which dries my skin out quickly.  No it is a wonderful moisture soap without any harsh ingredients.
The next morning we decided to have breakfast at the hotel.  My only regret was that I had not included breakfast in my room rate as Sunday breakfast is expensive (28 pounds per person for the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen).  You can order items separately (pancakes, juice, coffee, omelet, Eggs Benedict) as well.  But, since everything is charged ala carte, you are better served going with the buffet.  Fresh fruit, yogurt, breads, puddings, cheese, omelets made-to-order, cereals of all kinds, granola, juice, and bacon are just some of the items I remember.  If you look at the pictures of the restaurant, we sat in the booth with the gold upholstery.  It was clean and comfortable.

The Shelbourne's is located next to St. Stephens park, which puts you within walking distance of just about everything there is to do in Dublin.  This includes Grafton Street, the park itself, Trinity University, and Temple Bar Area.  You should know, however, that the city locks the gates of the park about 6 pm in the evening. What a concept!  Not sure how I feel about it.  For those places a bit too far to walk such as the Guiness or Jameson tours, a cab stand is right outside the hotel.

When it came time to leave, check-out was effortless.  You can view charges in your room and everyone at the desk took time to explain bills to patrons.  The desk clerks even seemed to know several of the guests by name.  We hated to leave.  The last thing I considered as we left the hotel was how well trained and friendly the staff was.  This hotel should be used as the benchmark of what a hotel should be.",5,2012,03,14
207,Fantastic weekend at the Shelbourne,"We stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin for 1 night in Feb 2012.  We were in Dublin to watch the Ireland v Italy 6 Nations Rugby with my Wife and 3 primary school age children.  We were a bit apprehensive of staying in Dublin over such a busy weekend based on previous experiences at other 5* hotels in recent years.  However this was probably one of the best hotel stays that we have ever experienced (& I spend over 50 nights per year in hotels).

On arrival we were met by the doorman and valet parking who sorted out our luggage and car.  The doorman was very friendly and explained that the Irish Rugby team was staying at the hotel & we could meet them in 30 minutes (this was a real suprise).  Checkin was very efficient and friendly with complentary cookies to please the kids, as a Marriott Gold cardholder we also got complementary drinks vouchers and free full Irish Breakfast.  

Our room was a larger park view with 2 double beds and a massive marble bathroom with separate bath and shower.  After checking out the room we made our way back to the foyer which at this stage was getting quite crowded with Irish Rugby supporters.  The hotel staff were very plesant and made sure that residents were in the best position to meet the team frist before allowing members of the public in.  We met the Irish Rugby team and walked the 25 mins to the Aviva stadium while my wife and Daughter walked 2 minutes to Grafton Street for some retail therapy.

After he game we all met up and had dinner in 'Fire' restraunt around the corner on Dawson Street.  We had a great nights sleep in the room and the breakfast in the morning was fantastic.  There was no wait for a table (even though the hotel was fully booked), the food was hot and tasty and the waiter was very friendly and helpful. We got a late checkout to 4pm and stayed for afternoon tea which is very relaxing.

In general the staff at this hotel are probably the most attentive & friendly team that I have encountered in my many hotel stays and by far better than ANY other hotel in Dublin (or Ireland for that matter).  I would like to thank the hotel staff for making a special weekend even more special and memorable.",5,2012,03,12
207,Perfect Hotel Location in Dublin,"Stayed in hotel for rugby weekend.. Ireland v Scotland. 

Staff cannot do enough for you very friendly and accommodating.

Overall experience was brilliant i cannt find anything to complain about.

Breakfast selection was perfect with a wide range if foods for everybody. 

Will definitely return on my next stay in Dublin.",5,2012,03,11
207,Perfect for a Week-end Getaway!,"Decided to stay over in Dublin for the night after going to see a show in the Gaiety Theatre, so as a treat we booked into The Shelbourne, which is well known for being a splendorous hotel.  When we arrived we were warmly wellcomed and shown every courtesy, but without being harassed by a concierge or bellboy.  Check-in was very quick and we were seen straight away, but we were fairly late arriving.

The room itself was small, but very comfortable and well finished, the bed was probably one of the most comfortable i've encountered in my travels.  The room was air conditioned and was easy to set to suit your preference.  Once again, hotel with cork screw in room (excellent!).

Later on, had drinks in the members bar which was very comfortable and good service.  The next morning we went to breakfast, which was not restricted to rediculous hours.  Breakfast was a buffet of hot or cold breakfast, which were fresh and pretty good. No complaints there.

All told it was a great stay and it realy felt like a treat.

Only complaints I have is that it was fairly expensive, but not rediculous; and hotel parking was too expensive to be use, and there is much cheaper parking at St. Stephen Green.",4,2012,03,10
207,"Fantastic Location,","Firstly this is an historic hotel set in a great location in the centre of Dublin - opposite St Stephens Green and a few minutes walk to Grafton Street and many of the shops, bars and restaurants.  You are constantly reminded of the historic past of the hotel, with a detailed account in the bedroom, in the small ""museum"" off the lobby, and the various pictures etc scattered throughout the hotel of past guests, events etc.

The bedrooms are clean and spacious, as are the public areas, although not quite as luxurious as the 5* rating would suggest compared to 5* hotels in other places.

The downsides are the reception desk, where on two seperate occasions, the receptionist broke off mid conversation to answer the phone, and talk to another guest, which I found quite rude.  The breakfast cost at nearly €30 if not included in the room rate is totally excessive.

Finally, charging for wifi access after paying the high room rates is outrageous, and this hotel needs to move out of the 20th century (if McDonalds can offer it free, then why can't this 5* establishment).",3,2012,03,07
207,lovely hotel,"I stayed here for a night with a friend. The hotel is in a great location just around the corner from Grafton St and a 10min walk down to Temple Bar area. 

Didn't spend much time in the room to be honest, but it was huge. Very comfortable beds and lovely modern marble bathroom with seperate shower and bath. 

Breakfast was good, even at 10.15am just before it finished there was still plenty to choose from and nice and hot. 

It is on par with any other 5 star hotel i've stayed in and all the staff were very polite and friendly. 

I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a really nice hotel in Dublin.",5,2012,03,07
207,Appalling lack of service or manners due to IFTA !,"I and 2 family members popped along to this place on Saturday afternoon last. We were feeling peckish so were ideally looking for lunch in the restaurant or as a last resort the afternoon tea.

Upon entering the establishment I noticed a long red carpet laid out in the foyer and then began to review a list of suites under an IFTA banner headline.

We were then stopped, firstly by some individual as we approached the restaurant and told it was completely booked out and a ""go away"" face of stone.  I do seem to recall we were all standing on the red carpet, perhaps we had ruined the image he wished to present !  He then suggested the Horseshoe bar in lieu.  Not everyone wants to sit with a waft of guinness whilst eating ""pub grub"" rubbish, we declined.

 We were then passed along to another rude and pompass individual to enquire about the afternoon tea, he gave us a look up and down as if we were some detritus on his (M&S?) shoes.  He enquired if we had a reservation and we said no, he went away for a few moments and returned to say that it was also booked out for afternoon tea, this despite plenty of tables being visibly empty.

Now let me be clear with this review - this is not the first or second time this has happened at the Shelbourne hotel in our experience, rather the third. I entered the premises mindful of my prior disappointment and willing to forgive and forget, if this experience was good, it was not!

The review is damning firstly with regard to the downright rude and inferior attitude of the staff we have encountered on each occassion.  I will not tolerate staff who give the impression that they are doing you a ""favour"".

Secondly, I am not interested in any function that is being held there and the myriad excuses offered to turn clients away.  It is usual everyday clientele who are the backbone of their business and also via repeat business and word of mouth recommendations.  Just because some turncoats arrive back on these Islands to receive token awards should have no bearing on how usual clients are treated.  A fine balance needs to be reached.

The frank reality is this - Dublin is insignificant when it comes to world class hotels.  They are on a completely different level.  As one who has been lucky to travel extensively and enjoy hotels of repute the world over (no i am NOT cabin crew) - London, NYC, Paris, Tel Aviv, Dubai, Greece, Munich, Geneva, Rio, Athens, Vienna , California and many more, this ranks amongs the worst experiences, in particular as Dublin is my home.

What a waste of €286 million euro.  The Savoy london was bought for €189 million ! the Burj al Arab cost €490 million, however the key to their success is their training of staff & people, their service and utter attention to detail and ensuring their guests are treated perfectly.

 A five star establishment it is not !  Where are the usual greetings of good day or afternoon Madam / Sir.  Where was the effort to retrieve our custom by perhaps offering to obtain us bookings in an alternative restaurant nearby? NONE.  We made our exit via the revolving, dirty smudged glass door to be met with a horrendous yellow cherry picker crane smack bang on the adjacent pavement.

Shame on the Shelbourne, the 2 staff and this utterly dreadful hotel.",1,2012,03,04
207,Nice hotel with a great location and service.,"This hotel is one of the oldest in Dublin and has a great central location within minutes of Grafton Street shopping and Trinity College.  The hotel spent a great deal of money to regain its 5 star status.  The rooms are good sized, the staff is great, and the service is excellent.  The hotel does charge for a huge fee, 10 euros per day, for high-speed in-room internet access.  It is available for free in some parts of the lobby.  The fitness center consists of 3 guest rooms, one with 2 treadmills, one with some free weights and 2 benches, and another with a bike, a precor, and stair steppers.  This configuration is not what I expected for a ""5 star"" hotel at all. The high tea is expensive, 25 euros, but worth every single cent to me.  Overall, I enjoyed the hotel and the kind doormen really added to my experience.",4,2012,03,04
207,Great location....but,"After a long overnight flight we arrived @9AM feeling tired and hungry. The woman at the front desk repeatedly told us that check in was at 3PM, we repeatedly told her we were aware. However, we were scheduled to meet with a geneologist at noon time in the  hotel and could she direct us to where we would in fact meet. She did not know but said they would notify us in our room...we reminded her that a check in was @3PM and our meeting was @ noon. Left our luggage and headed out for a reasonably priced breakfast, it was 29 euros in the hotel for the breakfast buffet. 
Returned around 11AM and was greeted by a different woman at the front desk who immediatley provided us with our room, a smile, and instructions on where to meet with the geneologist. Room was clean, comfy bed, good shower with plenty of hot water.
After a long day retired to bed around 8PM. At 9PM a knock to our door that woke us up.Someone entered the dark room, needless to say we were more than startled! It was a hotel worked delivering a package from the geneoloists. Granted we whould have chained the door, but in our exhaustion it was simply over looked. That was a first for us in  our many years of travel.
Good location, high priced, average service.",3,2012,03,04

207,Would NOT recommend,"Booked in for overnight stay on voucher I got for birthday present made reservation with hotel directly and gave all voucher details to see what was covered I was advised double room with breakfast. Checked in left bags in room, went shopping and had lunch went back to shower and change for dinner - got message to contact manager. We phoned the desk and said that manager will contact us after half an hour we got call from manager to say that the voucher was out of date and they could not honour it. As you can imagine we were checked in over 4 hours ago, had car parked (no value parking with the Shelbourne all extras) so after explaining that I booked voucher with reservation etc they said another manager will call me back when they check this. Well after 45 mins we got phone call from a male manager (americian accent) to say they could not honour the voucher...... We could have then paid for the room but we both just felt so drained with the whole experience, it was handled so badly showing no respect for us the customer that all I wanted to do was go home. So we packed up handed the keys back - no one said anything to us the manager did not even have the manners to come out to us no apologies - nothing! So what was meant to be a relaxing night in Dublin staying in the Shelbourne turned out to be a nightmare we paid then for the car park got the car out and drove back home over 70 miles. I did not even find anything nice about the room very run down and dark dust on bed headboard. Would not recommend it very overpriced and no personal attention from staff the only good point is the location but then you have to pay extra for parking and you even have to pay for the wifi so do you want all these extra charges to stay here I would look at other hotels the Fitzwilliam is close and the rooms are much nicer.",1,2012,02,26
207,The Perfect Location,"The Shelbourne is one of the Grand Old establishments in Dublin and it has witnessed history and history makers in all it years across from St. Stephens Green. From its fine dining, snug pub, oyster bar, and renowned High Tea, this hotel just exudes old world class and charm but with its association with Renaissance/Marriott it also has all of the amenities that we Americans in particular come to look for.  Best by far is its location! Around the corner is Trinity College and The Museum of Archeology. Down the road is Grafton Street and shopping. Down the other way is the National Library and the government offices. All around are great restaurants like Pearl and Bang. Short walks to O'Connell st, Temple Bar, The Liffey and its bridges and just a ton of fun. Not to me missed is the Dawson Lounge, literally around the corner from the hotel that is billed a the world's smallest bar. Its is and you cant help making friends. Down the other way is a true Irish Pub called Donahue's that jumps till closing. It makes a huge difference after slow walking through sites like Kilmainham and the National Gallery to be so close to comfort and relaxation, and after one to many at the pub, knowing you could crawl home if needed was a blessing. Hotel is beautifully maintained, has a helpful and friendly staff who, btw, found my memory card on the floor when I left and mailed it back to me so I didnt lose some cherished memories. I'm going back soon!",5,2012,02,25
207,"It's good, depending on what you want.","I was excited to stay at the Shelbourne as it was my first time in Dublin and everyone I spoke to has such great admiration for this hotel and its history. Let me inform you though, I didn't really feel this was a hotel for my own needs. I guess the main things I come to expect are a pool, a decent gym (not converted hotel room still carpeted), a spa is often nice but but necessary, however complimentary wifi for all guests is necessary, and I also expect to be able to switch on my TV and find CNN. I enjoyed the service and the room was beautiful. The location is also very central. It just wasn't the hotel for a younger, international traveller like me although I do wish the hotel continued success.  ",3,2012,02,23
207,Can't beat the location!,"My husband and I spent our last night in Dublin at the Shelbourne.   You can't beat the location!  This hotel is in the heart of Dublin's city center.   You are walking distance from everything...and in most cases, just a few steps from some of the best tourist sites including Stephen's Green, Grafton Street and so much more.   You are also just a few steps from some of the top rated restaurants in Dublin (highly recommend Unicorn and Shanahan's).

The Shelbourne has a charming, historical feel to it (but is modern in amenities).  The lobby is warm and welcoming with fireplaces to cozy up to on a cold, rainy Dublin day.   The Shelbourne is also known as having one of the best high teas in the city (highly recommend).   The bar is old, classic trendy and a great place to grab a pre-dinner drink.

Our stay included a free Irish breakfast- the buffet selection was huge and yummy!   

The Staff: Great.  Very attentive to all your needs.  Knowledgeable and friendly.

The Rooms:  We were upgraded to a suite, so the room was HUGE and overlooked Stephens Green.  Very clean. Great views, however, even on the 4th floor it was pretty noisy with all the traffic.    The rooms are done in an old Victorian style.  The bathroom was very large with a great soaking tub and very modern.   The bed was very comfortable (as long as you like softer mattresses).     I would recommend, even though the view was great, to try and get a room away from the street.   

Overall, pleasant stay.  It's worth it for the location alone.  You will LOVE this place if you love historic, charming and Victorian-like hotels.",4,2012,02,22
207,Always good,"We stay every year for a night or so. The Shelboyrne is consistently good. So far have established that we like the Heritage rooms the most overlooking the Green. If you can get breakfast included as well worth it, although coffee could improve. Beds are fantastically comfortable, rooms clean and good quality furnishings, bathrooms very nice.  You can't beat the location and the food in the Saddle Room is better every time we visit. Will be back again. ",5,2012,02,19
207,Champagne Afternoon Tea,"My boyfriend brought me here for champagne afternoon tea,it was really good.It was in the lord mayor room overlooking stephens green,a lady played the piano and the seats were really nice..especially by the window and the open fire.

The staff couldn't be more helpful and the food was amazing. I'll also post some pictures!There was a choice of about 40 different teas,I had the chocolate orange truffle tea. It also came with sandwiches,4 different scones with clotted cream & home made jam,amazing macaroons,short cake biscuits with fresh raspberry filling,chocolate cups,little glasses of cream & raspberry berry compote with white chocolate pieces and a glass of champagne.

It was a really nice treat,although I'd happily do it every week:-) &24.50 for regular afternoon tea/33.50 for champagne afternoon tea.

I would definitely do it again,delicious!",5,2012,02,18
207,Treat of a lifetime,"We have stayed twice in this wonderful hotel during our trip of Ireland. The hotel is located in the heart of Dublin amongst magnificent Georgian buildings. The building is a grand place which dates back to the 1700s, many famous people have stayed here and the Irish Constitution was drafted here - there is a special historic exhibit.  Across the street is St James Park and it is an easy walk to shoppiongs streets and other tourist attractions including Trinity College and the Book of Kells.  The rooms are comfortable and stylishly decorated, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and there is a very good restaurance and historic bars. There is also the best concierge in the world, Dennis Kelly, who was formerly the President of the internation Concierges' Association, a charming jolly man full of helpful information. Every observation is positive, cannot fault the staff or the facilities, it was a really enjoyable experience, suggest you come here to this classy establishment for the time of your life.",5,2012,02,17
207,Must go there,"Great place, great location - highly recommended - in the heart of Dublin - it is a beautiful place to stay",5,2012,02,16
207,Enjoyed the comforts of this Hotel,I was upgraded upon arrive to a suite on the 5th floor. Everything was clean and perfect and a great view of the pack out the window. I did head the people above me walk around but its an old hotel. I had great service and enjoy every minute I was there. I wish I could have stay longer!,5,2012,02,15
207,Fab Hotel,"A fantastic hotel in the heart of Dublin on stephens green,, from the moment you walk you through the doors you know you have entered a special place,, Have always wanted to stay in this hotel,, so was a nice treat,, Thank you one and all.",5,2012,02,13
207,Shelbourne hotel dublin,"I stayed at the shelbourne hotel, dublin on the weekend of 11th February 2012, this was an early valentine treat and found that this is an excellent hotel, staff where all very welcoming and helpful, we arrived early at 10am and with the intent of asking staff to look after our baggage as check in wasnt until 3pm. To our delight our room was ready and we were enabled to check in straight away. had a brilliant stay and excellent breakfast next morning. We were mingling with the Irish stars in the bar as it was weekend of the IFTA awards. I would definately recommend this hotel. thanks to all the staff. Diane Ewart",5,2012,02,13
207,More packed pub that 5 star hotel,The legendary hotel is so popular with locals that it feels like a huge pub during a rugby match. It desperately needs a residents only bar if it wants to charge 5 star prices. I will not stay again until the extortionate Internet charge is dropped. There are plenty of better hotels that don't rip people off in this way. 40e for breakfast was also too expensive for poor quality and a cold cooked breakfast delivered to my room.,2,2012,02,12
207,Outstanding!,"I've just returned from another fabulous stay at the Shelbourne and can't rate it highly enough. The history, atmosphere and people watching opportunities are fantastic!
This time we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a spacious suite which had lovely touches of sparkling pink grapefruit drinks and bars of delicious chocolate together with the standard fluffy robes and Elemis toiletries.
The staff really are first class, attentive and friendly and keen to make your stay enjoyable
The cocktails are also to be highly recommended as was the plentiful breakfast.
If you are looking for somewhere extra special to stay in this wonderful city, then the Shelbourne should be your first choice.",5,2012,02,09
207,HIghly recommended. Truly a 5 star experience.,"From arrival to departure I cannot fault this hotel. In light of the fact that I was entertaining some guests for a six nations rugby weekend it certainly ticked all the boxes !  
Warmly greeted at front of house by a great floor manager we were ushered through to reception for an equally stress free check in.
Facilities, rooms and especially a very well trained and friendly team of staff in all areas provided my guests and I with a truly enjoyable stay. I really cannot fault a single member of staff but feel I must highlight Dennis the original characterful and knowledgable concierge with his dry wit and sound advice. Also Timea our Hungarian breakfast waitress whose friendly and efficient manner were a joy.
I look forward to returning.",5,2012,02,08
207,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff central location",The hotel is on St Stephens Green so you cant get more central than this - the room was lovely the staff were lovely and there was a good ambience in the bar both nights.  Didnt eat in the restaurant for dinner,4,2012,02,07
207,Excellent location and value,"The best part of this hotel is the location and proximity to walking distance and downtown restaurants and pubs.  The hotel staff is very friendly, and the rate was reasonable for a downtown place.  Also good room size and a renovated room.  The only compliant would be the age of the mattress. The linens were nice, but the mattress wasn't what I would've expected from a Renaissance property.",5,2012,02,07
207,Bang central downtown location on Stephen Green!,"Central location in iconic Dublin Hotel famous for its posh afternoon tea!  Yes even cucumber sandwiches. As on Stephens Green you have fabulous restaurants nearby our favourite 20 steps away called Peploes a must to have lunch or dinner. Grafton Street which is bustling with main shops and coffee shops!
Hotel bar buzzing Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights!  Definitely place to be and to meet famous people.",5,2012,02,07

I cant recommend this enough, Luxury, well priced, great service, just heaven !!",5,2012,02,06
207,Not quite five star,"While we enjoyed our stay at the Shelbourne this past January, I would not put it in the category of a five star hotel.  No one thing but rather Little things that weren't quite up to snuff with a hotel of this caliber such as the bathroom floor not being quite as spotless or lack of turn-down service.  It didn't bother me but based on prior stays in hotels that were rated as five star, I felt the hotel was a lovely four star.",4,2012,02,05
207,always wanted to stay in this hotel,"looking forward to staying in this hotel as a early valentines gift for my boyfriend as i am working all 
over valentines.i decided on the shelbourne as we both always wanted to stay here and had been to hotel for drinks on a few occasions and dinner once before.Hotel its self is lovely and staff all very friendly.Staying in room 772, room was nice and clean.so after coming back from a lovely evening out around 3am we both couldn't get to sleep as the extractor fans were very loud on the roof and Kept us awake all night.we didn't want to call reception as it was very late in the early hours .When we went go to check out.The reception asked was very thing ok with our stay and i told her my complaint put she didn't seen to care and just said that she would take the issue up with maintenance team and we where thinking what benefit was that to us when we where righting this complain.Also are other complain was that the mini bar was empty and had not been stocked up after other guests had checked out early in the day.The only thing in the mini bar was a packets M&S mixed nuts don't know if they where comp or not.",5,2012,02,05
207,The standard by which all Dublin Hotels should be measured!!,"Myself and my wife stayed in The Shelbourne on the night of  Friday 3rd of March 2012. If any of you are not Irish, or familiar with this hotel, it is quite famous in Irish terms, and we were'nt dissapointed. There is a definite elegance about the place. It ""is"" old, but by no means ""creaky"". It is absolutely spotless!!. Our room was on the second floor, had a King sized bed, with all of the mod cons, LCD TV, direct phone etc. the decor is what I would call ""Classic"", very clean, no frayed carpet/bed Linen/Curtains, it really is pristine!!.
We only stayed one night so whereas I'm not 100% sure, I don't think there is a Swimming Pool. There is a couple of rooms on the second floor which have some Gym equipment if you feel the need tho'.
The bar in the Shelbourne was absolutely buzzing, there was no entertainment, but it really wasn't missed, and, if you would like some night life you are about a five minute walk from the famous Grafton Street, and then a further ten minutes from the Temple Bar area.
My only gripe was there is no free wi-fi. In an age where most coffee shops/cafes/Shopping Malls have wi-fi on tap, I think given the standard of the Hotel, the standard of cliontelle, and the price charged for a room, drinks etc. I find it incomprehensible that they charge for wi-fi.
If any of you are Rugby fans, the Irish Rugby team use the Shelbourne as their base approximately two nights before an upcoming home game, so you will more than likely bump into one or more of the team. 
In summary, would I stay in the Shelbourne again, ABSOLUTELY!!",5,2012,02,05
207,Impeccable Service,"I am staying at the Shelbourne for a week and have been consistently impressed by the service from all staff members.  We were exhausted and allowed to check in early and given extra water on request.  The concierges have been most helpful.  Every question has been pleasantly answered.  The breakfast is quite good and when we order room service to be able to make an early tour, it is always delivered right on time.  The rooms are comfortable and quiet.  The lobby areas are lovely.  All in all, we are very happy with our choice.",5,2012,02,03
207,Historic Dublin,"We stayed at the Shelbourne over Thanksgiving week.  Great central location. Nearby Merrion Row had many great restaurants with late night hours.  No. 27 Bar in Hotel had live music on weekend, filled with locals and tourists.  Afternoon tea at Lord Mayor's Lounge.  The staff was incredibly kind and helpful.  Started every day with a walk through St. Stephen's Green across the street from hotel.  Grafton Street closeby, Temple Bar area about 10-15 minutes walk.  Also close to Merrion Square Park.",5,2012,02,02
207,Romantic surprise weekend in Dublin,A few weekends ago I was surprised with a romantic weekend in Dublin. We stayed in the Shelbourne Hotel on Stephen's Green which was perfect for shopping and eating. The eggs benedict were yum for breakfast and the day just got better from there. I couldn't recommend the hotel or the staff more. My boyfriend doesn't have enough pockets for all the brownie points he now has!!,5,2012,01,31
207,"Luxury, Location, Love it",Very happy with our stay at the Shelbourne in Dublin. A historic building but with a fresh luxurious feel. Great rooms and friendly hospitality. The location though is the main asset of this hotel right on St stephens green central to everything you would want to visit in Dublin.,4,2012,01,30
207,Always wanted to stay here.....,"Stayed at The Shelbourne and found all the Staff extremely helpful in particular Emma on Reception, we had a beautiful room overlooking St Stephen's Green and only wish were able to stay another few nights to enjoy the experience........",5,2012,01,30
207,Right in the centre,"really old world, however the large size of the room was a real suprise, very modern and comfy, bar was a hive of activity and the breakfast was worth the stay alone",4,2012,01,30
207,Great hotel and great location,"My wife and I and my mom and sister stayed at this hotel.  I would say it was an excellent hotel in a great location.  Quick tip... there are two convenience stores near the hotel... which is helpful, not to mention being so close to St. Stephens green.
The first time you use the shower nob, it is a bit tricky, but after you master it the first time... it is okay....
The only down thing I would say about the location is the the bar/restaurant in the lobby is always packed... not a bad thing, but a bad thing when you want to sit and have a drink with your family after a day of sightseeing.  they do have an area just for guests of the hotel, but even on a Saturday night you could not find a place to sit.  It is definitely a place to see and be seen in Dublin (apparently).  That would be my only recommendation is to actually have space always available for the hotel guests.
The service is top notch, food was excellent, and the Guinness was great.
Overall I do recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2012,01,28
207,A real Irish  feel to this hotel.,"I've hoteled many times in Dublin but this was my first stay at The Shelbourne. I was upgraded to a suite which was nice, but I would have appreciated the hotel anyway. Really friendly and helpful staff, excellent food and a great location. More than anything else, the place had a real buzz to it especially in the ground floor bar and lounges. I'll be going back !",4,2012,01,28
207,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service","The hotel is gorgeous.  Loved the lush decoration in the rooms and lobby is incredible.  Everyone at the front desk was extremely polite and friendly.  I also love the little tea cookies they have at the check-in desk, as well as juice and coffee.  The rooms are pretty small, but the beds are comfortable and the shower is huge!  The hotel is located just a quick walk to Grafton Street and maybe a 10-15 minute walk to Temple Bar.  It is also right by a nice park, which looked like a perfect spot to go running.  The fitness center in the hotel is actually just 3 rooms on the second floor with weights in one room and 2 treadmills and 2 ellipticals in the other.  I think I read somewhere though that they are doing construction on the real workout room but I at least appreciated that they had some equipment.  Overall I felt absolutely spoiled at this hotel and look forward to staying here in the future.",5,2012,01,27
207,"Nice hotel, great service","First time in Dublin, liked the hotel's central location close to shopping and restaurants, and the park,  traditional layout with grand stairs, retro layout and deco in the restaurants and hallways. But I am mostly impressed by the service, the receptionist was very warm and welcoming, offered lemonade during check in, a pleasant surprise for a city/business hotel, upon hearing that this was my first in Dublin, they upgraded me to a suite to 'give me a good impression', then the wake up call next morning was done in a smiling fashion, a nice way to start the morning. the suite was very spaceous, and nicely furnished. definitely would return if I am in Dublin again.",5,2012,01,24
207,Terrible - Save Your Money!,"Had a courtyard room, I looked out the window and the window was covered with at least 1 inch of black grime.  The sheets weren't changed every day and the room wasn't vacuumed every day either.  When I opened the drapes, the swags and jabots at the top moved and dropped dust all over me. The sheers were gray, not white. The glasses in the room weren't replaced every day. Carpets in the room and hallways tracked and spotted. Asked for no feather pillows and that request was ignored.  It took 2 days to get non-feather replacements. Reception didn't know what a box of Kleenix is when the empty one in the room wasn't replaced. Had to climb 4 stairs after leaving the elevator to get to the corridor where our room was.   

2 chairs in front of a fireplace constitute the lobby seating.  Otherwise there's the overpriced bar or the tea lounge.  Hostess acted put upon when we arrived 20 minutes before the end of breakfast one morning and pointedly looked at her watch. Every morning we were given our bill as soon as we ordered breakfast.  The bill took up about 1/4 of the available table space which was meagre.

Difficult getting in and out of the front doors of the hotel (one set is permanently locked for some unknown reason and would be against fire code anywhere else).  People frequenting the bar who are primarily not hotel guests stand outside the front entrance smoking cigarettes or talking just ""to be seen"".  Not enjoyable asking people who've been drinking alcohol to move out of your way when you're trying to get in or out of the hotel and who consider themselves ""locals"" with more rights than a hotel guest.

The immediate area has lots of people begging for money, narrow streets and people lurking in dark doorways. Garbage collection days take up all available space on the walkways with garbage containers or garbage bags.   

Terrible - save your money and stay somewhere else. It's not worth what you're paying. I gave it one star solely for its history.  It's now a has-been hotel and nowhere near Marriott standards elsewhere.",1,2012,01,22
207,"Simply ""Grand""","Grand is such a common word used in Ireland but it is a huge word for Americans and summarizes our experience, it was simply ""grand"".  The Shelbourne, Dublin is a TRUE 5 star experience, before, during and even after the stay.
The amazing staff and superlative Concierge team of Denis and Alan created for my family reunion of 14 people a lifetime of memories and unforgettable events.
First let me brag about them a little bit.
BEFORE the trip, I worked with Denis and Alan over many a phone call to arrange a seamless experience for my family.  Not only a full itinerary filled with the best that Dublin has to offer but also perfect travel arrangements, pick up to and from the airport, hotel and private bus tours with clean, luxury motor coaches and fantastic tour guide and driver Kevin.
DURING the stay, the hotel was beyond accommodating. The food service, spa treatments, high tea and great fun in the bars were superior.
We even had a little star gazing because ""Mr. Big"" and Neive Campbell were also guests. :)
For those in the know, ""Mik Kro"" and the owners of the Hotel were there and blended with the guests like long lost friends.  But that IS the charm of Ireland and especially Dublin, you always feel welcomed and missed even if it is your first time visiting.
My whole family wants to return and to stay only at the Shelbourne for it's elegance, location, service and quality staff.",5,2012,01,21
207,"Location,location,location","Well,it's a bit more than location! Don't bother paying E60 for view of St Stephens Green especially in winter - just take a walk there. First,it's five stars because after a 20 hour flight arrived at 9:00am but they arranged that I could check-in so immediate snooze possible. I note on this site complaint that even after 1pm there was a problem checking in-maybe,it has to do with the time of year. The exorbitant charges for INTERNET - well, that seems in the past now,free WIFI Feb 2012,about time! Pub prices - yes,the reserved tables are a joke but stick to GUINNESS and the price is OK considering the place (pint is less than 6EURO-not so bad). The pub prices if you are careful are OK and there were alot of Dubliner locals this weekend there for the experience i would say and the conversation was great. Forget the breakfast unless someone else is paying. It's a thrill to go out and breakfast at LEMON,BEWLEYS,CORNUCOPIA or wherever. No ice machine-a pain!
Last,in case you have some interest in the history of 20th Century Ireland - it's a fascinating place, not only because of all the luminaries in music,arts,politics but also because it was there drafted the first Irish consitution with Michael Collins as chair. While we there Denis O'Brien took us to the CONSTITUTION ROOM  and gave an informative talk on the history of the SHELBOURNE and the events of 1922. Really enjoyable with refreshments on the house. 
Last,one of the acclaimed places for Irish music is a block away (O'Donoughue's) as well as IVEAGH PARK and the National Concert Hall. Amazing - check online - and great flight-hotel deals are available.",4,2012,01,20

207,Big Thank You,"My three sisters and myself have just returned from a two night stay in the shelbourne to celebrate a birthday. On check in we recieved an upgrade that was a lovely surprise and added wonderful comfort and space. The staff in all departments were nothing but extremely professional, efficient and friendly.
A special thank you from all four of us for making it a very memorable, pleasant and special weekend.

207,Excellent 1st Class !,"We decided on this hotel for our first trip to Dublin and were not disappointed. From first entering to our departure the staff were wonderful, accommodating and extremely helpful to Dublin virgins such as ourselves which we were most impressed about as they were very busy as it was in the run up to Xmas and both restaurant and hotel were fully booked and holding corporate Christmas parties too. Double Room was fabulous large, clean and very comfortable. Although they were busy they managed to find us a table for dinner in the restaurant Food was amazing as was service Breakfast buffet was plentiful and well cooked and White pudding amazing. 
Excellent deserves 5 Stars ",5,2012,01,11
207,An amazing hotel steeped in history,"Have just returned from Dublin where we stayed at this beautiful hotel.  The staff here are professional, friendly and go way beyond what you would expect.  Complimentary lemonade, two large blocks of chocolate and a personalised note from management was delivered to our room.  The room was spotless, the service exceptional and the location perfect.  Dublin you are lucky to have a hotel of this calibre.  Would love to return one day.",5,2012,01,08
207,Nice Dublin Hotel,"The Shelbourne is a beautiful hotel close to the attractions of Dublin. It's a Renaissance, so it has the efficiency of a Marriott and the wonderful bed and linens.  Well appointed bathroom and lots of wardrobe space.  We didn't upgrade to room with a park view, so we had a view of the offices right next door but that was fine since we weren't in the room a lot. 
The staff was pleasant and professional but after a week in other parts of Ireland, they seemed to lack the warmth we had found in our other hotels. It felt like I was checking into a hotel in New York or Boston. But still, they were very nice. The doormen were very helpful. 
We didn't eat at the any of the restaurants but the public spaces were beautiful and always bustling.",4,2012,01,07
207,"Elegant, first class hotel. Great location!","Staying at the Shelbourne was an excellent choice for my first weekend in Dublin.  Hotel is right across the street from St Stephens Green, there are many great restaurants and pubs nearby, Easy walking distance to just about anything you'd like to see or do in the city centre. 
There was a conference when I visited so I avoided the hotel bar, but had a wonderful Irish breakfast at the Saddle Room restaurant. Service was polite and attentive.  Knowledgeable, friendly staff who went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of. 
Hotel itself has a storied past, has been updated while retaining the elegant and historical ambiance.",5,2012,01,07
207,"Good hotel, but not fantastic. Location amazing but rooms disappointing.","The Shelbourne is a Dublin institution, in a fab location on St Stephen's Green. It closed a couple of years ago for major refurbishment, and having moved away from Ireland, this was the first time I was in it since. We were there between Christmas and New Year and the place was buzzing -  very atmospheric. In spite of this we were checked in straight away and service was excellent. Unfortunately though, the rooms didn't live up to the excellent impression we had downstairs. Very average, and it was hard to distinguish them from any reasonable 3-4 star hotel I have stayed in. The refurb seems to have concentrated on the areas downstairs, with the rooms and communal areas upstairs being given a basic brush up. Additionally, our room, while billed as non-smoking, smelled of smoke. Initially I though we must be overlooking a smoking area, but worked out it was the carpet smelling. Yuck.
We didn't eat at the restaurant, our meal was elsewhere in town, and the breakfast was ludicrously priced so we skipped it, but we did have pre and post dinner drinks in the bar. It's fab, a great place to people watch, and excellent service given how busy it was. 
In short, I wouldn't stay here again, but would visit the bar to soak up the Dublin atmosphere.",3,2012,01,07
207,Great location and atmosphere,"All staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.
Check in was smooth.  The room itself was small and the bathroom was very small (no bath).  Bed was exceptionally comfortable and the room was spotless.  The furnishings were all ok and not worn.
Breakfast was only average with particularly watery coffee. The bar is a great people watching spot.  Drinks are on the pricey side even for Dublin.  
Its main plus point is the location on St Stephens Green.  Grafton street is only a short stroll away.  Valet Parking was pricey at €25.  
I would stay again but probably only if I got a good deal.  
Would be great for a special occasion but might need to splash out on a bigger room!!",5,2012,01,05
207,Wonderful stay at the Shelbournce,"My husband and I stayed at the Shelbourne for a week-end in Oct '11.
From the moment we arrived at the hotel til the time we left we received premium service - it could not have been better. 
Our room was amazing - very spacious, luxurious and comfortable.
The breakfast choice and service was superb.
I have wonderful memories of this amazing hotel and look forward to going back soon.",5,2012,01,05
207,"Lovely hotel, good service","We stayed here for New Year's Eve, and overall had a good experience. The check-in was smooth, the receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Our room was a little small, but we weren't expecting a suite! This is an old hotel so that's part of it's charm. The public areas are lovely and give an old-world feel. Most of the staff do try their best to be polite and friendly, throughout the hotel.

The food in the Saddle Room was very good, and the service was also good, though it slowed as the meal went on. Breakfast on the 2nd morning was better than the first, even though our coffee was so weak it didn't taste of coffee and we had no cups or butter on our table. The first morning being New Year's Day, the restaurant was very busy for breakfast and the hotel had set up an extra buffet in the bar to deal with this; this is where we were seated by the waiter. Unfortunately, it didn't have the same selection as the main buffet, and as we didn't know what the latter contained, we came away disappointed.

Service at the bar was quick, despite it being a very busy time of year. However, table service there was a little slower. When we arrived at the hotel, we ordered soup and a sandwich; this took half an hour to get to us, and then it was the wrong order. We asked several times to speak to the bar manager, but when there was no sign of him, we went in search of him. He quickly rectified the situation.

Lastly, parking is quite expensive at €25 a night, and though this is similar in other Dublin city centre hotels, it doesn't justify it.

These minor issues are just that - minor- and overall our experience was very positive. It was a busy time to stay there, but we did pay a not-insignificant amount for it, and regardless of how busy the hotel is, we would expect these issues not to occur. We will hopefully return to this hotel sometime soon!",4,2012,01,04
207,Elegant common areas...room only ok,"We were very excited to stay at the Shelbourne as we had been to Dublin several times previously and knew of its excellent reputation.  We had booked through Sceptre Tours and I am afraid that is why we were relegated to room 454.  The common areas of the hotel are truly grand and the service is absolutely impeccable.  Perhaps the best service I have ever had at any hotel anywhere.  The location is also excellent as recounted by many others.  The room was a bit of a disappointment.  The door literally did not fit into the door frame and there was about a two inch crack at the top that looked directly into the hall.  Needless to say, all noise from the hallway came directly in.  The floor was also unbelievably pitched so walking a straight line at times was a challenge.  The bed was very soft but comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful with marble. All in all worth the money we paid for the package but I wonder if I would be so positive if we had paid the full rate.",4,2012,01,03
207,"Great hotel, centrally located","Other reviewers have complained about the size of the Queen room, but we thought it was just fine for two people. The bed was so comfortable and the shower was huge! We got a deal through booking.com and thought it was great value for money. The hotel is so centrally located you just can't beat it being steps from Grafton street. My only quibble would be an expensive breakfast at €32.50 pp and the fact that they seem to charge for wifi access (this should be free for paying guests).  Its a beautiful hotel, and the staff couldn't be friendlier or more helpful. I would recommend for a luxury stay in the heart of Dublin city.",5,2012,01,03
207,"Poor service, loud rooms","Perhaps this like other negative reviews is impacted by the fact that this was a one-night stay in a trip where we primarily stayed in three or four star hotels. 

Overall we were left asking ourselves what you get for your extra money in a five star establishment.

The Saddle Room in particular was poor. The service went from inattentive to gushingly servile which made us feel frustrated then uncomfortable. The breakfast selection was actually worse than some of the three star places we had stayed in. They actaully gave us a pot of stone-cold tea with no attempt at a service recovery.
 
The room was loud, with some ventilation system running above the door even when the air conditioning was switched off. Sleep was only possible with ear plugs.

The bed was old and worn out. If you remember rolling into the centre of your grandfather's bed because the springs were bad you will know what I mean.

The turn-down lady just would not go away.I thought we were going to have to call the police to explain why two half naked people didnt want their bed turned down at that particular moment. She was the wrong sort of persistent.

If we had stayed there for more nights I am sure our overall impression would be different. It maybe be a mistake to stay in lower classed hotels and then treat yourself for one night like we did. In this case we could have saved our money.

Never again.",3,2012,01,03
207,Good hotel with a few small issues...,"The hotel itself is beautiful and the location is perfect. You are just a couple blocks from Grafton Street and the city center. We checked into the hotel on three different occasions as we went from place to place within Ireland. I am a loyal Marriott customer with Platinum Premier Status. I recently stayed my 1500 night in a Marriott property this month. I disclose this not to boast rather highlight a couple of issues an expensive property like this should not be experiencing.  And if these breakdowns in customer service happens to me, I am sure it happens to others as well.
The check in process. Each time we arrived at the hotel we did so in the early afternoon. The first couple of times around 1:30pm, the third near 2:00pm. The front desk employees made it a point to let me know what big favor they were doing letting me check in at such an early hour. One of them pointing out that we were really early. It was rather embarrassing.  Also, the hotel had several parties and gatherings in the lobby area making it very difficult to maneuver through the large crowds to get to the front desk. It was really a pain trying to get around.
Long story short, this hotel is pretty good. Personally, I would save a couple pounds and find another place to stay. This hotel is not worth the money.",3,2012,01,02
207,Special hotel in great location,"Lovely stay, comfy beds, restaurant, tea room and bar really busy with no space for hotel guests on the night we stayed. ",4,2012,01,02
207,disappointed,"I was very disappointed because we had booked a twin room, and when we arrived we were given a room with 1 bed.  That was bad enough, but the girl at reception could not have cared less.  She did not apologise.  She tried to make it sound like we hadn't booked a twin.   Even when we tried to say ""oh maybe there was miscommunication on the phone"" she was just really rude like ""no! you booked wrong!"".  It really put a bad mood on me and ruined my stay.  It's annoying how one person can be so rude and it can affect your whole stay.  And given that this is a five star hotel and charges high prices, you'd of thought they would be alot more polite.  

Breakfast in the morning was a huge disappointed too.  Very poorly catered for hot food for vegetarians.  Had to settle for egg on toast.  Not really five star hotel.  Couldn't even get some potato bread when in Dublin!  

The only thing I will say is that the whole hotel was spotless clean, and the rest of the staff in the hotel especially the doormen and concierge were really friendly.  It's a shame they messed up my booking and then gave me bad attitude about it.",2,2012,01,02
207,high tea @ the lord mayor's lounge in the Shelbourne Dublin- don't do it!!,"I lived in dublin for work for 3 years now and decided to stay for Christmas. I invited my family of 5 and parents for a high tea at the Lord Mayor's Lounge in the Shelbourne hotel as i wanted to treat them to a special experience. Unfortunately it did not turn out that way. We were seated on a couch that smelled awfull ( i think somebody recently vomited on it). When we asked to be reseated as in this smell we really could not enjoy any food, the waitresses explained that they had had an accident on the couch, and no matter how frequently the couch was cleaned the smell would not go away. Clearly they already knew about the problem. 30 mins later, they just put other customers on the couch.  The waitress told me that even though they had mentioned this complaint to management several times nothing was being done about it and she asked would i speak to management. I did and the manager apologised, appearing to not know about the problem. A couple of days later i passed by the hotel again and just wanted to see if something had been done about the couch. Conclusion: nothing has been done, the couch is still there and customers are seated on it. The stinking couch is still there and they keep putting customers in it. That's how much this 5 star hotel cares about customer satisfaction. it's a disgrace. I will not be a customer ever again and i will certainly spread this story.",1,2011,12,30
207,Christmas at the Shelbourne Dublin,"My husband is working in Dublin and will be moving over to Ireland in a few months. Since he is only staying for one or two weeks at a time at present, he has been staying at the Shelbourne and wanted me to join him two weeks ago for a weeklong mini vacation! What a wonderful experience! The Shelbourne is pure luxury from the delicious buffet breakfast to the cozy, comfortable luxurious sheets on the king size bed! My husband and I were treated like royalty. The staff was very accommodating, friendly and always helpful. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and at night when we would come back from shopping and were chilly and needed to warm up, we were offered hot cider to take up to our rooms! Lovely touch! My husband is going back to Dublin next week and will once again be staying at The Shelbourne...I unfortunately will not be traveling back this time, but I look forward to my next stay at the nicest, most luxurious hotel in all of Ireland!!! The only downside of the trip was having to get a security code each day to allow us to use a laptop or mobile device, but it was a small inconvenience.",5,2011,12,27
207,Close to business and shopping,"Stayed at the hotel for business reasons.  Found the hisoric hotel to be ideally close to my business needs and personal shopping just down the street.  The place was bustling with activity that made it a fun place to be.  The food at the restaurant was great.  The breakfast was terric and filling.  The hotel could do something about the entry way.  The revolving door is rather small and one can fit with one's travel luggage.  The room was small; typical of older hotels.  Nevertheless, the room had all the necessities such as an iron as well as a comfortable bath robe.",4,2011,12,25
207,One of my favourite hotels,"We live just outside Dublin and have stayed in this hotel several times but this is my first review. I arranged our work Christmas lunch for 60 people in the hotel and it was really lovely, great service, great food and a great atmoshphere. We had a private room on the first floor over looking the green and a lovely time was had by all.

I decided to stay the night  as my husband was out in town also so it was much easier to stay rather than flag a taxi on what is the busiest night of the year. The hotel was buzzing and people actually queued outside to get in to the bar. Our room was fine. I stayed in a few different rooms here, including a suite, and this was by far the smallest but it was really comfortable. The beds are really comfortable and I always sleep really well. Even though the hotel was busy with lots of parties we couldn't hear a thing in our room.

When I was checking in the receptionist told me the hotel was full so breakfast would be very busy so we decided to go for the room service option. It arrived promptly and was delicious. We will be back!",4,2011,12,20
207,"Pure luxurious indulgence, treated like royalty! .....and we're not!","Wow! Everybody in this hotel was so friendly and helpful, they couldn't have been more welcoming.  Indeed the staff made this the best stay anywhere.. Could not recommend highly enough for a Christmas shopping break.  10/10... If you could bottle the attitude of staff- you'd be a millionaire. 
Well done.. Breakfast yum too..",5,2011,12,20
207,Historic hotel in the heart of dublin,"On a recent trip to Ireland, I stayed at the Shelbourne Dublin Renaissance Hotel and put a video up of the hotel on youtube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP3y5noAQI

Below is the written review of the hotel which goes in to much more detail.

The Shelbourne is a historic hotel built in 1824 located in the city center of Dublin Ireland, across of the St. Stephens Green Park. Getting to the hotel from Dublin airport is very convenient using the Air Coach bus. It leaves from Dublin airport, and stops just about one block from the hotel. The bus trip takes about 30-40 minutes and the stop for the Shelbourne is about the 4th stop.

Gold and platinum members get a free full Irish Breakfast in the Saddle Room only on weekdays. The full Irish breakfast consists of eggs, pancakes, waffles, mushrooms, bacon, sausage, and black/white (blood) pudding. It was a very good breakfast, but I’d only recommend the breakfast from the saddle room if you’re getting it for free, because the regular price is over 30 Euro per person. The concierge lounge is currently under construction and is scheduled to open in 2012. In the interim, gold and platinum guests receive 2 free drink vouchers from the hotel bar. The drink vouchers can be redeemed for any “regular” alcoholic drinks. Since it is Ireland after all, Jameson Whiskey and Guinness are the logical choices in the bar.

The Shelbourne is well known for the afternoon tea at “Lord Mayors Lounge.” In addition to tea, Lord Mayors lounge also serves breakfast and snacks. I had the oatmeal on one of the weekend mornings that I couldn’t get a free breakfast. The oatmeal was served with lavender honey, and was truly one of the best bowls of oatmeal I’ve ever heard. I would highly recommend the oatmeal! The scones and jam are also pretty tasty if you’re in to that kind of thing. The oatmeal is also available on the buffet in the saddle room. 

The hotel gym is a bit of an oddity, because the gym consists of three converted hotel rooms. They’ve converted one hotel room in to a weight room with weight lifting equipment. Another room has been converted in to a Cardiovascular room with tread mills, and the final gym room has bicycles and an elliptical machine.

In the hotel rooms, the bed had very nice comfortable sheets. Also in the room was a flat panel television, a desk, and good size closets. The bathroom in my room was recently remodeled and had a combined bathtub and shower. I asked for a quiet room, so I had a view of the courtyard. Indeed my room was also very quiet. The air conditioning and heating also both worked well in the room.

As a platinum member I got a choice of welcome gift. For my beverage I chose the chilled Erdinger, a beer. For my snack, I chose the “Selection of Irish Fruits.” The room also comes with a four bottles of complimentary Irish water. Two of the bottles are still water, and two of the bottles are sparkling water. Each day the bottled water was replenished by the housekeeping staff which is nice for those of us that are thirsty.

Ice machines are not available in the hotel, but ice is available by calling the housekeeping staff. I was actually quite amazed at how quick the staff would bring the ice up to my room. Usually the ice would arrive with one or two minutes.

Overall the Shelbourne is a very lovely, historic hotel in the heart of Dublin.",4,2011,12,20
207,Definitely not 5star,"We stayed in this hotel recently and were very disappointed with the service and facilities. The location is extremely good and the bars, reception and restaurant are all very aesthetically pleasing. However, the service from the minute we arrived was more three or four star than five. On check-in we were not offered assistance with our luggage. When we arrived at the room we were somewhat disappointed with its measly size and the generic type decor. The view was horrendous, overlooking a dirty yard with dumped mattresses. The bathroom was tiny with a bath only. There is no swimming pool, spa or gym. Although there is an effort of an exercise room located in what appears to be a bedroom. The service is the bar was very slow and staff were not friendly. The worst part of our stay was breakfast. We queued for 20 minutes in the cold lobby. Nobody came near us to apologise or to offer us a newspaper or explain why there was such a wait. I don't think a 1 or 2 star hotel would have treated us so badly and it most certainly isn't the customers problem if their restaurant can't cope.",2,2011,12,17
207,Loved the service,"Can't even begin to tell you how great the service is at the  Shelbourne.  From the moment we arrived, until the moment we left(at 5:30AM), the staff couldn't have been nicer.From the front desk folks, to the concierges, Dennis and Paul, and the Customer Relations manager,Raphael, all worked to make sure our stay was perfect.  Raphael even called to tell us goodbye.

I agree with most of the reviews. The hotel is very old, and therefore a little quirky.  The floor squeeks, the room, even a Heritage room, is small, and the halls are confusing.  But the location is the best! With all the history of the Shelbourne, I felt like staying there was important to my understanding of Dublin and Ireland.

Thanks to everyone who made our long weekend very memorable.

207,A Grand Hotel,I stayed at the Shelbourne last weekend and it remains the Grand Hotel of Dublin. The location is perfect for pre-Christmas shopping or just experiencing Dublin. The standards in the hotel are first class and there is obviously a strong philosophy of hospitality - a very good blend of friendliness and professionalism. There is also a great respect of the history of the hotel. Ten out of ten.,5,2011,12,14
207,5 star quality and worth every penny,"Just got back from a week long stay in Dublin. We stayed the entire time here. The room was spectacular. Dennis, the concierge should be considered a national treasure! Hope Dennis sees this (it's Mrs.Delaney). only negative is that they charge for wifi and it isn't cheap. A hotel of this caliber that wants to attract business clients should really offer this service! But I still ranked this hotel with 5 stars as the service is impeccable. Every single employee went out of their way to make us feel more than just welcomed! Can't wait to go back!",5,2011,12,13
207,Ten out of ten!,"My wife and I stayed for one night recently (Saturday, 19th November), as part of our 20th Anniversary celebrations. The entire experience from check-in to check-out was faultless, with the service, the room, and the facilities all exceeding our expectations.
 One of the really nice touches was the provision of a bottle of wine and two glasses ""on the house"" laid out for us in the room. Also, the bed was carefully decorated with red rose petals!
Our room was bigger than expected, very tastefully furnished, with the bonus feature of a balcony with views of the Dublin mountains above the city sky-line.
Because of the occasion, we were not overly concerned with the rate, so we pushed the boat out in that sense. Therefore ""value for money"" was not a prime consideration. We paid more than we would normally would for good city-centre accommodation and in hind-sight we were certainly not disappointed.",5,2011,12,12
207,Shopping break,Had a night in the Shelbourne with my wife and 2 kids (13-14). Booked one room B&B. Room had two doubles and was very nice comfortable with enought room for 4 of us. Its a great location and staff very helpfull and professional. Good bar and good drink expensive as per norm for a hotel of this standard. Bar got a bit crowed and messy late at night but the Lord mayors room for residents is really relaxing for a drink at night. Breakfast was average at best (€30 is expensive) and heard someone complain about the standard of breakfast. Overall very enjoyable stay thought not cheap.,4,2011,12,11
207,4* Hotel 5* Prices,"We stayed at this hotel in January for 1 night to attend a show. The location is great - smack bang on Stephens Green. The lobby area is very warm and inviting. The room we were given was a queen. The room felt a little damp and had a slightly musty smell, desite recent renovation. The bed clothes were also a little damp. The bathroom was very spacious and clean, however, there was a ring of mould on the tiles surrounding the bath. The bar is lovely and has a great atmosphere. I think I would try one of the other 5 star hotels in Dublin before I would stay here again.",4,2011,12,10
207,"Looks great, excellent central location","Well we swore we would never go back to this hotel and for the last 8 years we have been successful BUT the hotel was booked for a business trip and we had to go....... We were dreading it!!  What a pleasant surprise, this hotel has been totally refurbished and the staff were pleasant, helpful and smart.  So much was the difference I had to walk along the street to make sure I was in the same hotel as the last time - I was so well done everyone for a massive improvement.  The bed was comfortable; the room was small but smart with a reasonable view.  Little touches like the free water, dressing gowns, etc all make a hotel.  We had a drink and a sandwich in the lounge bar. The service was excellent.  We would consider this hotel again.
Shame they don't have Wi-Fi and they charge for internet connection - it seems to be a Marriott Policy",4,2011,12,07
207,First Class Luxury!,"Spent a night in The Shelbourne last weekend as I was attending a family wedding there. My husband dropped me off with the luggage and went to park the car. As soon as I stepped on to the pavement two doormen approached me and whisked me and the luggage into the lobby. From that moment to the moment we left the hotel we received a first class service. At check in we enjoyed a glass of warm cider and a cookie and soaked up the wonderful Christmas atmosphere while the friendly receptionist checked us in. The hotel was fully booked and there was a great buzz about the place. We were really impressed with our room which was a heritage room on the fourth floor. We didn't have a view as it was at the back of the hotel but this meant that it was very peaceful. The bedroom was huge with a large king bed, armchairs, TV etc. The bathroom was also huge with beautiful marble fittings, bath and a walk-in shower. The overall feeling was one of luxury. We enjoy our hotel breaks and expect a lot from a 5 star hotel. What stood out for us at The Shelbourne was that we felt like valued customers. All the staff we met were very friendly and welcoming especially the guest relations manager, Raphael. As the hotel was full there were long queues for breakfast and also for check out, which the receptionist had warned us about . We didn't have a problem with this as we lingered over breakfast with friends and took our time checking out. This was our first stay in The Shelbourne but I hope it won't be our last. Staying here at this time of year is a wonderful Christmas treat in the heart of the city. We booked with an on-line company so shop around for good deals. We checked with the hotel first to see if they were happy with the on-line agent. The hotel offer a valet parking service but we booked into St. Stephens Green Shopping Centre who have great on-line overnight and 24hr rates and is a few minutes walk away.",5,2011,12,06
207,Shelbourne misses out,"We selected the Shelbourne for its central location to Dublin however the room was not what we expected.  Yes, it was the pre-Christmas season.  Also, as we checked into the hotel evidence of weddings were everywhere suggesting possible reasons for a lack of better, more affordable guest accommodations.  The room was adequate for an overnight stay but my wife and I were in Dublin for two nights hoping to see sights not seen since our last foray to Dublin. The staff was friendly and outgoing seeming most desirous to please yet our room was in obvious need of a good carpet cleaning.     My wife had encouraged me to seek an upgraded room prior to our arrival but management told us they were completely booked.   I will not blame the hotel for something I expected but should have inspected before I paid.",3,2011,12,04
207,Very nice- lovely bar areas and attentive staff.,Excellent location and one of the best hotel bars I've ever been to.welcoming reception staff and good breakfast.the one downside is that the rooms aren't really 5 star standard but if you can get a good rate it is well worth staying here.,4,2011,12,02
207,So romantic...,"We had a one night stay for our 15th wedding anniversary and although it was only 24 hours, it was total luxury from start to finish.  We booked a room with a view of St Stephens Green but when we checked in we were upgraded to a large suite, which was magnificant.  About 2 hours later there a knock on the door and a staff member arrived with complimentary biscuits and wine.  Later that evening when we arrived back after dinner the bed and bathroom were covered in red rose petals.  Next morning we had a beautiful long breakfast and afterward a late check out.     We always stay in a 5 start hotel in Ireland for our wedding anniversary, this is out 3rd time in the Shelbourne.  It by far the best 5 star hotel in Ireland.   Can't wait for our return trip.",5,2011,12,02
207,The Highlight of my six week trip was The Shelbourne.,"What an amazing hotel from start to finish. This hotel and it's staff were first class.
Having traveling almost around the world in six weeks, The Shellboune was my favorite hotel out of my trip.

The location, layout and style of the hotel were excellent in every way.

I was able to get a fantastic rate through Marriott Rewards that included breakfast and afternoon tea in the lounge. This was just amazing, the breakfast was first class and the eggs Benedict was to die for!

The staff were so kind and professional and made you feel like a pleasure and welcomed guest at all times. The main doorman, ( dont know his name) was lovely and made sure we got into the afternoon tea one day when I forgot to book and they were full, Thank You~!

I'm not in a hurry to go back to Dublin but want to go only to stay here once again. what a treat!.

Also had a celebrity sighting - the adorable Kevin Zegers was staying at the hotel filming the mini series Titanic Blood and Steel. Chatted to him a few times and he took a picture with me, what an awesome guy.",5,2011,11,30
207,"Lovely facility, though understaffed and food prices crazy","We had the pleasure of staying for 3 nights over the American Thanksgiving weekend.  Check in took quite some time as only 1 person was at the front desk.  Our room requests were met and one of our 3 rooms was even upgraded to a huge room with fabulous bath.  The rooms are quite luxurious, though showing a bit of age.  We loved the bar and lobby- buzzing with energy each evening and the tree lighting on Fri night added even greater festivity with carolers.  Though I had made all dinner reservations and day excursions on line prior to arrival, the concierge seemed to be slammed at all times so I was glad that we did not need his assistance.  The negatives were a tiny gym (literally the size of one small hotel room with 2 pieces of cardio); outrageously priced breakfast (29 Euro) as it was not in our room rate; and  ridiculous cost for internet and the office center printer was out of order.  The concierge did spend about 30 minutes checking us in for our departing flight and printing boarding passes while being very, very busy with guest requests.  Overall, we loved the Shelbourne and it's location in Dublin (we have teens who loved shopping on Grafton St), but for the price would expect free internet, slightly more affordable breakfast prices, a much nicer gym and a facelift to the rooms & lobby.  The staff were lovely and very helpful as well.",4,2011,11,30
207,Excellent service and comfortable hotel,"We have just spent three nights at The Shelbourne and were particularly impressed by the delightful staff, Rachel on the reception desk for breakfast, with her lovely smile and charming manner, and Derek, the breakfast waiter, with whom we had an intelligent discussion about the EU, imagine doing that with a waiter anywhere else, he was also extremely professional, unlike our breakfast waitress on the last day, who got almost everything wrong, and didn't notice anything, clearly very inexperienced, she even dropped the Eggs Benedict for the table next door.

Breakfast is quite one of the best, wonderful fresh squeezed juices, pink grapefruit, my favourite, and a juicer to make your own if you fancied that, plus masses of choice of hot and cold, really oustanding and included in our room rate.

The hotel is surprisingly quiet upstairs, especially so when you consider that it is at the centre of Dublin and Dublin life, at half past twelve at night on the Saturday night everywhere was still packed downstairs with a lively crowd.

Only downside was the fluffy mattress cover, hopeless for the back, but when requested, it was removed for the second night, and an extortionate 20 Euros for 24 hours of Internet connection, but when queried it was explained that they were locked into a long term contract.",5,2011,11,29
207,Not the Shelbourne of old I'm afraid !.. (Seems to be rack 'em; stack 'em and pack 'em),"Booked in for a romantic week-end with the Missus... Very efficient booking system.
Parking - selected Valet Parking as there is no parking at the Hotel (is in the City Center), but there isn't even a place to pull up to hand over your keys - it's double park on the busy St. Stephen's Green area (and on a Friday evening - a nightmare !)..  
Room - had requested a room on a top floor (to avoid road noise) and not near a lift... Got a room on the 1st floor, right beside the lift; would have preferred not to have been assigned a room with a disabled friendly en-suite (floor outside the shower got wet every single time); 
Breakfast - very good breakfast (bacon on the first morning was hard as a rock - fine the second day).. but otherwise good. 
Dinner - good selection; efficient service and nice food.
Bar/Lobby - A DISASTER !.. NOWHERE to sit !!.. I know it's a busy bar, but reserving seats in a bar that remain vacant for an hour is totally unacceptable...   We couldn't get a seat in the 'residents area' either & the attitude of some staff was bordering on rude.  We asked to be let sit at a vacant seat in the bar on basis that we would move when the party arrived, but told NOT ALLOWED..  Seating reserved was for 6.. Checked 30 mins later - still vacant.. Checked 60 mins later - 2 eventually arrived (must have been the kilt !)..  Purely based on this experience, I will not be staying here again - much nicer/pleasant hotels in the City where you are properly accommodated and staff don't treat you with contempt...",3,2011,11,28
207,Wonderful night in the Shelbourne,"Spent one night in the Shelbourne last Friday as a pre-Christmas treat, always wanted to stay and could never afford to!  The refurbished hotel is beautiful and great Christmas buzz around. Room was gorgeous, bed fantastic with lovely mattress topper etc, great shower and really quiet, no disturbances at all. Breakfast next day excellent in a very nice setting, could not fault at all, really looking forward to the next time we can afford to go!",5,2011,11,28
207,Not a 5 Star Experience!!,"Just back from a night's stay and although things started well the wheels came off a little as the day went on. Was greeted by valet parking (good), was checked into our room by 1PM(good) had lunch in front bar, nice buzz about the place (good), food came I had a few bites but meal was cold, waiter promptly changed for hot meal and management apologised prefusely even gave us complimentary fries. Approximately 6 hours later I felt unwell and had to retire to bed until 9PM when my wife and I decided to attempt something to eat again, we sat in the piano lounge (very nice) and decided after being offered a dining table to remain in the lounge as dinning room was very noisey and tables a little too close for our liking. We ordered just one soup and one salad and then waited approx 40 minutes (how long does a soup and salad take at 9:30PM?) after asking about our food we eventually started eating at approx 10:15PM. We had several drinks prior to dinner and was still comtemplating whether to eat or not anyway, when food came I was asked did I want another drink and ordered but 15 minutes later was still waiting and had to remind waitress who obviously had forgotten. My impressions were that there wasn't anyone taking charge of waiting staff and things weren't that well organised, could see a few tables hadn't been cleared of dishes/glasses and our table had dishes on it for an hour after we'd finished eating as we sat there. I may sound a bit fuzzy but really where's the 5 star service? The lounge wasn't busy not over crowded and there were no people standing due to not enough seats. Another thing to add, the bedroom we got was quite small but adequate and I noticed that part of our bathroom mirror was broken with sharp edges (I'll try and post my sample photo) which I think is quite unacceptable in a world that is so health & safety crazy. Summoning up our experience, perhaps we were just unfortunate and we'd like to give the Shelbourne another try as it's quite a lovely hotel with a good atmosphere and the staff were all very nice but perhaps the hotel is living off it's past tradition and reputation and maybe needs to focus a little bit harder on the full package. 
PS I don't believe I've ever posted a negative report on Trip Advisor and I wish I didn't have to mention all this but hopefully the management at Shelbourne will take on board some of my comments if they think they're relevant....5 out of 10 but must do better!!",3,2011,11,27
207,Shelbourne Again,"Thanks to my wife's Marriott points, we enjoyed three very pleasant nights at the Shelbourne.  We had stayed here about fifteen years earlier and the place was showing its age but the hotel has only just been entirely refurbished and is really quite nice.  The room was very well appointed and quiet - though, curiously, the housekeeping staff stinted on the soap.  Clean sheets, shampoo, mints, bottle water were replaced every day - but not the soap.  Go figure.  The concierge is quite the fellow and knows the town.  The Irish breakfast is a feast but staggeringly priced but - using points - quite worth it. It is a rare hotel that actually has people in its bars and restaurants but the Shelbourne's Horsehoe Bar and lobby bars were always full.  Right on St. Stephen's Green, short walk to shopping, and excellent pubs.",4,2011,11,27
207,Fantastic 4 night stay at the Shelbourne Hotel,"i was in Dublin for business and stayed at the Shelbourne for 4 nights.  The rooms were beautiful and well equipped and the service level was very high.  We arrived late on a week night (around 10 pm) and we were starving!  The bellman arranged dinner for us around the corner at a restaurant that was about to close.  Basically, whatever we needed, their staff delivered (seamlessly).  Amazing.  The bar after hours also provided some fun people watching!",5,2011,11,20
207,The food here is insanely good!!!,"My parents and I love to visit the Shelbourne and have lunch here when they come to stay in Dublin.  The food is just, simply, GREAT.  The fish and chips is just delicious - I always get that for lunch here because it is that good.  

We've also visited to have a quick snack mid-morning - scones, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc. and it's very good.  We have seen Afternoon Tea taking place but we were having some lunch at the time so didn't have Afternoon Tea but it looked delicious and we'll definitely be trying that next time we visit.

The location is superb too and the staff are wonderful.  It's a really lovely place.  Highly recommended!",5,2011,11,20
207,Incomplete experience!,"I am writing this review still sitting in my bed at the Shelbourne! 
It is, without doubt a beautiful property in a perfect location but.........

I have stayed in several properties in Dublin over the years as both business and pleasure bring me and my wife her often. The Merrion, The Westbury, The Four Seasons being some of the other 5 Stars but also lesser properties such as The Morgan and The Arlington have been the base in the past. I have to say, I have always enjoyed my stay in this city wherever the bed was!
I have been to The Shelbourne for a legendary 'Early Doors' drink on many occasions and mingled with Dublin's beautiful people wondering what it would be like to stay.
So, on this trip (3 nights), my wife and I decided on The Sheby.

Check-in was fine, I had booked a '3 for 2' deal on-line which seemed a reasonable rate compared with the others quoted. The room was ok with a view improved by the curtains being closed - Not a major issue, it's not a vital asset to a room just a bonus if you can see something other than brick Walls and other rooms!
The bathroom is superb with new fittings and lots of products. It's also very large. It would be true to say that the bedroom is a poor relation to the bathroom!
The bedroom has all the necessary features and is well decorated with a very comfortable bed and large feather pillows.
One would therefore ask, what more would you want?
Well, I'll tell you:
- I want a turn-down service like I get at every 5 Star I stay at!
- I don't want to have to get out of bed to turn the room lights off before I settle down.
- My wife found the coffee making facilities this morning and the electric cord to the kettle will not reach a power point. We had to lift the whole tray out of the drawer as the cord is threaded through a hole in the tray and then put the tray on the floor by the door and the nearest point!
- I am amazed that this hotel still charges for wi-fi. €20.00 for 24 hrs is daylight robbery!
- As I previously said, the bar is legendary. It's also very irritating for residents who want a quiet drink before dinner - There should be a residents bar elsewhere.

Having said all this, the service downstairs is very good as was my breakfast yesterday.

Overall then, The Shelbourne misses a few details. It's nice, but not quite nice enough.",4,2011,11,19
207,Darling of Dublin,"Just returned from a wonderful six day stay at the Shelbourne. I traveled to Dublin with my eldest son to explore our Irish roots. We were made to feel special at every turn - the hotel was completely sold out the night before we arrived on an overnight flight - knowing how tired we were they rushed to get us a double-bedded room. To our delight, despite using Marriott points we were personally escorted to an upgraded room in the Heritage wing. This is the older part of the hotel - some may say needs some sprucing but I found it to be just lovely. Fabulously plush bedding and a luxourious marble bath. The staff was beyond friendly and helpful, from Declan at the front door to Paul at the concierge desk. The location is superb - across from St. Stephen's Green - a magical park and only a couple of blocks to Dublin's museums and great shopping on Grafton Street. Lots of restaurants in the area, but be warned some are very, very expensive - but walk about and seek out places where the locals dine. The cafe at Avoca on Suffolk Street was a great find. Beautifuly prepared sandwiches, soups, quiche and baked goods - located in an elegant four-level shop. The only two things I could find lacking initially at the Shelbourne were a concierge lounge for gold/platinum level and the very small fitness room............but Dublin was such a wonderful, wonderful city we spent every possible minute out and about - and we had to look forward each day to coming back to the warm and inviting Shelourne Hotel. Thank you for making our trip to Dublin so special.",5,2011,11,18
207,"Lovely Shelbourne, Thank You for a Great Stay","The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin is absolutely extravagant. My husband and I stayed for one night for our one-year wedding anniversary, and wish it had been a longer stay. Our room was stunning, clean, and comfortable; the bathroom was luxurious with a soaking tub and separate shower. The Shelbourne has a tea room, restaurant, and bar – so many different options for your taste buds. The staff was more than accommodating and absolutely friendly. The Shelbourne has an excellent location, located near Grafton Street and St. Stephen’s Green. Perfect hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2011,11,18
207,Grande dame,"A wonderful location in one of the great old hotels of Europe.  The improvements made about five years ago were excellent, but some things are starting to show some ""threads."" staff were very hospitable, though some levels of English not as good as others. Bathroom nice, amenities weak. Room large, seemed lacking a more thoughtful furniture selection. Public spaces lovely, though heavily patronized, thus making reservations for tea a requirement, even for guests. Breakfasts excellent, and the Sunday morning hostess delightful, wish I could recall her name. No concierge lounge, and didn't realize gold status received breakfast, so I purchased the package. Valet parking helpful, doormAn solid, concierge very good. Value for stay, like most hotels in the Uk and Ireland, not quite there. Overall a very good experience and I'll surely return.",4,2011,11,16
207,Grand Hotel,"I traveled to Dublin for business in mid November. I stayed at the Shelbourne and could not have been happier.  It is an elegant lady.  My room was a suite (named after a Dubliner novelist) and could not have been nicer.  I had a view of the park.  Internet only worked when wireless but that was fine.  I cannot imagine coming to Dublin and not staying in this historic hotel; I only wish my wife had come.  

I am frankly shocked as to where it ranks on Trip advisor for Dublin hotels.  There cannot be that many hotels ahead of it in the city.",5,2011,11,14
207,Overlooking St Stephen's Green and Marriott points,"I stay here regularly on business.  There are lots of restaurants and shops in the area.  The rooms are luxurious with robes and slippers. Breakfast is expensive, unless it is included in your rate.",4,2011,11,11
207,not what I expected,"I booked a nights stay I had revserved a junior suite and got a great price on line €189 on arrival we had the car parked for us really nice touch, the room however was what anyone call a standard double! the bathroom was about the same size and the marble finished to poor standard. Before we got ready to get dressed we decided on cocktails in  the bar big mistake it was cold and their was a football match on and alot of people in football jerseys which i dont think is the right dress for such standard of hotel. we went back to the room I had a shower and while standing in the cubical the water was coming back up the spout not very nice and the plug hole was full of hair. on our way out for dinner i mentioned that the room did not represent the pictures on the web site but was informed i was in a suite!!!! very coldly to add!! however we returned from being out late and the night staff were wonderful and we relaxed in the soft sofa with a few drinks one blonde guy not Irish was so polite Pity I cant remember his name he offered us snacks etc but all in all it was not a great stay!!!",3,2011,11,10
207,"Good, not perfect","It is a beautiful property and very well located.  The room was spacious and comfortable.   Customer service was not as good as it could have been.  We were not afforded access to the concierge lounge although we are frequent Marriott travelers and have had that offered at every other Marriott hotel.   The internet was broken and it was hard/impossible to access e mail from the room or the business center for over two days.   The view from the room looked directly into an office building.  I could see what the employees had on their desk and no doubt they had an easy view into the room.  
Perhaps, the biggest disappointment was the food.   I was visiting a college daughter studying abroad.  I took her and a few of her friends out for tea at the Shelbourne.  The dining room looked beautiful, but the food was sub par - particularly the scones which were dry and hard and quite possibly the worst scones I had in Ireland.  We also ate in the signature restaurant which was mediocre at best - with small portions.   I would not recommend eating there.",4,2011,11,10
207,Best Staff ever.  Jane is a gem.,"I love this hotel.  It is a historic building, but you could never tell guess by the luxury of the hotel and rooms.  From 1824 this hotel shows no wear and tear that much newer hotels show.  The bed was amazing.  
The location was really good.  Take a right out the front door and it is only a couple of blocks to Grafton street.  I ended up walking all the way to Temple Bar area.
When we were checking in we were fed biscuits from Jane.  She was making sure everyone in the group was taken care of.  We had questions and concerns and she reassured us that she would be at the desk when we checked out to take care of any potential problems.
I highly suggest this hotel.  Might be a little more, but worth it.
I hope this was helpful.",5,2011,11,08
207,A Glittering Gem ... With a Few Flaws,"Whether it's business-related or not, when I travel, I choose Marriott whenever possible.  In fact, my husband and I have spent nearly 100 nights this year in Marriott properties, and have rarely been disappointed.  This, unfortunately, was one of those few less-than-stellar stays.

A female traveling companion and I checked into the Shelbourne, during a recent (mid-October) trip to Dublin.  Its reception area was every bit as gorgeous as the brochures promise:  glittering crystal, well-polished marble, brightly lit and welcoming.  It has an exclusive, elegant, old-world feel that just pervades the entire atmosphere.

The problem for me began at check-in. First, my traveling companion and I were placed in a king-room, despite the fact I had specified a two-double room.  Then we were grudgingly relocated to a two-double room -- with the absolute worst view of an abandoned, decrepit interior courtyard ever.  (We left the drapes closed for the duration of our stay.)  We were not made aware of a concierge lounge (available for frequent Marriott travelers) until check-out; and I felt, honestly, that I was being punished for upsetting the Shelbourne's initial plans.  (There were several other little nit-picky things that I won't go into here because they are related to Rewards perks that don't affect all travelers.)  

On the ""plus"" side of the ledger:  The beds are WONDERFUL! The breakfast buffet is fabulous! The location is great!

So while the Shelbourne could have earned a five-star rating, my personal experience definitely impacted my appraisal in a negative way.  Not negatively enough, however, that I'll pass-up another stay at the Shelbourne!  I'm hoping that my experience was a fluke rather than the norm, and I'm planning to stay there when I return to Dublin in 2013.  Heads-up, Shelbourne!  I'll be back...",3,2011,11,08
207,Fantastic Hotel,"Really good quality hotel,expensive but worth it.Staff were very friendly and pointed out some great bars",5,2011,11,07
207,great location,"We stayed here for 2 nights after flying overnight from JFK. The taxi was 40 Euros from the airport, but the driver was worth it.
The hotel is indeed a Grand Old Hotel. Our room was nice and comfortable. Almost everything about the hotel is worth the price, except the breakfast buffet is too Americanized. We would have preferred a broader selection.
The afternoon tea was very nice, although slightly overpriced.
The location was ideal, as we walked to everything we needed to see, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Temple Bar area, Ha-Penny Bridge, and even Guinness brewery.
We would stay here again.",4,2011,11,05
207,Tired Grand Hotel,"The lobby area of the hotel together with the bar and restaurant are very grand, impressive and luxurious. A true Grand Hotel. Thereafter, everything is not so grand anymore. The service is friendly, but could be faster at times. My Heritage Room was big, but very tired with too little furnishing to make it comfortable. On the table,there were 2 bottles of Cranberry juice and lots of peaches with fruit flies circling - must have been prepared for another guest. The wifi access was efficient, but very expensive. 
All in all, the hotel is in a good location with a nice ambiance, but the rooms need serious work.",3,2011,11,04
207,Outstanding choice,"We stayed in Dublin for one week taking side trips by train and bus to other areas.  This being our base location, we wanted something nice.  We certainly found that here.  The location for touring and taking the train or bus to other villages was perfect.  The staff was perfect.  We had a breakfast buffet included with our room that was outstanding.  Our room was large with a large bathroom.  We are part of Marriott Rewards so we also had access to the concierge lounge that was very nice.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,11,01
207,Afternoon Tea Delights!,"A few of my friends and I recently had the most amazing champagne afternoon tea in the shelbourne. It was an absolute treat for my girls day out before our wedding... not a typically boozed up crowd. We were treated very well and we had the most gorgeous sophisticated girly afternoon. It was just perfect. the hotel were very welcoming and even brought out an extra plate of bite sized treats after our tea and fizz for the special occasion.
Thank you to all the staff at the shelbourne!",5,2011,10,31
207,Outstanding,"All the details of luxury in the reviews are accurate.  For me its all about service and this place is outstanding.  1st class all the way, conceirge is great - got us pointed in the right direction on our first day in Dublin.  On checkout day, they stored our bags well into the evening while we toured the city before our 8PM train.  Great place, perfect location - we were able to walk virtually everything.  Well worth extra $ to stay at this hotel - and you can redeem Marriott points as well.",5,2011,10,30
207,Sheer Luxury,"Cannot fault it

Sumptuous room, comfiest bed ever, luxury linens

Close to tourist attractions

Old fashioned charm and sophistication

Highly recommended

207,"Wonderful Hotel, Great Location","My husband and I stayed here on the first night of our trip to Ireland.  We took an overnight flight from the US that landed us in Ireland at 5am the following morning.  The Shelbourne was more than accommodating, and had a room ready for us by 9am (despite check-in being at 3pm).  The room was spacious and clean, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The complimentary breakfast was absolutely insane.  So much food!  We picked at the items offered in the continental buffet, and each ordered a cheese omelette.  It was probably the best omelette I've ever had.  The location of the hotel was perfect for going out an exploring Dublin.  St. Stephen's Green makes for a peaceful walk to begin/end the day, Temple Bar is a short walk away, and Trinity College is right up the road.  The only downside is that the ""gym"" is tiny.  (Although most folks probably don't worry about working out while on vacation!)",5,2011,10,25
207,"Good, not great","We stayed for a weekend in September. The foyer, bar, restaurant, breakfast and staff were all top class. The room itself however, meh! A small 3-star room in a 5-star hotel. No tea/coffee facility, no bath. Nothing remarkable at all about the room. Pity, as everything else was top class.",3,2011,10,25
207,Just Perfect,"As soon as I arrived at The Shelbourne I knew it was going to be perfect for our visit to Dublin. The welcome from the moment we arrived at the front steps was the best I've experienced. The staff are so friendly, the rooms are so clean, spacious and comfortable, it really is a 5 Star hotel that lives up to its 5Star designation.

As for the location, I don't think there could possibly be a better located hotel within any city.",5,2011,10,25
207,Very Classy,"As soon as I walked into The Shelbourne I felt I was in a classy hotel.  It is a five star hotel and feels like it too, my room was as you'd expect spacious and clean with all the facilities you require, I even had an umbrella in the room to use in case the weather wasn't too good.

The hotel is only a couple of minutes stroll away from the shops on Grafton Street, and there is also the St Stephen's Green Shopping Centre if you prefer to shop in an arcade.
The weather was good whilst I was in Dublin so it was handy to be able to cross the  road and enjoy a walk on St Stephen's Green which is just across the road from The Shebourne.

I've stayed in Dublin on many occasions and although this was probably the most i've ever spent on a hotel, the saying you only get what you pay for has never been more true, although I skipped the full Irish breakfast of EUR32 and found a decent pub for a quarter of the price!",5,2011,10,21
207,Lovely hotel in central location,"I stayed here for a long weekend during my first visit to Dublin. From the moment my taxi pulled up to the front door to the moment I left, the service was impeccable. The only downside was my room looked out to another building however the room was spacious with a big bathroom and a large and VERY comfortable bed with lots of great pillows. There are a lot of restaurants in the immediate area and a good pedestrian shopping area nearby as well. The Dublin cycle scheme has a rack of bikes just across the street - fun for exploring Dublin! If I can find another deal on a room, I'd definitely stay again.",5,2011,10,21
207,Lovely old hotel with a nice staff,"My wife and I stayed at the Shelbourne for a business conference, and stayed over the subsequent weekend while some friends joined us from the UK.  The hotel is an old, stately property that sits across the street from St. Stephen's Green, a 22 acre park with walking paths, ponds and plenty of waterfowl to feed in the morning.

We liked most things about the hotel.  The location is excellent, the rooms quiet, and we had a decent sized balcony, so we could open the door and get in cool fresh air.  (Yes, in the tradition of the UK and Ireland, the hallways are heated well beyond what we find tolerable, so the balcony was definitely needed.  If heat is an issue, ask for a 7th floor room with a balcony.)

The food was very good, and drinks in the bar off the lobby were good, as well.  We found the Horseshoe Bar rather boring, but that's a matter of personal taste.  We prefer windows and light to dark interior spaces.

The downsides are the fitness center (one room with 2 treadmills; another with some dumbells) and the business center.  Internet was expensive (20 euro/day) and spotty, but credit was given with no questions.

All in all, a very solid place to stay.",4,2011,10,20
207,trips end,We ended up in Dublin and 3 nights at the Shelbourne.  Convenient to EVERYTHING.  Comfortable quiet room. Lovely people working there.  Loved my Irish coffee in the bar every night and my tea in the afternoon. Rescued by the ladies up front my last day when my purse went missing.  Recommend highly!,5,2011,10,18
207,Great choice for Dublin,Good value.  Super breakfast!  Quiet room.  First trip to Ireland.  Good food and shopping nearby.  Front desk staff efficient and everyone was friendly ,5,2011,10,15
207,"Best location in Dublin with lots of history, too.","Enjoyed our recent 3 night stay here.  The mood and ambiance is also very upbeat, bustling & busy in the heart of this action-packed city.  You can walk easily almost anywhere from here.  Having St. Stephen's Green right across the road is a big plus for beautiful, leisurely strolls.

Our room was pleasant with a King bed but the view of the office building across the alleyway, not so pleasant.  The bed was superbly comfortable with great linens which meant a great deal at the end of our 14 hour trip!  Traditional furnishings beautifully match the architecture of the place but they're beginning to look a bit ""tired"", not worn, just not ""fresh"" anymore.  We usually do not mind the shower over tub at all, but my husband @ 6' 4"", had a tough time navigating under the shower head in this one.  The tub itself was elevated too high, but the shower head itself, not high enough.

All the staff here clearly aim to please the guest from the front desk to the dining room to the Horseshoe Bar to the Lord Mayor's Lounge! The breakfasts every morning were abundant, fresh and offered tremendous choice.  (My advice would be to book the room including the breakfast.  You won't regret it!) Everyone we came in contact with was genuinely pleasant & very helpful.

There is a terrific amount of history of Ireland that has touched this hotel throughout it's existence.  The stories we were told were very impressive, including the drafting of Ireland's constitution at the Shelbourne.  You will not find a better location in Dublin.",4,2011,10,14
207,What a great hotel!,"I loved staying at the Shelbourne.  It's very historical, and very beautiful.  While it may strike some as 'intimidating' (read: formal), it is in fact, a very friendly place to be.  Everyone who worked there was welcoming and helpful.   I felt right at home.  It's location is great, being right in the center of the best area of Dublin.  You can walk to loads of great shops, restaurants, pubs and parks.   St Stephan's Green is right across the street.   Trinity College is a few blocks away.  I would highly recommend seeing the Book of Kells at Trinity College. (Some consider the Book of Kells to be Ireland's greatest historical treasure).  The Shelbourne serves a wonderful breakfast also.  The constitution of Ireland was signed here, and the room it was signed in is virtually unchanged; the original constitution is in a case in this room (ask to see it).  This is a fun, interesting, well-placed hotel.   PS.. our room was very nice too, with a large modern bathroom.",5,2011,10,14
207,Beautiful Hotel!,"Great hotel, Great location! The staff was amazing!",5,2011,10,13
207,A cut above the rest,"We booked the Shelbourne hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday on Saturday 8th October. We had high expectations because this is a five star hotel and had come highly recommended to us. Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations to a very high degree,from check in to check out,they could not have been more helpful in every department. The room was fantastic, very  spacious, comfortable and stylish,with a magnificent view of St Stephen's Green park. The food and service in both the bar and restaurant for our lunch dinner and breakfast on Sunday morning was as good as it can get, five star plus quality. Before we went for our meal in the restaurant we had asked if they could reserve a table in the 27 bar for us because some of our friends were meeting us there. Once again, this was no problem, even though it was exceptionally busy. We had a fantastic night in the bar with brilliant entertainment from an excellent pianist. Overall I can't fault this hotel in any way, in fact it has a five star rating but has five star plus standards. I have now, in my opinion tried the best hotel in Dublin and can't wait to go back again real soon. I would like to thank all the staff especially dearbhla for making our visit truly memorable",5,2011,10,11
207,Old world glamour!!,"Stayed in the shelbourne in June with a group of friends and found it truly wondeful. We were here for three nights and after the first night the bar staff recognised us and remembered our orders. 
Concierge was so efficient and got us into our restaurant of choice for 16 people on the Saturday night when we had previously been told it had been booked for weeks! 
All in all I can't recommend the shelbourne enough! Beautiful decor and fabulous location. If possible try a suite.... Possibly the nicest suite I've ever stayed in!! ",5,2011,10,10
207,"Great location, great staff, comfortable room","I stayed one night in this hotel as it was close to the theatre even I was attending.  The room was very spacious and the bed extremely comfortable.  Based on some of the other reviews, I must have gotten lucky to have a large, comfortable room with all the amenities.  It is in the perfect location for seeing all the great things Dublin has to offer, and being right across the street from St Stephen's Green, it also allows you to find a quiet spot to relax and recoup.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, always asking if there wasn't more they could do.  My only complaint would be with the food prices.  According to the menu in the room, breakfast was over 30 Euro and 20 Euro for an ala carte omlette!  That's more than the three course dinner at the French restaurant down the street. Needless to say, I did not have breakfast at the hotel. The rest of the prices seemed in line with a hotel of this stature, but breakfast seemed particularly out of line.  The hotel is definitely worth staying at based on location and comfort, but you may want to at least have breakfast elsewhere.",4,2011,10,09
207,"Very nice, traditional hotel","Myself and my husband stayed on Saturday night for one night, to attend a concert in Dublin,and I booked us into the Shelbourne as we hadn't had a night away overnight without the kids in years.  This was planned as a special treat.  
Check-in was seamless once we located the well hidden reception area, and the cookies at reception were a nice touch.  
Our king room was not as large as in some hotels we've stayed in, and we had a view onto the office block behind or beside the hotel, having lost all sense of direction on our way to and from the lift, we weren't sure which direction.  The room was clean, and the Pecksmith toiletries were a nice touch in the marble bathroom.  The decor was very traditional, and simple.  Slightly understated, for a 5 star hotel, I felt.  The bed was very comfortable.
We had pre-dinner drinks in the 27 bar at the front of the hotel.  We were lucky to get a seat, to take in the atmosphere, whilst many patrons wandered around trying to grab a table as patrons left.  The 27 bar is evidently very popular.
We had dinner in the Saddle Room restaurant, in the hotel.  The food was exquisite. We enjoyed every morsel of it.  Unfortunately, the wrong wine was brought to our table.  Having realized the error before we started to drink it, we notified a member of the hotel staff who had decanted the wine.  The wine we ordered was 100euro cheaper than the one that was brought.  The wine waitress/sommelier who brought the wine to us, who hadn't taken our wine order originally, rectified the matter by speaking to the manager and offered us a discount on the opened bottle of wine.  Whilst it was much more than we'd wanted to spend on wine, we agreed on the discount, and the wine was very nice.  We really appreciated how the matter was handled, and hope that the first waiter who took the orr did not get into trouble for his error.
After our concert we paid a visit to the famous Horseshoe Bar in the hotel.  It was small, and not as nicely decorated as the 27 bar, but we stayed for one drink.  I knocked my glass over accidentally when my umbrella caught the edge of the table as I made my way to the toilet.  I managed to straighten it up without spilling all of it, as it had been full to the brim when I knocked it over.  When I came back, the barman had cleaned the table and mopped the floor.  Unfortunately, the barman also took my glass away which still had some vodka and diet coke in it,  plus he also took the remainder of my bottle of diet coke which hadn't been knocked over.   I wasn't very impressed that his clean-up included taking the remainder of my drink away as I hadn't even had a sip of it yet.  There was really no need for him to take the diet coke away!   My husband ordered me the same drink again, and paid for it, but the atmosphere was spoiled for me. 
We then moved into the residents lounge (called the Lord Mayor's Lounge) after that, and had one drink there, in nicer surroundings.  It's a very impressive room and was much less packed than either of the other two hotel bars.  As with the other public areas within the hotel, there was some interesting art on display.  Also the classical music was a nice touch.
Breakfast was served until 11am in the Saddle Room.  We were led to a lovely gold booth, which were all reserved the night before by canny diners in the know!  The breakfast was lovely.  I did miss not having baked beans on offer though.  Only slightly though, as the the breakfast was very good, and the coffee is excellent!
Check-out time was noon.  Our bill arrived under our door in the early hours of the morning. it mentioned a fast cheek-out box at reception, which didn't appear to be there'd when we left.
One last thing, This is my second trip to a Dublin hotel in the last 4 months, and again I was surprised to learn that there is some sort of complication regarding using a visa debit card to charge to the room.  This has only ever happened to us in Dublin hotels.  We stayed in a Westport hotel in July and they had no problem accepting a debit card for charges upon check-in, so It definitely isn't a practice across all of Ireland.  Just Dublin, it seems.  Or at least in the two hotels we stayed in (in July and October) in Dublin. I didn't take a credit card with me, so I agreed to pay our room rate upfront (309euro for one night, bed and breakfast plus evening meal), plus 100euro extra towards any charges (to be refunded if it wasn't used).  I find this policy strange, and would love to have it explained, as most hotels have no problems with debit cards.        
I gave the hotel an average of 4 out of 5.  The service was excellent, despite the mistake in the wine order.  I took a point off though for the confiscation of the remainder of my drink when our table was cleaned up in the Horseshoe Bar.
I think it was expensive enough for a decidedly average room, hence the 3 out of 5 for value and room.  The room certainly didn't wow us the way we had hoped it would.  Perhaps I expected something more in line with the room we'd stayed in a couple of years ago at the Fitzwilliam at Stephen's Green.
We didn't use the pool, or see it, so I gave it an average rating, as there wasn't an option to not rate it here on trip advisor.

207,"Lovely hotel, great location!","Great old dame, rooms fab, stAff, fantastic location... and most of all...so so nice. ",5,2011,10,02
207,City centre gem,"After one night in a not so good room (at the back of the hotel, facing a concrete office block and above the bin yard) we were moved to a a much better billet on a higher floor.
The hotel is so central that all the delights of Dublin City are on the doorstep from Trinity College to Temple Bar and the wonderful restaurants around St Stephen's Green.
The main bar is a popular meeting place especially on Friday and Saturday.  The only slight imperfection was a meal taken in the Restaurant which was expensive and dull.  
The staff were superb.",5,2011,10,01
207,Well worth the price,"I have stayed in Shelbourne several times and it is now my go to hotel in Dublin's fair city.  The staff is knowledgeable, helpful and want to make your stay worthwhile.   While the rooms are not as large as most Americans are used to, standard rooms are large by European standards.   You need more than one night here to appreciate the amenities.  Just a word of advice; breakfast is not included with most rooms.   This is very rare in an Irish hotel.",5,2011,09,29
207,Very nice hotel,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for 5 nights.  The hotel is beautiful.  I upgraded to a suite but was dissappointed at the lack of a view for the amount of money I spent.  The bars in the hotel are obviously very popular among the local business men and were therefore always so crowded that getting a table or seat proved to be nearly impossible. There were 4 of us traveling together and not being able to go sit at the hotel bar and have a pint or 2 got annoying. This will prevent me from staying at the Shelbourne on future visits.  With that said, the hotel staff were excellent and very attentive.",4,2011,09,28
207,Great location-small rooms,"Have stayed here a few times. The location is great, in central Dublin opposite st. Stephens Green. The staff are excellent and nothing is too much trouble for them. 
However, I have always been disappointed with the rooms. They are small with very small bathroom. View is non-existent. I presume if I paid more I would get bigger room with a view of the park.
The bar is nice with a good atmosphere. Meeting rooms and other areas are very nice. Would check other hotels in the area before booking here",3,2011,09,27
207,Historical building,"Beautiful hotel with a perfect location.  However, the rooms were so small! Wonderful hotel bar and restaurant.  However, you're better off venturing on the outskirts to find something more reasonably priced and friendlier.",3,2011,09,25
207,Beautiful Classic Hotel in Amazing Location,"The Shelbourne is a beautiful hotel in the best possible location.  You feel like you're stepping back in time to another age.  The rooms are fine enough.  I think I ended up in a smaller room with a tiny bathroom and no view whatsoever.  The beds were super comfortable and the TV had plenty of channels to choose from.  The floor in the hallways were uneven and there were many twists and turns to get to the elevator.  The food options were out of this world.  The breakfast was plentiful and very tasty.  We had dinner at the hotel and we couldn't ask for better food.  We also unexpectedly had a tea service brought to our room the first night we arrived.  It was a nice touch.  WiFi was very expensive (I think 20 Euros for 24 hours) per day and quite a disappointment when other hotels seem to have complimentary WiFi these days.  Many landmarks were easily walkable from the Shelbourne and there was a great park across the street.

Overall, I was happy to have stayed at the Shelbourne and could not have asked for a more centralized hotel in Dublin.",4,2011,09,24
207,Very disappointing,"We had been looking forward to our first visit to Dublin and our stay at this Marriott property. We booked for one week. We left to the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt, after one night.

The hotel was very noisy. We arrived at 2pm and our rooms were not ready until 6pm!!! Old property that has been converted to a hotel and they added a connecting building, so finding our rooms was like looking through a maze. Rooms were small, but clean.

The executive lounge was filthy and smelly. There was food leftovers from at least 24 hours before and coffee cubs filled with cigarett butts. The Computer did not work nor did the phone. The lounge had no bottled water, soda or other drinks. The newspapers were 2 days old. 

The hotel's fitness center was basically one small converted bedroom with only TWO (2) tredmills!!!

We reported this to the front desk staff, who promised address our complaints, but did nothing. This property is not worthy of the name Marriott.",2,2011,09,23
207,Surprisingly great,"I expected the Shelbourne to be an ""old feeling"" five star hotel that was ""past peak"".  But in fact it is not like that at all.  I was really impressed at how well run the hotel is, how clean it is, and how beautiful it is.  I had a great stay.",5,2011,09,20
207,"Lovely hotel, but had some issues","This was our first stop in Ireland.  The hotel is very beautiful and the location is perfect.  We had requested a king size bed, but were put in a very small room with a queen bed and tiny bathroom--too small for a tub.  Our travel companions fared much better with a lovely large room with a king size bed, huge closet space and bathroom.  The staff was very helpful and accommodated our request for an early check in.

INTERNET ACCESS WAS A RIDICULOUS $28.00 (20 euro) PER DAY!  We found this extremely annoying and opted to go to a nearby ""Insomnia"" to take advantage of the free WiFi (and fabulous coffee).",3,2011,09,18
207,Perfect location!,"Exceptional hotel in downtown Dublin.  The hotel's interior is a very nice blend of modern and antique.  They were in the process of remodeling the sitting area directly inside the lobby when I arrived.  The next morning that same area was completed with new carpet and furniture.  
We actually stayed in two different rooms during our time in Dublin.  The first room at the beginning of the trip was spacious and well appointed with many useful amenities to the traveler (i.e. in room blow dryer (no need to use converter), and 110 volt adapters built-in).  When we returned to Dublin at the end of our trip there was some confusion over our reservation.  The front desk was very pleasant to work with and actually upgraded our room for the inconvenience.  We were placed in a top floor room with floor to ceiling windows along the length of the room.  While it wasn't as spacious as the first room, the view was worth the sacrifice.  
The staff were very friendly and curtious--always willing to assist with directions and suggestions.  The hotel is in excellent proximity to most of the Dublin ""tourist"" attractions.  St. Stephen's Green is directly across the street and a 1-2 minute walk will take you to Grafton Street. A 10 minute walk will get you to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Trinity College or Christ's Church. An excellent choice when adventuring in Dublin!!",5,2011,09,15
207,Old-style luxury,"We stayed at the hotel for one night while waiting for our tour group to arrive in Dublin. The rooms were very nice - old-style charm, complete with old-style quirks like floors that were obviously older under the nicely styled carpets and an apparent elevator that is no longer there next to the central staircase. The hotel was very nice and the staff was extremely helpful. It is located across from a park and only a few blocks away from a massive shopping area, Trinity college, and more. The restaurant is very expensive with breakfast for 4 costing more than $130 USD.",5,2011,09,14
207,A Very Nice Hotel,We stayed here in September for a 2 nights.  Accommodations were fine.  The hotel is centrally located which is great.  It is an old hotel with a lot of charm that has gone through a refurbishment.  The feel is sweet and nice.  There is no concierge level but the hotel staff are very good at what they do and helpful as well.  The buffet breakfast is very good but we did not have any other meal.  I would not hesitate to stay there again.,4,2011,09,13
207,A godd hotel in an excellent location,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for two nights on a short break with my wife and friends in Dublin. The hotel is in a good location, easy to walk to the main shopping areas and about 25 mins stroll from the Guiness factory - although beware the maps the hotel concierge give out don't show the location of the guiness store but rather the depot.
Our room on the fifth floor was spacious and well equipped although I would have appreciated a kettle and tea / coffee and the water pressure in the main shower was very poor (we ended up using the hose). 
Service in the bars and breakfast was very good.",4,2011,09,13
207,Luxury City Break,"This hotel ticks all the boxes; location, luxury and service. The standard rooms are superbly comfortable. Buffet breakfast is freshly cooked and has a vast selection of food. The bars are stylish and always buzzing. Staff are extremely helpful and most pleasant. Search around for best deals, as prices can vary quite a bit.",5,2011,09,13
207,Nice Experience,"We recently spent one night at the Shelbourne, then returned for another three nights at the end of our trip. First stay was okay. Room was small but we had a pretty good view. We commented that we would prefer a larger room upon our return, and indeed were given a much larger room with a similar view. The only fault with the room was the fact that it was on the top floor (8) of the back section of the hotel and it was located just under the elevator equipment room. Although we adjusted to it, there was a bit of a noise that some might find distracting. 
I agree with the many reviews that this is definitely not a five star hotel. It is an extremely busy hotel and while the rooms are very quiet, the lobby and other first floor areas are full of people and activity. Its quite the happening place and hosts a number of weddings and other events. If you are looking for a hotel with a subdued atmosphere, go elsewhere. 
In spite of the drawbacks, we would stay here again. We felt that the room rate was very fair and that the staff was excellent. Maid service wasn't consistent insofar as we didn't always receive evening turn-down service or replenishment of amenities used.",4,2011,09,12
207,Very Nice Hotel with Large Rooms & Bathrooms,"My husband and I stayed here on vacation and the hotel was very nice.  Because I am gold status with Marriott we also received free breakfast each morning which was very nice and saved us a lot of money.  Everyone at the hotel was very helpful.

The only complaint is that the floors were uneven so walking down the hallways felt a little like you were in a fun house!  

The rooms were very nice and clean and big especially for Europe.",5,2011,09,12
207,A real treat,"We stayed here for a friend's wedding. What we liked most was the treatment you receive from the staff. Everything is ""certainly sir"", ""right away, madam"" and the roo
S were really lovely. One complaint however. When we came down for dinner in the morning, there was a queue for breakfast in the lobby. Although it moved quite quickly and the staff were apologetic, we thought it was a bit unsuitable for a hotel of this kind to not have sufficient space for all its residents. The breakfast was delicious however",5,2011,09,12
207,Smallest room ever,"Loved Dublin and the people were unbelievably friendly.  (I know that sounds trite but it's really true.  We had to limit our conversations with people because they'd have kept talking to us for hours.)  Stayed at the Shelbourne a couple of nights in July and even though the outside temperature was mid-60s our room was sweltering.  They did come to fix the air-conditioning as soon as we called but it was never as cool as we'd have liked.  It didn't help that the room was the size of a shoebox and looked out over a rooftop.  We've stayed in many European hotels and I think this was the smallest room ever.  That being said, the fittings in the room were lovely and the bathroom was elegant, but I think I've been in airplane bathrooms that were bigger.  The public rooms are beautiful and the staff were very helpful.  When the bar was full (it's extremely popular with young professionals from the area) the staff found me a table across the lobby and brought me a drink and dinner.  High tea in the lobby area was lovely and the location in Dublin can't be beat.  Lots of great restaurants close by.",3,2011,09,12
207,Made by Mother's 80th Birthday,Went for drinks last Friday 9.9.11 to celebrate my Mother's 80th Birthday. Bars full. Asked Duty manager if we could sit in Resident's Lounge. He escorted us in and Waitresses were very friendly and warm. Thank you for making my mother's birthday so special. After a while the waitress arrived with a platter of petit fours with candles and sang Happy Birthday to her. It was amazing and she was delighted. Thank you to everyone on duty last Friday night!.,5,2011,09,12
207,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Shelbourne Hotel is the height of luxury!  The place is beautiful.  Service is impeccable.  Every amenity is available.   The daily breakfast for a very reasonable addition is terrific with a variety of choices at the hot buffet, and terrific cold dishes including European cheeses are a welcome start.  The tea room is well known throughout Dublin and worth a visit.  The buffet lounge is also terrific for a short relaxation or snack in the afternoon or evening.  In the future, my first choice hotel in Dublin would always be the Shelbourne, and, of course with a park view!",5,2011,09,11
207,Excellence in the centre of Dublin,"Our first experience of the Shelbourne was when they were fully booked.They phoned every 4 and 5 star hotel in Dublin to help us.Subsquently we booked in for a night of decadence!! It was superb the hotel itself is a historical building rich with history and stories from the past,it was great to be involved in that. Our room was stunning, it had a hallway!! And we were opposite the famous JFK room. 
I thought the highlights were the surroundings the art that adorns the walls is magnificent(see photos below).We had afternoon tea and breakfast which was the nicest eggs benedicts I've ever tasted!!definitely Go!!",5,2011,09,11
207,"Great location, excellent service","We stayed here for two nights on our recent trip to Ireland and it was a beautiful hotel.  Our room was fully equipped with comfortable beds and we had a spacious bathroom with separate shower and tub, even heated towel racks.  It's right across the street from St. Stephen's Green and several of the bus services have stops right on the street there.  You can walk to many shops and to Trinity College.  We enjoyed strolling around the park in the evening.  Meals are quite expensive here but there are many good restaurants and cafes in the area.  The service is excellent-- they go out of their way to make your stay perfect.  I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2011,09,08
207,Incredible Stay,"One of the best places we've ever stayed.  Accommodations were first class, breakfast buffet was terrific and the services was superb.  Every member of the staff went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and appreciated.    Can't wait to return.",5,2011,09,08
207,Very expensive for a room like a shoe box,"Can't recommend - 235 euros per night with no breakfast in a tiny room is extremely overpriced. Apparently it has had a multi million pound overhaul, but I cannot see where this has been spent. The only saving grace is that the bed was really comfortable. No pool despite numerous websites claiming as such. There is much better value to be had in Dublin. ",1,2011,09,06
207,An excellent choice,"In addition to its excellent location, the Shelbourne is a great choice for those wishing to stay in an historic hotel with modern conveniences.  The service personnel are professional while also very friendly, and more than willing to do whatever is necessary to please.  The room, and bathroom, are nice sized by European standards.  Take high tea in the drawing room, or enjoy a drink in the Horeseshoe Bar.  It all makes for a relaxing good time.  Special thanks to Maria for making our stay so wonderful.",5,2011,09,05
207,A Piece of Irish History,"We stayed at The Shelbourne on this and past trips because of its location, its place in Irish history, and its quality service. The staff cannot do enough for you (they even programed the GPS for me so that I would not get lost returning the rental car)! High tea is a must for anyone's trip to Dublin. 

I love the fact that the Irish Constitution was written by Michael Collins and company in what is now called The Constitution Room. I was surprised that the room is used for business meetings (complete with a large screen that blocks some of the historic furniture). Also, because it was used for meetings, it was unavailable to the guests who wanted to view the room and its artifacts most of the time. 

As an American whose ancestors fled Ireland in the late 1800s and early 1900s, this room has significant historic significance to me. I suggest that Marriott and the Irish government consider how best to preserve the room for future generations. This room and its furniture should not be used for anything other than guided tours. (In the USA, this room would be under the care of the National Park Service. It is time for Ireland to do the same for The Constitution Room at The Shelbourne.)",4,2011,09,03
207,Beautiful Historic Hotel,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful.  The location is great, as many things are within walking distance (St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Temple College, etc.). When you walk in the lobby, there are beautiful chandeliers and fresh flowers.  The bathrooms are very spacious, with lots of marble and a heated towel rack.  The exercise rooms are hotel rooms that have been turned into workout rooms - one houses treadmills, one with elliptical and bike, one with weights.  Just average workout facilities.  If you like to run, you don't need a treadmill though, because St. Stephen's Green is absolutely perfect for that, especially in the cool Dublin weather!

We booked a meeting with the genealogy butler, and we were not very impressed.  You have to provide the name and date of your relative who originally came from Ireland to her, and then she teaches you how to research the history beyond that - basically on the Internet.  You might be better off going with ancestry.com or some other website, because she will point you in the direction of Internet searches anyway.  She was very nice though...

Overall the hotel is pricey but beautiful.  You can tell they take very good care of it and have pride in their business.",5,2011,09,02
207,Irish holiday,We stayed at the Shelbourne a few weeks ago.  It was very nice with old world elegance and charm.  Our room was nicely decorated but small with no view. The location was fabulous. The food (breakfast and group dinners with the company) was great.  I found it annoying that internet was a 9E per day charge and there was no free access anywhere in the hotel.,4,2011,09,01
207,Faded / fading glory..............,"I was very excited about staying at this hotel as it is famed as the best hotel in Ireland. The last word in Dublin. I think that this fame is on the wane; there are now better hotels in Ireland and Dublin but it does nevertheless have the history. 

On balance it feels like more of a four star than a five star hotel (there is no pool, limited public rooms and common parts above ground have seen better days - think the London Savoy before its refurb). I thought the service efficient but not Four Seasons. I was a little annoyed that on arrival our twin request had turned into a King as we were told no twin was available - however in their defence ours was a request only and not an obligation on the hotel's part. Do be careful of this however if it is essential that you have a twin. We were upgraded because of it; or were told that we had been. The room was vast probably 400 sq feet and the bathroom excellent – separate loo which is always good. View very poor - a side road, but presumably you can pay to face the green. In my view there is no better location than this if you are staying in Dublin - almost everything is only a walk away - there are however better hotels.",3,2011,08,30
207,Old School Comfort and Excellent Service,"We stayed in the Shelbourne for a single night while attending a wedding in Dublin City...for a single night.
From the moment we left our car with the Valet Parking attendant, to our check out the following afternoon, I can only describe the service and level of comfort, as excellent.
On checking in, we were told that we had been upgraded at no extra cost. The room we had booked was a standard Double room, but the room we stayed in was actually a junior suite.....great stuff.
The accommodation was extremely comfortable and all staff members were attentive and courteous at all times.
The Shelbourne has a big reputation to live up to. In my eyes it would be regarded as THE premier luxury hotel in Dublin (despite the attentions of many pretenders to the crown)...and it really did not disappoint.
While the prices are not what you'd call economical, the bottom line is...you get what you pay for, and in that regard, I cannot reccommend this hotel highly enough.
The hotel is centrally situated with easy access too museums, historic public houses, government buildings and the Dublin light rail system (Luas Green Line).

If I ever have the opportunity to stay here again....I certainly will....and reccommend that you do too!!!",5,2011,08,27
207,Beautiful hotel in an ideal location,"The Shelbourne is in a historic building and the character is maintained beautifully. The rooms are spacious and very quiet, with effective blackout curtains. New bathroom amenities are added each day. The shower doesn't get the bathroom wet, a rarity in a European hotel. The breakfast buffet is abundant and delicious. The staff is very friendly, efficient and helpful. The public areas are lovely and always busy. The main bar is hopping! If there are any celebrities in Dublin, they are probably staying at the Shelbourne. Although it's a little pricey, it's worth it. The only criticism is that there is no free internet access, which seems to be the norm in Dublin.",5,2011,08,25
207,"Good, not Great","We stayed at the Shelbourne for four nights. The room I reserved was described as a small room & it was very much a small room; full sized bed, desk & miniature wardrobe - that was it. The bed was very comfortable however & the room had windows that opened, allowing fresh air in. The air conditioner was quiet & the small closet had a safe & ironing board but no coffee or tea making appliances - which I would have appreciated.  The bathroom was modern & luxurious, with white marble & a rain shower head & very good water pressure. It was also tiny & I discovered the best way to brush my teeth or put on makeup was to do it sitting on the toilet. We had one meal delivered; two desserts, one glass of chardonnay & a milk cost E37! We also had a drink in the bar served by a lackluster middle eastern man who did not make eye contact, never asked if we wanted anything else. Service at this property would be my main gripe, excepting the wonderful front desk & concierge. I found the bell desk useless. With the exception of one kind Polish man who offered to put my luggage in a taxi, no one else did anything but stand around chatting with each other & looking like Ireland's best looking but unmotivated bell men. They opened doors, perhaps called a taxi but did not offer to help with luggage & did not break off their conversations to interact with guests. I had been wanting to stay at this hotel for some time, but probably will not return. The location across from St. Stephen's Green is excellent, but there are many other hotels near bye, perhaps with larger rooms.",3,2011,08,21
207,The centre of the city,"This place cannot be campioned in terms of LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!!!
Its well managed (juice went down really well)....and the staff are cool. Pub fills up in the evening / a good Dublin watering hole, as they say.",5,2011,08,21
207,Most comfortable beds ever - Fab central location - For a 5* must try harder!,"Grand, stately, old-fashioned hotel with a sense of time and era - Stayed here last year and had a much better experience and an excellent deal from Travelzoo ( which may have biased my opinion!) No concierge to meet n greet this time, alcarte items not included in breakfast - kids disappointed about not getting their pancakes. Unable to take breakfast in the Saddle room, don't know if this luxury is reserved for guests staying in a suite? (which we weren't this time, dirty net curtains and windows ( doesen't really matter although room view overlooking St Stephens Green not much to see and Dublin is ALWAYS grey in weather) Heaters never really warm up and as rooms are quite spacious can feel bit chilly even in July! No beverage making facilities which i think is poor for a 5* hotel. Same goes for lack of Spa /swimming pool facilities.
Opulent, spacious, marble bathroom.  pleasant, courteous, amenable staff. Reasonable valet parking 25e per day, good variety at breakfast but insist on taking it in Saddle room for a truly decadent breakfast experience. Excellent location in heart of Dublin with a sense of history all around. All in all  a pleasant comfortable stay for one night with teenage children. However for a 5* must try harder",3,2011,08,20
207,Perfect location in central Dublin,"This property is beautiful.  The rooms are clean and the service staff was wonderful.  The lobby was VERY busy in the evening, which was a downside.  It is obvious that this hotel is very popular with local business people.",4,2011,08,18
207,Beautiful Hotel and great location,"I used 30K Marriott points to stay here one night on our final night in Ireland and I loved it! Service was spectacular and the people very nice and helpful, room was very comfortable and clean, and it was located in the middle of everything! (Tip: get tickets to Merry Ploughboy - an absolutely fantastic evening out!)  We used aircoach for roundtrip transportation to/from Dublin Airport, and it was very convenient and comfortable.(14euro per person round trip)This was a top notch hotel and I hope to stay here again.",5,2011,08,17
207,History meets Class,"The Shelbourne is relatively easy to get to from the Dublin airport and it really is in the center of everything. It's an impressively built brick hotel with sectioned off areas of rooms. There is a delightful tea room, bar, and restaurant - but because it is a nice hotel, expect to pay for it as well (at least 30+$ for breakfast and 8$ for a pint).  The rooms are small, but nice. However, make sure your air conditioning works before you settle in for the night - ours didn't work for a week and we just figured that we didn't have it until I realized other rooms had it. The engineer ""PJ"" was brilliant and kind, came to our room and fixed it right up. As soon as we needed a bit of heat though, everything shut off as soon as we touched the button; this was disheartening. Also, the internet issue is annoying. You get 1 code, per computer each day and have to check your TV in order to gain access to it. My boyfriend was away at work during the day and I would need the internet, we had to switch computers and phones in order to use the internet; with such a pricey and nice hotel you would expect free and accessible wi-fi. I applaud the staff at the hotel, they hail from all over the world and were wonderful, as well as the bell-boys and front desk staff. The beds are incredibly comfortable, lots of closet space in the rooms, but if you want privacy or to sleep in, make sure you put a sign on your door or you will be greeted throughout the day by staff.  All in all, a gorgeous hotel with just a few annoyances, but you'll have that anywhere.",4,2011,08,16
207,Impressive!,"Very tastefully decorated lobby area, bars, restaurants etc. all is spacious and impressing and wonderfully decorated. 
We stayed in a junior suite with our kids with two tiny windows facing the wall of the next building... Very comfortable beds, exklusive italian linen and great bathroom with rain shower etc. When we booked the Suite we were told that this is part of the Heritage floor where a small breakfast would be served, but the woman at the reception just told us the Heritage did not exist any more... and we could have breakfast for 22 (continental) or 29 Euros (Irish) in the hotel restaurant. Not exactly the alternative we were looking for. Alltogether the hotel was a very nice experience but honestly I question if I'd spend that much money again for a room at the Shelbourne if I can get all the stunning trimmings from the restaurants - including the very best afternoon tea ever - also as an external guest. We also booked this hotel because of the gym - but this cannot seriously be called gym as there are just some weight-lifting and outdated cardio machines placed in three different hotel rooms. The only treat mill that seemed to work made a hell of a noise I didn't dare using it, as the neighbours might wake up. Seems this is non of the priorities of the hotel or eventually this will be changed when the Spa opens.",4,2011,08,15
207,Great hotel & location!,We reserved this hotel for 2 nights and our flight was canceled so we ended up staying only 1 night. They waived the cancellation fee for the first night which was very nice. Would highly recommend.,5,2011,08,12
207,Wonderful experience for family.,"We stayed at the Shelbourne last week, August 2011.   Three children, ages 9 to 16 and two adults.   I'd stayed there a number of years ago, and was delighted with all the improvements.     The rooms were beautiful, staff was welcoming and the breakfast is not to be missed!   We will go back definitely.     The location is wonderful particularly for a family.",5,2011,08,11
207,Our top choice our next time,"My wife and I stayed there twice this month, and it will be our top choice our next time in Dublin. Dublin’s a great walking city full of history which the Shelburne is part of.  Pros: Great location next to St. Stephens Green, near Grafton St. and easy walking distance from the Temple Bar area both of which are great for shopping, food and drink, it has well maintained comfortable rooms, friendly & helpful staff, located next to tour bus stops. Cons: Executive lounge was being renovated, really wished they had set up a temporary one, and the rooms have auto charge mini refrigerators ( I travel a lot and it’s always nice have a refrigerator that you can keep food and drinks in for those times you don’t feel like going out.)",5,2011,08,11
207,I was very very disappointed with our experience at the hotel.,"The only good thing about the Shelbourne is it's location. The rooms are small and not serviced well. The concierge was most unwelcoming  and I had to wait, without apology, for over half an hour for my car. The staff were unfriendly.",1,2011,08,10
207,"Beautiful hotel, incredible staff, great location","I have read a lot of negatives about the Shelbourne on this site, and really could not find any of the faults that have been pointed out.  We all loved the place: the staff worked so hard to help us, the location is amazing, and the hustle and bustle combined with the beauty of the first floor public rooms was very enjoyable.  Though (obviously) more expensive than a B&B, we thought it was a reasonable value for a beautiful hotel.",5,2011,08,08
207,We stood outside and were not treated with respect,"We didn't stay at the Shelbourne but had an opportunity to stand in front of it one morning when we were waiting for our tour.  It began to rain so we stepped under the canopy.  A gentleman in black immediately came over and shooed us off into the rain telling us the bus would. ""pick us up over there"".  He used his body to move foward as to sweep us away. HIs attitude conveyed to us that we were not welcomed or worthy.  I won't be staying at the Shelbourne.",3,2011,08,06
207,Dinner & Over Night in the Shelbourne,"I stayed in the Shelbourne on July 13th.  The sun was shinning as I pulled up to the hotel, the concierge took my car so I didn't need to worry about packing. Staff on reception were quick but friendly. There was lovely biscuits and home made lemonade if I wanted. The Biscuits were divine.  My room was lovely, big bathroom and plenty of space. We had dinner in the restaurant, it was buzzing and I was surprised how busy it was, Great early bird menu.  Dinner was lovely, very tasty and not small portions. We went into the bar afterwards and it was really busy, great buzz. We got two seats and had a few glasses of lovely wine.  Overall a great time and I would recommend the Shelbourne, its a real treat and you feel like a super star staying in this famous hotel. Well done to the new general mgrs, new sales mgr doing a great job.",5,2011,08,05
207,Beautiful Historical Hotel,"which was at a great location across from St. Stephen Green.  Hop on Hop off bus stop was across the street.  There is a vast shopping center at the end of the street.  Marriott club members received a full buffet breakfast during the week. It was plentiful and did included an omelet station.  Club members can also ordered off the breakfast menu with no addition charge.
The Hor d'ouves and danities were short supply in the evening.  The club lounge was very  hard to find. The club lounge was very comfort and never crowded.
We had dinner in the main restaurant and  it was adequate.
There is no coffee or tea maker in the room.  And one coffee and one tea cost us E8.",4,2011,08,04
207,Beyond all expectations,"It was a special anniversary occasion for my wife and I and Reception saw to it that we were pampered from the start.  The Room Service staff were right on top of their jobs, polite, courteous and obliging.  We dined in an excellent atmosphere, choosing from a well-balanced menu.  The food was to a very high standard, timed to perfection and elegantly presented.  The waiters were attentive yet hardly noticed.  The room was most comfortable with every detail delivering a quiet restful night.  Breakfast was bright and cheerful providing the perfect start to the day (fried-egg lovers will appreciate their individual preparation as opposed to the commonly-found collection firming up under the heat-lamps!).  The public rooms were comfortable and welcoming and the flower arrangements were exquisite.  Well done Mr Hanley and your staff.",5,2011,08,03
207,Loved it,"Great hotel, lives up to its reputation for great rooms and hotel facilities.",5,2011,08,03
207,Worth every penny,"The Shelbourne was a touch pricey, but was an almost perfect experience. Our family traveled to Ireland when I had a business meeting (2 days) and then extended it to a holiday (4 more days.)  

The rooms (we had a suite with two rooms (one with a 2 queens and one with a pull-out)were clean, spacious and well appointed. 

The staff was spectacular.  The most polite staff ever. The front desk, bellmen and wait staff were fantastic. The downstairs bars were fantastic and so was the barber in the basement. The concierge was not quite as helpful as we would've hoped, but was OK.

We also had breakfast included with our room rate. The breakfast was the same each day, which was just fine as they had a nice selection of different foods served as a buffet.  They also had an a la carte menu that was available.  
We would go back tomorrow if we could!",5,2011,08,02
207,This is not a 5 star hotel,"Strongly advise not to stay.
The smallest hotel room I have every stayed in, the most expensive internet I have ever experienced, the worst buffet breakfast I have ever tasted and to cap it off no water in the room to shower or clean teeth ( I was told the management woudl write to me about that but of course they never did).
I would have given this one notch higher ""as poor"" because the service staff are so friendly but no water was just too much.",1,2011,08,01
207,Loved it; very classy and beautiful,"If you go to Dublin, there is no better place to stay.  We were there two weeks ago at the beginning of our trip.  The service was excellent and the common area rooms are beautiful.  We had afternoon tea which was lovely.  It is such a nice hotel that even the locals eat there.  The bar was lively with local businessmen and tourists enjoying cocktails.  The hotel is ideally situated.  I would definitely stay there again.  The rooms were reasonably priced for this class of hotel.",5,2011,07,31
207,Classy & Elegant: The Shelbourne Dublin Marriott,"The Shelbourne, built in 1824, greets visitors with marble floors and crystal chandeliers. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with all the conveniences (hair dryer, make up mirror, robes, ironing board & iron, safe, mini bar, internet).  The hotel is across the street from St Stephen's Green (a beautiful park) and a short walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, and a number of other places Dublin visitors will enjoy. Shelbourne staff are friendly and courteous. The concierge can help you with just about anything you need from a cab, to attraction tickets, to directions to popular pubs! If you are a Marriott Gold Member, you will have access to the members lounge for appetizers and drinks in the early evening. The restaurant food is good - besides menu choices, there is a breakfast buffet featuring traditional Irish fare as well as fruits, cereals, pastries, etc. Gold members get free breakfast on weekdays. The bar seems to be a favorite because it is always crowded! It is a 5 star hotel, so if you are not a Marriott Rewards member, you may find the rates pricey. If you are visiting Dublin, this is a great place to stay! This was our second trip and both times we stayed at the Shelbourne - and we won't stay any where else in Dublin!",5,2011,07,31
207,Very nice hotel in GREAT area!!!,"We loved the Shelbourne.  It had everything we wanted and needed.  It was close to some great pubs (locals type as recommended by our cab driver), restaurants and parks.  Just walking around the area is neat.  

Our room was clean and spacious but not huge.  No view (trash area) but we were never there so this didn't bother us at all.  The bathroom was of adequate size and modern but our bathroom door handle fell off.  I informed the front desk (by handing them their handle) and they took care of it right away.  No troubles there, whatsoever.

The morning breakfast was nice.  Good selection of items and tasty!  We especially enjoyed the bar menu one night.  We had a few pints, it was getting late and we were a little hungry so we just ordered some soup and brown bread and ate it in the bar.  It was fantastic!!!  Bar staff was great, too.

We had dinner in the restaurant one night and while the food was delicious, the service was just o.k....we had been spoiled in the country part of  Ireland for the preceding 10 days and the Dublin servers can't hold a candle to those out there!  The seating was cramped (table against table) and the servers just did their job.  Nothing more.  Not too many smiles or thank you's.  It wasn't horrible but I'd choose a different option next time.

The hotel itself is lovely.  It gets busy on weekend evenings in the bar.  Good fun!  I would recommend it if you're looking for a nice location in Dublin that's not too fancy but just right, in my opinion!",4,2011,07,27
207,"Five Star Building, Three Star service","My wife and I had stayed at the Shelbourne several years ago but the hotel has gone through an amazing rehab project since then.  Our room was beautiful although the view was of an office building.  Service was sub-par.  I tried three times to get my Marriott Platinum number into the reservation, and even by checkout it wasn't in the reservation.  Front desk staff wasn't too terribly service-oriented.  I had asked for a newspaper, and from the reaction of the concierge you would have thought I'd asked for a million euros.  He did tell me he would get a paper up to my room while we were out, but he never did.  

Location was outstanding but the staff need some retraining",4,2011,07,27
207,A great place to begin and end our trip,"Our trip began here and it was such a wonderfully welcoming place to come to after our overnight flight.  the staff worked so hard to get us into our room as quickly as possible even though we were checking in at 8:30 in the morning!!  Our room was large and had a fantastic view of St. Stephens Green.  The bathroom was unrivaled and the shower..... Absolutely luxurious!  We were sad to leave, but knew we would be back for our last night.  We were warmly welcomed again and were upgraded to a suite on the 6th floor.  Wow....what a room!  It was spectacular and we felt great.  the Shelbourne made us feel special and very welcome.  It was a great trip and thanks to the Shelbourne it was great from beginning to end.",5,2011,07,21
207,Comfortable way to stay in Dublin,"Surprisingly quiet, central location, fantastic afternoon teas, good service but breakfast not so good.  Local cages are good and reasonable.",4,2011,07,21
207,Couldn't have been better!,"We arrived at the Shelbourne on Sunday to the warmest of greetings, even though I had booked on points we were treated wonderfully. 

Our room (#440) overlooked the park, we had two enormous beds and the bathroom was huge! 

We had dinner the first night in the Saddle Bar the food was amazing, breakfast the following morning was ample and tasty. 

The staff made this hotel come to life, they breathe a genuine warmth into the place. Sophie was very lovely and exceptionally helpful. 

I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough it was a perfect place to enjoy Dublin. We will be back soon!",5,2011,07,21
207,Very enjoyable stay,"I stayed here with my wife for a midweek break on way to tour Ireland and enoyed it from the get-go. Great location, great buzzy atmosphere, yet quiet and sleek in the lounges. Rooms were top notch.  Staff attention was just pitched perfectly. Impressed the hell out of my wife - which was the whole point! Loved it!",5,2011,07,19
207,Good hotel with a real buzz,"We really enjoyed our two-night stay at The Shelbourne. The Deluxe Queen bedroom was elegantly furnished and very comfortable.

The hotel has some lovely interior architecture and fittings in the No 27 Bar & Lounge and in The Lord Mayor's Lounge - a very serene and elegant setting for tea or coffee.

Concierge, Reception and Bar staff were all friendly and professional.

One negative - chargable wifi.  This seems to be a trait with larger chain hotel groups (The Shelbourne is part of the Marriott group). We have stayed in four 5-star Dublin hotels; The Shelbourne and The Westin charge for wifi access - wouldn't it be nice if these corporate hotel groups stopped profiteering in this way? The Westbury and The Merrion provide complimentary wifi access.",4,2011,07,15
207,"Fabulous, luxurious hotel experience!",This was such an elegant hotel beginning with the uniformed doormen who escorted us to the front desk where the desk attendants were so welcoming and gracious.  The room was beautifully decorated and meticulously prepared for comfort with great linens and towels.  We ate breakfast every morning in their excellent dining room where service was impeccable.  It was such a great retreat to return to after busy days seeing the sites in Dublin and in a great location across from the beautiful St. Stephen's Green.  It reminded us of staying at The Pierre in NYC and being across from Central Park but on a much smaller scale.   Would love to return and plan to do so in the future.,5,2011,07,15
207,Not so sure about the 5 star,"As a gift, we booked a double deluxe room which contains two double beds. I booked through a website and not directly with the hotel for the simple reason that the hotel were charging me 120 euro for two breakfasts on the two mornings of the stay.  When I said I thought the price for breakfast was exorbitant, I was told by a very snotty person in reservations  ""it is the Shelbourne Hotel, and it is a 5 star Hotel"".

When our guests arrived at the hotel, the Champagne that we had delivered to the hotel 24 hours earlier was sitting in reception in a bag. Not chilled in the room like requested...strange I thought as ""it is the Shelbourne Hotel, and it is a 5 star Hotel"".

When they went to their double deluxe room (which we paid extra for, and which was confirmed with the hotel in early June to be allocated to them) they got a standard double bedroom with one armchair looking onto a brick wall! Finally got moved to another room which wasn't much bigger but was brighter.

As this was booked as a gift we were extremely embarrassed. I did contact the hotel and eventually they got the room they should have got in the beginning. I dealt with a girl call Emma who was very apologetic and finally got it sorted.  But I thought it was very poor behaviour considering ""it is the Shelbourne Hotel, and it is a 5 star Hotel"".",3,2011,07,14
207,Nice hotel,We stayed there for a week and had nothing but great experiences the entire week.,5,2011,07,13
207,Simply the best,"Arrived at 9:30 a.m. and were checked into our room immediately, a relief after an overnight flight.
Beautiful old-world elegance; courteous, gracious service
Immaculate rooms, excellent linens on comfortable beds
Room service at 1:30 a.m. was prompt, hot food, good choices
My husband had a health issue. Concierge connected us with a local pharmacist who got in touch with our family physician. Within an hour, my husband had the medication he needed. Concierge advised if that hadn't worked out, he would have gotten us in to see a local physician asap.
Didn't eat in the dining rooms but had high tea in the lounge. It was a lovely tea with all the usual treats, though probably over-priced. It was a touristy splurge that our daughter had been looking forward to for a long time, so no regrets.
There are several good hotels in Dublin, but the Shelbourne is simply the best.",5,2011,07,13
207,"Nice, quiet hotel.  Very pleased !","Stayed for 3 nights.  Our room was the 1st, next to an elevator - but we never heard it.  Awesome, I was nerveous about that.  This place is in a good location - as others may be.  But it's an easy walk to the main shopping street/area.  Most of the touristy places are of walking distance too (we took a walking tour from his hotel.).  The room was very nice, bed was comfortable, the bathroom was of decent size.  However - the prices in the restaurants were a bit high, but the bar areas were great and the wait staff were on top of their game.  Service here was perfect.  
If you're looking for a resonable priced breakfast - go out the front door, turn right.  You will come upon a small restaraunt on your right side, corner of the street, maybe 2 blocks away  - small but great prices & food.  We love little places like this.  

A very nice hotel in a very nice city.  We totally enjoyed the Shelbourne.",5,2011,07,12
207,Fabulous Bathroom Tissue,"The only thing fabulous about our visit was the toilet paper!
We got a very warm greeting from the reception staff as we checked in. the disappointments started when we saw the room. It was surprisingly small for a recently renovated hotel.  The furniture was excellent.  I tried the television and there was no reception - on calling reception I was told there was a problem with the signal in the area.  Why wasn't I told that as I checked in?  When booking online I asked for extra towels - they were not provided. 
The major disappointment, and what has prompted me to write this review was the breakfast. We were delighted to be greeted with a big friendly smile and shown to our table in a most professional manner. Unfortunately there the professionalism stopped. Firstly it was a buffet!  Supposedly a luxury hotel and they want guests to queue for their food.  The food was warm at best. The bacon tasted like it had been cooked an hour earlier and the other food was no better. There were no staff manning the buffet so we had to call a chef to get serviettes to protect us from the heated plates. When I asked for the serviettes the chef sighed and then proceeded to test the temperature of 3 plates with the back of her hand. she handed me one serviette even though my wife was standing beside me. We had to ask for another as she turned to leave the counter. We then discovered that the only eggs on offer were well aged scrambled, not something I relish, so after sometime waiting I called another chef, who finished what he was doing without replying and then came to the counter carrying a tray of food. We asked for fried eggs he asked how many and walked away. He gave no indication of when or where we might expect our eggs. Returning to our table we ate our now cold food, eventually caught the eye of a waitress and asked for our eggs. We were well finished when the eggs arrived - cooked sunny side up!
THE BREAKFAST ROOM STAFF WERE A DISGRACE. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY AN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ISSUE. NOBODY CARED. 
A most disappointing end to what should have been a fabulous experience.",3,2011,07,12
207,"hmmm great room, good breakfast, grumpy staff serving the breakfast","Fabulously historic hotel, we had a great room overlooking the green, great bed and bathroom etc, great room service, but all was somewhat spoilt by a grumpy waiter at breakfast who had no more interest in serving us , nor was the breakfast as good as the hotel should have had, we would go back though , but not rushing",4,2011,07,11
207,Was hoping for a bit more...,"I spent lots of time reading reviews of Dublin hotels; I did not want to stay at a cookie cutter property; I wanted a bit of luxury & some style & history & additionally, wanted a hotel close to the heart of Dublin particularly since it was our first visit & only for 2 nites.

We arrived early morning from the airport & were warmly welcomed by the staff.  First impressions of the entry were ""nice"" but not ""grand"".   We were surprised to learn that our room was ready for us & additionally we had been ""upgraded"" with a view of St. Stephens Green...original booking was ""Deluxe"" but I'm not sure what that or the ""upgrade"" actually means....ended up in Room 546.  Room again was ""nice"", classic; bathroom quite elegant with lots of marble.  Separate tub & shower.  From what I had read, the hotel had recently undergone a thorough restoration; furnishings were okay but seemed a bit worn in some areas.  The ""view"" was again ""ok"" but not anything spectacular.  Hotel was comfortably quiet at nite & street noise was not an issue.  Mattress was not that great as it was sagging in the center.  I think some people would find it very uncomfortable but I think we were exhausted enough not to let it bother us.

We had beautiful weather in Dublin & it was a little disappointing that there was no outdoor space or patio to enjoy the weather at the hotel.  There was no pool or hot tub facility of any kind we were told.

Breakfast was included in our package (even tho they charged us for it & we had to ask for it to be taken from the bill) and was served in the dining room which was rather non-descript & did not have the same classic style as the rest of the hotel in my impression.  Food was very good--buffet style but you could also order from menu.  

Service continued to be very friendly & helpful throughout our stay.  One disappointing note was that from the time we checked in on Saturday until we left on Monday just before noon....a room service tray sat on a table in the 5th floor hallway....dirty cups & silverware & used creamers on the tray, clearly waiting to be cleared....day after day after day....every time we passed, we'd jokingly say ""...still there""  I have to wonder how many housekeepers & room service & bellmen passed that tray as well & did not pick it up....not exactly 5* quality service in my opinion.  

One note that might be positive to some (or negative), even tho this hotel is affiliated with Renaissance (Marriott), you would barely know it ....VERY little is mentioned about the affiliation & you simply don't see signs of it.....kind of nice if you are not looking for the ""chain"" experience.

Bottom line, the hotel is ""nice""; it is ""fine"" but it did not knock our socks off.  Location is good.  area felt perfectly safe & upscale.  We easily walked to restaurants, shopping, pubs & sites.  The park (St. Stepens Green) was nice but felt it was a bit dirty from all the duck & bird poop all over the sidewalks & in the pond water....",4,2011,07,11
207,A grand old lady,"We enjoyed a 5 night stay in a lovely room at the front of the hotel overlooking the Green. (an upgrade to a ""Heritage"" room which gives access to the lounge)
The hotel is beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough for us - nothing was too much trouble.
Very convenient for Dublin central.
Not the budget option but if you enjoy a bit of luxury, the Shelbourne is highly recommended.",5,2011,07,08
207,Nice hotel in a nice location but overpriced,"The location of the hotel is in the best part of Dublin; very safe near the shopping district and in the vicinity of trinity college and St. Stephens green park.  It was easy to get bus and taxi transportation right outside of the hotel to get around the city.  We took the aircoach bus (a 24 hour service) to get from Dublin airport to the hotel which was very easy and economical.  We liked the hotel staff as they were all pleasant and mostly helpful.  The hotel in general was very clean. The lobby of the hotel was beautiful.  Our room was comfortable, clean and a decent size.  We had an issue with a concierge on one occasion who gave us false information in regards to the required method of payment for a tour we took.  The hotel did apologize and made it up to us.  
   This hotel is very expensive when compared to others of similar caliber in the same area (although the whole area is expensive).  Meals, internet and basically everything else were all expensive.  For example, it cost 30 euros a day for internet.    
    Overall, we enjoyed the hotel but probably will stay at other hotels in the vicinity in the future since they are a little more economical across the board compared to what is provided.",3,2011,07,04
207,Fantastic Hotel and can't wait until we come back and visit Ireland,Beautiful Hotel located in the Heart of Dublin.  Very friendly staff and were very accomodating.  Room was beautiful with comfortable beds.  Food was amazing too.  Concierge were wonderful and gave us great suggestions for dining and tours.  Would definitely recommend this hotel over any chains that we stayed while in Europe!,5,2011,07,03
207,"Great location, beautiful building","Shelbourne Hotel is right at the end of Grafton Street which is one of the main shopping streets.  Dublin is a great walking city.  We could walk to Temple Bar area in about 10 minutes.  We found several great pubs and restaurants just around the corner from the hotel.  Also, St. Stephen's Green is directly across the street. 

We did not eat at the hotel, it is a very high dollar restaurant. 

Room was good size. View was of an office building but we didn't go to Dublin to hang out in the room.   We used points to stay here so of course the value was great.",5,2011,07,03
207,"Great hotel in a great location, always bustling with activity","We stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel two nights in late June, following a business trip to Northern Ireland.  The hotel is ideally situated on the north side of St. Stephen's Green, bordering a wonderful, upscale neighborhood, and within easy walking distance of Trinity College, the National Gallery, and numerous restaurants.

We encountered some check-in glitches when were offered an upgrade to a suite facing St. Stephen's Green.  While the suite was spacious, its location on the six (top) floor of the hotel resulted in small, half-sized windows that provided a limited view of the Green and made the room dark.  We opted instead for a room in our original category choice, a Heritage Park View room, located on the fifth floor and with a wonderful view of the Green, and nicely appointed.

We dined in the Saddle Room on both evenings, and can highly recommend both the food and the service.  We also had lunch in the Lord Mayor's Lounge which provided a perfect street view.  The Number 27 Bar and Lounge is a great place for pre-dinner drinks, but it seemed to be continously overflowing with people, making if difficult to find seating, and a bit noisy as well.

Every member of the staff we encountered during our stay was gracious and helpful.  

One minor complaint.  The hotel has a wonderful art collection, but no printed information on the works or the artists.  Too bad!",4,2011,07,02
207,Wonderful Historic Hotel,"The Shelbourne originally opened in 1824, making it the oldest operating hotel in Dublin. In 2006 it was completely remodeled. The renovation managed to completely update the facility while maintaining the historic architectural features of the original hotel, which hosted many significant events in Irish history of the 1800's.  The lobby and other common areas have many historic Irish paintings on display.  

  As Marriott Platinum members we were upgraded to a larger room with a king bed. It was absolutely beautiful, having the feel of an old world hotel room with all the modern conveniences one could want. The bathroom was very elegant with marble floors, separate tub and large shower, etc.  

We had breakfast at the main restaurant every day (another Platinum perk) and found the atmosphere and food to be excellent. The Horseshoe Lounge was a pleasant and convenient place to have a pint of Guinness.    

  Typical of Ireland, every employee was very friendly and willing to go ""above and beyond"" to meet our needs. Dennis, the Concierge at the Shelbourne was simply excellent.  The doormen at the hotel entrance were also exceptionally helpful and courteous.   

Location is convenient to both public busses and tour services. The Aircoach bus from Dublin airport will drop you off less than a block from the hotel entrance.     There are many restaurants, cafes, pubs and shops within easy walking distance (don't miss the chance to visit one of the many traditional Irish pubs for evening music).  

Locals consider the Shelbourne ""the"" place to stay in Dublin. Believe me, they know what they're talking about.",5,2011,07,02
207,Perfect stay,"We stayed in the hotel for one night while also holding a private function for 50 guests in the Adams suite. The bedroom was a Heritage room overlooking St Stephen's Green.  The room itself was spacious and comfortable and the bathroom was also large. Only one complaint is that there are no tea/coffee facilities in the room. At €350 per night I would expect this basic amenity. We found the staff to be extremely helpful, courteous and professional. Our event ran smoothly and the staff were there to assist with anything we needed.  Special thanks to Fergal (Front Desk), Caitriona (Event Manager) and Eamonn (Banqueting director). Also thanks to all kitchen & waiting staff at our event",5,2011,07,01
207,Elegant and central,"My husband and I stayed in this beautiful hotel and we were so happy with our choice. The location is perfect, right in the city center but still not noisy. The service and food were great and the hotel is truly beautiful. We would stay here again if we ever returned to Dublin.",5,2011,06,27
207,Most Wonderful Hotel in Dublin,"The Shelbourne was built in 1824 on the north side of St. Stephens Green. The history of the hotel, goes back to 1922, when the  hotel played a very important part in the founding of the Irish nation.  The Irish Constitution was drafted in room 112, now known as The Constitution Room. The building is considered a national treasure that still keeps much of its charm as can be seen from the exterior and interior appearance. There are high ceilings, long thick silk curtains, beautiful chandeliers and an exquisite winding staircases with wood work can be seen in every corner of the building. 
We stayed in a junior suite and found it the most relaxing part of the trip.
It's also a great place to begin a tour of Dublin, or to set up a tour of further away places you may be inclined to visit. 
Book as far ahead as you can, rooms tend to go quickly. We had breakfast in The Saddle Room, and it was grand. The hotel will also post any postcards for you for free (you write them, they mail them for free). The staff was warm and friendly, and requests were greeted with a 'Certainly, only too happy to oblige,' and a feeling that you were the most important person in the hotel.",5,2011,06,27
207,Nice but problems,"Very spacious, extremely beautiful but terrible pricing and availability of internet, worn out mattress and forgery on our bill.   I can understand the worn mattress, (which felt like we were sleeping on mashed potatoes--no support) but the hotel subs out its internet service and for wireless service the cost is $80. Euros per week/PER DEVICE!!   Not only this but our final bill came and I was charged not only for the weekly access on the internet but also the hour rate and the daily rate but the hotel couldn't help since they use a third party provider.   The final insult on our bill was like 5 charges for items from the mini-bar, the only problem was we never took a single item.   Nice hotel and if you are willing to pay outrageous fees internet use, like ""soft"" mattresses and don't mind being charged for things you don't use then I highly recommend the hotel.  Really its unbelievable almost that a hotel of this caliber would make up charges on their mini-bar and want to abuse their customers so badly with the high internet charges.",3,2011,06,26
207,Nice Value,"After the long trip from Denver, we found the rooms cozy and clean.  The staff were very friendly and professional.  We had dinner in the restaurant which was quite convenient.  It is across nice central park and shopping.",4,2011,06,21
207,hotel made our stay perfect,"me and my husband have just returned home from our stay in this hotel, from arriving until checking out we had very comfortable stay. room was very well appointed , beds and pillows were very comfortable , nice size bathe and double sinks to nice touches slippers robes paper deliverd free of charge in the morning , the breakfast was avery nice mix of continental to full irish , no complaints at all. the bar area was a lovaly touch as well we both sampled the dublin oysters my only complaint was we wish we orderd more they were that good, the staff were great and attentive. we will be coming back as soon as we can, dublin has a lot to offer if its shops or going for the craic as the irish say well done to shelbourne...",5,2011,06,21
207,Stunning Hotel,"We were very privileged to get to spend a weekend at the Shelbourne Hotel with our 2 children. We wouldn't normally stay in such a salubrious hotel, due to our financial status, however, when the opportunity arose I am so delighted I got to experience staying in the Shelbourne.

The room we got was so spacious, even with beds brought in for the 2 children. The room was so clean that I felt like I was the 1st person to stay in it. Beds are so comfortable, I really didn't want to get out of the bed, the goose feathers are something I will be investing in. Anything we needed we got, the rooms have things like hairdryer, iron, umbrellas, vanity kits, beautiful creams and bath products, robes, slippers,  the list goes on and anything that wasn't supplied/needed in the rooms, we just asked and we got.

The staff are amazing, I especially found the staff who worked the main entrance to be the most helpful and polite people, they were wonderful. 

We got to experience the food at the Shelbourne and found it very good, it is very pricey and you do need to be prepared to pay extra than most of the restaurants locally. The bars were relaxing and it was nice to sit back and enjoy a drink.

The only little thing that we could fault the hotel on was asking for an extra hour after checkout, I don't think the receptionist was best pleased as she rolled her eyes, however we got the extra hour which made a huge difference to us.

Overall a fantastic hotel, I would definitely return and if we were a little better off financially we would stay at the Shelbourne more regularly.",5,2011,06,20
207,One of the best hotel experiences ever!,"We were planning a trip to Ireland for holidays and had some Marriott rewards points to use.  Given that this is one of the few Marriott properties in Ireland, we didn't really give it much thought, so you can imagine our surprise when this turned out to be one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had!  From the moment we got out of the taxi you could tell this hotel is all about service. From the doorman to the bell hops to the front desk and conceirge; everyone bent over backwards to ensure a pleasant stay. 

Our flight arrived in Dublin at 8:30 am...we were tired, grumpy, and feeling a bit rank, but past experience had tought us that our room likely wouldn't be ready until mid-late afternoon so we had anticipated dropping off our luggage and coming back later. As it turns out the room was ready and they were happy to accomodate us right away so we could shower, nap and hit Dublin refreshed and relaxed.  

The rooms were large by European/urban standards and the bathrooms were super modern and massive by any standard.   The beds and bedding were ultra comfortable and the room came equipped with a large flatscreen.  Just to prove this is an objective review the only slight criticsm is that we could hear the guests upstairs move about early in the am which also caused the chandelier in our room to rattle (oh it's a rough life....I know...)

The concierge was extremely helpful with excellent recomendations for dinner and the staff in the bar poured the perfect pint.  We'll happily recommend this hotel to all of our friends and will definitley stay here should we find ourselves in Dublin.",5,2011,06,19
207,Traditional luxury in a modern city.,"The Shelbourne is not a cheap hotel by any means but it offers a wonderful charm and level of service which many new five star properties fail to match. The location on St Stephen's Green is unbeatable and the rooms are luxurious and comfortable. I wished there had been more Irish staff as we were very nicely served by many nationalities but very few 
from the host country! The Horseshoe Bar is a really buzzing place on weekends.",5,2011,06,16
207,Beautiful hotel with an excellent location,"My girlfriend and I traveled to Dublin for a friend's wedding and stayed here.  We loved it.  Big, beautiful bathrooms, especially by European standards.  Right across the street from St. Stephens Green and only a few blocks from shopping, dining, and sight seeing.  I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2011,06,13
207,Quiet escape within the city,"Rooms are comfortable.  Bathrooms are wonderful and big and clean.  People are very friendly and helpful.  Free afternoon wi-fi, coffee and tea in lounge.  Right across the street from St. Stephen's Green.  Great location.",5,2011,06,13
207,very comfortable,"we enjoyed our stay here.  location was excellent.  service was good.  very nice rooms and atmosphere.  the restaurant and bar were expensive, but with so many other options in the immediate vicinity, we never ate at the hotel.   recommended.",4,2011,06,13
207,The Shelbourne is an elegant and top shelf hotel!,"Everything about this hotel says ""how may we improve your stay?  Spent 3 nights, and felt pampered from the time we arrived. Note, the rooms are equipped with plugs that accommodate all international devices.  Was able to use all my US electronics.....other hotels should take note...a GREAT convenience!!",5,2011,06,10
207,Very Nice Hotel - Great staff and service,"WE spent 3 nights (not consecutive) here in 2 different rooms. I felt the hotel was top-notch in terms of the room quality, the cleanliness and the staff. The executive lounge was a bit weird, hard to find and not very well stocked. Other than that though our stay was wonderful. The concierge , porters and the desk staff were helpful and courteous. The breakfast was excellent.",4,2011,06,10
207,Cheap beds,"This is probably the best Hotel in Dublin. We checked in for 4 nights. We left the hotel after the first night as we could not sleep on a double bed.
The mattress was so poor an cheap that when I sat on it it actually bent into the air upwards. 
The VIP lounge was very badly supplied and we had to go through corridors, climbing upstairs and going down stirs like a maxe to get to iot to find nothing. Not even a computer or anything to eat.

a very disappointed stay
nael",3,2011,06,08
207,Third time even better than the previous two!,"Yes, we stayed a third time at the Shelbourne for a getaway and were not disappointed. This is a regal hotel and the staff aims to please. We were given a spacious room that was so well-appointed yet homey. We had several small meals in the lounge and the bar area and couldn't have been better treated. The food was excellent and the staff were quiet but attentive. There are excellent options for a full Irish breakfast (what would be a trip to Dublin without a few of these?) We enjoyed Foley's which is to the left and the Red Rose Cafe to the right. The weather was perfect for strolling in St. Stephen's Green and the location is ideal for seeing all the sites. We really do look forward to visiting the Shelbourne again. This was our 32nd wedding celebration and we hope to have our 33rd at the Shelbourne as well. Thanks for everything.",5,2011,06,05
207,Expected a better room,"This was my first time in Dublin and I chose the Shelbourne with its majestic building, wonderful location, and depth of history. I was not disappointed with respect to the grounds and location. The bars and lobby are exquisitely designed and in my opinion very inviting.  That said, they are very crowded with throngs of locals and tourists. I was aware from website reviews that it is a popular and often crowded place so this did not surprise me.  The food was good.  Room service breakfast food was good, ample and the delivery was fast. The hotel staff I interacted with was very helpful.  Now for the rest of the story...  Upon my arrival, I was given a room that was small, small, small, and in a smoking area despite my reservation request and my Marriott profile. I have severe allergies to smoke and the hall  was blue with smoke from another room. I immediately called the front desk and they immediately reassigned me to another small room, this time with no adjacent smokers.  When I asked to pay for an upgrade, I was told they were sold out. Thank goodness I didn't stay there longer than a day. It would have been intolerable. I have no idea what the other rooms in the hotel are like but I would not return to this hotel unless I was able to get a larger room with a guarantee of non smoking.",3,2011,06,04
207,Waste of a renovation,"This hotel seems to be all about the reception rooms and joe bloggs off the street than guests.

Reception is out teh back of the hotel.
Executive lounge is not disappointing but a joke, from being impossible to find to be poorly equipt, staffed and drinks are not complimentary!! Never seen that before.
You need bread crumbs to find your rooms its such a maze.
My newspaper arrived while I was out (Left the room at 1100and came back at 1600)

Stay at the Merrion or Westin and have a drink in the shelbourne where there priority seems to lie!",3,2011,06,02
207,Loved it and will be back,"This is a great hotel in the best location. 
The service, food, atmosphere, cleanliness and decor are perfect.
Some of the rooms are quite small so do ask for a larger room!

If you dont know Dublin and you are visiting then rest assured that this hotel is in walking distance to EVERYTHING you want to see (the tour buses to the Guinness Brewery are 5 mins walk away) & the best shopping in Dublin. 

Parking would be expensive so rent a car AFTER your visit to Dublin if you are taking other parts of Ireland or pick it up from the city centre as you depart. 

The 'aircoach' to/from the airport stops outside the door. It costs about €12 return so be sure to take that.",5,2011,06,01
207,"A regal respite, centrally located - worth a splurge","The grand hotel overlooking St. Stephen's Green is a perfect spot to take in this great city.  Everything is within walking distance and the Shelbourne provides the right amount of papering and prestige for its guests.  Renaissance style rooms with all the usual ammenities, comfy beds and quiet surroundings.  Opulant public spaces, lounge for afternoon tea and attentive staff to address your needs.  You're close to shops on Grafton Street, restaurants on Dawson Street and an easy walk to Dublin Castle, St. Patricks and the Liffey River sites.  You too can call this historic landmark home during your stay in Dublin.",5,2011,05,21
207,"Great and real hospitality experience, want to come back!","Located in the viby part of Dublin, the Shelbourne offers a great experience.  Although arriving at a very busy time (Queen Elizabeth visiting, UEFA finals and Obama to arrive over the weekend in Dublin) and the hotel abuzz, there were no queues at reception.  Staff is friendly , personable and very helpful.  The rooms are classic but well equiped.  Overall great value for money and certainly one of my best stays this year - if not the best.  There is a great bar/lunch room downstairs, and many nice resturants in the vincinity.  I really recommend this one.",5,2011,05,17
207,"A truly beautiful hotel, with great service","The Shelbourne is a truly beautiful hotel, with great, personalized service, a wonderful location on St  Stephens Green, and, certainly for its weekend rates, it was a fantastic value. The room was large, gracious and comfortable, and I got an immediate early check-in, even though it wasn't promised with the weekend rate. It had a delicious afternoon tea, with a pianist, and a room full of elegant people enjoying their surroundings.  The staff were helpful and courteous, and there was free early morning coffee and cookies. If the breakfast had been free, it would have been perfect!",5,2011,05,17
207,Heaven on Earth - Best Hotel in all of Ireland !,"This Hotel is the first place where we stayed before starting our car travel all along the Irish coast to Galway, then returning to the Shelbourne at the end of our travels for another two nights until we flew back home...  It was the most comfortable and luxurious sleep with soft, fluffy bedding, and top quality linens.  The marble bath had heated towel racks, bathrobes and slippers!  Immaculate housekeeping, friendly and helpful staff along with the best breakfast ever served made our vacation a most memorable experience.  We hope to return, and will advise anyone traveling to Dublin that they should spend at least one night in this fantastic 5 star Hotel that is perfectly located within walking distance to so many wonderful attractions.",5,2011,05,17
207,Perfect,Simply the best hotel in Dublin. Location. Service. Atmosphere. It has it all,5,2011,05,11
207,Expected More,"I have mixed feelings about the Shelbourne.  I appreciated the wonderful, rich history of the hotel and enjoyed the quirkiness of it (we had to back down to the lobby and up a different elevator every time we wanted to go to the concierge lounge).  However, the room we had was fairly small for two double beds and we overlooked the parking garage.  The room itself was nothing special - could have been any Marriott, any where. Our maid left the window cracked one night and it took us a while to figure out why it was so noisy.  Our room had a connecting door and whenever the people in the next room were talking any where near the door it sounded like they were in our room.   You cannot beat the location of this hotel - literally right across the street from St Stephens, several blocks from Grafton Street, restaurants, pubs, shopping all easily accessible.  There is a Spar grocery several doors down that is well-stocked and has reasonable prices for snacks.  The staff was helpful with all of our questions and gave us some great advice on getting around Dublin.  I would stay here again, but only if I got a great rate with breakfast included.  I loved the location but the hotel itself was only slightly above average.",4,2011,05,04
207,Must try harder,"On arriving at the hotel, there was no doorman to greet us - the taxi driver commented and seemed rather shocked by this. However, we hauled our heavy bags up the few stairs and made our way to reception, check in was fine but no porter in sight and we were told, the lft is over there and press your floor - this fell well below my expectation of a five star hotel. We did monitor this during the week and found most days did have a doorman and a porter around - so why not Sunday?
 I know this hotel is somewhat of a Dublin institution but I did not like being greeted by a great many tourists everytime I arrived and left the hotel.
Our room was fine, reasonable size and plenty of hanging space, the bathroom was a good size although I think the shaving mirror and towel rack were designed for midgets, no way could you see in the mirror without kneeling down and I am not tall but banged my head several times on the towel rack getting out of the shower- a lack of good thought for usability. Five star hotel with no turn down and towel change service! breakfast was OK in most respects however every morning the bacon, wich could have been excellent was so hard it was almost inedible. We ate in the restaurant several times and our experiences were varied some evenings excellent professional service and some evenings having to pour our own wine.
Finally I do find it incredible that hotels can continue to charge their guests exhorbitant charges for internet. I had both ipad and laptop and had to pay 2 charges - claiming it was out of their hands and with a service provider (not the first time I have heard this cop-out).This is potentially a good hotel, but they do need to iron out a few basic issues for a five star hotel.",3,2011,05,03
207,Disappointing with regard to the shelbourne reputation,"On arrival the staff were very friendly. A parking charge of 25 euro per night and the car not onsite is out of order in my opinion. They did offer to retrieve it at any time but I wouldnt ask them to get the car because I left my sun glasses in it. 
The decor is nice old worldly but too much furniture. It felt very cramped to pack more people in. The rooms are small and dark. It has to be said though the beds are extremly comfortable.
The location could not be better and more central.
There was a lot of confusion about rooms at check in. We had 5 rooms booked for at least 2 months and the rooms ended up being on different floors. This is not acceptable for a hotel supposed to be of this quality. The staff were helpful in sorting this. One of the rooms was too small for 3 people a  pull out bed for one person at rate 600 euro is a lot to ask. They were moved to a bigger room but still a pull out bed is not good enough.
The breakfast was cramped and left a lot to be desired.
I wont stay in this hotel again. I feel there are nice hotels in Dublin and just as central. 
The rooms were spotless but an awful smell in one of the lifts.
We went for afternoon tea. I ordered diet coke 3 times. The wiatress got it bedly wrong 2 of the 3 times. It was correct the first time. At 25 euro a head for the afternoon tea it did not live up to expectation",3,2011,05,03
207,Great Location but disappointing room and service,"My partner and I had been looking forward to staying in the Shelbourne for a long time. It was not a great start being told they could not find your booking before the receptionist had looked properly. The room was o.k, if small. A good bed but woken to the noise of bottles being dumped at 3.a.m and 8 a.m. The service in the residence lounge just after midnight was very poor and involved me asking a number of staff. The breakfast was no better or worse than most hotels although the service was again poor.",3,2011,05,03
207,not bad but expected more,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights.... got a great rate on the hotel website, stay 2 nights get one free, including breakfast buffet.  The reviews and writeups made the hotel sound fantastic and not to be missed.  My travel book even said go for a drink if you can't afford to stay here!!  

In the end I thought it was just 'ok', nothing really special.  Wireless internet is very expensive at 20 Euros per day.  We ate/drank in the lounges a couple times.  The breakfast room didn't have the best service.  It was very busy and we were in a back room and waited forever for someone to come around with coffee.  The food was pretty good though.  One morning we were put into the lounge but the selection of food was not as good as in the main breakfast area.  The temperature controls were dials that showed cooler temperatures, but the dials were locked and we were unable to make the room cooler.  oh yeah.... be prepared to go to the restaurant to get a pot of hot water if you want some coffee in your room (I always travel with instant starbucks).  No coffee service in the room.  

I'd stay again, only if the price was right.",3,2011,05,03
207,wonderful treat,"we stayed at the shelbourne hotel on sat night april 30th just for the one night. we were greeted on arrival by Jane at reception who welcomed us warmly and was extremely courteous, we were upgraded to one of the heritage suites and this was most appreciated. Our entire stay was wonderful couldnt fault the hotel in any way at all, but the one thing that really stood out and made the trip such a success was the great staff  nothing was any trouble the staff were so helpful and plentiful and its a long time since i have stayed anywhere in ireland where we have got such good treatment. There were three of us on this trip and all would highly recommend this hotel and we would definitely be back no hesitation, well done.",5,2011,05,02
207,A very pleasant stay.,"My wife and I recently returned to Ireland for vacation.  We decided that we would stay in Dublin and do day trips if we wanted to travel outside of Dublin.   We booked the Shelbourne Dublin (Renaissance) because we really liked the location.   

The location turned out to be perfect for what we wanted which was just to relax, do some pub hopping, listen to great music, have a wide selection of good restaurants and do some sightseeing.  We walked everywhere from the hotel and we felt safe regardless of the time of day or night.  

More importantly, the staff at the hotel was superb.  They were very friendly and very helpful in recommending restaurants or pubs.  Their service in the hotel restaurant (breakfast) was fast and courteous.  Every staff member that we met during our five days was very pleasant and always greeted us.  

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will certainly return to the Shelbourne when we return to Dublin.",5,2011,05,01
207,"Perfect Service, Excellent Menu and Value for Money","we didn't actually stay in the hotel but visited friends here and joined them for dinner. The hotel is very elegant from the outside and extremely luxurious on the inside. It is worth taking a walk into the lobby even just to  see the chandeliers and grand stair case. We eat in the Saddle Room restaurant and had a 3 course menu for 40 euro. The choice on this menu was excellent and the pork fillet is a must have. The restaurant itself is very nice and busy..we had a really intimate and extravagant gold booth. The young Irish man serving us could not have done enough, his knowledge of the menu and wine selection was very impressive, he recommended restaurants for us to visit in Paris and Edinburgh that he knows  where we are going to soon, this really added the wow factor. The most impressive part was when a plate was brought out with sweets and 'happy birthday' written in chocolate on it. This was a real surprise for me and well done to the kitchen and waiter for organising this. 

The only flaw is the lighting in the restaurant which is very low, it makes it very hard to read the menus.

We had drinks after in the Horse Shoe bar where again we were amazed at the knowledge of the bar tender on the whiskey menu. This bar is really old fashioned and not like any other hotel bar I have been in. 

This Hotel is really worth a visit for dinner or drinks.",5,2011,04,30
207,Wonderful,"Stayed at the Shelbourne last week for three nights. It was a wonderful experience, the hotel was lovely, the service great and the location outstanding. You could walk easily to any number of sites and shopping destinations.  Recommend highly",5,2011,04,26
207,"Excellent position, excellent hotel","We booked this hotel via an offer on Travel Zoo and got a great deal of €150 for two including breakfast with an upgrade to a Heritage room. An Irish colleague told me to 'bite their hands off' at that rate! It's the best location in Dublin', he wasn't wrong.
           First impressions were wow! A real 5 star hotel with service to go with it, from the door man taking our cases from us, to the speedy reception. Our room was ready for us, even though we arrived at 10:30am and what a room, we could have played football in it. My wife and daughter couldn't get over the whole ambiance and quality of the room. We knew from when we first entered the hotel we were in for a first class stay.
         A couple of minor problems that were quickly over come without any fuss or bother, which is always a good indicator of the quality of staff, they passed with flying colours.
        Although we didn't eat in the hotel, wishing to experience Dublin nightlife, we did have breakfast, which was ample, varied and good. 
       Staff at reception were always helpful with advice, such as which bus to take to an attraction and never failed to smile when passing guests in the common areas.
       If you're going to Dublin and can afford it, try the Shelbourne; it's close to all the main attractions, city centre, has good staff and a treat to be away from corporate hotels.",5,2011,04,26
207,"Great, but","We had a great stay and superb service from the head concierge Denis O'Brien. He was most helpful and spent hours helping solve our problem back in Edinburgh, Scotland.  He has been on the job for 25 years and it seems no problem is too big for him.  He is also a big man - in many ways.

We were upgraded to very nice room #640 with access to Heritage Room.  Good beds, large bathroom, great shower, view of park, etc.
Also had breakfast included, but only on week days.  Heritage Room is nice, but no services (except coffee) on weekends.  Internet wifi access is available in room, but only for one device.
Biggest BUT was Martha, assistant manager.  She was of no help.  Only wanted to explain why they could not do something - instead of trying to help.  She needs to find another job.
We had dinner in the Saddle restaurant on the early bird (before 19:00) and it was good and a good value.  The server was very attentive, too.  Bar was also nice, and you can get a smaller meal in there.
St. Steven's Green park is beautiful and there is plenty of things within walking distance to see and do.
Go there and have a great time, BUT stay away from Martha.",5,2011,04,25
207,not worth the price to stay - go for a drink and pick somewhere else to lay your head,"go for a drink - see the famous bar (which is amazing) and be part of the scene - yet, stay somewhere else so as not to be disappointed - skip the icy staff and standard queen room - the bathroom was as big as an airplane bathroom with no tub and a sink/counter ( think airplane size) that you had to crouch down  to reach  - To be fair, it is great to be at a hotel with such rich history - but feeling like you are in someones maids quarters ruins the luxury.  Worst hotel room by far during our 10 day trip with 3 other 5 star hotels as competition",3,2011,04,21
207,Elegant with a few quirks,"The Shelbourne Hotel is, of course, a historic experience.  The remodeling that apparently changed the hotel in the recent past has not entirely taken away from the original elegance and beauty the Shelbourne has possessed through the years.  As an American visitor and a fan of old Hollywood movies I got a kick out of the allusions made to Princess Grace  throughout the hotel.   There is even a room dedicated to her in the back section of the hotel.   Although I'm not sure if that was only due the fact that her son and his significant other were visiting the Hotel around the time I stayed there...   Perhaps the Grace Kelly Salad isn't a regular on the menu in the tea room...   In any case, I loved the ambiance of the rooms and the hotel in general.  The beds were mostly comfortable and rooms felt clean.  I don't have any complaints in that regard, only compliments. In fact I would have thought it one of the best experiences I've ever had if not for the problem my boyfriend had with the concierge.  

You see, apparently, my boyfriend was planning to ask me to marry him during our stay....   However, he wanted to make sure his plans would succeed after several failed attempts at romance, in which he decided in his better judgment not to propose, so he enlisted the help of our concierge.  He later told me that he practically threw himself at the rather plump man's mercy, and the man coldly said he needed ""...more help.""  On his first attempt he took me on a trip to the country using very rudimentary directions provided by the concierge.  We wandered around like a couple of confused idiots for a bit until we found a very small beach with a lost dog...   That was depressingly unromantic and we were hungry so we returned to the hotel morose and in bad spirits.  My boyfriend was, of course, becoming very anxious and alarmed.  He decided to try again the next day.  This time the concierge suggested a terrible restaurant with reservations for 9:15pm...  The cab provided got lost and we had to walk.  The restaurant was totally unromantic and the food unsavory.  He asked for a table in a quiet, romantic place so he could get down on one knee and propose.  Instead we were placed an arm's length away from huge family.  Of course, my boyfriend could have ""made it work"" but was too troubled to pull it off...

We left Ireland depressed, frustrated and unengaged.  All complaints made to the concierge about the debacle produced nothing.  Apparently it isn't his job to be helpful.  

Other than that, it was honestly a beautiful stay.  Just don't expect too much beyond what the building and the cleaning staff will provide...",4,2011,04,21
207,Quiet dignity in the heart of Dublin,"Overlooking St Stephens Green this hotel is a wonderful place to stay tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre.  The staff are helpful, friendly and well trained as to how they should go about their jobs.  Attentive but not intrusive, just as it should be.  We stayed in one of the heritage rooms so the space was more than enough for two and the bathrooms are, I believe as standard throughout the hotel, roomy and very well appointed.  Food at the hotel was super, drinks at the bars and lounge were excellent.",4,2011,04,19
207,Amazing Hotel and Staff,"We were welcomed to the hotel with wine and a gourmet cheese tray during the U.S thanksgiving week-end, as we passed the hallways we walked by the Irish rugby football team. The lobby was stunning getting ready for Christmas 2010. The VIP member lounge was very quiet - needed some music and the gentlemen doing valet did not speak english much so we request another man and he spoke very well and was super helpful!  A little too ""reserved"". All and all we enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel to anyone else.",5,2011,04,15
207,Lovely Hotel;,"The Shelbourne is in a great location right across from the St. Stephen's Green.  We stayed in the Heritage Park View Room.  It was a nice size with comfy beds and a huge gorgeous marble bathroom.  The room had one small window that didn't give much circulation so the room got stuffy at times.  All in all stay was perfect for the beginning of an Ireland adventure.  

For breakfast go to Fixx Coffeehouse located around the corner from the hotel.",4,2011,04,15
207,Personally I will never stay here again ...,"Stay here if you are a rotund middle-aged trainer wearing American, you will love it. If you are French, Italian or German and want some understated style choose to stay at the Merrion 75 meters away. Personally I will never stay here again. Not that there is anything fundamentally wrong – it’s an accumulation of things. More a 4 star than a five star. No turndown during our 5-night stay. Be prepared for outside visitors occupying the entrance lobby and the communal parts, the hotel is a tourist attraction. Breakfast very average, overcooked eggs etc. and understaffed. One morning we waited 20 minutes for a table. The internet is a completed rip off – they charge by computer so if you have two computers or as we did, two macs and an ipad be prepared to pay 75 euro a day for the internet – ridiculous! I would boycott this hotel on that basis alone. Lacks any real charm and the makeover a couple of years ago feels plastic. Shower in the bath in our exec room, which I do not like. Cheap uncomfortable beds. Plus point is plenty of hanging space and drawers.",3,2011,04,15
207,Not the best value for my dollar or euro,"Don't get me wrong here, the hotel is gorgeous and it is in a prime location.  However, it was on the bottom of all of the hotels we liked in Ireland.  I was shocked that a 5 star hotel charged for wi-fi and I was surprised to see the AC unit falling apart in my room.  This hotel is rooted with lots of history and the breakfast buffet is the best we had in Ireland, but I didn't enjoy my stay here like I did the other places I visited in Ireland, and we left Dublin last to be the crown enjoyment.",3,2011,04,13
207,a wonderful way to celebrate a very special occasion.,"We  stayed at the Shelbourne to celebrate our golden wedding anniversary. The staff were wonderful and made us feel as important, as the royalty who were on the premises at the same time. In our room was plate with ""happy anniversary"" piped in chocolate and chocolates in the middle. Delicious!  We had a lovely room with a very comfortable queen bed, and a huge bathroom with every thing we required. The breakfast was very good, well cooked and everything hot, and a great selection of food and juices from which to chose. A very happy and memorable stay for a special occasion! 
     Thank you,
                 Pat and Colin.",5,2011,04,09
207,Great location - not sure 5* but certainly 5* prices,"Pros - location is second to none, staff were very nice, bathrooms amazing (i've stayed twice), residence bar for a drink late in the evening is very relaxing, horse shoe bar is lovely. I booked on points, got an upgrade, which was very nice.
Cons - There is a smell by the reception area, especially by the lift to the right and in it. Last time we stayed we thought someone had been sick in the lift or carpet the smell was so powerful, but it was still there 6 months later. That mixed with hoover bag smell wasn't very pleasant. I wonder did anyone else notice.
There was a drain smell in the room when we entered first, but we opened the window and left to go out for dinner, When we came back the smell was gone. That was good.
Breakfast - €32.50pp for irish breakfast in bed, and €26pp contenintal. Seriously!!!!!
The craziness of this was we stayed on points so would have splashed out, but i could not justify paying that for breakfast when we were in central dublin surrounded by restaurants and cafes.
The drink in the residence bar after dinner out was lovely - but then at about 1am they started hoovering. Thought this a bit bizarre as they had called last orders but wasn't possible to finish them in peace. Small con, but for a 5* hotel perhaps lacking attention to detail.",3,2011,04,06
207,Very Dissapointed,"We had high expectations about the stay but unfortuntaely we left very dissapointed. The main dissapointment was around breakfast  - the service &  the selection for a 5 star hotel was poor. In terms of service, I ordered from the menu. I asked for a strawberry smoothie, the gentleman came back and told me they could not make strawberry. I said I would have mango instead. About 5 minutes later he arrived with pineapple juice! I asked for French Toast. It never arrived. At the end of the breakfast, I asked the same waiter again about the French Toast and he said he would get it. It still never arrived. I asked another waiter, and it eventually arrived. I asked for Ketchup, it never arrived. I had to ask again for it. The buffet selection was poor compared to other 5 star hotels I have stayed in. It is also very cramped in the servery area, and not a very pleasant browsing experience.  How they could possibly charge 29 EUR per person for such an experience is beyond me.

The room itself was nice and roomy (Heritage Room) but was a funny smell/odour when you walked in.

I would not stay at the Shelbourne again.",2,2011,04,03
207,The most Amazing stay EVER - bar none!!!,"We stayed at this hotel on a 'Minimoon' after our wedding, it was a wedding gift from friends. On arrival we were greeted by the door porter who unlike most others was chatty - funny even and put a kick in my step before we had even checked in! The check in staff were extremely courteous and check in was very fast which is always a plus when you're away and have already spent an hour travelling! We were made away of where the Concierge was based should we require anyhting and then headed very excitedly to our room. This is where we were firstly impressed, we had the Heritage suite - 5 floors up overlooking Stephens Green, and though I have spent many a night  and day in Dublin I can honestly say that I've never had such a spectacular view. The rooms were beautifully decorated and as an Interior Designer myself I can honestly say I was greatly impressed with the mix of old style luxury and modern facilities. The Sitting room was large enough to house a private party, the bedroom with its separate door had a 6ft bed drowned in feather cushions and duvet, the ensuite was also big enough for a small family and immaculately clean. So much so I had a bath on arrival - not something I often give myself time for! 
The best of our stay however was yet to come, we had breakfast in our room the following morning (something I never indulge in as its generally cold and not of the same standard as the restaurant - how wrong I was on this occasion), two very polite ladies arrived to our room with a fully dressed table and silver service settings! The food was fantastic - poached eggs, roast tomatoes and potato bread for me and the Full Irish for my hubby! No messy eating at a little coffe table or spilling food on the the duvets, crispy bacon, hot toast (a rarity) and preserves, freshly squeezed orange juice and smoothies!! I was in heaven.
We then had a booking for the restaurant at 8pm that evening - now here's where the class kicked in, we were a tad late - 25mins to be precise, we were greeted by Andrew at the restaurant with my sincere apologies to be told to take a seat in the foyer, enjoy a glass of wine, take our time and enjoy some canapes compliments of the house.  He went through the menu with such detail and gave his recommendations at our request. I had duck, hubby had chicken, and 1 dozen of the freshest Carlingford Lough oysters I've ever had. Bottle of wine, again on recommendation, fantastic service, and even a quick nod from the chef Kevin as we were leaving, I remember the names of the staff purely due to their attention to us on the evening and their attention to detail. I'm sorry if this review seems to go on forever but quite honestly I could write continuosly and still not include all I want to say.
For a hotel that was destroyed by a fire some years ago it is a credit to its revival and to Dublin as a whole - this is the Hotel of the capital in our opinion!! Enjoy if you stay there, I have no doubt you will!",5,2011,04,02
207,What a great stay !,My husband and I satyed here a few weeks ago and I have to say it was fantastic ! I booked thru co vacations ( Continental ) and all that was available was a deluxe room . With that said the room was two floors ! Very era represented in good taste ! When we walked in it looked very basic bed/tv desk etc but when I looked to my left there were stairs leading up to a landing area which was the size of a small bedroom ! At the end enter the oversized marble bath area . The staff was very nice and overly eager to help ! We did not check out any of the restaurants because we prefer to eat at local pubs when in Europe . There is a taxi stand right outside of the hotel and most local attractions are in walking distance . I do advise buying the bus pass its two days worth and will drop u off at all the local sights !,5,2011,03,29
207,Wow - a 5 star hotel well worth every cent,"It was my birthday last weekend and as a treat I booked the Shelbourne for 2 nights as part of the travelzoo offer at 150e a night. I am so glad I did. On arrival on Friday evening the lobby was very busy as the Style Awards were taking place there but we were escorted to check in very professionally. Checkin was quick & very friendly. No problem with the reservation.

Room was assigned on the fifth floor overlooking the street. but there was no street noise.Double windows !! Room was very large, fabulous bed very comfortable to sleep in. I had a welcome gift of Happy Birthday chocolates & large water along with card from hotel management wishing Happy Birthday, very nice touch. The whole room was just regal & palatial.

The bathroom was the size of my living rooom, very large & spacious, separate shower cubicle and lovely deep tub, which was easy to fill. Soft towels & oddly sweet smelling toilet tissue !!!!!! Also there were 2 light settings for the bathroom, on off as well as dimmer switch.  2 toweling robes & slippers just added to the luxury of the bathroom.

Breakfast was included in the rate in The Saddle Room near the lobby. The cost is normally 29e per person so to get it included was a  steal. The room itself was very richly decorated and grand. It was a fab selectiion of cooked breakfast items, great black & white pudding along with cold cuts, pastries, fruit and cereal. You could even order eggs benedict from the breakfast ala carte menu as it was all incliuded. Silver tea pot & white porcelain tablewear again added to the whole WOW & luxury. Staff were great, very well mannered & keen to please. Could not fault

The location is great, just at the top corner of Stephens Green and just by all the great restaurants on Merrion Row & Pembroke St.  Would love to stay again if price was the same but doubt it. GO ahead & treat yourself.

Ate at nearby FXB steakhouse on Pembroke St which was great, Fabulous big steaks & great onion rings. They do a set menu which is good value. Also ate at Pearl just around the corner too, great French food in massive rooms in the basement of a normal looking building.A little more costly but it was a treat. As ever had tea & cakes at Bewleys on Grafton St- you have to if you are in Dublin.",5,2011,03,29
207,Top quality,"Excellent hotel.  Very old building.  Properly maintained.  Staff is helpful.  Could use better cooling in the room, but in early spring it's OK.  Pricey.",5,2011,03,28
207,This hotel made us feel like we were having a second honeymoon!,"I just spent Saturday night in the Shelbourne with my husband, after finding an incredible deal through TravelZoo - until May they are offering the Hertiage Suite rooms at a price of £129 (150 Euro) INCLUDING BREAKFAST, which is really a fantastic offer for such a gorgeous 5* hotel. You also get a 10 Euro voucher to use in the restaurant or bar which I just realised we completely forgot to use. Oops...I guess we were enjoying ourselves too much.

The room itself is one of the older rooms in the hotel and doesn't have a view of St Stephen's Green - it didn't bother us at all, we knew we were getting a good deal and were just delighted to be in such a spacious suite with all the classic luxury of the Shelbourne, for such a reasonable rate. You can't fault this place on cleanliness at all - everything is spotless. I would have liked some tea and coffee making facilties in the room but maybe it's just one of those things with 5* hotels - I've only stayed in a couple but they've never had tea/coffee in rooms. Everything else about the room we loved - perfectly comfy bed, lots of space, lovely bathroom.

The 2 bars in the hotel are brilliant - I'd recommend a visit even if you're staying somewhere else. The Horseshoe Bar is legendary and we would have gone there but it was standing room only and, being pregnant, I needed somewhere to sit. So we went to the No 27 bar which is bigger but has just as much character and a little hint of glamour. Drinks weren't really any more expensive than normal Dublin prices.

We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant - The Saddle Room - and had a lovely meal which was really quite reasonable for the standard of food and service. The Saturday dinner menu was 79 Euro for both of us - I was honestly expecting to pay about that much each so was pleasantly surprised. Also, there seemed to be a bit of a mix up with service which left us having quite a long wait between our starter and main course. Just as we were starting to get a bit agitated and looking over in the direction of the kitchen a waiter appeared and discretely apologised for the delay. He then brought us free side orders compliments of the chef and didn't charge us for drinks when our bill came. I loved the way this was all handled - we didn't even have to say anything, they just very discretely made sure we were compensated for the inconvenience. Proper classy! I also like the open kitchen in The Saddle Room - some might find it a bit noisy but we really enjoyed seeing the chefs interact and getting a sense of all the buzz and activity of the kitchen.

We also used the valet parking service for 25 Euro which meant all we had to do was pull up outside the hotel and a driver took the car for us and brought it back the next day when we were ready to go. We parked for about 24 hours in total so it was pretty good value and they are flexible with timing - you can leave your car up to about 5 or 6pm the day of departure which means even if you've checked out at 12pm you can leave luggage in the hotel and wander around Dublin until the early evening before heading home - which is exactly what we did! Some other hotels I looked into have strict policies with parking where it has to be no more than 24 hours or they start charging extra - one even said that you have to be gone by 2pm or they'll charge for an entire extra day. The Shelbourne's relaxed attitude was really great.

The best thing about our stay in this hotel was just the whole feel of it - it's very hard to describe. It just feels like luxury, class, history, the buzz of the city, the relaxed approach of the Irish...all wrapped up into one fantastic experience. It was romantic and exciting and for myself and my husband was like a second honeymoon - and one last weekend away as a couple before our first child arrives in June, so that made us savour it even more! Also the location was perfect for me as I could step outside and be in St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Trinity College and Temple Bar in no time - great since walking too far really tires me out at the minute.",5,2011,03,28
207,Best hotel in Dublin,"Stayed here for three nights 18/21 March which was the Ireland v England final game weekend..  What a wonderful hotel this is and such a good location, with the walk in the park opposite and shops just down the road.   This is our second visit here.  Curteous staff, wonderful decor, great rooms, coomfy beds, super breakfast, two wonderful bars really not much more to say other than it has to be one of the best hotels in Dublin and would chose no other to return to.",5,2011,03,24
207,"Impeccable Staff, Great Rooms, Wonderful Food, The Best in Dublin","We stayed at the Shelbourne hotel for one night, on a Saturday. The moment we arrived we were made to feel relaxed, the bellhop took our cases to reception as we were greeted by the friendly doorman. Check-in was efficient and fast, the staff at Reception are excellent and friendly. We stayed in a Heritage Premium Room which cost 218Euro for a Saturday night, inclusive of breakfast, this proved reasonable has breakfast cost 58Euro alone. 

Our room was located on the second floor, near the Gym facilities. On entering the room it was spacious, cosy and grand. The room was complete with writing desk, armchair, and other amenities. The Bed was excellent, as was the pillows it proved perfect for a great nights sleep. The Bathroom was large and featured a separate toilet, a shower and a deep soaking tub. Also included was two bathrobes and slippers. The view from the room was not the best, although other rooms feature views of St Stephen's green. 

As we were staying for a Birthday, we received a knock at the door and the friendly staff member brought a plate of chocolates and a card, wishing us an enjoyable stay and 'Happy Birthday.' 

For dinner we decided to try the Hotels own ' Saddle Room Restaurant.' It turned out to be an excellent choice. The staff were great here, our waiter was excellent and provided brilliant service. The food was also superb, whilst being affordable for Dublin. At the end of our meal, the same exceptional waiter brought us chocolates.

On returning back to our room after dinner, we received a knock at the door from a Maid, who brought us two bottles of water and chocolates. She also took the time to ask if we required any extra towels, which was an excellent touch as we did. 

Breakfast was included in our rate and takes place in the Saddle Room Restaurant also. There was a wide selection of hot and cold food available, which was delicious, especially the fresh bread. As we were eating our Breakfast the waiter who served us at dinner, brought us a bag of freshly made chocolates by the Chef, after I had told him how much we had enjoyed them. It is the little touches like this that separates the Shelbourne's Hotel staff from any other 5* in Dublin. 

We required late check-out, and this was not a problem for the Receptionist who arranged this. After returning from a shopping trip in Dublin that morning we arrived at the room to find we were locked out. This was soon rectified by reception in a matter of seconds, with our key card being re activated. 

As we had to catch a Ferry at 14.30pm, we brought our luggage to be stored with the concierge. This was swiftly done and we then decided to have a pot of Tea in the 'Lord Mayors Lounge.' The surroundings were perfect, and the staff member was swift and attentive. 

As we waited for our cases, we spoke to the friendly Concierge whom is a Fine credit to the Shelbourne Hotel. Without a doubt, the Shelbourne has to have the best Staff in Dublin, and more to the point the best Staff I have ever encountered. The staff here at the Shelbourne, make you feel that they are genuinely interested in the guest, and they always have the time to say ""Good Morning"" or ""Good Afternoon."" 

Forget the unfriendly Westbury and visit this Hotel, it is full of Irish Charm and Character. We will be most certainly coming back to the Shelbourne soon!",5,2011,03,17
207,2 Dubs treating themselves to touristy week end in Dublin,"Ding Touristy Ting in home town, Decided to treat ourselves to top hotel.  What a  disappointment.  Booked smoking romm, which I got but without ashtray.  Twice on saturday asked for one to be put in room , No joy.  ONOn sunday asked to see Duty Manager with regard to same, Ashtray promptly delivered.  Had dinner on Saurday night.  Very average.  some waiting staff very nice, some looked like they wished they were somewhere else,   Breakfast awful. sausages brown on one side, pink on the other  Inedible as far as I was concerned.. There was also a menu available for breakfast but.  we weren't told about this on the first morning. Bill pushed under door on morning of departue to be checked, signed and posted in box on the way out. This of course means you don't have contact with members of staff when you're leaving and nobody has to ask how your stay was. HAYOUR STAY WAS.  as it turned out had to query the bill, because we were charged for 2 items from the mini bar which we hadn't used.. Were told ""it's very sensitive""!!! Great week end in Dublin. shelbourne, Huge Disappointment",3,2011,03,14
207,"High Quality hotel in a prime location,where the staff cannot do enough for you.","We have just returned trim a weekend at the shelbourne,it was outstanding.we ate in the saddle room it was superb the food was delicious and the service impeccable.Our room was beautiful,the bathroom very high quality and a comfy dreamy bed too. We had early doors in the bar very buzzy yet still very slick service. Add to this the brilliant location and you get a truly5star experience.",5,2011,03,13
207,Terrible Service,"The Shelbourne in Dublin is a hotel that prides itself on its reputation as a high class establishment and it is priced in line with that. I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels around the world and the Shelbourne does not really come up to scratch. Its amenities are not really those of an up market hotel and not what many travellers paying over the odds for a room would expect. True, it may be restricted somewhat by its location in expanding to provide 5 star amenities but in that case, it should be pulling out all the stops in other areas. It doesn't. The rooms are nice enough but nothing out of the ordinary and in fact are a little ""frayed at the seams"" (cracked tiles in the bathrooms etc). We noticed that during our stay, although our rooms were cleaned, the complimentary toiletries that we had used were not replaced which seemed a bit tight. The worst feature of the stay however was the service in the Saddle Room restaurant. It was quite literally the worst service I have ever experienced. Our orders were taken and then not processed resulting in BIG delays in us getting anything to eat or drink (it took 45 minutes for us to even get a drink!). Our waitress came to take our order immediately after we had sat down and before we had had a chance to look at the menu and then when she did take it, she evidently forgot to put it through resulting in a huge delay. When we complained that we had been waiting for a very long time, she blamed us for ordering off the set and a la carte menus! She then brought the wrong wine having originally forgot about the order and then wouldn't accept that she'd brought the wrong bottle. We complained during the service and the manager came and apologized but nothing was actually done and the delays kept coming. It  took us well over 2 hours to be served our main course and we only moved on to dessert after we were assured that it would be brought out immediately. It took over twenty minutes to arrive. The service charge was still included on our bill however and it was only after complaining about this at check out that it was removed (admittedly with an apology and without undue fuss). Our stay was during a rugby international weekend and admittedly the hotel was very busy. However, in that case, put on more staff or close the restaurant if those scheduled to work wont be able to cope. I'm sure if you are a famous sports or film star the service may be considerably improved but if you're Joe Public, you could do better spending your money elsewhere. The Shelbourne has ideas above its station.",2,2011,02,25
207,"Just the very, very best of hotels!!","I hesitate to review this hotel for fear the reasonable prices will go up if this treasure is discovered.  Stayed 2 nights this Feb and 2 nights last Feb.  I am VERY picky and this hotel is the best:  Quiet at night, dark room at night, lots of sunlight (for Ireland) by day.
The staff could not be more gracious, friendly, accomodating, esp. Ms. Hird at reception.

On arrival since our two double bed room was not available they upgraded us to a suite.  Wel, that got my attendion.  The suite was spacious, cheerful in its yellow color walls and thick sound blocking drapery, a flat screen tv in each of the 2 rooms.  Beautiful marble baths.
I am very, very, picky about noise at night as i am a bad sleeper.  Even though overlooking the street and park the double pane windows blocked the noise.  The black out curtains blocked the light.  I was in sleep heaven.  So many hotels have noisy ac/heatesr and this was not noisy, just pleasant.  
I am VERY picky about beds:  this was not too hard, not too soft, just right.  
Instead of a staff of cannot do, this was a staff of can do.  I dont make many requests, but anything I did ask for, no problem.  I was stunned when I asked if they might have a free ballroom for my children to practice their Irish dancing for which we had come to Dublin for a major dance competition.  Not only did they get back to me within 5 minutes, they gave us a huge, and beautiful ballroom to practice in, no questions asked, no one hovering over us to see if we would damage the floor, etc, just turned us loose in a beautiful room with a gorgeous crystal chandelier, rosewood carved fireplace, lovely paintings on the wall.  I cannot say enough about how much we appreciate their trust to turn my two teenagers loose to dance away for hours there.  Such a can do attitude!!
We will be returning to Dublin in April and we considered another hotel just for a change of pace, but after this, we will definitely book into the Shelbourne even if they dont upgrade us (lol).
We booked with breakfast and it was a lovely huge buffet.
We did eat in the casual restaurant for dinner and it was terrific.  We had room service one night and frankly, it was less expensive than a top restaurant we went to one night.  That, is amazing.  My teenager loved the steak sandwich and I loved the soup and salad.
The kids loved the dessert of ice cream and chantilly.
So, if you like a quiet room with sunlight in the day and dark at night, a comfortable bed, a staff that says ""can do"", food at reasonable prices, in a lush, elegant  environment, this is your place.
My only hesitation is that you may all come and take up the rooms when I want to come or spike the prices!
I cannot recommend this place hightly enough and if you see my other recommendations of hotels around the world, I do have criticisms to say.  The only other hotel I loved maybe almost as much as this hotel was the Table Mountain Hotel in Capetown, which is a 5 star hotel, otherwise, not so impressed by many others claiming exceptional service. 
Also, great location a block from the shopping areas, close to museums, and a brief walk to Trinity College.",5,2011,02,23
207,I liked it but it could be improved a bit,"It's a good hotel but as the ""flagship"" hotel of Dublin, they could fix a few things.  I've stayed at over 50 hotels so I can be picky...here are my general thoughts (This was a list I wrote up when I was in the hotel & meant to post earlier.  Please forgive the organization of the review.)

There were problems with the heat – but they came up fast… but it was never really fixed. A space heater was provided which helped.  Only 1 window opens which didn't really matter but just FYI.

I found the room very quiet because I was not off the street, but there was noise above me like in an old apartment...building is old.  The vacuums are the worst...especially post hangover (I was there during St. Pats... vacuums should not be allowed!).  Room service was nice and told me what they give for a hangover cure (I think warm ginger ale?  I forgot now...but it was funny they had a standard thing that they will send up.)  On the room service...I do have to say it is insanely priced and not even that great.   You could get 5 gallons of soda in the USA for what they charge for 1 tiny little bottle w/ delivery (like 10 euro basically).  

The internet very slow for 80 euro for the week... like this in other Ireland hotels... but 80 euro is a lot for poor internet.

They do not have the most friendly concierge – but he was effective at getting me into places.  Westbury staff are much more friendly.  Thankfully I stayed there before so they were nice & patient enough to explain all of Dublin to me.

Friendly front desk staff with banana bread every day (nice touch).  “At your service” seems annoyed when you call – sometimes… sometimes not.  They say your name in this condescending way.

I could not figure out, for the life of me, how to turn my clock radio to non 24 hour time.  

Forgetting to leave bar soap, face cloths, etc… but spraying way too much chemical cleaner in the bathroom that I just decided not to have maid service and exchange towels.  

A CRAZY thing happens when someone leaves you a phone message.  I deliberately unplugged my phones so I wouldn’t be woken up (hangover - hello!)…so this friend left me a message and my TV turned on and started beeping at 100 decibels that I had a phone message!   It was like out of star trek and scary as hell – woke me up when I was desperately trying to sleep.  Who on earth thought of this madness?  That should happen in a fire, maybe...

If you are into temple bar, the westbury or westin are closer.

They could not tell me how much the cost of a local call was.  It was “something like one euro every few minutes or something like that” – It wasn’t listed anywhere.  They literally did not know at the front desk or at the “at your service” number.   I’m sorry but just because I am staying in a nice hotel does not mean I want to make $50 worth of phone calls when I don’t have to (which ended up happening because I had the impression that the phone calls were cheaper than using my cell phone for local calls – but this was not the case I learned after I made the calls.)

Beds were comfortable w/ nice linens & bathrooms were very nice.

Ok so that was just my random list when I was staying there...looking back, I do think it was a nice hotel but nothing amazing really.  I'd stay there again with a good rate - but the merrion and westbury are very nice too & have slightly cheaper rates usually.",4,2011,02,23
207,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed at the Shelbourne recently and I have to say it was fantastic, room was very comfortable.  Bars were busy and had a great atmosphere.  Breakfast was fabulous with a very large selection.  Would definately recommend this hotel having stayed there on numerous occasions and will definately stay there again. Staff in hotel very friendly and attentive to guests.",5,2011,02,21
207,Enjoyable,"Spent four nights in Dublin and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel.  The room was very spacious and the bathroom was the largest we have found in Europe.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating.  The Saddle Room was very nice with attentive waiter and good food, and the bar was great too!  Afternoon tea is a must!  We hope to return to the Shelbourne!",5,2011,02,21
207,My Favorite Home in Dublin,Dublin has a lot of great hotels and since I use to live there I'm not always picky about where I stay but The Shelbourne is always my favorite. Why? One word: the bar. The rooms are comparable to the Westin or the Westbury but the Shelbourne really comes alive with a mix of visitors and locals making a drink or two down in the bar an authentic experience!,5,2011,02,16
207,Grand elegance in a great city,"We stayed 2 nights including New Year's Eve, 17 extended family members in 6 rooms.  Our only service issue was that they wouldn't guarantee a roll-away in advance, told us to ask at check-in, and then at check-in, asked if we had reserved it.  We said we requested and were told we couldn't reserve, he said yes, you can, but the reservation is not a guarantee, just a request.  So, . . . after 20 minutes of a circular conversation, we ended up with extra blankets on the floor for one of the kids.  Not well done.  In all other respects, the hotel was lovely.  it is a beautiful grand hotel in a fantastic location. and the bars were buzzing on New Year's Eve.  Great fun for all, would definitely go back.",5,2011,02,09
207,City Centre elegance that saved the day!,"Things started badly as my reservation at the Conrad landed me an awful room that hadn't been cleaned properly and had an outstanding view of brick wall and car park. I checked out and tried to find somewhere else.

Thank heavens for the Shelbourne!

They found me a delightful room that was immediately available and threw in a couple of upgrades too. The result was one of their lovely Heritage rooms looking out over St Stephen's Green with huge bed, lovely furniture and enormous marble bathroom. My wife, who is quite a connoisseur on these things, tells me that the smellies were pretty plush too.

There has been plenty written about their Dining Room and the busyness of their Drawing Room and bars. We used neither but I would say that the former is being renovated and this is fully explained at check-in and didn't seem to be causing any disruption whilst we were there. On the latter, we couldn't help feel that the 'buzz' of the place was all part of the attraction. This is a landmark hotel at the centre of Dublin and one of THE places to be seen. Perhaps not quite the same league but think Claridges, or Waldorf, or Crillon, or Raffles and you understand the attraction. This place is slap bang in the middle of town and is a bit of an institution locally.

Two observations that dissuaded full marks: Firstly, I dropped my shower gel and asked the night concierge to send up more. He wrote nothing down and nothing subsequently appeared. A real shame because absolutely every other member of staff was immaculate. Secondly, you'd expect a hotel of this calibre to have a decent pool and fitness suite. Not the end of the world (there's some great places to run nearby) but still, for the money, you kind of expect it.

In all though, this is a proper landmark 5* in a great location. It stands head and shoulders above everything else in Dublin save The Merrion and we liked it very much indeed. Highly recommended.",4,2011,01,21
207,Luxurious elegance!,"What a beautiful hotel, the room was luxurious and wonderfully decorated with a huge bathroom.  We stayed in a heritage delux room!  The service graceful and the location perfect!  Afternoon tea is a must!!  I've decided to make this my hotel of choice when staying in Dublin...sorry Four Seasons!! ",5,2011,01,18
207,Excellent Dublin hotel,"Two night work stay with colleagues. Central position, elegant and beautiful hotel. Buffet breakfast good, not excellent.  Upgraded to suite, large and well furnished.",5,2011,01,11
207,Fantastic Service,"Huge rooms, brilliant breakfast and the best service I have ever experienced at a Hotel. Well worth a stay if you get a special price or can afford the full rates!",5,2011,01,09
207,Very disappointing,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for a night before Christmas and while being reasonable value, especially as we were upgraded to a suite, it was a very disappointing 5* experience. Why?
1. There was no heat on in our room when we checked in, despite it being white with snow outside. When an engineer looked at the heating it turned out that it was due for maintenance and that there weren't sufficient heaters in the room to heat it. He did get an extra heater but it was still a chilly experience.
2. The service is terrible. There wrere lots of people about but it was always someone else who was meant to be serving us. We waited for room service to call us back + and gave up, we waited to be seated at breakfast, we waited for tea/coffee, we waited to be served at dinner... And eating at The Shelbourne isn't cheap, which makes all the waiting a lot worse!!
3. There are no resident areas. The bar + lounge are open to the public so there is no where for residents to go when they are full, which was our experience.

Overall, I would find it difficult to give The Shelbourne a 4 star rating let alone a 5 star rating. There are a lot better places to stay in Dublin!",3,2011,01,07
207,Excellent Old World Service and Style,"This hotel is located across from St. Stephen's Green.  The rooms are spacious and wonderful.   The service is beyond outstanding - it is a of a quality and standard that is difficult to describe.
The experience begins the moment the taxi arrives at the curb.  Every effort is made for a gracious welcome and a smooth, efficient check-in process.  The rooms are of outstanding quality and only one time in numerous stays have I had a small  issue (it was with the internet and it was dealt with so quickly I felt that an entire team must have been standing by for my call).  
The concierge desk is looked after by skilled and knowledgeable staff who  make it their mission to assist in any way possible.  They give life to the words 'the difficult we do immediately, the impossible may require a little longer'.  
Although the hotel is part of the Marriott family you truly feel as if you have stepped back  in time; the building is historic but it is more than that - you step back in time to a period when the guest was of paramount importance and you feel that everyone is committed to your personal needs.  
The location is convenient to the National Archives, St Patrick's, Grafton Street, Trinity College, and so much more.  While there are many choices in the area there are also options for meeting someone for lunch, tea, a drink without leaving the hotel and all were very good.  Room service is very accommodating in dealing with any requests, service prompt, food hot and well prepared.  (Although on this visit it was the first time we tried the breakfast buffet and I cannot recommend it)
I would recommend this hotel for business or pleasure travelers without exception.  On this trip I arrived on a cold, icy afternoon and felt as in past visits, that I was transported to a safe warm oasis where one could relax and recharge.",5,2011,01,05
207,Has the buzz of a splendid hotel in the 1930's,"Stayed here for a couple of nights in a suite on our way to a wedding and it was lovely, our room was immaculately presented. The staff were as charming and efficient as any Hotel that we have ever stayed.  The two bars were busy and buzzy.  The location is second to none and the whole thing was remenissant of one of the luxury hotels of the 1930's when people dressed to go out and enjoyed the friendly company of others. We had a hiccup on our first night as our room was not ready, but the situation was handled properly and it did not phase us at all.  The Hotel itself is very, very nice and if like  me you love beautiful things,  the art is a feast for the eyes.  Dublin is amazing, and if you have never been you are missing a treat.  The shopping is to die for and the people are the nicest people that I have ever come across.  We will return as soon as our schedule allows.  I would personally choose Dublin for a weekend over anywhere else.  If you can't offord to stay at the Shelbourne go for a drink in the bar you will love it.",5,2011,01,05
207,Looks five star - but runs like a 3 star,"On arrival
The Shelbourne is supposed to be the best hotel in Dublin. My opinion is that it isn't. Check in was fast for us, although the staff member checking us in had no personal attention for us; she asked us questions that didn't relate to our stay. (How many nights? one. Do you need a second bed on your second night? err.)

The room
The room was nice, clean and quiet as was the bathroom. As you'd expect for 5 star. Annoyingly, there was no tea and coffee facilities in the room. If i wanted to order one up, it would be 6 euro for the tea and 5 euro to bring it to the room. At the rate per room, you'd expect a complimentary cup of tea.

Privacy
While i was in the room, a staff member knocked and charged in. He didn't give us chance to let him know we were in the room. He was refilling the mini bar.

Breakfast
Breakfast was served until 10:30am. We got to the breakfast room at 10am and we had to join a que for 20 minutes, one-out-one-in. Kind of unacceptable for a 5 star hotel - queuing through the foyer for breakfast. Food was ok once in. Service very poor. We were ignored so i had to dramatically catch the attention of the waitress to get tea, toast etc.

Card Key - stopped working so i had to que again with all the check-out/ins for 15 minutes to get it reprogrammed.

So, Its a great looking hotel, but the way it is run is very standard 3-star service, which is amplified when you expect 5-star service. We would never stay there again.",2,2010,12,31
207,very nice but make sure you budget correct,"i stayed at The Shelbourne for new years eve last year. very well located by st stephens green and all the main areas (o connell street, temple bar, trininty college) are in walking distance. The reception is grand and they pre-authorise approx £400 on your room for extras!! This is a 5* star so expected it. Room very happy with - had sound system in the bathroom and lovely view of St Stephens Green.

The bar is very busy and one of the most popular in Dublin. The restaurant was 99 euros per person again which was expected -  we used a very nice restaurant called 'Bleu' a couple of street away. Breakfast quite disappointing for the price. 

All in all i would stay again.",4,2010,12,30
207,Beautiful hotel that is always busy,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for two nights.  Location is wonderful, across from St Stephens Green and a short walk to Grafton Street.  The hotel property is well maintained and beautiful.  Around every  corner we saw gorgeous holiday flower arrangements and decor.  The service was good, it was what we expected but we never had the feeling that it was over-the-top (example:  offer to make reservations for dining on the property as most other hotels do).  If you are a nonsmoker, please note that some floors are smoking or half smoking floors.  We do not smoke and were on a floor that was considered a half smoking floor.  
The only reason we were disappointed with the Shelbourne was that it is always busy.  We were hoping to have a drink at one of the bars, high tea, or a meal but it was constantly busy.  Even reservation books were full!  We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel property if staying in Dublin.  Next time we would commit to reservations when booking!",4,2010,12,22
207,More a pub than a hotel,"The Shelbourne is a lovely hotel if you just want to sleep there. Don't expect to be able to find a restful place to enjoy coffee or a glass of wine. This is because the Shelbourne caters more for the locals than it does for it's residents. There are two bars in this hotel that are completely packed full of Dublin's youngsters out for a drinking session at the weekend. They are not confined to these bars either they all spill out into the elegant foyer and entrance making it virtually impossible at times for guests to enter the hotel. You have to literally shove and push past them. Also there is a massive queue outside in the evening to get into these bars and as a guest if you don't have your room key with you to be able to identify yourself as a guest you'll have to join this long, long queue to gain entry .
The lounge looks very comfortable but you will be lucky if you get to enjoy this room either. It costs approx £200 a night for a room at this hotel but it is virtually impossible to get access to the hotel's lounge during the day as it is completely commandeered by people having afternoon tea.This cost approx £25 and these people take over the lounge completely from 1.30pm (you can't get in if the tables are set for tea even if there is no one there) until after 5.00pm. We had to go to another hotel around the corner to have drinks and coffees. And the queues in the morning for breakfast.............seemed to go on for ever!
Most Disappointing.",2,2010,12,20
207,"Wonderful, modern, old style hotel","Stayed recently for a business trip.   The hotel is perfectly located in St Stephens green and has a nice feeling to it.    

Company event had a good rate, whereas usually this is out of my preferred price bracket.   The hotel managed a nice balance between being modern and having an old style feel.   

The blackout blinds really work - I slept in until 1.30 in the afternoon - suffering from both Jet Lag and a late night out.",4,2010,12,17
207,"Not worth the money, very disappointed, and treated poorly.","We have stayed in Dublin 3 other times, and this is our ""splurge"" when we travel, as we stay in 5 star hotels.  Last year we stayed in the Clarence, but I have always had my eye on the Shelbourne.  (We stayed at the Savoy while in England). Sadly,  I have never been as disappointed in a hotel as I was with this one.  When we made online reservation, we answered questions for extra towels and washcloths, and pillows. When we checked in, they volunteered that these items were already in the room.  They weren't and it took a while to get.  Mostly, we were just treated with a ""look down your nose"" kind of attitude.  The Irish Rugby team was on our floor, but when I went to business center to work on grad school assignment, the staff acted like I was trying to bust into the teams buffet room, which was right next door.  They kept peeking in on me, with a suspicious demeanor.  For the money we paid, our expectation is to have excellent service, and I would rate it as the worst we have ever had for this level of hotel, and worse than many of the lower ranked ones as well.  We were treated so much nicer at the Clarence, and we will go back there for our next trip.  I expected much more, and was highly disappointed.",4,2010,11,29
207,It's the Shelbourne and it's sheer class,"We stayed over the weekend of the New Zealand rugby match so the town was humming, especially the lobby and bars of the Shelbourne. It really is right at the heart of Dublin.  If you want a bit of Dublin class and history, you'll stay here. Our room was fine, we even had a balcony, sadly not overlooking the Green. Nice touches like trays of mince pies and cakes in the lobby to help yourselves. One major problem-the place is boiling. A previous correspondent has complained that their room heating was broken. You were lucky mate. We had the aircon on and the balcony doors wide open just to get some sleep. Sort it out Shel, it's uncomfortable and must be costing you a fortune in heating bills.",4,2010,11,22
207,"Plush, traditional - a tad old-fashioned","Stayed at the Shelbourne last week. Public spaces are elegant and upmarket. Overall flair of the hotel is traditional. Some of the staff are oddly snooty (Breakfast Maitre d', Heritage Lounge attendant). Reception and sales staff are very friendly. Restaurant food is also traditional and somewhat heavy - don't expect novel, healthy or innovative cuisine. Beware of food in the Heritage Lounge - there have been cases of sickness. There is no pool or spa. Fitness rooms are in place. Internet in the room is only via a (short) cable, so no lying in bed and surfing. Airconditioning in some of the rooms is erratic (i caught a cold one night). Heritage rooms are spacious and well appointed. Generally rooms are comfortable (but most don't have a view).",4,2010,11,19
207,"Not as good as it thinks, and good news for the cats of Dublin!","The Shelbourne Hotel.. the pinnacle of hotels in Dublin, THE place to be seen.. yadda.....nonsense!

Checking-in took 15 minutes - one woman working that desk and another busying herself by popping in and out of the office but ignoring waiting trying-to-be-guests. 

Having a sandwich in the bar, I asked the waitress if there was free Wifi for my iPhone. She said she didn't know, there might be, she thought there was, but I should ask at reception and they'd maybe give me a code... How about, no, I am eating a EUR16 sandwich and drinking a EUR14 glass of wine... 

This hotel has recently been refurbed. Fair enough. Perhaps the money ran out after they had done the foyer. The towels in my room were like the ones I used to have after 4 years at uni...frayed ends and thinner than a La Senza model.

There was no bath in the ""bath""room and the bedroom itself was certainly small enough that you couldn't swing a cat. If you were in to cat swinging, which I'm not. 

I waited ages at the bar to be served at 2245. A guy unloading the dishwasher spotted me a few times, but ignored it. I then called over to him, since his colleague seemed intent on only serving women, and he replied that the bar was now closed... even though the other guy was still serving, and I'd been waiting 10 mins... this was on a Tuesday night. But he then served me.. so it wasn't reallly closed, he just wasn't too bothered.

I couldn't find a pen anywhere to fill in the breakfast order. Most 5* hotels usually have one or two lying around. I found one in my briefcase and filled in the order.

Woke up the next morning when breakfast arrived - no milk for the corn flakes. Wonderful! In fairness, they brought it up pretty quickly after I told them but still...

And finally, the helpful quick check-out thing they push through the door - it didnt have the breakfast on it (which I had ordered at 1am) so I had to join the queue to check out anyway which was woefully understaffed. 

I know times is tough, but welcome guests, they are paying money to be there.. money is good for your business... 

The Merrion, despite its imperfections, is much better.",3,2010,11,15
207,"Great hotel in central location, can be very noisy at times","We got this hotel on Priceline for $145 a night. The hotel is located very centrally, and especially close to the main shopping area. Because we booked the room on Priceline we were given a very small room, facing the back and above the kitchen. When we opened the windows to our room we could smell the kitchen fumes. The airconditioning/heating system was broken (it was way too hot in the room) in the room. They sent someone to fix it though. At night we realized that our room was also right above the party room. There was a wedding party going on  which made it impossible to sleep. We complained a few times about the noise and were given a free breakfast in the morning. The breakfast room was really great. 
This is a very trendy yet classy hotel. I think we got a bit unlucky with our room, and given that it was Valentines Day weekend the hotel was at full capacity. It would definitely return, but not with a Priceline reservation.",4,2010,11,10
207,Fantastic position and a true quality hotel,"The Shelbourne is very well located in the centre of Dublin, ideal for a quick holiday. The bars, whilst busy had excellent service and the lounge was very welcoming with a roaring fire and comfortable chairs. Service throughout was extremely professional, with staff showing a high degree of care.
We stayed in a smaller back room, but the price at around 100 euors was fine for two and gave us access to everthing the hotel has to offer.
A true 5 star plus hotel.

I will look forward to returning.",5,2010,11,04
207,"Great location, Cosy place with great character"," On arrival we were well looked after with valet parking and the reception lady was lovely, she looked middle eastern and could not have been nicer. 
I have stayed in other 5 stars and I was disappointed that the horse shoe bar was closed on a Monday night, I was so looking forward to seeing this famous bar but unfortunately not on this occasion. 
Breakfast in the saddle room was beautiful, we were seated by a nice lady and ordered coffee but we were not offered toast and there was no sight of butter anywhere. The staff were nice but could have explained to us the layout better.
The room was ""Cosy"" but I liked it compared to the big cold feel of The Four Seasons rooms, however if I was been pickey the air-conditioning unit needs a bit of a clean, not bad but would not be accepted in 5 star circles
I know this might sound crazy but the windows are something that I can only assume you would find in a    Run down hospital. It was a lovely stay and the hotel has a lot going for it. I maybe a little harsh but I was really looking forward to the horse shoe bar. Overall very good will be back ! ",4,2010,11,02
207,Superbly located; Exceptional customer service,"Went for NYE and both the location and the staff were excellent!  It is within a couple of blocks walking distance to all the key shopping centers and city center.  One night we were craving Chinese, but there were no delivery locations.  The bellman brought us menus and offered to go pick it up himself so we could still lounge in our pjs!  The staff also booked a car for us in order to explore further south.  They had the car delivered to the hotel and picked up from the agency from the hotel.  Service was above and beyond in every regard. 

Rooms are ample sized with American standards (two queen beds!) and American plugs on the desk.  Bathrooms are marble with full tub and shower, but with the toasty European towel racks.  The lounge is a bit difficult to find but comfortable once there.",5,2010,11,01
207,Service awful,I have to say for all the staff and grand rooms this hotel let's itself down on the staff whether they are badly trained or just plain lazy I can understand it. Sat I. The lord mayor lounge for 25 mins without a single person taking our order. Not a single tray used and got to the point where we just left. I'm off to the Merrion where they treat guests like guests.  Never coming back,1,2010,10,30
207,Outstanding accommodations-Shelbourne Dublin,"Outstanding service. Exceptional staff. HUGE bathrooms and very comfortable beds. You don't have to leave the hotel to enjoy yourself. The bars were a wonderful place to spend time. The staff at this hotel is beyond compare. Saddleback food was excellent too!

Only one complaint, the heat. It runs non stop, we had to run A/C in the room AND open the windows. It's suffocating in the communal areas of the hotel. Turn down the heat. It's uncomfortable in the Saddleback restaurant, you feel you're being cooked alive :(",5,2010,10,27
207,Excellent hotel to start our vacation,"Our trip began at this hotel.  We chose it with the help of our travel agent Kathi Sheridan from Altour International (a Conde Nast specialist for Ireland).  We had a choice between this hotel and the Merrion but we chose the Shelbourne.  We were extremely happy with the hotel service, breakfasts (more smoked salmon than I ever ate), the room, and especially the concierge.  The location was great and we had the special treat of having Tony Blair stay on our floor during his aborted book tour.  Got hassled by his secret service at first on the way past his ""area"" but made friends in the end.  My wife and I would highly recommend this hotel as your base in Dublin.",5,2010,10,25
207,"Nice Room, but problems","While the Shelbourne has all the amenities one expects of a 5 star hotel it lacked one thing... we had no heat in our room.  We noticed the lack of heat when we returned from dinner.  The hotel sent up a repair man , but he couldn't fix it and all he could do was put a small space heater in our room. The hotel claimed to be full and couldn't move us that night.  The heat did get fixed the next day.

I would have expected a hotel of this caliber to have offered us some sort of comp, like  a meal or cocktails, for our inconvenience, but hey did not.  Although, I didn't ask for a comp.",4,2010,10,24
207,"Fantastic Hotel, Fantastic Service, Fantastic Location BUT very pricey","I can not fault this hotel on service, quality, location and luxury but this does come at a steep price. Massive bedroom and bathroom. The bed was to die for and the room came with everything you need  but no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which I found disappointing. Rooms are equipped with bath robes, slippers, safe, iron & iron board, great toiletries, loads of towels/face cloths and keyboard/computer lead. However the breakfast service is really slow and didn't open at 6.30am as advertised in the in-house brochure.  The bar is horrendously expensive so would recommend going to the nearby bars. The concierge staff were absolutely brilliant especially Keith who went on a mission to track down our lost luggage at Dublin Airport. Would love to go back when on business.",5,2010,10,20
207,Amazing! Beautiful! Excellent customer service!,"First time in Dublin and this was the place to stay.  The bar was set high at this beautiful property with amenities to spare and a bed you could sleep in all day.   We are planning a return next year.  Friendly staff, super comfortable and great location--close to the fun without being loud.  Be sure to walk through St. Stepehn's Greene park across the street..breathtaking!",5,2010,10,19
207,Best Anniversary trip ever!,"My husband travels extensively and is a Platinum member with Marriott. So for our 5th Anniversary, we cashed in some points and got a fabulous room in the most gorgeous hotel I have ever stayed in. Our bathroom was the size of our home office and was completely marbled and absolutely luxurious. The staff was just AMAZING and are so willing to help with whatever your needs are. 

For Elite Marriott members, the concierge room was spectacular, with gorgeous view of St. Stephen's Green. And the food and staff were superb. Each morning we ate breakfast in The Saddle Room. Don't forget about taking Tea in the parlor at the front of the hotel. 

If you are looking for your Irish ancestors, don't feel shy and book an appointment with Ms. Helen Kelly, the genealogy butler. We met with her and she was so incredibly helpful. The Shelbourne is a quick, two block walk from The National Library of Ireland (which has a great genealogy room), and a quick bus ride to the General Registration Office. 

Shopping on Grafton (sp?) street is just a couple of blocks away, as is Trinity College with the beautiful Book of Kells. 

If you make it walking all the way to Guinness, I might recommend paying the 30 euro to hire a carriage to take you back to The Shelbourne. It's quite different from the carriage rides you find in our historic, southern city that we live in.",5,2010,10,16
207,A+ hotel in fabulous location,"Stayed with large professsional group and was totally pleased with The Shelbourne. Quiet rooms, excellent beds, gracious public areas.  St. Steven's Green is across the street (beautiful park), just a quick stroll to Grafton St. shopping, Trinity College, and the hop on hop off tour bus stops right there.  Able to walk everywhere from the hotel, including the theatre, National Gallery, etc.  Do take the Green bus tour and get your tickets from the hotel as the pass is good for two full days instead of one and there is a live guide rather than recorded.  The Literary Pub Crawl is worth doing, and again just around the corner from The Shelbourne.  Great breakfast, but expensive if you don't have it included with your room.  The only down side is fee for internet.",5,2010,10,15
207,Awesome would barely describe it!,"I always wanted to go to Ireland, so I decided to save all my points and splurge!  It was the best experience I have had in all my travels to Europe, South Africa and Brazil...I loved it!  Sure, I used points for the first 5 days, but after I traveled around Ireland, I came back and stayed 3 more...It was like coming home!  The concierge helped to make our stay fabulous, we didn't miss a thing even in the rain!  It was luxury without the stuffiness of the high end hotels...I enjoyed the fresh flowers, the drinks and the food...delicious!  The location is perfect, walking distance to Temple Bar, museums, and the bus stop is on the corner...Stevens Green is beautiful and a safe place to walk...it was great!  If you are Irish, and interested in tracking down some ancestors, ask the concierge to hook you up with Cathy...I think that""s her name...very nice and very honest!  hope you choose to stay, and have a pint for me!",5,2010,10,12
207,The place to stay in Dublin,"Beautiful olde traditional hotel right in the heart of Dublin. Located directly across from a huge park with ponds and  swans and  enormous shade trees. Rooms are quite posh and very quiet. Staff is friendly and goes out of their way to accomodate - even to the point of posting letters and postcards home for free. One large bar area and a smaller cozy bar in more like a pub setting. Prices are high for drinks and food, but that is the case all over Ireland right now. Tio give you an idea, a shot of Jamieson on the rocks is about 8dollars U.S. abd a pint of Guiness is $4.50.  Fantastic Concierge service . They work to get hotel guests the best deals possible.Hotel is in easy walking distance of major museums and prime shopping district.  My only complaint was that they had no self service ice machines so every time the ice bucket needed replenishing, I had to call for room service. While there was no charge for the ice, the staffer seemed to expect at least a 2 Euro tip.  I just found that alittle irritting for a high dollar hotel.  Check-in and check-out was a breeze and our three day stay was memorable.",5,2010,10,12
207,Just lovely.,"For my first trip to Dublin, I wanted to go big and not worry about cost.  I chose the 5 star Shelbourne and I was not disappointed.  It is in the perfect location, situated across from the park and the pick up location for the Duck tour (awesome!).  The hotel staff was very nice and gave us an upgraded room when we had to wait longer than expected for our rooms.  The restaurant on site has the best filet mignon and mashed potatoes, and children's spaghetti!  The rooms are beautiful with the most comfortable beds ever.  It is tricky to pull up for valet parking because it's on a one-way street with busy traffic.  I will absolutely go back to this hotel on my second visit.  TIP:  Take a taxi from the airport to your hotel in Dublin.  Traffic is awful and the taxi's have a speed lane.  It's worth it.  You won't need a car in Dublin.",5,2010,10,12
207,warm welcome,"This was my second stay at the Shelbourne and it just gets better.
From the moment I pulled up in the car till the moment I left it just felt great.
Very helpful staff very nice rooms and a great location.
I booked the hotel for a wedding annivessary and in my booking email I mentioned this the staff really pulled out the stops,flowers upgraded room and chocolates( the queen was happy).
The main bar is fun and cool without being in your face and the bar staff were excellent.
What a location close to the shops off  Grafton st and opposite St Stephens  Green.
Would i stay here again ?
FINGERS CROSSED.",5,2010,10,11
207,"Delightful, historic hotel in the heart of old Dublin","Had booked this hotel because it was in the Marriott chain and I used points. Before leaving for Ireland, our neighbor, upon learning we would be in Dublin, said that the one place we had to see was the Shelbourne Hotel and the Horseshoe Bar in the hotel. And she was right! I would gladly stay there again upon visiting Dublin. The one drawback for those unfamiliar with driving in this city is that with the one-way, non-orthogonal streets, it can be a challenge to firure out how to get there and how to leave!",5,2010,09,30
207,referred to car rental company by concierge - car rental was a nightmare,This hotel is in a perfect location in Dublin. For the most part we had a grand experience during our visit. The concierge referred us to Sixt car rental which depite providing several reasonable quotes ultimately charged us 2030 Euro or  $2727 for an 11 day car rental. This car rental transaction cast a gloom over our entire stay in Ireland.,3,2010,09,18
207,Elegance in the City...,"Just returned from 8 days in Ireland and first few nights were in Dublin at the Shelbourne.   Beautiful hotel with top notch service, restaurants conveniently located in the heart of Dublin.    Loved the Saddle Room restaurant for breakfast & dinner (ask for a quiet booth) and the large bar.   Could take or leave the Horseshoe Bar, as it was very noisy when there and cramped.   We are not ""tour bus"" type of people, but the Dublin on/off double decker bus stops right across the street from this hotel every half hour or so.  Great way to take in the City sights if you're a first timer, and get an idea of where everything is located.  We rode the whole route once through, and then planned a route of attack on the City as to what we wanted to see.   Then just stopped where we wanted, visited, and jumped back on for the next stop on our list.  Real foot-saver!  Enjoy!",5,2010,09,09
207,Fabulous location!,"You can never go wrong with the Shelbourne!  Great location, wonderful staff, fabulous food, and everything is exorbitantly priced...lol, everything you'd expect from a Renaissance!  :)  The one tip I found out too late is that you can hand them your postcards and they will stamp them for you, even to other countries!",5,2010,09,09
207,Perfect place to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary,"We have nothing but praise for the Shelbourne Hotel and its staff.  From the minute we arrived we were made to feel special.  We were personally greeted by Maria (Guest Relations Team Leader) who wished us both a Happy Anniversary and booked us into a lovely room, which was both comfortable and spacious.  Maria also booked us a nice private table in the restaurant (in one of the booths) where all the staff wished us a Happy Anniversary.  The food in the restaurant was very good.  When we returned to our room that evening the bed had been scattered with rose petals, we had been left a hand written Anniversary card and home made chocolates from the staff, we thought this was a very thoughtful gesture.  The Shelbourne staff really do go that extra mile, to make your stay very special.  The breakfasts at the hotel were fantastic, a brilliant choice and everything was hot and cooked to perfection.  The Entrance, bars and lounges are all very elegant, with beautifully arranged  flowers on display and wonderful chandeliers. The location of this hotel could not be better, very central, right opposite St Stephens Green, and short walk to the shops on Grafton Street.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and will definitely be staying here again.",5,2010,09,06
207,Trendy hotel in the centre of Dublin,"I frequent The Shelbourne whilst traveling on business to Dublin. It has the perfect central location but due to which is slightly more than most hotels in Dublin. I work in the Sandyford Business park which is approximately a 20-30 minute taxi drive depending on traffic.

The rooms have all you would need and are very pleasant but bijou is the best way to describe them. This might be slightly disappointing if you're here on a leisure break and have paid high rates for a room such as this. But remember to look out of the window and remind yourself how central you are. The hotel over looks St.Stephens square which is a calm and pleasant place to take a stroll. The beds are extremely comfortable, I had my best nights sleep here for months!

For dining you have ample options within the hotel and are reasonably priced. I have yet to be let down by the quality of food.

Service is very good, although some requests do take a while but this is no doubt due to the volume of guests in and out of the hotel constantly. But the staff are always on hand to help and very friendly. The reason for saying this is due to the fact I stupidly forgot to pack my toothpaste, having phoned reception who were only too happy to help, I then waited approximately 25 minutes for it to arrive.

The hotel is decorated throughout to a fabulous standard and you can see why it holds its 5* hotel.",4,2010,08,29
207,"Five star public rooms, barely three star everywhere else","As a native of Dublin who has often partaken in afternoon tea at the Shelbourne I was delighted to be treated to a surprise weekend there by my partner.  I was expecting great things but what a let down!  At check in, couldnt find our booking and then when eventually found told with disdain that the problem was that it had been booked through a web site and not directly with them.  
Our bedroom on the fifth floor was down a maze of corridors and when we finally reached couldnt swing the proverbial cat in it.  I always thought there was a minimum room size for four and five star hotels??  Overlooking a concrete building mass, accompanied by the loud sound of the compressor and the even louder sound of the inadequate air conditioning ensured that we didnt want to spend any time in this room.  Tiny wardrobe. Bathroom had basic toiletries and only one of each so we had ask for more.  Though had asked in advance of arrival for foam pillow as alergic to feathers, had to ask a further three times before finally getting at 11 30pm the first night.  Breakfast served in the bar, at low tables and bar chairs, the smell of drink still noticable from the night before and the food  set up on basic trestle tables.  On returning to our room at 3pm on the Saturday it still had not been made up though we had put the sign out on leaving at 10 that morning.
No residents lounge so unless you wanted to stand in a crush in the bar (taken over by a wedding party both days) or pay to eat and drink in the lord mayors lounge there was no where else to sit.  After a long queue for check out on day 3 was not even asked if we had enjoyed our stay and felt no one cared if they never saw us again. When metioned my concerns to the check out clerk they just shrugged and continued to check us out.
No leisure centre or spa and there suggeston for swimming was the Irish Sea and a small beach, Sanymount, more than 4km from the hotel
Great location, ridiculously expensive and if the people who run it want to find out what a five star hotel is like suggest they visit Aghadoe Heights in Kilarney Ireland or the Hotel Splendide in Lugano, Switzerland, now they are five stars and more.
Avoid unless for afternoon tea!",3,2010,08,24
207,"It's true - ""The best address in Dublin!""","My husband & I recently enjoyed 3 nights at The Shelbourne; our first trip to Dublin (and to Ireland, for that matter).  We were very pleased with our decision to make The Shelbourne our home while touring Dublin by foot.  EXCELLENT location for those without a car; most of the sights to see are within walking distance (Grafton Street, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, premier shopping areas, Jameson's Distillery, ...).  The property has been beautifully restored and still extolls the virtues of grander days gone by.  Our room was in the back of the hotel and was VERY quiet.  (Street-facing rooms MAY be noisy.)  One of the most comfortable hotel beds ever!  Standard rooms are not large but certainly adequate for a couple; good storage space.  Modern bath.  Overall service was good.  We were disappointed in the fees for using WiFi/Internet; 9 euro for one hour.  Would like to see The Shelbourne add one ""free"" computer for guest use as many hotels (from Hampton Inns on up!) do these days, or at least offer a discount to Marriott Rewards members.    We only had a light dinner in the larger bar facing the street; food was good and lovely, upscale decor and setting.   We would definitely stay at The Shelbourne again if we had it all to do over again!!!",5,2010,08,18
207,Excellent value!,"didnt think I would afford this but the recession has been great for travellers.Courteous receptionists, and Concierge Alan  very helpful and has a great sense of Irish humour.
Lunch is very affordable as is the afternoon tea .
Early bird dinners at the Shelbourne  and the Fitzwilliams are cheaper than some smaller establishments .",5,2010,08,16
207,Quaint and Interesting Hotel,"This was my second trip to Dublin.  Flew into DUB and the taxi took about 25 min and about €25.

Check-In was a breeze.  Very professional and fast.

Getting to the room was a bit of a walk, not because of the size of the Hotel, but because of it's converted nature.  Reminded me somewhat of the Sherlock Holmes Hotel in London.  Personally I love the narrow twisted corridors and find it adds interest to the hotel experience.

The room itself was good.  Bed had a pillow top matress which I always appriciate and the pillows were feather which I prefer.

One nice feature was the fact that the wardrobe is double sided in that it opens into the bedroom as well as the main room.

The room was cleaned well and is obviously well maintained.

The conference facility at the hotel was very good.  Interesting room and the catering between the sessions was also very nice and a lot of effort had been put into it.

I did not eat at the hotel other than breakfast.  As with most hotes, breakfast was a bit disorgainised.  I had the buffet, although you can also order from an a la carte menu.  The buffet in iteslf was good quality serving local products; Sausage, black pudding, bacon and irish smoked salmon.  It is always nice when you can enjoy the local fare.

They have a fitness centre.  Well, it is not exactly a fitness centre.  They put several machines in three of the guest bedrooms.  One room as free weights, one has running machines and one has cross trainers.  Not the most professional setup however at least they have something for those people who have the need to burn those calories!

All in all it was an enjoyable visit and I felt as though I was well taken care of.",4,2010,08,12
207,"Great hotel,close to Grafton St.the main shopping area in Dublin.","We booked 2 Heritage Premium rooms at this hotel through Travelzoo who had secured a deal with the Shelbourne.We were going to the horse show in Ballsbridge and wanted to stay in a nice hotel.On arrival at reception we discovered that in fact  our rooms weren't booked due to us not  properly completing the booking on our computer.This was an extremely busy weekend in Dublin due to the Horse Show.For a moment we thought we were in trouble.The lady who was checking us in assured us she would try her best to secure us similar standard of rooms later in the day.She arranged for our luggage to be kept safely at the hotel.We went to Grafton St. got some lunch.When we returned to the Shelbourne reception desk Ms.Hird had got us 2 rooms not Heritage Premium  but we were happy enough.Despite other poor staff reviews on this site,I found all staff  very friendly and helpful.The food at this hotel is excellent.I would definitely stay here again.",4,2010,08,08
207,Second time a charm as well!,"We had previously stayed at the Shelbourne in December, 09 and excitedly looked forward to another great stay. I must say I was very surprised with all the negative reviews on TripAdvisor and wondered if we had made the right decision to revisit this summer. We were very happy that we stayed at the Shelbourne again as it was delightful, in some ways, even better than last time, due to some very positive changes in staff attitudes that we had previously encountered in the lounge. Our room was spacious, clean and grand. The bathroom is elegant and well-appointed. All of the staff personnel, including those in the lounge, were extremely gracious and accomodating. The breakfast, which was included in the price of the room, was excellent as well. The location continues to be perfect and this grand dame of a hotel is keeping her five star rating as far as we are concerned. Our next trip to Dublin will certainly include the Shelbourne.",5,2010,08,06
207,Tiny room and dirty shower contradict luxury price,"We arrived for a significant wedding anniversary full of expectations and entered the impressive, marble-clad lobby. On opening the door to our 'Deluxe Queen' room, however, we were dumbstruck at the tiny size of the room, unworthy of any other hotel (let alone luxury hotel) we have ever stayed in. There was literally just room for the bed and a tight walk round it to the desk unit, complete with forbidding fully-stocked minibar - any item therein cannot be touched or it is automatically charged to one's bill. The bathroom was ridiculously tiny and the drain was full of hair. On returning to the room later that night, we discovered that the bedside lights didn't work, but were reluctant to deal with room service at night. On enquiring at reception I was further shocked to learn that they charge for WiFi access - is there nothing included in the prices charged by this hotel?
I was sorely disappointed by the room and felt very annoyed at the contrast with the ostentatious facilities available in the lobby and breakfast room, as well as the exorbitant price for what we actually got.",3,2010,08,05
207,Nice hotel in a good central location,"I had a weekend stay at the Shelbourne through a travelzoo offer, which made it reasonably good value.  Our arrival was too early to check into our room, but that wasn’t a problem as our luggage was kept securely.  I was told I would receive a telephone call to let me know that our room was available, but this never transpired.

The room we were allocated was very nice and spacious.  I had requested twin beds, but they had none available and so an extra roll-out bed was put into our room.  The extra bed was perfectly adequate and as the room was fairly large this wasn’t a problem.  The bathroom was lovely and large, with a separate room for the toilet and a bath with a separate large shower cubicle.  I did however, have to request an extra set of toiletries.

Although I had requested a room overlooking St Stephen’s Green, our room overlooked a side street, which was actually a good thing as the main road is quite noisy and busy.

Breakfast was included in our travel package which was a good thing because the prices were a bit steep.  There was a wide choice of hot and cold breakfast items and the quality was good.

The location of the hotel cannot be faulted.  It is within walking distance of the main shopping area(s) and most (if not all) pick-up points.  The Dublin Connolly railway station was only a 15-20 minute walk away and there is a HOHO stop about 3 minutes walk from the hotel.

Our room was made up satisfactorily, but with two minor niggles.  Our travelzoo offer included a nightcap of Irish whiskey and Baileys.  As we had booked for two nights, we should have received another mini-bottle of each after the first night, but I had to request them (made me feel a bit tight-fisted).  Also, we had used almost all of the bath crystals from the bathroom and I had deliberately left the lid open so that it would be filled up again, but housekeeping simply replaced the lid (when it was obviously almost empty).  As I said, minor niggles.

We dined at the hotel on the Saturday night, opting for their early bird menu.  The quality and service were good and was quite good value for money.

Overall, a nice hotel.  Some of the staff at the hotel could have been a little more friendly though.",4,2010,08,05
207,Elegance Lost,"Prior to this recent visit I had stayed at this landmark hotel many years ago.  I had fond memories of the character and elegance the Shelbourne was famous for those many years.  Unfortunately, I was not able to recapture that magic on my most recent visit.  Reception area is cold and while I was deluged by offers of cake, ice cream or pink lemonade while checking in, it would have been less intrusive if there was a little welcome basket or some cookies and goodies in the room that could have been enjoyed at leisure.  I was assigned my deluxe room only to find that it was not ready for occupancy once I got to the room.  Back down to reception for a different room and to track down the porter with my luggage on his way to the former room.  Not off to a promising start for a 5 star hotel.  Air conditioning in room was not working properly and was extremely noisy.  The choice was listen to the TV or listen to the AC.  Rooms are extremely small but that is to be expected of an older, city center hotel.  The bathroom was new and modern and most acceptable.  Breakfast is good but skip the Oatmeal with honey.  The Oatmeal was watery and most unpleasant.  The bar is quite active during happy hours but the service was sub par.  The bar itself could do with a little sprucing up and the prices were high as to be expected in a hotel of its reputation.  It would be nice if some of the service staff were actually Irish but I found throughout my stay finding an Irish person in a service position was as hard as finding the mythical leprechaun and his pot of gold.  There was no late night bar for hotel residents.  Drinks were served in the lobby area but somehow that is just not the same.  I didn't find the staff to be overly friendly or attentive.  The hotel lacked warmth and the charm and elegance that I had experienced in the past was definitely lost.  It is a shame because with just a little effort and some training in customer service and hospitality, this could once again be the Shelbourne of the past and ""The Hotel"" in Dublin's city centre on the Green.
By the way, do not use the telephone in your room.  You could hire a messenger to take your message personally for what the telephone costs you from the room.  Truly outrageous!!!",4,2010,07,30
207,"""Lumpy"" says it all","We ended up in the ""old"" part of the hotel. Despite an otherwise excellent renovation, we think they kept the original mattress. It might have been fine for James Joyce, but we literally could not get a decent night's sleep, which marred an otherwise good stay.",3,2010,07,29
207,"Ho-Hum stay at what should've been the ""Great Dame"" of Dublin Hotels","Recently took the family (Wife, self, 5mnt old, 12yr old) on a week long vacation here.  I really struggled between a 2 and 3 rating, but decided upon the 2 as this hotel should hold itself to higher standards as the previous ""Great Dame"" of Dublin hotels.  

Check-in was S-L-O-W.  (Had 2 rooms reserved, and took FOREVER to get checked in).  As a PlatPremier member, I wasn't upgraded, and had a great view of the trash bins/car park!

Breakfast was free in the restaurant, and NOT worth near 30euros!!!  Billing mistakes happened 3/5 days as breakfast is included for PlatPremiers, but I was charged and told ""just sign""!  (More on this later)

Heritage lounge was HORRIBLE.  Sparse offerings, with NO Veggies/fruit.  As stated earlier, you had to ask the NASTY attendants for permission to have a soda!!!  (They keep them locked up, yes locked up, in china cabinet)  I have NEVER met worse lounge attendants!!!!  

Location was ok-not really centrally located, and will stay at the Westin next time I am in Dublin.

Check-out was slow (slower then check-in).  I requested that the erronious charges be taken off of my bill.  The agent first refused, asking why I signed, when I should not have.  I tried to explain to her that I didnt ASK for the bill, they made me sign it.  After about 5 min I was able to get the proper bill and be on my way.

Overall, I will not stay back here.  Location was sub-par and staff was NASTY...of which made the stay a 2 and not a 3!!!",2,2010,07,28
207,Great Service and Pretty Hotel,"My fiancé and I used Priceline to bid on this hotel since we don't usually stay in 5-star hotels and wanted to spoil ourselves.  We got a great deal, but I know this is usually a VERY expensive hotel.  The hotel itself is gorgeous!  There is a lot of history behind the building and you can tell they take great care in keeping the hotel pretty.  We stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights and were originally given a room on the 3rd floor.  We only stayed in that room one night as there was this horrendous buzzing noise coming from somewhere near our room (never figured out what was causing it).  When we spoke with the front desk, they were very polite and moved us to a room on the 6th floor where we had no more issues.  The beds are very luxurious and comfortable, however, the rooms are definitely on the small side for a luxury hotel.  The bathrooms are standard with huge showers and you can listen to the tv while showering (a feature my man loved).  I don't think the hotel was in a great location, personally.  It wasn't convenient to the bus stops and it was too far from the main tourist areas to walk easily (especially when it rains so much).  Parking is far too expensive to rent a car, so if you are planning on doing a lot of sight-seeing, I would recommend staying in a different area of town.",4,2010,07,27
207,Just OK,"Stayed here for a 3 night stay, visiting Dublin for the first time. Got a great deal through TravelZoo and I'm glad it included Breakfast - not that we would have paid the 30 Euros each!! Overall everything was just OK - not what you'd expect from arguably the most famous hotel in Dublin. We had access to the Executive Lounge being Marriott gold members......food was ok, drinks never replenished so you had to go ""cap in hand"" every time you wanted a soft drink and the staff in there so miserable!",4,2010,07,27
207,Not the quality I expected,"I am just after returning home after a two night stay and I was very disappointed with my stay. We stayed in a Queen Room and it was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in numerous hotels in London and New York which have a reputation for small hotel rooms. The bed seemed smaller than a Queen bed to me as my bed at home is a queen and this was definitely smaller. The air conditioning was terrible which on two hot nights was not a recipe for a good nights sleep. In fact they were the two worst sleeping nights I have had at a hotel, sleeping with the covers off and still sweating. The air conditioning seemed to be on a timed switch and would automatically switch off after a while and you would have to turn the switch on and off again. The combination of the tiny room and bad air conditioning was a disaster.

Also, the room was not serviced on our 2nd day even though it was free to be serviced from 1.45pm to 4.30pm and from 6pm to midnight. We were very disappointed when we returned to the room after midnight and as I wanted it noted there and then, I rang reception but it took me 5 seperate calls before anyone answered.

On our last morning, I went down by myself to breakfast and was seated in an inside seat by the waiter who had to pull the table out for me to acess the bench seating. The table was right by a doorway and he had to pull the outside seat out to move the table for me but when he moved the table back in, he forgot to tuck in the outside seat which was halk blocking the doorway. I thought to myself, no problem, any of the waiters to pass would surely move it in to place as they and customers carrying their breakfast had to walk sideways to fit between the doorway and the chair. At least 5 dirrenent waiting staff passed numerous times and did nothing and after a few looks from other diners who had to manouvre around the chair and with me beginng to feel uncomfortable, I had to do it myself. You might say, no big deal, but terrible service at a 5 star hotel for the price I was paying.

A couple of positives to save it from a 1 star rating from me is that it is in an ideal location and the Bar is very lively with a good atmosphere.",2,2010,07,26
207,Excellent Hotel,"We loved our weekend stay at The Shelbourne!  The hotel is in a great location off of St. Stephen's Green and is an easy walk to most Dublin sites and Grafton Street.  The room was very nice and the bed was extremely comfortable.  Breakfast which was included with our package was very good.  We were leaving early on our last day and they delivered breakfast to our room, which was great.  We did have dinner one evening and that was just OK.  The Shelbourne is a beautiful and comfortable hotel in a great location and I could not ask for much more.",5,2010,07,26
207,The best address in Dublin,"A Great Hotel in a suberb location. Friendly , attentive staff. The mattresses and sheets were simply a cocoon of perfection. Breakfast was a delight over which to linger. The Lounge was perfect for afternoon tea or a night cap.",5,2010,07,25
207,"Fabulous hotel, distinctly average service","Stayed here for a few nights for a friends wedding.  The stay started well as we were offered delicious pink icecream in cones topped with hundreds and thousands while waiting to check in.  Sadly customer service went downhill from this point onwards - the girl checking us in did not even acknowledge me (but was courteous to my husband), the start of a series of 'sub-optimal' encounters with various staff members.

The hotel itself is elegance and decadence personified.  All the public areas are grand, clean and awe-inspiring.  The 'standard' room we stayed in was also agreeable - an exceptionally comfortable bed, a nice bathroom with powerful shower and a generally 'luxury' feel.

Its location in Dublin also cannot be faulted and I recommend it highly for this.

However, while the hotel is undoubtably 5*, the customer service was bitterly disappointing.  Having stayed in other hotels of this standard (the Oberoi group being my benchmark of perfection) I have never before found it so hard to attract the attention of staff while having breakfast or dinner... at times they seemed to be actively avoiding eye contact.  At no point did anyone give any indication of an inclination to do more than the absolute minimum, let alone any inkling of a possibility of 'going the extra mile' that staff at such hotels often manage seemingly effortlessly.

As other reviews have noted, their charge of 20 euros per DAY for internet access is absolutely shocking... even some McDonalds offer this for free....

Would I recommend it? Well, its a beautiful hotel and its location is great, so yes, but had the service been any worse these attributes would not have been enough to compensate.",4,2010,07,22
207,Crowded out!,"I stayed at the Shelbourne with my son during a rugby international weekend. The hotel is difficult to fault, with excellent rooms, attentive staff and one of the best breakfasts I have ever been offered. However our experience changed when we attempted to relax with a drink that evening. The hotel bar was packed beyond capacity and after battling to the counter to place an order we had to retreat rapidly before we could be served as one of our fellow patrons felt the need to empty  his stomach into the crowd. There was nowhere to sit or even stand and the supposedly ""residents' only"" lounge was little better. I believe this is a popular nightspot every weekend but I will never stay here again, I do not need to pay to add more stress to my life!",3,2010,07,17
207,A delightful Stay,"We recently stayed at the Renaissance for a family vacation.   The location is fabulous.  We felt very comfortable walking in the area at all times of the day and it was close to many amenities.  We were upgraded to the Heritage premium rooms with access to the Heritage Lounge.   I would not suggest that paying for the lounge access was beneficial unless you needed a quiet place with internet access.  The room size was fabulous and the beds were very comfortable.   We overlooked a roof so no view but very quiet!  The bar and food prices were very expensive but that was expected.   We only had 1 drink here because of the prices.  If you can get a fair price for the hotel, I highly recommend this location.  The staff was very pleasant.",4,2010,07,12
207,Great City location,Lovely hotel in a great location for bars shops etc ..... bedrooms ok beds so comfortable... wish that there was a Spa there ....,4,2010,07,11
207,"Beautiful beds, too bad they forgot our wake-up call","Spent one night at the Shelbourne as part of the Royal Irish tour group. This is a beautiful hotel with the most comfortable beds in Europe. Unfortunately there was a mix-up with our names and room number which resulted in the hotel staff neglecting to give us our wake-up call. This was the worst morning to miss the wake-up call, as we were flying home that morning. I discussed the issue with the desk clerk in the morning. She appeared quite upset--I don't think they are used to handling complaints. She apologized and I forgive them, as the rest of our all-too-brief stay was above average.",4,2010,07,09
207,Great hotel in good location,"We went here for our ""baby moon"".  We used that as our excuse! But what a hotel, luxury def a 5 star. Location was good not far to walk to shops and lots of restaurants. We were in room only basis so cant comment on the food. Service on the front desk was excellant and great tips on where to visit.  Paking valet was very efficient and didnt have to wait long for car. Have been in Dublin a number of times but this has been the most luxurious hotel we have stayed in.
If I was to pick out any negative points it would be they have no spa or beauty salon, but i did go to a nearby hotel for my massage!",4,2010,07,08
207,very grand,"We stayed in the Shelbourne on a Saturday night. The hotel is beautiful and luxurious. We had a room in the Heritage wing which was lovely and had a large bathroom. The bed was extremely comfortable.
The service was excellent from check in to check out and all staff were friendly and courteous.
The hotel is in a great location within walking distance of everything.
We had the buffet breakfast which was included in the room rate, however I wouldnt pay extra for it as it was just ok, the hot food was just lukewarm and for the 29 euro each cost should have been better. I would definately stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2010,07,05
207,Poor service,"I felt compelled to write a review of the consistent poor service in the Shelbourne bar. Given the ridiculous prices charged, you'd hope the Shelbourne would, at very least, have a high standard of service.
They are slow, rude and inconsistent - it's really not good enough in these days!",2,2010,07,05
207,Try Elsewhere,"We picked this hotel for the location and the fact that they would put an extra bed in our room for our 14 year old daughter.  The extra bed was not on the reservation despite the fact I spoke to the hotel directly myself.  So we ordered it and went to dinner but when we came back three hours later, it was not here.  Finally a third attempt got it here.

This sort of thing can happen, but it is indicative of the mediocre service this hotel provides.  But the final straw is that they charge 20 euros for internet and it isn't even that fast.  I travel a lot and I cannot remember the last time I was charged the equivalent of $26 for internet.  At this time in history, it is egregious and petty, and it is enough to say I will not patronize hotels that do it.

Even the finest hotels I have stayed at for work and holiday, have lowered their prices to the $10-25 range with many just offering internet free.  If cheap hotels can give it away for free, why should ones that are charging $265 per day add a charge for it?  Because they can get away with it?  

Sorry, you have lost me as a client.",3,2010,06,23
207,Great Place,"Stayed here with my wife for 5 nights.  We used Dublin as our base and travelled 3 of the 5 days to smaller towns for day trips.  I was concerned with some of the negative reviews, but I found this hotel to be one of the nicer hotels I've stayed at in Europe.   The hotel is definitely at a good location - it was no problem walking anywhere from this location.  If you're into cocktails and lounging the bars in the main lobby areas were very popular.  We went to the restaurant one night for dinner and the service wasn't great - but I think it was our particular waiter.  The rest of the staff seemed friendly.  I definitely recommend the hotel overall to others wanting to visit Dublin and stay at a nice hotel.",4,2010,06,14
207,"Slow Service, Poor Business Center","Overall a nice hotel but with slow front desk service. The building is charming, but is old and the floors in hallways and rooms are quite noisy under your feet - although I didn't hear any noise from the room above me. 

The location is ok, a short walk to Temple Bar but there are better located hotels.

Although it was a busy weekend, the front desk service was very slow, with wait times 30 minutes or more as people checked in - not normal for Marriott. There was difficulty settling our bill with a different credit card - overall not a smooth front desk service. The business center was largely out of service - after paying $5 euro for 15 minutes of internet we discovered the printers didn't work. 

For the high price, this hotel did not live up to expectations and was not the normally consistent excellent Marriott experience.",3,2010,06,14
207,Relaxing,"We arrived in Dublin in the morning after an overnight flight and went straight to the hotel hoping to at least check our bags until check in time. We received a very friendly and welcoming reception from Helen who told us not only that a room was ready for us, but that we had been upgraded to a junior suite. Our suite was absolutely beautiful and spacious. We had great time out shopping in Dublin from our excellent location and had excellent service in the hotel bar.",5,2010,06,11
207,Nice Hotel Close to Sights,"Stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of our vacation at the Shelbourne.  We chose this hotel because we were able to use our Marriott points for the two nights stay.  The hotel was very clean and close to all the sights.  We especially liked how the HOHO bus pick up was right across the street.  The walk to Trinity College is very short and there are a ton of bars and restaurants close by.  The rooms weren't ready when we arrived so they held our luggage and called us on our cell when the rooms were available, which was a great service.  I would recommend staying at this hotel.  The breakfast wasn't included with the Marriott points and the amenities for Gold Level Marriott members isn't available on the weekend - which was a big disappointment.  We ate at the hotel for breakfast because the cafes close by didn't open early enough.  The food was good but extremely expensive!!",4,2010,06,10
207,"Luxurious hotel, excellent service and central location","My colleagues in Dublin highly recommended the Shelbourne so I moved from another hotel and was very pleased with the decision.  The Shelbourne is in the middle of the citry center of Dublin so close to everything.  It was especially close to all of the tour bus pickup points.  The room was very large with excellent amenities, including a very comfortable bed and chairs.  The staff bent over backwards to make my stay very pleasant.  The concierges helped me find the right touring opportunities, and the front desk staff actually sent someone to knock on my door when I didn't answer the wake up call to ensure that I was all right.  I can't wait to return to Dublin and the Shelbourne!",5,2010,06,07
207,Awful overrated hotel- don't stay here,"Are currently spending our last 2 nights of an otherwise fabulous European vacation here, and I am actually writing on Trip Advisor because it's been such a bad experience.  Old, smelly (smokey) room at first, asked for a change, and now we're in a room that slopes downward so much that there is a large crack at the top of the door when it's closed all the way.  NOT worth the star rating and money - and we're not even paying- we used valuable miles to stay here and now just regretting it terribly since it's too late to change without losing the miles and we're stuck.  Stuffy, stained rugs, just not on par with what is normally expected at a hotel of this rating.  As avid travelers and internet researchers, we're kicking ourselves we suppose...it's just not at ALL what you'd expect.  Needs a MAJOR facelift.",1,2010,06,05
207,The perfect location in an amazing city!,I booked this hotel on Priceline and what a great value we got!  This is a beautiful hotel with all amenities and the perfectly located to get wherever we wanted to go.  The staff was very helpful and friendly and they made our trip the perfect 10!,5,2010,05,23
207,Great spot for business or leisure.,"I was traveling with my parents, they got a room using points, mine was standard room.  Both rooms were comfortable and clean.  Theirs had a bigger bathroom with separate tub.  Every staff member was friendly & helpful and we talked several times to the concierges for suggestions & tickets.  The Shelborne is a great location for tourists, most everything is walkable and the hop on-hop off bus picks up across the street.  The front desk will change money for you for no fee.  Our 2 nights at the Shelbourne were great.",5,2010,05,21
207,Wonderful Hotel,"Our room was beautiful, everyone was super helpful, and the breakfast was delicious.",5,2010,05,17
207,Best Hotel in Dublin!,"Stayed at the Shelbourne last weekend, and the experience was one of the best we've ever experienced..and we've travelled widely.  Everything from the check in, the friendly staff not to mention the room, with the most comfortable bed i've ever slept in, lovely bathroom.  We got a really good rate on the Marriott website, which included breakfast, which was in the 'saddle room', what can I say, it was just wonderful.  We used the valet parking which was 25 euro, We thought this was quite good compared to other car parks in the city...can't wait to go back.",5,2010,05,13
207,Wonderful Location,"Great location overlooking St. Stephen's. Staff extremely helpful, let us check in early and upgraded our room.",5,2010,05,10
207,Pure Class!,"Elegant hotel overlooking St.Stephen’s green right off Grafton street, lovely restaurants, bars.  Hotel is maintained to a high standard & would definitely stay again.",5,2010,05,09
207,Mismanaged,"We were promised a unforgetable  weekend but really came away disappointed. The hotel is very welcoming at the start... Nice and polite Doorman , professional car parking staff but everything in door is just dissapointing - more suited to business than leisure. Rooms ok but everything has a label asking if you want to buy it - umbrella, gowns etc. No tea and coffee facilities in room - only expensive room service. Mini bar also very expensive. Internet connection slow and very very expensive! 9e per hour! Restaurant  crowded and noisy. Food good but not great. Staff helpful but too busy to deliver individual service, cutbacks? 
When complaining to manager on duty We recieved no solution, and have been let go as the lady was in rush... 

Hotel lacks initmacy - too busy and impersonal. For this much money I would rather have gone to the Merrion just next door.",2,2010,05,09
207,"Central location, beautiful rooms, staff go the extra mile to make your stay great","Arrived by car so we were wondering where to park but the porters, doorman and valet sorted everything in seconds, very slick and professional, but friendly at the same time. Excellent location, we were so glad we chose the Shelbourne over some of the other 5 stars we were considering (they may well also be lovely, but our experience here was faultless).

Once inside we were checked in quickly, informed we had been upgraded to a suite and shown to our room which was beautiful. Everything spotless, bathroom gorgeous with fantastic bath and shower. We didn't dine in the hotel but breakfast in our room was exceptional. One of the main things we took away from our stay was the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to go above and beyond, particularly the concierge. After breakfast we turned on the news to hear of the volcanic ash cloud and the fact there were (at that point on some) flight delays. The concierge called the airport and our airline and rung us as soon as he found out that our flight was cancelled, enabling us to book onto a ferry in the nick of time. Overall a first-class hotel and we would return very happily.",5,2010,05,02
207,"Amazing, phenomenal, the best!","Great time. Wonderful stay. Very polite staff. Extremely helpful. Particularly given recent volcano events! 
Good food. Very nice room.",5,2010,04,26
207,Disappointing,"My Husband and I stayed here as my belated birthday treat! OH is Marriotts member  and had booked a non -smoking king room.

On Arrival there was no doorman on duty and we never saw one during our 3 day stay. Our king room (no-smoking) had a faint odour of stale smoke on arrival which continued to worsen during our stay, no idea where it was coming from, can only assume coming up throught the air vents. There was no turn down service, only 1 bathrobe and no slippers (which were promised in the room rate) There was no kettle or coffee maker but you could have a cup of tea through room service for 5 euro (plus 5euro delivery).

The low point during our stay was at breakfast first morning. The buffet had a good selection of food and the part of the dining room where we were seated was fairly quiet with only 2 other table occupied. After cereal we returned to the buffet for hot food (after our tea/coffe had only just been delivered) only to find on our return that our table had been completely stripped (adjacent tables were still littered with remnants from earlier customers). We thought it was a joke and my husband went off to find the Maitre d'. He eventually arrived followed by a waiter and they seemed to find the whole thing rather funny. No apology whatsoever. We actually had to ask for the table to be reset and they only brought cutlery no crockery. We had to ask twice for tea/coffee and that took another 15 minutes. All this for 29 Euros each.

We seemed to wait ages for the lifts and the only friendly staff we encountered was the girl who checked us in (and out) and the the chap at the left luggage. 

We were awoken a couple of times both nights by inconsiderate guests shouting and laughing in the corridors in the early hours which seemed to go on for ages.

The only good things I could say about the  this hotel are the location (round the corner from the airport shuttle drop off/pick up), 2 minutes walk from the HOHO bus (take the red one with the Live commentary rather than the pre-recorded one - so much fun!) 5 minutes walk from the top of Grafton street and within a few minutes walk of some very nice restaurants)  oh and  the beds were very comfy.

This place might have been wonderful in the past but service is far from 5 star and at the prices they charge, wouldn't recommend it or return.",2,2010,04,20
207,The quintessential hotel experience  in Dublin,"Located at City Center on St Stephens Green, this hotel is at 'ground zero' of the Dublin action.  This hotel delivers on all cylinders with first class dining, bar and room facilities.  The decor is ornate and lively as the marble lobby welcomes visitors either into the windowed bar to the left or tea in the salon to the right.  Certain rooms can be snug- but that's Europe.  If you need space, opt for an upgarde to a suite.  The food is excellent at all times of the day at The Shelbourne.  In the immediate vicinity is the government center, numerous shops, the art museum and the various business houses on Merrion Square.  Along St. Stephens Green are the top restaurants in Dublin- and there are plenty to choose from.  The ""hop on, hop off"" tour bus stops right in front of the hotel.",5,2010,04,12
207,standards slipping,"Stayed at the shelbourne on numerous occasions, and have always been very happy with the hotel, but not this time.On check in we were upgraded to a one bedroomed suite which was a lovely surprise, and really nice and much appreciated, however things went downhill from there.
There were no amenities left in the bathroom i.e. soap etc had to request same, no slippers either, told they had run out and they were on order, and we had paid in our room rate, access to heritage lounge and could not get in , despite trying 3 times and speaking to some one in delighted to serve , who insisted it was open, well we could not get in and no one answered the door even when we knocked!!!!! We also had dinner in our package, but in error we paid in cash for our meal, but were assured by the restaurant staff it would be deducted form our bill the following day, how wrong they were.All excuses were used so as not to refund us.... its a a bank hoilday... we cant find the resataurant receipts....... the manager is off......so can you pay your bill in full and we will call you and sort it out. We paid the bill again and we waited for 4 days for the call it never came, eventually after 15 phone calls we got it sorted and had to wait one week for the refund. I was really dissappointed with the service and wont stay again, they are trading on past reputation, and really need to review their standards as it is not fve star any more.",3,2010,04,12
207,Once Great Hotel - Now Compromised.,"Having stayed at the Selbourne for over 30 years, I recently revisited the revamped Shelbourne, now owned by Renaissance.The increased room capacity has created overload in all the public rooms. You que for reception, the lifts, for breafast, lunch and dinner...and at all the bars. The once elegant restaurant overlooking St Stephen's Green is now a large bar, bursting with the non residents which doubles as an overfow self service breakfast room. retaining the previous odour of the previous nights alcohol. My small room, though well fitted, comprised a tiny bathroom..not capable of accommodating any one over 5'6'' . This was Dublin's greatest hotel..now sadly  it is not and has been compromised by owners expecting too much of the hotel's footprint..",2,2010,04,10
207,"Absolutely stunning rooms- top service, amazing stay.","We stayed two nights at the Shelbourne over St. Patricks Day in 2010. We were upgraded to a suite (I'm a Marriott Rewards Platinum member) and I can't say enough about the top notch customer service at this hotel. The rooms were immaculate and the staff went above and beyond with everything from mailing postcards to checking us in. I would recommend this hotel for the location, the amazing rooms and bathrooms, and most of all, the great customer service. The food is even good - and I never think hotel food is good! The bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.",5,2010,04,05
207,3 star service,"Stayed in Shelbourne celebrating my birthday, very central location, stayed in heritage room which was supposed to have access to concierge heritage lounge, when we enquired about  it  we were told it does not open at weekends, very strange, and this should be highlighed on their website. On arrival at the hotel there was no one out front to valet park the car so had to go looking for someone at reception, Room was of good size with large bathroom but our lights did not work , on calling down to reception a repair guy was up promptly and fixed the fuse. We went out for dinner and a show and did not return till 10pm on returning we noticed the bathroom floor was very dirty , I phoned down to reception to ask for slippers, I was told that she would phone me back and thats the last I heard so I wore my hubbys socks. On check out our car was waiting outside as we had given three quarters of an hour notice. There was no attempt to help us with our luggage and we left as all the porters were chatting in the lobby, which was the norm . I was waiting at the door on one occasion as I was waiting for the rain to ease and I noticed how unhelpful and flippint the doormen were towards a woman looking for information on the bus service. I feel this could be a good hotel but the service lets it down badly. The westin dublin is a much better choice, much better service and you do feel like you are getting value for money.",3,2010,04,04
207,Great Location and Service,"I stayed at the Shelbourne over the week-end during a business trip.  The location is fantastic, within easy walking distance of all of Dublin's main attractions and restaurants.  The service was impeccable, from the concierge to the bellmen to the check-in desk.  I had a rear-facing room so it was quiet.  The hotel has been updated so the room is attractive, with very good lighting, and with continuously variable fan control and also variable temperature control (so you can hot or colder air at any time or season).  You don't hear much hall noise as they have fitted the doors with good closers.  The room is, however, small, although it has good storage, drawer, and closet space (the reason why I rate the hotel as 4 rather than 5-star).  The common areas (bars and restaurants and lobby) are classic and stunningly beautiful.  This is a great place to stay in downtown Dublin--I don't think you can do better.",4,2010,04,01
207,Perfect,"Lovely hotel, very friendly staff. Bedrooms very comfortable with large bathroom. Spotlessly clean. Great breakfast. Overall great place to stay in Dublin",5,2010,03,16
207,Outstanding Elegance and Service,"We stayed in Dublin at The Shelbourne after a wonderful trip through the countryside, staying at B&Bs.  This....was worth the wait.  The hotel is in a prime location, and we were able to access all the key touring spots on foot.  We stayed there with our 4mo old, and they had a cot (crib) set up in the room upon arrival.  While we missed out on getting a cocktail in the gorgeous bars, we were only a short walk to many accommodating restaurants.  The hotel staff was EXTREMELY helpful, especially when they saw we had the baby with us.  When we headed back to the States, we were well-rested and felt like royalty.",5,2010,03,13
207,overpriced and trading on its past reputation,stayed herefor 2 nights  with my husband whilst on business in Dublin.  The doorman was very pleasant - but cant say the same about the restaurant staff.  The room was shaby and desperately in need of a refurb.  The restaurant food was ok - I ended up with food poisoning .... not pleasant.  Certainly overpriced - were asked if we wanted water - were charged €7.50 for one bottle!,3,2010,02,20
207,The Shelbourne,"Very well located near Saint Stephen's Green Park. Close to Trinity College, to Temple street and to Shopping Streets...
Huge lobby with cheminey, 2 bars and 1 restaurant.
Large room with balcony. Very nice bathroom. Good bedding but I definitely prefer Sofitel's My Bed...",4,2010,02,20
207,Something lacking ...,"We started our 12-day trip to Ireland with a couple of nights at the centrally-located Shelbourne, located across the street from the beautiful St. Stephen's Green.  We booked through Expedia at a very decent rate, which let me know that we probably weren't going to get the nicest room in the place and I was okay with that.  

Arriving at the hotel in the rain, our cabbie couldn't get a porter to come help us with our luggage so we ended up clumsily making our way through the wet & slipper front portico to the very understated check-in area at the back of the lobby. My first impression of the hotel was that it was very lovely but it lacked a certain warmth and character.  My impression didn't really change that much throughout the rest of our time there.  

The room was fine, exactly what you'd expect from a Renaissance property - alas, ANY Renaissance property, in any city in the world.  There was nothing distinctive about it at all and nothing that I would call out as particularly luxurious or 5 star.  Oh, and our room overlooked a bunch of offices so we couldn't have our blinds open at anytime while we were in the room because we'd be looking out over people typing away on their computers or a giant garbage bin. The elevator was also extremely loud and the maid's closet was being opened and closed repeatedly starting at 6 a.m. We eventually learned that it wasn't closed properly so somehow the air moving along the hallway was opening it and closing it on its own.  I dunno, it was annoying. 

Our first morning in Ireland we woke up VERY early.  Leaving the hotel around 7:30 a.m. to try to get some coffee, when we asked the concierge where a good cafe was he laughed at us and told us to try something on Dawson Street. He didn't tell us what Dawson Street was or where it was located and he didn't give us any recommendations for which cafe we should try.  In the end we went with the first one that was open (the next day we found a lovely Italian-style cafe that would have made a great recommendation if he had just taken the time to make it instead of laughing at the eager Americans on holiday). 

Upon check out there was a problem with their computers so we couldn't get even a copy of our bill.  We were told they'd email it to us before the gentleman ""helping us"" walked away.  I understand that computers go down (trust me, it happens at my job all the time!) but we were paying you several hundred dollars for the pleasure of staying at your hotel - you could at least act like we weren't putting you out somehow.  

I dunno, I just left the Shelbourne completely disappointed and hoping the rest of our 5 star hotel experiences that trip exceeded this one (they did!).",3,2010,02,10
207,"The Shelbourne Dublin, A Renaissance Hotel","Perfect location.  Walking distance from every thing, form local pub to the 5 * restaurants.  Excellent service and security.

would have appreciated free Internet but every thing else was perfect.",5,2010,02,04
207,Not that great for a 5 star,"I agree with previous reviews that the Shelbourne is trading on it's history. The check in was efficient enough. The room  a deluxe double was clean & quiet & nice but quite small compared to other 5 star hotels in Dublin such as the Westbury or 4 Seasons.  The location is great but there are better hotels just as near to the green such as the Merrion. The breakfast was a disaster, long queues, poor selection of food when we chose to opt out of the queue & go for the pre-cooked breakfast in the bar area. We were ignored by the waiting staff for at least 15 mins before I finally had to request cutlery & tea coffee. Have had much better breakfast in 3 star establishments & lot more efficient friendly staff. Would not return.",3,2010,02,02
207,Fab rooms at the Shelbourne - Service Issues,"What a great job they have done - rooms are fab, it is obvious that they are not that busy on a Sunday night - food and beverage service was a bit lax - breakfast was a go slow, and we ended up fending for ourselves (juices etc), but as most other guests were doing the same what can you say, standard of cooked breakfast below average. Overall enjoyed it, very good welcome and service from Front Desk (Stacey??), but no staff greeting your arrival at front door (how times have changed) - the Sunday evening scenario. Rooms are excellent, shame about the breakfast and service of same . For a memorable breakfast it's still Sheen Falls Lodge, Kenmare or the Cliff House Hotel in Ardmore!",4,2010,02,02
207,"Above average, I would not expect less for the price","Shelbourne is a nice hotel, very well located. This is not however the best 5* hotel I have been in Dublin (got hte room at 130 euros with corporate rate). 
breakfast is quite expensive (30euros)
TV system has France 24 as french chanel and plenty of English chanels. 
If you don't get internet included in your rate, it will cost you 80 euros for the week
the tissues in the bathroom are under average, no slippers or bathrobe provided either",4,2010,02,01
207,Christmas at The Shelbourne...,Checking into the venerable Shelbourne in The Fair City of Dublin on Christmas Eve (09) shall go down as one of my great hotel memories. Walking into a cheery lobby with a fire roaring a Christmas Tree alit and a small choir serenading the assmebled...you get the idea. Christmas. Festive and welcoming. The young ladies at the Front Desk welcomed us all with hot cider and a big Irish smile. Loved my room loved the locale. I shall try to be at The Shel for as many Holiday Seasons  as I can. Thank you all for your  unstinting graciousness.,5,2010,01,19
207,Location: Fantastic; Staff: Unhappy,"I grew up in Dublin, and The Shelbourne was always somewhere fun and fancy; a treat; somewhere you could go with your friends, parents or colleagues, and have a great time.  Things have changed.  Whatever about the size of the rooms (tiny) and provision of amenities (3 star), the issue is the staff.  From check-in, to an early check-out, our experience was really, really poor.  There is absolutely no friendliness, warmth or initiative.  The staff all seem to lack confidence, and not to enjoy their roles.  Perhaps this is a function of management style - who knows?  But the hotel appears to be run on the basis of 'we have a wonderful history, and beautiful location - pay up, and shut up'.  Check in took 15 minutes.  The guy behind the counter ignored me for the first 6; then checked me in in the most bored, lugubrious fashion: kind of like you would expect at an Undertakers' Convention in suburban Minsk in winter.  Service in the bars and restaurants was shockingly amateur: the staff had limited knowledge of their menus and processes.  We had to wait 35 minutes for a drinks order for 4 in the lounge; which then arrived incorrectly.  No apologies, or no sense of urgency.  That night, we received a missive under our bedroom door advising that the hotel was 'very busy' and we should expect to wait longer for particular services - for example, minimum 45 minutes' advance notice to retrieve our car from valet parking (it actually took 1 hour 20 minutes: the car park is a 90 second walk); and to expect slower service in the bars and restaurants.  Hardly inspiring or welcoming?   When I gave feedback to the Duty Manager, she was passive-aggressive and clipboardy: 'we'd love you to stay, but understand if you don't want to'.  What do you do in those circumstances?  Leave.  There are plenty of other lovely hotels in Dublin, all of which have superior service.  I would recommend The Dylan, 31 Leeson Close, The Merrion and The Westin instead.",1,2010,01,17
207,Not Pleased to have my bag robbed..,"Went to The Shelbourne hotel to celebrate a friend's birthday and when we stood up to leave there was that sinking feeling that a bag had been robbed and indeed it was gone.The staff did not really want to engage in any conversation on the subject other than to repeatedly tell us that it was not the responsibility of the hotel that the bag had been stolen.There was no basic humanity or concern demonstrated just a repetition of this mantra.So be warned,if you choose to go mind all of your personal effects very closely and if or when something is stolen do not expect any support from the staff.",3,2010,01,16
207,"Fabulous location, efficient staff but rather pricey","A weekend break for my wifes birthday and the Shelbourne lived up to its hefty reputation but it did carry a hefty price given the value of the dollar. Staff were quick and efficient if a little snobish, top floor room with view of the park had a wonderful bathroom and the usual comfortable Marriott bed. The beat place to base yourself in Dublin but much better value for eating and drinking can be found outside of the hotel, wonderful craic to be had in the hotel bar or residents lounge with roaring fires when the other pubs of Dubin are winding down.",4,2010,01,13
207,Staff with pompous attitude,"The staff we encountered were not friendly & customer focused. They seemed pompous with their position of working in this hotel. They were short, not friendly or helpful in their attitude towards our requirements when wanting service either in the bar or at breakfast.
The extra we paid for a room with a park view was not worth it. You had to crane your neck to look out a small attic window to see anything. Room size was ok though.",3,2010,01,12
207,great stay,"The hotel was clean and friendly. Location was good for all the shops and pick up to and from the airport. The staff were friendly, althought we only saw the door staff once..... The bath was amazing so deep you may need your armbands.... try to get a room over looking the park. over all a great stay.",4,2010,01,11
207,"Good Hotel, Missing the 5 Star touch","Arrived late, check in fast and efficient.

Booked into a 1 Bed Suite, we stayed for 4 nights.

Very large bathroom, bedroom on the small side, although the large sitting room made up for that. We were facing the courtyard, our own fault though, we were offered a St. Stephen’s Green view at check in, but my wife though it might be too loud – typical ! – anyway it wasn’t a huge drawback only that it got very dark early in the evening.
If u are staying over the winter I would recommend a room facing the Green.

The bed was extremely comfy, room well kept and generally clean.
I say generally as it was a little disappointing to see dirty handmarks on one of the roof hatches ( no idea why the roof hatch was there in the first place, as we were not on the top floor ) - I would have expected the cleaning staff to have seen these.

The location was ideal – right in the heart of Dublin, close to Grafton Street with ample shopping and good restaurants.

Service - Depending on who u were dealing with very good to poor. On a personal level if u asked for something directly or went to one of the staff, there response was always good but what was missing was the simple ""hello"" or voluntary acknowledgement that u existed.

Breakfast - very good, wide selection and properly cooked.

Executive lounge – beautiful room, old style, looking on to Green and complementary WIFI.

BTW - No Swimming Pool or Fitness Center

Overall, the Hotel was good but the staff ( in particular the Porter and reception staff ) left a very cold and unwelcoming feeling.

Would stay there again.",4,2010,01,10
207,A week in Dublin,"Dublin is a city with no doubt wonderful character.  In our travels through the UK, it was the friendliest city we were in.  The Shelbourne was amazing...you cannot go wrong staying in the heart of Dublin across from St. Stephens Green.  The concierge is the best and will do anything you need.  The rooms are comfy, bed unlike anything we had ever slept in and the service goes way beyond...",5,2010,01,06
207,FABULOUS,"This was by far the nicest hotel I've stayed in. The building was beautiful, and the location was fantastic! The hop-on hop-off tour picks up right across the street (cheesey, yes...but fun!), as does the shuttle for the O2, and shopping on Grafton St. is just a few blocks away. We did a tour during our trip, so we actually stayed in the Shelbourne on two separate occasions. The second time, we actually got upgraded to a better room because they were fairly emtpy that day. Everything was fabulous!",5,2010,01,05
207,The Best Hotel We've Ever Experienced!,"We had the most fabulous experience at this hotel.  I have traveled all over the US and in Europe and Great Britian and this was the best!  The hotel is beautiful, the staff exceptional, and the room was to die for!  It was our anniversary and when I told the staff person at check-in, she immediately upgraded us to a huge room with a grand bathroom.  When you called housekeeping for anything they were there before you could hang up the phone.  We loved it.",5,2010,01,05
207,Great Location,"We arrived early but becuase of a wedding, we were unable to get a room.  They stored our luggage so we could have a look round the shops.  They also gave us an upgrade to a King room. 
The rooms are good but I would advise that you book a king room as the queen rooms are little small.
One area they do need to work on was service.  It was not really as good as should be.  it could be because of the bad weather but they really need to have more staff as it is often very busy.
The food is excellent and the location is brilliant for the shops.
A great hotel.
Bentleys on the green is an excellent restaurant just round the corner.",4,2010,01,04
207,kids loved it,"We stayed here 2 nights, in 2 different rooms. Both rooms plush, but our first room (as seen in the pictures) much more spacious, bathroom 3 x larger than our 2nd room, room 2x bigger and faced the park area street side. Kids loved the large tub and 7yo daughter pampered herself in the tub and felt like she was Eloise at the Waldorf. LOL. They loved the charm and history and bustle of the hotel and the doorman opening the door and greeting them.

We enjoyed the quiet in the room, watching the comings and goings of the guests and wedding receptions and xmas decorations. Rooms with luxurious linens, but beds small. 20 E for internet daily, yikes!, 25E for parking.

Only negatives were concierge forgot to order taxis for us twice so we were late for engagements and hotel check in long and chaotic and our cards had to be rekeyed several times  which I feel brought it down to 4 stars bc I would expect a hotel of this caliber which I assume  prides itself on service would do better at.

Nice convenient location to shopping, walking, pubs, eating",4,2010,01,02
207,FABULOUS,"This hotel lived up to all my expectations. The location is central the rooms were great and the bar was buzzing, and they pulled this off over new year so what must they be like the rest of the time!!! Our new hotel base in Dublin.",5,2010,01,01
207,Still got old charm,"We stayed in the shelbourne as a treat over christmas. We got a good deal, lovely spacious room very comfytm bathroom goodsize. Hotel still has the old charm, we had a snack in the bar they were a little understaffed the day we were there but the plachad a great athmosphere. Overall the only fault I would have is the bar is pretty expensive, but wouldn't stop me going there.",5,2009,12,30
207,Almost perfect!,"My husband and I spent three wonderful nights at this truly five star hotel! We were greeted and treated like royalty for the most part, the only exception was  very cold treatment by two staff members in the residents-only lounge, where we were quite ignored. However, we reported them to the night staff and hopefully they will be made aware of how out of touch they are with the rest of the excellent hotel staff. Other than that, our stay was wonderful. We had a charming junior suite that was elegantly furnished and very quiet. The location is central but far enough from the nightlife to be very calming and delightful. St. Steven's Green is directly across the way and is an oasis. All sights are within walking distance. I can't wait until we can again stay in this stately hotel. Close by are a beckoning wine bar and a local bar-restaurant, Foley's, that is quite reasonably priced and provides good value and service.",4,2009,12,20
207,"This time, disappointed","I stay in one of 3 hotels in Dublin.  I was happy with my previous stays but this time there were a few too many points which didn't add up.

I know that when booking a special 30 day deal, you can expect a smaller room than usual and this was the case, it was very small for 2 people and the bathroom was only a shower room, I prefer a bath. The bathroom was naturally very small to match.  But that was the least of the down points, as I understand that when a hotel is full and you are on a special rate that's what you get.

What disappointed me is that one night we can down to go out and the whole of the downstairs was mobbed with about 300 people, a private Xmas function, they should have dedicated floors for that, I don't think it's on to have such a large amount of people in your lobby.  The rest of the time there are always people hanging around in the lobby area because they overflow from the bars, so that's another thing, it's constantly packed.

One afternoon at 4.30 we came back to our room and the room was half made and the maid had left the stuff in as she had to come back.

Unlike most other hotels, the business center gives you free Internet access, there it's 5 euros for 15 minutes and the connection is slow and the computer just hung and/or rebooted a couple of times.

The mini bar didn't seem to work, got 2 beers and they were warm.

At the checkout when the lady asked if everything was ok I took the opportunity to give the above points (forgot about the business center part though) she was apologetic, explained that the rooms take upto 18:00 to be made etc, she could not do much about the overcrowding really and gave me her business card for another time so maybe she could upgrade us.  She took the beers off the bill so that was nice.

Otherwise I do like that hotel, the service has always been good (to us) but it makes me think that I may wish to stay at my other preferred two in the future.",4,2009,12,15
207,"Beautiful hotel, great location","We booked this hotel through priceline and got a fantastic deal. When we arrived (after 1 hour at passport control, lost luggage, a 30 minute cab ride), we were so please to have such a warm welcoming from the reception. She was very kind and helpful with maps and directions. The room was a bit small and we only had a shower (no tub), but again, we paid a very discounted rate. There were robes and slippers provided which was a nice touch. The room was very comfortable and quiet. The hotel is in a fantastic location, only a short walk from Grafton street and the local sites. We really enjoyed our stay here.",5,2009,12,11
207,"Beautiful Hotel, fantastic location! Oh and then there's the average service...","I grew up in Dublin and The Shelbourne was always the benchmark of what a top 5 star hotel in Dublin should be, its legendary and steeped in Irish history and culture so, when visting ""home"" recently on business I was delighted to know I'd be staying there! On arrival I was warmly greeted by the doorman and shown to reception, eventhough there was a queue I was checked in within about 4 mins and headed to my room happy. The room was lovely, large and airy, decorated to a high standard and very clean, only complaint no tea and coffee in the room-you have to call room service and the ""tray charge"" is as much as the beverage!! I was with a group of work colleagues and clients and overall I would say this place lives up to its reputation as mentioned above, a very enjoyable stay was had by all and I would definitely return, but (there is always a but) the one thing that lets this beautiful majestic Irish ""icon"" down is the service, particularly in the bar(s), its poor, plain and simple! The two main bars were constantly busy with a great atmosphere, a mixture of locals and guests all enjoying a drink, but there was never enough staff to cope! So we adjourned to The residents bar (Lord Mayors Lounge) in the evening and the staff in general were cold and unresponsive, drinks took forever and I would have to say we weren't made feel welcome. This is a 5 Star property and charges 5 Star prices for its drinks and quite frankly I've had better service in a Holiday Inn!! 
In summary this hotel exudes class and quality in a traditional and grand setting, so central for everything its worth booking, but do be aware the service doesn't match the 5 Star tag!!! Shelbourne, listen to the reviews on here, make the changes its worth it!",4,2009,12,10
207,"Disappointing - chaotic check-out, unfriendly staff","I attended a wedding there and stayed 2 nights. Reservations staff were rude to my daughter in law when she booked my room. Staff around the front of the hotel (porters, receptionists, waitresses in the Lord Mayors Room) were unfriendly. Food was very good, but breakfast was rushed on both mornings and check-out was chaotic. Not good enough especially as it cost over 220 euro per night.  Years ago the Shelbourne was one of the best hotels in Ireland.  Not so any more!  Very disappointing visit.  It should not have 5 stars.  Go to the Merrion Hotel, or the Westin instead.",3,2009,12,01
207,Sex in the city come to Dublin,"Fairly decent 5 star hotel. 
Grand facade. Not overly spectacular or unusual inside. Traditional but nice. 

Busy at weekends. The public bar used to be bright lights and mostly male - a place to talk – better for it I think -  but now it’s dark and popular with the gals.  All good looking and well dressed and having a good time downing cocktails. It’s very popular. 

The heritage bed room is nice. Good size, good bathroom, huge luxurious bed, quiet.  

Restaurant is all small interlinked rooms darkly lit and perhaps not the grand open bright ballroom type dining experience that one might expect from a hotel of this type. Fully booked.

Dinner is €37 for three courses but its not interesting grub and won’t leave a memorable impression. The portions were small, for example main course risotto was down my neck in 60 seconds – it was that small.  

Service throughout is very good although reception gives you directions to your room rather than first checking if you would like assistance. No offer to arrange a morning paper either.

The pre authorisation is for more than the room/package cost which implies that they assume you are going to steal from the mini bar without telling them A bit Radisson SAS that.  
Many hotels do not do this but foreign owned chains seem to persist with it. I take exception to it. 

Breakfast is entirely self service (boo) the only cooked option being the Irish fry up (boo again). Quality produce throughout. 

Extra charges. Wifi begins at €9 and tray charges of €5 added to breakfast in bed despite having paid for the privilege as part off a package???.  WiFi is usually free in Irish hospitality these days. 

I would recommend not to bother with a package though as a room, dinner and a bottle of wine will work out cheaper if you buy separately. 

Busy, lively, smart and perfectly located. A nice change from most 5 star places which can be a little too exclusive and a little too quiet.",4,2009,11,24
207,"Wonderful, elegant hotel in a great location!","We got this hotel on a discount travel website so the value for us was exceptional.   We were treated as regular customers and given a wonderful room.  We stayed for 4 nights.  I meant to write a review back in May or June, but didn't get to it until now. 

The hotel is very elegant and quiet.  The staff is very attentive and eager to please.  We even got  moved to an upgraded room for our last two nights, since availability opened up and they knew we had initially asked for a room with a view to the park.  So wonderful of them to accomodate us!

The hotel is a short walk to Grafton St. where there are great pubs, stores, and shops.  It is also right near a double decker tour bus stop, so you can easily hop on and visit all the main tourist stops (Zoo, Guinness Factory, Castle, etc. ) and be back to your hotel in no time.  

We did not eat in the restaurants, but had a pint in the bar and loved it.  Everyone here is super friendly and eager to please.  

I always find that a smile goes a long way and when you come with a positive attitude and open mind, you will always have a better experience.   We have nothing but great things to say about this hotel.",5,2009,11,23
207,Amazingly beautiful!!!,"Our final night in Ireland was in Dublin. The Shelbourne was gorgeous; top notch. There was a soccer match and rugby the next day, so the City was very busy. We went to a local pub, Foley's, and had a great time. After, we went back to the Shelbourne bar, which was packed. It was a great time!!!!",5,2009,11,16
207,Grand Hotel But Major Downsides,"Stayed for seven nights in what is known as the Grand Lady of Dublin.
The hotel is beautiful but, the staff and service needs to improve.
Before leaving for Dublin I contacted Marriott and requested a non-connecting room and early check-in.  Upon arriving we waited hours for a room and had a connecting room.  I did mention this to the front desk, but it was the only room they had at the time and no plans to move us.
The bellhops and doormen were great and did go out of their way for us.
The concierges acted like it was too much trouble to give us information.
They were far from pleasant.

Breakfast was included with the room and very good. 
We left early everyday for some sightseeing and upon returning after 3 sometimes 4 in the afternoon our room still was not made up. 
When we reported this to the front desk, we were told that the maids make the rooms up between 8am and 7pm. After three days of this, we requested to have our room made up by noon.
This of course was done, but you must request such a service.
The towels were dingy and not what you would expect at a five star hotel.
Just alittle work with some changes and this would be a Grand Hotel.",4,2009,11,15
207,Very Nice,"This was a five night stay paid for with Marriott Award Points and the purpose of the trip was a short vacation. This historic hotel was built in 1824 and was recently totally remodeled and updated. It is an attractive property and our room was very nice with a comfortable bed, a bathroom with twin sinks, and a flat screen TV. My Award Level allowed access to the Heritage lounge which has afternoon snacks and free internet. I also received a free breakfast on weekdays and this was probably the nicest amenity I have had in my years of Marriott traveling. 

The hotel in very convenient to the museums and also to the routes of the ""get on, get off"" bus and the airport bus. The staff were very nice. There are two bars in the lobby and both were very busy all the time we were there, I think I lot of local people go there. In summary, this is a very nice and very convenient hotel. I recommend it highly and hope to have the opportunity to go there again in the future. This assumes I can afford to go back to Dublin again since, as of this time, Dublin is very expensive for American tourists.",5,2009,11,14
207,Afternoon Tea at Shelbourne - a few niggles,"A group of us booked a table for Afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors Lounge. (7 of us). When we arrived we had been given a large table and a small table added on at the end. The chairs were a mix of comfy ones and then upright ones which meant that those sitting on these chairs were much higher than anyone else and they were ok for sitting perhaps at a dining table but not around small low tables. We did manage to change some of them but two people still ended up on the high ones as the waitresses would not change them as they said other tables were reserved. Well, we had reserved our table 2 weeks in advance!

Service was good. We all had different types of tea and the little stands full of sandwiches came out with scones, sandwiches, smoked salmon, little meringues etc. Very nice altho I thought there could have been a better selection of the little cakes. Jams were nice.

We asked for another pot of tea after an hour or so and we were given it. However they did not come and take away my old cup with the cold tea in it. I had to pour it into another cup so I could get a fresh cup of tea. This I felt really left the service down. It is a small thing but really for €29.euros a head I expected more.

The Shelbourne is still a stunning hotel to walk into. However, having been in top hotels in London I felt the welcome was not as good. I had to walk over to the reception desk and stand for a few minutes until the Porter with the top hat asked me if he could help me. Now I dont think that should happen.

One other strange thing was that I went down into the womens bathroom on the lower ground floor. The cubicle I went into had no lock on the door, it had been removed. How can this possibly be left unfixed in what is a 5 star hotel ?

All in all I felt that if you were a tourist coming to this hotel looking for the Cead Mile Failte, you would be disappointed. None of the staff who served us were Irish.

I will try the other hotels like the Westbury or the Four Seasons for afternoon tea rather than go back to the Shelborne.",4,2009,11,14
207,Great!,"My husband and I had an overnight in the Shelbourne on the 7th Nov, I booked through Priceline so got the room for £113.  The room was clean, the bed super comfy and massive, and we didn't hear a peep through the night either.  The check-in did take longer than I would expect at a 5 star hotel, only one person serving, but we got a king rather than queen room as well as an early check-in at 8am and late check out at 2pm - couldn't really have asked for anymore (well other than the heater in the room to be working).",5,2009,11,12
207,Enjoyable stay at the Shelbourne Hotel,"I was traveling with two children and we found the staff at the Shelbourne Hotel to be very friendly.  On our second night, the hotel upgraded our room to a beautiful suite.  The rooms were very clean with very comfortable beds and good water pressure in the bathroom.  We enjoyed the beautiful lounge one evening while family came to visit.  The staff was very accomodating as we had a large group.  The location was good as we were able to do the city bus tour (hop on/hop off) and walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College,etc.  We took a taxi to/from the airport for approximately 30 euros.  Dan Dooley Car Rental arranged to deliver our car rental to the hotel which was a great help as we did not need the car the first day in Dublin.  I would recommend this hotel and look forward to staying at The Shelbourne Hotel again.",4,2009,11,11
207,The most unfriendly staff and worst service we've ever had.,"While the hotel is well located, there was absolutely no service during our 3 night stay and the staff couldn't care less.  When we first arrived we had to wait 45 minutes for someone to even give us a menu in the lounge and this was after complaining 3 times.  This set the stage for the level of service we recieved throughout our stay.  The concierge could not locate any of the resturants or activities that I had selected from tripadvisor.com before leaving NY and the one place he suggested and reserved for us did not have our reservation when we got there.  Our room looked out onto an air shaft with a perfect view of the linens stacked in the linen closets on each floor.  Noone exchanged the normal pleasantries that you expect, like good morning when you're leaving for the day, good evening when you retirn from your activities.  Overall this hotel was very supoosed to be very chi-chi but was by far the least pleasant place we've stayed in during our trip and we would definately NOT recommend it.",1,2009,11,10
207,Beautiful hotel for a Dublin getaway,"My husband and I live in Europe so we went to Dublin for a quick getaway. We used Marriott point to book a night at the Shelbourne. We arrived in the evening, took the Aircoach bus to the Kildare stop and walked about 1/2 a block to the hotel.

We were immediately greeted by a very friendly lady at the front desk and served fresh lemonade and pistacchio cake while we waited for our room keys. We found the service to be very helpful. We asked for directions to several local attractions, and they were great at giving us directions.

We had one of the regular rooms (not a suite). It was slightly smaller than any Renaissance we've stayed at in the U.S., but it was extremely clean and very well done. We were hoping for a separate bath and shower, but it was all-in-one. However, it was the best shower we've seen in Western Europe. We had a mid-week stay so there probably weren't as many people in the hotel as the weekends, but our room was incredibly quiet; we didn't hear street noise or even anyone else on our hallway. The view from our side wasn't much, but it wasn't a big priority for us either.

Because we used Marriott points, we didn't get the complimentary breakfast so we opted not to eat at the hotel, but went for Starbucks instead. The hotel did have complimentary coffee available downstairs though. We also were a little surprised that you had to pay for wi-fi. 

We thought the location was fabulous. We loved being across the street from St. Stephen's Green and just blocks away from Grafton St., Trinity College, the National Gallery, etc.  Overall, a great stay for us; we'd definitely stay there again.",5,2009,11,04
207,Birthday/Anniversary Trip,"Despite a nightmare getting to The Shelbourne from the airport in the middle of the Dublin marathon, we had a wonderful time on this birthday/wedding anniversary trip.  Our room had a nice view of the far corner of St. Stephen's Green, a comfortable bed, a large bathroom and a nice surprise left for us on our first night to celebrate our special occasion.  Free coffee is only available in the lobby until 8 am (no coffee maker in the room.)  The 29 euro buffet breakfast was not included in the price for our room--we didn't pay that much for most of our other meals, but we were too tired when we arrived to worry about the price. Great location, easy access to Hop On/Hop Off bus and other transportation, easy walk to Grafton St.",5,2009,11,01
207,Great Use of Marriott Points,"The Shelbourne is a treasure more than any other hotel I have stayed in.  It is amazing to read the history of the hotel, those who stayed there, and the events that had happened on the grounds.  The hotel, opened in 1824, is the sight of many events of British and Irish history, including the fact that the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland was signed in the hotel!  

The service is typical of all 5 star Marriott properties, top notch.  The Heritage Lounge (Concierge Lounge) was a great place to stop before dinner and relax looking out at St. Stephens Green.  Grafton Street is minutes away, the National Museum is directly behind the hotel, and Bram Stoker's birthplace is across the street! 

The Horseshoe Lounge and the No. 27 Bar are both great places to grab a drink and people watch.  I even used the hotel Barber Shop for a haircut and Paul did a fantastic job.  All in all, this hotel is a wonderful five star luxury hotel with character at every turn.",5,2009,10,30
207,"Great Position, fantastic Horseshoe Bar, let down by sloppy service","I love the Shelbourne for a few drinks or to meet people but have not stayed there for years. As I was doing the Dublin marathon I treated wife & I to a heritage room, overlooking the Green.  Lovely bed, fab bathroom. No tea/coffee making in the room but access to the lounge (with tea/coffee) two floors down! Tried to get tea room service on the Sunday - was quoted 30 mins....I had booked a table for 5 in the Saddle restaraunt and specifically asked for a quiet table because my 89 years old mother is slightly deaf . arrived to find no record of the booking! Yes they sorted us with a table but no quietand service slow. I still love the Horseshore bar but will not stay there again",3,2009,10,29
207,A Honeymoon to remember,"The Shelbourne is a delight. My Wife and I arrived on an early Sunday Morning, and despite not having our room ready, we were doted on with personal service that can only be described as outstanding. 
The hotel itself is a wonderful experience, ranging from classic fixtures to a staff that is warm and friendly to meet the needs of its guests.
Upon finally being able to check in after dropping off our bags early, we were lead to a wonderful suite over looking the lushish St.Stephens Green. A golden room with plush bedding, a large and modern bath and a charming sitting room.
I cannot say enough positives about the Shelbourne. It was the first hotel we standed at during our honeymoon in Ireland and it by far was the best(and we standed at 4 different hotels all star 4 stars and above during our 13 days in Ireland.)
I highly recommend the Shelbourne and plan on returning.",5,2009,10,29
207,"Wonderful experience, a gem in the city","We spent 4 nights in the Shelbourne, a long-held ambition. We know Dublin very well so the hotel was the focus of our break and we were not disappointed.
The building has an unbeatable location on Stephen's Green in the city centre and is very elegant, the refurbished hotel is decorated to an excellent standard with outstanding artwork and finishes.
The staff were lovely: friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  The room was large and extremely comfortable, the beds being the best I've ever experienced in any hotel.
We did not eat in the hotel apart from taking the legendary afternoon tea experience in the Lord Mayor's Lounge on the Sunday, highly recommended and a highlight of the visit.
Dublin is a wonderful city and having the opportunity to stay in such a historically significant hotel surpassed our expectations.
My only grumble is that the room lacked a kettle and with coffee or tea being around 5 euro plus 5 euro delivery on room service it was the only thing I can complain about!",5,2009,10,29
207,Elegant and very quiet hotel,"We arrived at 10 in the morning from an overnight flight and the front desk had a room available for us immediately.  The location was great and everything about the hotel was first class.  We had the quietest room in a back wing but still had a view of the Wicklow Mts.  Loved the comfortable beds and pillows.  Using room service for the complimentary delivery of a bucket of ice was different from the hotels in the states, but they were fast and pleasant.  All our questions for directions  were answered politely and one with a little humor.",5,2009,10,28
207,Great Location,"Spent a weekend here and loved it.
Location is superb and staff very helpful.
Rooms are comfortable and elegant.
Breakfast is not to be missed!
Bar must be one of the busiest around St Stephens Green!",5,2009,10,24
207,Fantastic,We stayed here on a Saturday night for a special occasion.  We were greeted by Michal whom must have been one the most professional front desk staff we have ever been met.  His warmth and friendly manner set the tone for our stay.  We were allocated a truly beautiful room which was an upgrade from the room we had reserved.  It was wonderfully spacious with every accessory...even a bathroom scales!!!  Every member of staff that we encountered during our time there were both friendly and professional.  I would recommend The Shelbourne to anyone.,5,2009,10,21
207,Treat yourself to a little luxury,"I stayed here recently with my husband and teenage daughter - we loved it.  Fantastic, grand building located a couple of minutes from grafton street.  The bedrooms are gorgeous - bathroom was so roomy  - a pleasure to get ready in.  The beds (2 double)  comfy!!  Had one drink each in the hotel lounge  - it was lovely to soak up atmosphere and relax here before  our  quick walk  to Thunder Road Cafe ( which our 15yr old loved - not recommended for those who want a quiet meal tho).  We had breakfast delivered to the room the next morning - table on wheels which was opened out - food was yum!)  This is by far one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in.  Def stay again - If I had to pick one thing however it was the not so nice receptionist we met when checking in (unfriendly and snooty - I would def recommend this hotel but I would also warn people to beware that some of the staff might be a little off if you don't appear to be flashing the cash!!!  But only for that it is a plush hotel that I can't wait to stay in again when in Dublin!",5,2009,10,21
207,Great Hotel steeped in History,"We normally stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel which is so handy right beside Grafton Street and with great views of the Green.  I decided to book the Shelbourne for a change.  It's just a very beautiful Hotel.  We got a great room with 2 Queen Beds on the 6th floor overlooking the Green and more.  I must say the breakfast that was included in the room price was just superb and sustained us for the day.  Compliments to the chef!  The staff was very friendly.  We will definetly be back.  If you want to spoil yourself go and stay in the Shebourne.  Make sure you are hungry in the morning and go to the Saddle Room for breakfast.  The location was brilliant too.  We walked to the Concert Hall, the museum around the corner, shops, O'Donohues pub etc.",5,2009,10,19
207,home sweet home,"A national treasure built in 1824, The Shelbourne Hotel has been magnificently restored while keeping its historic charm. The Shelbourne is a luxury 5 star hotel in Dublin city centre overlooking St. Stephen's Green, Europe's grandest garden square. Ideally situated close to Dublin's cultural and historic buildings, The Shelbourne offers a great location, from where you can visit the majestic St. Patrick's Cathedral and Trinity College. Explore shops on Grafton Street or visit the Guinness Storehouse. The Shelbourne offers spacious accommodations with luxurious Egyptian cotton bedding, flat- screen TV, laptop-size safe, and marble bathroom. Enjoy a cocktail or Ireland's own Guinness at our renowned Horseshoe Bar. Celebrate life at our Oyster Bar or a prime- cut steak at The Saddle Room Restaurant.

207,Perfectly located and cheerful grande dame; small but well-furnished rooms,"Our four night stay was business for my husband, leisure for me. The perfect location at the top of St. Stephen's Green suited us both. The public spaces are very attractive and always bustling with suits.

Our room was certainly not large, especially given that it was one grade up from the very smallest category offered. However, the king bed and linens were extremely comfortable; marble bathroom nicely appointed (slightly weak water pressure, though); large flatscreen tv, armchair and work desk made for a really cozy and functional stay. Also the room was absolutely silent at all hours--a really nice advantage when my husband had to make work calls during the day, and of course it helped us sleep very well at night.

We didn't need much in the way of service, but were happy with the cheerful arrangement of an early-morning taxi to the airport and with housekeeping's willingness to accommodate an unusual schedule (they never bothered us when we stayed in the room all morning or even into the afternoon; yet the room was always made up even if we only left for a few hours in the p.m.--it was sooo nice not to be harassed to get out of the room!) I'd also like to make a special mention of Helen Killian who checked us in at the front desk with SUCH charm and warmth. What a great ambassador for the hotel and for Irish hospitality!

Since we got a great rate, we were really pleased with the value-for-money, but I'm sure those who pay full price would be disappointed with the room size.",4,2009,10,13
207,First-rate,"Beautiful property is in a great part of Dublin. The bars and restaurants are cozy and luxurious. We stayed in the JFK Suite and found it to be luxurious and comfortable. Bed extremely comfortable with great linens. Bathroom is large and well appointed with big fluffy towels.

We look forward to enjoying this hotel again.",5,2009,10,09
207,Shelbourne?  Eh!... But definitely not with Priceline!,"The Shelbourne is advertised as a four or five star hotel.  It may be, but my experience did not bear that out.   This hotel seems to be the kind of place that wants to do as little, instead of as much as possible for its guests.   It started even before we arrived.   Having made reservations for two rooms through Priceline.com, there was no opportunity to select the room as between full, queen and king.  We were automatically assigned Queen bed rooms.  After booking was completed, the Priceline site directed customers to deal directly with the hotel.  My efforts to change one of the rooms to two doubles was futile online.  Instead, the hotel simply said that such rooms would be assigned if available upon arrival.  We also sought early arrival, which, while not committing to, the hotel did ultimate accommodate us when we checked in.  

In my second request (still in advance of our arrival) the hotel replied that if a double room was not available, they would provide a rollaway bed for the second guest.  At check in, that offer was repeated when they explained that no doubles were available.  As soon as we saw the relatively small rooms, we knew that fitting a rollaway bed would be difficult.  Though told in an email, at the front desk and in literature from the hotel, it proved to be impossible.  They could barely get the bed through the door and once in, it was clear that there was no floor space for it whatsoever.  Still, the hotel refused to accommodate a room change.  At one point, it was suggested that if a room change available, there would be an additional fee of 30 euro a night, again subject to availability.  A second option offered was to “make a bed” out of duvet covers, and mattress toppers on the floor next to the bed.  Ultimately, that is where my sister, recently out of hospital, spent her Shelbourne nights.  

If that was all, we would chalk it up to an unfortunate circumstance in an otherwise great hotel.  But there’s more, much more.  The room my sister and 82 year old Mother shared was missing basic equipment.  Half the pillows were missing, there was no luggage rack and the walls were bare.  The window needed to be propped to stay open.  The cleaning of their room on the first day was cursory at best.  Toothpaste was not cleaned from the sink.  Take out coffee cups were left on the table.  On the second day of our stay, we vacated the rooms at about 10:30 am and when we returned around three, neither had been cleaned and the bath linens were not replaced.  They finally arrived around 5, while my Mother was napping and did return to do half a cleaning job sometime after 6:30.

Sleeping might have been relaxing except for the low rumble of some kind of motor that was constant through  three quarters of the night.  I might have tried to put myself to sleep by cruising the internet, but the 20 euro per day / 9 euros per hour charge was just a bit too steep to pay.   

When I asked the Concierge to make a reservation for the Guinness tour, he suggested instead that I go to the Business Center and pay a five or six euro charge to log on for 15 or 20 minutes and do it myself.  Nice.  Instead, I walked to an internet café on Grafton St in the drizzle and paid 1.50 euro for the same privilege.  The next day, we were going to go on the Hop On Hop Off bus.  The greeter at the hotel door volunteered that it might be more convenient to purchase our tickets through the Concierge.   I explained that one of our tickets was to be a Senior Ticket.  He confidently told me that the Concierge could handle the transaction.   I left my family at the entrance of the hotel and returned to the desk and waited and waited and waited for the Concierge to return.  That didn’t happen and about 10 minutes later, a bellhop offered to help (Finally, I got someone’s attention!).  When I told him I needed three adult tickets and one senior ticket, he said that complex a transaction could not be done in the hotel but that it was very easy to purchase the tickets on the bus, as I had intended to do some time earlier.  Time wasted, family left waiting, our day delayed, we finally were off on our own.

There is much more to tell (a bellhop trying to jam four of us and our luggage into the tiniest cab he could find; the wildly overpriced drinks at the hotel bar, to name but two more), but it given the inattention or unavailability of staff at the front desk, in the cleaning of rooms and most everything else, the point is made.   

The Shelbourne has apparently been recently renovated at great expense.  A few more dollars in to training the hotel staff to be accommodating might have been worth the investment. A bit more of a desire to please the guests rather than to do the minimum could make this really a hotel worth telling friends about.

Instead, this is one guest who will not be back.  At a very minimum, I strongly recommend against using Priceline.com to book a room.  If there is anything not to your liking, the hotel staff is quick to point out that “well, you booked on Priceline, after all.”  Apparently they are not very fond of Priceline customers.  Even though THEY use Priceline, help them out, don’t use it to give them your business.  They apparently just don't like it.

All that said, it was an okay hotel in an okay location.    It was easy enough for all but my elderly Mom to walk to Grafton Street and, of course, St. Stephen's Green.  Everything else was a cab ride away.  A cab for four from the airport was about 30 Euros, to Heuston Station (Irish Rail) over 20 (not during rush hour) and to the Guinness Storehouse about 16 on a Saturday.

The restoration of the hotel is magnificent.  Too bad it got buried under the negative points raised above.",3,2009,10,08
207,"Shelbourne Dublin, Classic Hotel, First Class Experience","We stayed for four nights at the Shelbourne on a business trip this past August.  This hotel is in an ideal location accross from St. Stephens Green and just around the corner from all the shops and restaurants on Grafton Street.  We had a suite facing the park with a huge marble bath.  The beds and pillows were feather and the most comfortable by far of the six different places we stayed in Ireland.  It was hard to get up.
Breakfast was included and served either buffet or ala cart in a very nice little restaurant on the ground floor.  We did not dine here for dinner, but breakfast was excellent.  If not included in the rate, it is expensive.  There is a  very lively and fun bar off the lobby called ""Number 27"" which we highly recommend.  The other bar, the Horseshoe,  is nice but more sedate.  There is a wonderful lounge for tea and cocktails in the front of the hotel which is quite nice.
This is a perfect business hotel or for vacation with everything located close and the service and food of high quality. 
If you want a great steakhouse, Shannahan's on the Green is only a five minute walk on the other side of the square.  This restaurant rivals any in the states for the best steak served exactly as you order it.  Outstanding wine lise, fresh hot onion bread, sauteed shrimp to die for (dip the onion bread in the sauce), and marvelous deserts.  To top it off, the Oval Office Bar located downstairs is great for any American.  A terrific collection of memorabilia with signed documents from many different U.S. Presidents.  They have deep comfortable leather chairs and carpet with the Presidential seal.  A fabulous place to sip a nice Irish Whiskey, we recommend the Middleton's Very Rare.  To top it off, JFK's rocking chair sits right behind the bar.  Not an Irish experience per se, but one not to be missed.",5,2009,10,08
207,80/20 rule.....how about 90/10,"I think if I was to ever stay in Dublin again it would be at the Shelbourne.  First rate property all the way.  The food, room, service, staff....all top notch.  Historic property on St. Stephens Green, walking distance to everything cool in Dublin.",5,2009,10,08
207,Fabulous splurge,"My 13-year-old niece and I splurged on one night at the Shelbourne and was a blast! She was quite impressed and will probably never be the same! The service was fantastic, the room stunning, just a really fun treat.",5,2009,09,30
207,Delightful,"My family and I stayed at the Shelbourne for five nights in mid September. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel was situated across the street from a gorgeous St. Stephens park, next to Grafton street for shopping and we walked to dinner every night. This part of town is considered very elegant. The meals at the Shelbourne were excellent but you also pay for them. 
Breakfast was included in our rate, but the menu stated 30 euro. Drinks in their lounge for four ran us $49 euro each time. But the service and food were well worth it.
The staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The concierge helped us book a tour of the Cliffs of Moher and got us hop on hop off tickets each day, and the bus picks you up across the street.
The rooms were clean and elegant. The only problem we had is a wait to get one of our rooms and we did have to ask for a room change as one of our rooms wasn't up to par.",5,2009,09,29
207,Nice hotel but make sure you get the room you want,The Shelbourne is a lovely hotel in a great location but we had to be assertive when they put us in an handicapped accessible room. The bathroom was like a hospital bathroom - roll a wheelchair into shower which only had a curtain around it - the entire bathroom floor would be wet and there was no tub.Handy if that's what you need - otherwise depressing.   It was on the first floor with a huge line of beer kegs just outside the window - what a clash of noise that promised at some point in the day or night!  We called to request a different room and were told the front desk was very busy and they would call us. 10 minutes later my husband went to the front desk and they were serving no one at the time. The new room was much better but the air conditioning didn't work well so it was always over warm despite being cool fall days.  The concierge did not have printed directions to drive to the airport and two different concierge s gave us slightly different directions neither of which were complete so we ended up way off course and had to rely on the kindness of strangers to direct us.  Thank goodness for the good nature of the Irish.  Otherwise the hotel is lovely and the location is great.,4,2009,09,24
207,perfect localtion!,"We were there for the last 4 days of our Ireland tour and I must say, the hotel is everything I'd heard about.  We had great rates through priceline.com so the room was small, I mean tiny small but considering the location, the ambiance, class, and service of this hotel, we can't complaint.  Everything was top notch and service from bellmen to front desk, bar servers to house keepers, everyone was very professional and nice.  There was always something going on in the hotel, a very exciting atmosphere.  The only problem is that it can appear to be a little on the pretentious side, but once you get past all the well dressed local business people, find a place to sit in one of the beautiful bars and chat up the locals, it's not pretentious at all.  Just well dressed people in a well appointed place to people watch and to be seen.",4,2009,09,23
207,Beautiful Hotel - Let down by WiFi,"The Shelbourne is arguably Ireland´s most famous hotel. Ideally located on a corner of St. Stephen's Green it is here that the Irish constitution was written. Over the years it has hosted a roll call of the worlds rich and famous from John F. Kennedy to Princess Grace.

As you would expect from such of an establishment the public rooms are well maintained and sumptuous. Our room, no. 777, whilst small was beautifully furnished and equipped with all the comforts you would expect from this category of hotel. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. What a shame then that, for me, a poor wifi internet service and lethargic response to my remarks by reception let the whole experience down. 

Perhaps the hotel management don´t appreciate just how important wifi is to many of those of us traveling on business. It is our most important connection to the world and the companies we work for. Whilst it is now quite often a free service in hotels I didn´t mind paying the 20 euro for 24 hours that the Shelbourne charged. For that however I expected a reliable, fast connection. This was not to be. Signal strength varied between ´Very good´ and ´Low´. It was never ´Excellent´ and at times non-existent.

Having previously worked and may times stayed in similar category hotels, when I mentioned his failing on check out at reception, I was expecting the charge to be reduced or even dropped altogether. Instead the response was “Yes it does get slow, especially when the hotel is full” as full payment was taken . 

I´d happily recommend this hotel to anybody who doesn´t need to use the internet whilst traveling. If you do need such access, look elsewhere. The promised ´High Speed Internet´ simply doesn´t come up to the job.",4,2009,09,21
207,A classic luxury stay,"Enjoyed our recent stay at the Shelbourne.  Stand outs of our stay were the quality of the full breakfast (which came with the room) and the comfort of the bed/pillows.  AirCoach shuttle transportation  a is very convenient  way to get to/from this hotel vis a vis the airport.  Also, we highly recommend the Elephant and Castle Restaurant in Castle Bar area for a reasonably priced, fun dining destination.  Also, the Shelbourne is walking distance to ""No Name Bar"", a trendy drink spot.",5,2009,09,20
207,"Great location, service & attention to detail","We had a wonderful 5 night stay at The Shelbourne.  My husband and I were celebrating our 4th wedding anniversary and we could not be happier with our stay.  The location of this hotel is excellent.  It is located across the street from St. Stephen's Green and just a block and a half from the aircoach stop (www.aircoach.ie) which is the coach service that takes you to and from the airport for €14.  We arrived on an early morning flight and were able to check in early, even though check in should have been later that afternoon.  Our room was large and comfortable and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud.  They had complimentary robes, slippers, etc. as expected from a hotel of this caliber.

The concierge was extremely helpful both with information about things to do in dublin as well as recommended an outstanding tour of the Wicklow Mountains.  He took care of making the reservation for us while we were out an about exploring Wexford (a little town 2.5 hours from Dublin by train).  The train station is only a 15 minute walk so you can easily take the train to other parts of Ireland in the morning and be back in the evening for a good night's rest.  This is what we did one day and we highly recommend it.  It is a great way to explore beyond Dublin.  Dublin itself is not a large city so you can easily access most tourist attractions by foot.  

The hotel itself was superb, as expected.  We started of our days with their complimentary breakfast in the Saddle Room.  The service was excellent and the food was tasty.  I also recommend trying the other restaurants/bars located at the hotel, which are frequented not only by guests at the hotel but also locals and tourist alike.  We had drinks both at the No. 27 Bar & Lounge and the Horseshoe Bar as well as coffee and dessert at the Lord Mayor's Lounge.  This was a great way to end our busy days and relax before going to bed.  Because we stayed at The Shelbourne using our Marriott Reward points (Gold Elite) we had access to The Heritage Lounge where they had appetizers and desserts from 5:30-7:30PM daily as well as complimentary WiFi.  This was a great treat.  There are also many good restaurants so we had no problem finding both local and international cuisine to enjoy.  

Overall The Shelbourne met our expectations with its great location, service and attention to detail.  It has an old world charge to it which we loved.  By the way, don't miss out on the great little treats they on front desk in the afternoon.  It varies daily from brownies to carrot cake!  They even have a little note with the recipe for you to take home.",5,2009,09,18
207,Fabulous Renaissance property -- highly recommend,"The service at this hotel is impeccable, from the valet to the front desk to the concierge.  A+ in all catagories!  The rooms are beautiful, modern, and tastefully decorated.  Everything about this hotel is perfect, including the prime location right on St. Stephen's Green.  We capped off a two-week journey through Ireland at this hotel and could not have hoped for a better way to spend our last few days.  I highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure travel.",5,2009,09,13
207,"Beautiful Hotel, Shoddy Service","I stayed here with my husband for two nights and thought that the hotel was beautifully decorated.  Our room was large and delightful, with a comfortable bed, luxurious bathroom, and crisp exquisite sheets.  

Notwithstanding the beautiful amenities, the service was not of the caliber I would expect at such a hotel.  We arrived incredibly early and decided to sit in the lounge, drink some coffee, and decide what to do with our stay.  As it was our honeymoon, we thought it would be nice to have a room facing the green.  My husband travels for work quite often and we decided to use his marriott reward points to book our stay.  He asked the man working that the reception desk if having a room facing the green would be possible and he answered that it ""certainly would not be possible"" because people who had those rooms had ""paid 450 Euro"" for those rooms, we had used points not Euros.  This comment shocked both of us as he frequents marriott hotels often, spending weeks at a time at other marriott locations.  We felt, at that point, that they considered our stay to be more lowly than that of a ""paying"" customer.  When we asked another receptionist about his comment, she dismissed it, but it left a negative impression on us and on that hotel. 

We also noticed that the service here was not very friendly nor was the concierge very knowledgeable.  We asked how to get to the Guinness Factory and the Kilmainham Jail by bus, not the tourist hop-on-hop-off bus, and he had NO CLUE.  Neither did anyone know the correct price of the fare, nor were they able to tell us that there were day or weekly passes available.  I don't understand how people in service do not readily know this information.  Overall, it seemed to us that the concierge and receptionists did not really care about our experience in Dublin, rushing us away and making our questions seem tedious and redundant.  It was our first trip to Dublin, so of course, we knew nothing about the city - the staff at this hotel certainly did not help in making us feel welcome.",3,2009,09,12
207,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","This hotel is ideally located for sightseeing, shopping and nightlife.
We stayed for a total of 3 nights, one upon our arrival in Dublin and 2 nights prior to our departure.
The staff is very friendly and attentive but we were surpirsed to find there was no turndown service.  We would expect thisin a 5 star hotel. Every room does not have 2 sinks in it.  There are several rooms with 2 sinks but you must  request it.
Also the tub is very slippery when stepping in .  
There are 2 bars which attract a lively crowd every night.
We would stay here again.",4,2009,09,12
207,"LOVED, the Shelbourne!!!","We are just back from our stay in Dublin where we spent 7 nights at the Shelbourne.

We went back and forth a million times on hotels - from staying in Ballsbridge at a less expensive B&B to staying at Brooks Hotel, to the Merrion, and finally settled on the Shelbourne.  Partly because of comments from people on TA forums, and partly because we are Marriott Rewards members and always have had consistent, extremely pleasant experiences with our stays.

The Shelbourne met and exceeded every expectation.  We booked at ""Queen"" room, and at 167E for 5 of the nights, I think got extremely good value.  We were upgraded to a Deluxe Room without asking, which was huge, which a very large bathroom, nice sitting area, large flat screen TV, ample closets, and bless them - an iron and ironing board, plus an umbrella.  The bed was very, very comfortable and the room was beautifully decorated with an old world charm but with every modern convenience.  Did I mention there was a phone in the bathroom?

Nervous about our arrival time, we showed up on their doorstep at 5:30am anyway, and I could have jumped for joy (but instead just collapsed on the bed) when the graciously gave us our room right then and there!

Every request was politely handled, even my ""off the wall"" request of the concierge to please find out what the paint color was in our bedroom, as it was just the shade of yellow I had been searching for to paint our kitchen!  Poor guy!!

The hotel is beautiful, but not at all stuffy or pretentious as I had worried.  Very welcoming and friendly.  We ate only our last day in the hotel for breakfast which was very good, with excellent, attentive service.  We also one night ordered room service dinner when my husband fell a bit ill, and although little was eaten under the circumstances, what was consumed was delicious.  We didn't venture into the bar or tea room, but it was always abuzz with people.

It should not go without noting that the location of the Shelbourne is superb, being smack dab in the middle of things, therefore an easy walk to anything you might want to see with perhaps the exception of Kilmainham, although it's not out of the realm of possibility if you don't mind walking.  Temple Bar, O'Connell St., Trinity, Nassau St., the Tourist Office, pubs and pubs and more pubs - all an easy walk.  Always felt quite safe at night as well.

It's quite handy to have the cabs available out front, the horse and buggy and buses across the street, the HO/HO stop across the street, and the Aircoach stop a block down Kildare where the hotel is located.  

To the left down Merrion are some great restaurants and pubs, Dawson St. has a very good assortment of bookstores and restaurants, and one street over is Grafton with it's great shops and more fine choices of restaurants.  St. Stephen's Green shopping center is just at the top of Grafton with a whole lot more to see.

Of course the added bonus is that St. Stephen's Green is just across the street, which gives the hotel an air of tranquility.  My husband commented how very quiet the room was.  We never heard a noise once we were in our room.

There is nothing that I would change about our stay here.  You cannot go wrong here.  We hope to be back soon and stay here once again.  Great memories.",5,2009,09,10
207,Great location - most comfortable bed I have ever slept on.,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights over the weekend with my husband and two friends.  I booked the rooms online with Marriott.com.  We booked 1 king room with breakfast included and one junior suite with breakfast.  I decided to treat my husband with the junior suite as it was our anniversary.  The suite was almost double the price of the king room and not worth the price.  It was big and very nice but nothing special and just not worth the money.  It is worth getting the breakfast included as it was quite tasty.  We preferred to sit in the bar and eat rather than the crowded dining room.

The hotel is in a wonderful location close to absolutely everything and right across from St Stephens Green if you fancy a jog in the morning.  All the bars and shops are right around the corner and everybody knows where the hotel is so its easy to find your way back.

The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful.  Avoid the concierge's recommendations for dining - not good at all!!!  We asked taxi drivers and found a wonderful Michelin starred restaurant down the street called L'Ecrivainn (book a table well in advance).

The best part about the hotel was the bed.  We have stayed all over the world, including countless Marriotts, and this was by far the absolute most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  We loved it so much, that we got back home and ordered the mattress, box spring, mattress topper and pillows online through the Marriott store.  It was just that good.  Our friends are planning to do the same.",4,2009,09,09
207,"Beautiful, Well Situated, Comfortable, and Fashionable","The Shelbourne Dublin was a wonderful experience!  We arrived at 8am after traveling well over 12 hours...we were welcomed by the kind reception staff who offered us refreshements upon our arrival...more importantly, had our room ready for us to check in!
The hotel is immaculately restored and breathtakingly beautiful!  
The hotel staff was helpful during our stay in helping to schedule day tours and provide us with information on local eateries.  The only unpleasant experience was the wait outside of the Saddle Room where breakfast is served every morning. I didn't realize one was expected to wait to be seated and when I seated myself I was rudly repremended by the host who explained to me that I should have waited to be seated.  This took me by surprise...I explained that I did wait...and when no one came to seat me within a reasonable amount of time...I seated myself.  Regretfully, I witnessed this same confussion with other guests during my seven-day stay.  So, if you stay at the Shelbourne...wait to be seated or suffer the embarassment of being told to wait.",4,2009,08,31
207,One of the best hotels I ever stayed in,"Everything about this hotel was first rate....from the top-hatted gentleman who parked our car, to the extremely friendly hotel front desk clerk who immediatly checked us in & gave us a complimentary glasses of lemonade and apples.  We felt pampered & welcomed here. The room was luxurious in every way...plasma tv...lemongrass soaps & conditioner....plush bathrobe...complimentary bath slippers & cushy pillows.  Breakfast was truly amazing....seated immediatly by smiling, friendly staff...coffee was delicious; freshly made to order french toast was divine.   Great fresh strawberries & homemade yogurt smoothies served at crisp, white linen tables with silver.  Hotel was sparkling, vibrant & staff was upbeat & eager to please.  We asked for a quiet room & it really was!  It was so quiet that we forgot we were in the middle of Dublin.  Great vibe.",5,2009,08,29
207,Fantastic Hotel - Most Comfortable beds on earth,"We absolutely loved The Shelbourne - our Heritage Park View room was fantastic and had literally the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  The staff was nice and attentive, the food and drinks great, and the location could not be better - everything in Dublin is within walking distance.  Bathroom fantastic as well.  Also it had air conditioning and a great tv with lots of channels which is a rarity for Europe!  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2009,08,21
207,Fantastic Experience,"We all give the Shelbourne an A+.  The rooms were wonderful.  Amazing beds.  The location perfect --  within walking distance of great sites and areas and across from a beautiful park.  The breakfast was included in our package and was delicious.  Most of all, the service was what one would hope for at a top hotel.  All in all, a perfect stay.",5,2009,08,18
207,Enjoyable stay,Hotel appeared recently refurbished. Breakfast very good. Very comfy bed and great location. Highly recommend.,5,2009,08,16
207,Magnificent Hotel,"My only regret about staying at the Shelbourne is that we only stayed for one night. The rooms were fantastic, the service was excellent and the hotel had been recently renovated. Probably one of the nicest Renaissance hotels I have stayed in anywhere in the world.",5,2009,08,15
207,Great experience all the way around,"Fantastic historic hotel in a great location. Friday night drinks in the No. 29 bar is very busy and a great way to meet local Dubliners.
Study up on which parts of the hotel are open and serving different things (food, drinks etc.) at  which times. Dublin City rules on this sort of thing and the multiple offerings at the Hotel can be a bit hard to follow.",5,2009,08,14
207,Really Liked this Hotel,"We stayed here one night after spending 9 days in Ireland.  I really liked the hotel.  The common areas were great.  The night we were there both bars were crowded and that was before a wedding got out.

The room was great and the bed was very comfortable.  You really can't beat the location and Dublin is a great city.",5,2009,08,13
207,A gem on the Green.,"Great location and still retains some of it's old world charm. Great bar to sit and have a drink or two. Lovely breakfast spread and quality service all round. Oh...and great beds, love those mattress toppers. The Shelbourne is hard to get out of your blood, once bitten.",5,2009,08,11
207,Great Place to Stay,"The staff, particularly the head concierge Denis O'Brien was a great help for us to have very enjoyable time in Dublin.The hotel is in agood location to geat around.The room was great and comfortable. Ellieen Derus Tours ,was very helpful in helping us get to Killarny.",5,2009,08,07
207,Great Rooms fabulous atmostphere,"Stayed over night for our 10 year wedding anniversary.  On check in we mentioned to the concierge that we were there for our wedding anniversary  just in passing.  Arrived back to our room to complimentary confectionary iced with happy anniversary.. a really nice touch.  In a room in the original part of the hotel over looking st stephens green, whcih was lovely.  There was a fantastic atmostphere in the hotel, with lots of people just mingling and chatting away.  Try the cocktails in the Horseshoe Bar.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Well worth an overnight stay.",5,2009,08,06
207,"thankfully, it was halfprice","Priceline sometimes has decent pricing. However, I suspect one also gets what one pays for. A long weekend in Dublin at the Shelbourne sounded like a grand experience. It was not.

Pluses: clean, good bed, convenient location.
Minuses: tiny room, very limited tv selection, no radio, no tub--just shower.

This renovated property has wildly popular bars/restaurants on the ground floor. The rest of the place seems unremarkable. I am not sure why anyone would chose to stay there if they had spent a night there before.",3,2009,08,02
207,Beautiful hotel pity about the staff,"We booked the Shelbourne in Dublin for two nights while waiting for our tour to start. The rooms were beautifully furnished with the most comfortable beds we enjoyed for the whole holiday. The breakfast was very nice with a wide choice in a lovely dining room.. The waiters were all European Hungarian, Romanian Etc.  and didn't really want to be waiting tables.  We were disappointed that there were no Irish staff as i'm sure they would have been more welcoming.  All in all it was lovely but very pricey for the service we received.  It was right in the heart of Dublin across the road from the gardens so it was marvellous from that point of view.",3,2009,08,02
207,Beds more comfortable than home.,"Our stay last week at The Shellbourne was fabulous. Denis O'Brien, the head concierge, treated us like we were long, lost friends. He arranged several outings for us and was a master multi tasker. Declan O'Brien, the doorman, welcomed us and was friendly and warm whenever we ran into him during our stay. This hotel is more than what we expected. Our room was comfortable and newly renovated. We didn;t have much of a view but we were always out and about anyway. Our service there was outstanding, whether we were in the bar or having breakfast in our room. The hotal was convenient to everything. I would recommed new visitors to use the Hop on and Hop Off Green bus that is located just a block away from the front entrance of the hotel. It gives you an overview of the city and allows you to get on and off the bus as you like. We had exellent valet parking experiences and appreciated the amenities in our room. The only thing I can say that might be negative was the 20Euro for internet access. A little steep. But if that's the only criticism I have...that's pretty good. We will be back next year for sure.",5,2009,07,25
207,Fabulous stay at the Shelbourne!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Shelbourne.  It had the perfect mix of classic and modern.  Two things really MADE our stay: one, we were permitted to check-in early (around 9am) after our trans-atlantic flight; two, we were upgraded to a larger room with a gigantic bathroom.  We loved the room and the bathroom was unbelievable, probably one of the best I've ever stayed in!  Also, the location is perfect-- across the street from St. Stephen's Square and close to the Trinity College.
The only downside: you can hear the person above you through the ceiling.  We were fortunate that whoever stayed upstairs didn't move around very much so it wasn't an issue.  If I were to stay here again, I would ask to stay on the top floor.",5,2009,07,24
207,Woudn't Want to Stay Anywhere Else,"Stayed seven nights.  Rooms clean and comfortable.  Enjoyed having Afternoon Tea (we chose hot chocolate instead) delivered to our room , early-bird evening meal 6-7pm was 18.50 per person for two courses (24.50 for three).  Wonderful staff in every way!  Very helpful with everything we needed (tickets, directions, tours, extra items for a young child, another room key...)  you need it, they'll get it.  We very much enjoyed reading about the hotel and then exploring it.  One staff member even took us on an impromptu tour adding a few more details than the book provided. (The book is in your room).  We appreciate all that was done for us.  
Only thing we would change was the problem with the ""stay nights get night free"" promotion.  There was a 10 euro difference because we stayed on a weekend night.  Because of that difference, they would not honor the promotion.  We were told upon check-in we would recieve two free nights.  At check-out they only honored one. 
TIPS:  see the mummies at St. Michans, take the ""green"" bus tour and stay on for the enitre tour (great way to start/end vacation) make sure you sit in a top corner seat, want to see an original book at Trinity College?--make a ""reading"" appointment for anything you want to see and they'll get the book for you, walk the city and stroll St. Stephens Green (great play ground for children).  Bring an umbrella!  Have a great Trip.",5,2009,07,22
207,Loved the Shelbourne!,"We just returned from a long (nearly three week) vacation in Paris, Western Ireland and Dublin.  We stayed in one of the suites and found our accompdations to be very comfortable.  I loved the sheets and bedding.  I hadn't slept that well in several weeks.   Our room was beautiful and overlooked the park.

The hotel went above and beyond our expectations in many ways.  When we checked in Friday night we called needing a sitter for Saturday night to go out with friends that were checking into the hotel.  We noticed in the information book that we needed to book with 48 hours notice.  I called the concierge and they actually called the person who typically handles the agency the hotel uses at home to see if there was anything they could do.  Saturday morning we received a phone call and voila, one of the hotel employees who was also a certified babysitter was available!  She was fabulous!  We'd actually met her in the hospitality lounge the night before where she had been playing with a little girl and she even remembered our son!  The kids really liked her.  She played games with them and even asked room service to send up chocolate chip cookies on a plate with ther names written in chocolate!  

The only downside to the stay was the restaurant waitstaff.  The food was excellent, but on occasion the waitstaff seemed surly and impatient.  I think they could deifnitely work on this...

Next time we go back to Dublin, we'll definitely stay at the Shelbourne.    It was a lovely trip!",5,2009,07,17
207,Awesome!,"We stayed at the Shelbourne the first night of our honeymoon.  There were three things which made the Shelbourne so great.  First, it was free, as I used up some Marriott points I had collected.  Second, we arrived at the hotel from our red-eye flight at 6:20 AM.  By some stroke of luck, they had a room available and let us check in, allowing my wife and I three hours of quality sleep before we hit the town to sight see.  Third, the hotel is luxury all the way.  Bed was fantastic.  Room was clean.  Bathroom, and shower pressure, great!  It was a lovely stay.  Not being made of money, I probably would not splurge if I was paying out of pocket for the hotel, however, we enjoyed our 1 night there immensely.",5,2009,07,10
207,"History, Luxury, Location","Just spent three wonderful nights at this stately and historic property in the heart of one of Europe's oldest capitals. Character abounds with no compromise to luxury thanks to the recent meticulous renovations. If it's Scandinavian Modern design with glass and steel you're after than look elsewhere, but most visitors to this area should appreciate what the Shelbourne has to offer. This building is celebrating its 185th year after all.

Lobby staff always eager to help with any query and while they're at it will even offer you a freshly baked treat or refreshing drink! Rooms are well appointed, tastefully understated yet still opulent. Beds couldn't be more comfortable as you drift away enveloped in soft cotton and feathers. 

Location is unsurpassed, within walking distance to all top attractions in City Centre. By just crossing the street, you can begin a stroll through beautiful St. Stephen's Green. 

Can't wait for my next visit.",5,2009,07,07
207,Overpriced and overrated,"For such an expensive and hyped up hotel I should have had lots to say about it, but I don't! It was not a memorable experience. There was nothing too wrong with it, but it was just dissappointing considering how well respected it is. The hotel layout is not very nice considering it only recently got refurbished. The lobby is hidden away in the back and you have to come through a small hall between the 2 bars to get to the lobby and rooms. The hall can be cluttered if the bar is busy. The rooms were clean but a bit boring from a decor point of view.
Just not worth the money to be honest. The Merrion Hotel around the corner has a lot more style and charm for the money.",3,2009,07,06
207,Great Location--but don't try to bring a car,"We enjoyed our stay at the Shelbourne very much with a couple of serious issues. First, if you are driving into Dublin, beware the one-way streets. Getting to the valet parking spot in front of hotel is a nightmare for unsuspecting out-of-towners. There is an unusual one-way street configuration that requires an elaborate meander around the hotel. After several tries and about an hour, we finally figured it out. BTW, our GPS was not helping the situation--apparently the City fathers change the one-way directions on the streets near the hotel frequently, so beware. In fact, DON'T BRING A CAR. It takes 30 minutes for the valet to bring the car around to the front of the hotel--you must call in advance.  The location is great--so just plan to walk, or take a taxi or public transportation, which is excellent. 

Another very annoying thing was the price of the internet service--exhorbitant! In a tech-savvy country like Ireland, internet service at a 5-star hotel should be INCLUDED. 

Other than that, the hotel was great, and it has the added interesting feature of being very historic. The concierge let us take a peek at the room where Michael Collins et al drafted the Irish constitution...and we got to sit in his chair.

Our room was lovely, the bathroom was deluxe, the staff was very helpful. 

The expensive internet service and automobile difficulties make  our ranking of this hotel a 4.",4,2009,07,05
207,Impressive Hotel,"We stayed two nights at the Shelbourne and were thrilled with everything.  The location was perfect.  It was close to everything, but quiet and peaceful (across from St. Stephen's Green).
The staff were very attentive, friendly and accommodating.  The rooms were clean, spacious and well equipped.  
The breakfast was one of the best we have ever had.  The buffet really gives a new meaning to breakfast.",5,2009,07,04
207,Seriously Overrated,"It would appear that this hotel has suffered in todays climate of the 'credit crunch'.  The doorman, in his top hat (perched ungainly to one side of his head) was literally moping the front entrance - this activity (& other activities) led to guests being required to carry in their own bags.  The concierge, purported to be on 24hr service, was no where to be found.  A request for ice had to be requested twice and eventually arrived one hour later &, when I asked reception why the used toiletries in the bathroom had not been replaced she queried if we had used the whole bottle!  As for the 'fluffy' bathrobes - they were so rough, heavy & starched I didn't have the strength, nor the inclination, to put them on.

Used glasses were not replaced, mini bar items were not replaced - even the room service breakfast menu was not replaced!  And the 'turn down service' (an integral part of service, not only in five star hotels but other good hotels), had to be requested - and then didn't happen!!!  Everything required a phone call to front desk or a personal visit.

Clearly this hotel has staffing/training issues and I would have enjoyed my stay more in a five star hotel that actually provided a five star service.  Other than the elegant bar, whose staff, in the main, seemed to know their craft, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

I would hope that the managers of the Marriott chain read this review and take the appropriate measures to ensure that five star costs receive five star service.  This is certainly not the case here & I would never return, nor recommend friends, to this hotel.",3,2009,07,02
207,"Location, Location, Location",We stayed here for a girly weekend.  We stayed in one of their standard rooms which was small but decorated beautifully. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in - it was devine.  The best thing about this hotel is the location.  It just can't be beat.  The down side was that there is no tea/coffee making facilities/complimentary water in the room.   We probably wouldn't have used them but it was just disapponting to see that these standard in-room facilities were not provided for.,4,2009,07,01
207,Good- but for the Bar,"We stayed in June 08 - the overall stay was good. The room was of a standard, almost expected from a hotel of this standard. The staff on reception were excellent. The breakfast was incredible!

However, the residents bar was most disappointing. This was the second time we had stayed at this expensive hotel, and had expected some kind of standard in the residents bar (we were there early in the evening- around 10pm both times). While we could expect the public Horseshoe bar to be rowdy, we were hoping to retreat to the residents bar for peace. The first stay we were subjected to a middle aged man roaring the song, 'Delilah', rowdily into his empty tonic bottle, staggering around and interupting the whole bar. The second time, we had to see a couple canoodling in a really inappropriate manner next to us. We are a couple in our thirties, and not easily shocked, by the way! It just seemed like there was no decorum here, as expected, from such a hotel. The staff seemed to turn a blind eye.",3,2009,06,27
207,The Hotspot of Dublin,"We stayed at The Shelbourne in November 2008. The hotel is very beautiful, the entrance was luxurious but at the same time felt very happening, thanks to The Saddle Room at the front part of the hotel, which seems to be the hotspot for drinks and rendez-vous in Dublin. The room was also lovely, it was not excessively spacious but still a good size. 

We were very impressed with The Shelbourne and would recommend it to friends going to Dublin. However, I didn't give it 5 points only for these reasons:

1. In-room internet was not free and the rates were quite extortionate. These days I would expect a high class business hotel to include Internet access as part of the services and facilities that just come with the room. 

2. The Saddle Room being very busy all the time, I understand there must be several incidents of drunken patrons trying to wander into the hotel. And the security staff do a great job at keeping them from entering the hotel part. However, I was a paying guest of the hotel, and I did not particularly like being checked if my name was on the list every time I entered my hotel in the evening. And as I had my room for the number of nights I booked, I also should be able to bring my friends up to my room without being scrutinized at the door. I totally understand the difficulty they must be having with such a popular bar in the hotel, but honestly, I have been to many 5 star hotels where the staff remembers your face and your name after you've checked in. 

3. Be careful with the minibar and the billing system for it. The minibar has slots for each can and bottle, and if you move them out of the slots to make room for your own drinks or snacks, the system will think that you have consumed whatever was moved. I had to clear this up with the receptionist at check out. He was aware of the situation immediately though, and corrected the bill very swiftly. Which explains it's a common occurrence. 

Despite these points though, I would stay at The Shelbourne again. The location is excellent, and when you tell people where you're staying, they either look impressed or surprised, which says a lot about the hotel!",4,2009,06,26
207,Fabulous relaxing stay,"My wife and I stayed this weekend at the Shelbourne Hotel for our anniversary we were treated like Royalty, nothing was too much trouble, the detail and the service were fantastic, the front office manager Paula who i want to mentione specifically was a delight, my wife was very impressed with the romantic swan arrangement and rose petals on the bed when we returned to our room after a fantastic dinner in the saddle room restaurant. The Dinner ranked as one of the best I have tasted anywhere in the world, the oysters were fantastic and the restaurant supervisor Geraldine was incredibly attentive throughout, the food and wine quality was first class, everything arraived perfectly as ordered and was delicious. This is our fourth stay at the Shebourne and it is a Haven in the middle of the city and highly recommended.",5,2009,06,21
207,Wonderful hotel and location,"We stayed in Dublin for 3 nights at the start of our trip to Ireland.  The location of this hotel is ideal, walking to great shopping, Trinity College and the Dublin Castle.  Great park just in front of the property, safe and fun to walk through.  Easy access to other tourist activities and a 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area and more great pubs and music.  Hotel was immaculate, greated with refreshments at the front desk. Rooms roomy and bright and well appointed.  Restaurant pricey but outstanding.  Mediocre exercise facility.  Complimentary wireless in Heritage Lounge, had trouble with access and hotel comped us room access for our entire stay.",5,2009,06,16
207,The Gracious and Welcoming Shelbourne,"Old world grandeur meets you at the front door of this historic hotel in a perfect central Dublin location.  After an efficient  and welcoming check in, we went directly to our room to relax after our long flight from the US.  The room was of average size with a king bed.  We asked for a view if possible, but  those rooms would be the premium, historic rooms facing the front of the hotel.  We were using Marriott buy three nights pay two offer, so we were not surprised to be assigned a less desirable room.  Bathroom was also average in size with marble and granite surfaces.  The tub shower combination was the only issue I had with the bathroom.  The tub surround is quite high with only a partial glass shower enclosure door to keep water off the floor.  It is difficult to step over and out, there is not much to hold onto and usually water will be on the marble floor!  Be cautioned.  We found a minibar in the console where the tv was located.  It was full of the usual items at the usual exhorbitant price, so we never used any.  Might have used the refrigeration for other items if there had been room.  Some hotels will clear out the minbar for that purpose if asked.  We were in the room for 8 nights June 2 through the 10th and were comfortable and had no noise issues.  The bedding seemed fairly new and  clean.  Housekeeping came by twice a day.  Turn down service at night was nice.  Enjoyed complimentary breakfast in the dining room on weekdays.  The Concierge lounge for Marriott loyalty members  was not able to serve breakfast there, but did provide the usual coffee, tea, soft drinks and cookies during the day.  Light appetizers from 5:30 to 7:30 and desserts from 7:30 to 10;00pm were provided.  The lounge is lovely with a great view of all the street action  outside the hotel and St. Stephen's Green directly across.  Getting to the lounge from inside the hotel is a bit inconvenient, but worth the walk!  Did not dine athe the hotel's restaurants, but noticed the menus posted and the expensive prices.  The hotel concierge staff were delightful and provided us with any information we needed.  I will conclude by saying we would certainly stay at the Shelbourne again.",4,2009,06,15
207,This grand hotel has seen better times.,"We were very eager to begin our Ireland vacation with three nights at the famous Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin.  We arrived--no doormen. We asked for concierge help and found it wanting. The business center had old equipment and charged guests for its use. The cost of food was ridiculously high given the great restaurants nearby. There's no questions that this is  a beautiful hotel with lots of amenities, but it didn't live up to our expectations. We then move to the Westin and found the service much better.",4,2009,06,08
207,Nice modern business hotel,Stayed here for 5 days during a conference. Very nice location in the centre of Dublin. Service and all other aspects of our stay were top of the line. Highly recomended for a stay in Dublin,5,2009,06,06
207,5 Star Hotel - Above and Beyond Service,"All of the previous positive reviews are accurate as is the website. This is an elegant hotel in an excellent location in Dublin. 

After 2 1/2 weeks in Ireland and Northern Ireland staying at a variety of accommodations the Shelbourne was an elegant way to end my visit to Ireland. After suffering with iffy showers it was wonderful to have an easy to use rain shower and to have a separate deep soaking tub. The elegant furnishings and large room with a comfy reading chair and matching hassock,  robe, and slippers  were luxurious to settle into after a long day of seeing the sites. 

On my last day in ireland I was too tired to go out so I ate dinner at the Number 27 Bar and Lounge off the foyer. I ordered from the early bird special menu (at 7pm)  and had wonderful sea trout. It was delicious and the staff was pleasantly attentive to a single woman dining alone.  

The evening before I was to leave Ireland I arranged a taxi tthrough the hotel concierge to take me to the airport at 6:30 a.m.and a wake up call for 5:45. At 5:30 I was surprised to receive a call saying the concierge had just found out the taxis were going to strike at 7 am and he was concerned I might not get to the airport. He had made a special arrangement for a taxi to pick me up at 6:15 if I could be ready. Needless to say I was in the lobby before 6:15 to meet a charming Dubliner who drove me to the airport before the strike began. Before I left the hotel I wanted to thank the concierge but I couldn't find him in the flurry to leave. I plan to write to the hotel to express my thanks for this above and beyond service provided by a member of their staff.  

The Shelbourne is a wonderful hotel. I highly recommend it to anyone visitng Dublin. You won't be disappointed.",5,2009,06,04
207,Good stay at Shelbourne,"Very nice hotel in the heart of Dublin.  Easy access to all the sights of dublin.  Very expensive.   The room was a bit small and was dissapointed that the Heritage lounge did not serve breakfast and was not open weekends.  Other European Marriotts we have stayed at have been open 7 days, had free beer/wine and served some sort of Breakfast.

Expensive choice - but high class.  If I was going back to Dublin I may try another hotel the next time.",3,2009,06,02
207,beautiful! A touch of class,"we stayed at the shelbourne for a weekend away from the children for our anniversary. it was perfect! rooms more than comfortable, service was top class and food was amazing. The hotel bar was a great atmosphere serving tasty lunches and great for an afternoon drink or pre dinner drinks. we ate in the saddle room resturant which was one of the best meals i have ever had. Breakfast was unusually overpriced and therefore me and my husband walked 2 minutes along the road to a lovely Irish pub called Foley's which served an amazingly huge but cheap breakfast which was lovely. (dinner here was also fab!). Over all, a great weekend in an amazing location next to beautiful st stephens green!!",5,2009,05,09
207,lovely hotel,"I just returned from a 2-night stay and overall, it was wonderful. However, a 5-star hotel where there was neither an outlet to plug a hairdryer into nor exhaust fan in the bathroom? If you are not able to stay in a Heritage Room, I would try another of the luxury hotels. The regular rooms are perfectly generic and not worth it.
I arrived at 8 am on Sunday morning, not expecting to be given a room right away. However, I was told the hotel had been fully booked and no room would be available until early afternoon. I was not actually given a room until 1:30 and find it hard to believe that there was no room available any earlier. Considering the luxury status of the hotel, it would have been nice to have been offered breakfast rather than my wandering around the city, where no cafes were open until 9:00.",4,2009,05,08
207,Location-perfect,"Stayed for two nights in March. We got a good bed & breakfast deal with Superbreak. 
The hotel was lovely & the staff were friendly & helpful. It is pricey, but we found Ireland to be very pricey on this trip. The room we had was fairly compact, but the bed was extremely comfortable & the shower hot & powerful. You do pay for any extras but, hey it's a bit of a treat to stay somewhere a bit 'upmarket' & you get what you pay for I guess.I'd asy if you're prepared to splash the cash you'll be fine, but if you're watching the pennies go elsewhere.",4,2009,05,08
207,Loved everything,"My sister and I stayed three nights at the lovely Shelbourne Hotel.  Other than a silly priced breakfast (36 euros - we declined.... smile) it was a fabulous choice.  The room was very plush and although we had no view - into the back of the hotel block - it was actually wonderful because it was very quiet.  The service,  from the desk staff to the concierge to the bar staff to the housekeeping was outstanding.  We enjoyed both lovely bars and the small sitting area / cafe off the lobby.   You could walk to everything from there.  We also enjoyed the ""hop on/hop off"" bus which stopped right across the street.  If you are there for a few days,  do not buy from the bus,  but rather go to the tourist office to get a three day pass.  It is only 10 euros more and gives you the bus for three days as well as all the Dublin public transport included.  This was on the green bus but probably the others have something similar.  All our Irish friends were quite impressed that we were staying in the Shelbourne!",5,2009,05,06
207,Superior Shelbourne - Quietly Classy,"We have just returned from a fantastic weekend in Dublin which is a wonderful city and very impressive.
The Shelbourne is an outstanding hotel and we would have no hesitation in staying there again or recommending it to anyone. The decor, furniture, and general ambience are just wonderful and there is so much to look at and take in. It was like staying in a private stately home!
It is situated in a wonderful location overlooking St Stephen's Green and within easy walking distance of Dawson Street, Grafton Street, Temple Bar etc - we even walked back from Croke Park quite comfortably as the roads were heaving and it was quicker (and cheaper!) than taking a taxi.
Check in was very efficient with pleasant staff and a welcome offer of freshly squeezed orange juice and home made banana cake, which was delicious.
We stayed in a heritage room which was huge with the most comfortable bed ever, loads of squashy pillows and quality soft furnishings.
The bathroom was equally impressive with a lovely deep bath, seperate shower cubicle and seperate toilet.
Free tea and coffee was included (a kettle and fresh milk and cups were bought promptly to your room on request) as was a very good shoe shine service.
We also had access to the Heritage Lounge which overlooked the Green and made for fantastic people watching although we seemed to be unlucky with our timings as there never seemed to be any food left in the serving dishes other than the odd biscuit. You also get free internet access here.
The one downside was the horrendously expensive breakfasts (although to be fair the exchange rate doesn't help) at 32 euros for a full english breakfast. From memory I believe that even the cheaper continental breakfast is around 25 euros.
We choose to head into town instead and can thoroughly recommend the Gotham City Cafe which does fabulous home made breakfasts, not of the greasy spoon variety either - more homemade porridge with banana and maple syrup and poached eggs with bacon on homemade bread - all delicious and worth a try.
Loved the Shelbourne and Loved Dublin (especially Cafe en Seine) - do go as you won't be disappointed!",4,2009,05,05
207,Simply The Best !,"We stayed in the Shelbourne Hotel for 2 weekend nights. From the moment we entered the hotel until we left it earlier today, we were continuously impressed by everything. The friendliness of the staff, the quality of the service, the quality of the food and drink, simply the best. We asked friends and family to join us on Saturday afternoon for ""Afternoon Tea"". Again just wonderfully delicious food and good value for 9 people, just over €150, with as much tea, coffee, beautiful sandwiches, scones, cakes, deserts, etc. We were so imporessed, we bought my in-laws a weekend to the Shelbourne for my father in law's birthday. We will be back, as often as our budget will allow !!!",5,2009,05,03
207,Visiting Ireland and staying at the Shelbourne was wonderful,"I visited Dublin for a 4day business meeting and I can confirm that ""Baile Atha Cliath"" as its called in Irish, was great to visit. The Shelbourne hotel with its wooden floors and ornate interiors was a nice place to stay and travel to local sightseeing spots was convenient. Once can visit old pubs, guinness beer factory (I dont drink but the visit was informative) and also landmarks like the Anna Livia (lying down) statue fountain on O'Connell street.
I would defininitely recommend staying at the Shelbourne in Dublin.",4,2009,04,23
207,Shelbourne was awesome!,"My family of five just stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights over Easter weekend.  It was fabulous.  We had 2 interconnecting rooms at a rate of 149 euros per night per room, including VAT.  We arrived at 10 AM and one of our rooms was ready.  We  went up to drop our luggage and minutes later the front desk lady arrived with the connecting door room key.  The hotel was very comfortable and quiet, we never heard any noise.
     Our rate was for Marriott Rewards members and included full buffet breakfast for the 5 of us.  It was in the Saddle Room- beautiful room, incredible selection.  The hotel had a great location - right across from St. Stephen's Green and a short walk to Grafton St.
     Highly recommend.  All staff we encountered were professional and friendly.",5,2009,04,20
207,"Great hotel, even better location","We stayed over the long Easter weekend at the Renaissance Shelbourne Dublin and it was very nice.  First, I would look into getting the ""Dublin Pass"" at the airport.  It allows a free shuttle from the Airport to the City and offers free Access and VIP access to multiple attractions including Guinness, Jameson and the Dublin Castle and several museums.  Well worth it.  
The hotel sits on a great location: the heart of St. Stevens Green and minutes from multiple tour bus and local bus stops.  there are shops and pubs/restaurants galore and within 15 minutes of walking you can be almost anywhere in the city.  Dont take cabs: they are a rip-off and Dublin is very clean, safe and a great walking city.  
The hotel rooms were well appointed, the bathrooms modern and the beds were extremely comfortable.  you can tell they put their renovation $s to good use when Marriott bought this property 2 years ago.  the Horseshoe bar within the Hotel is famous and one of the oldest bars in the city.  We didnt eat at the hotel, as most who come to dublin want to savor true authentic Irish cuisine and not your run of the mill standard hotel food, although the restaurant did look real good; a bit on the expensive side however.  For those who are coming over from the states, to both the left and right hand sides of the hotel, about 3-4 min down are a US version of a 7-11 where you can go to stock up on pre-made sandwiches, booze, water and other stuff.  
The Concierge level on the 3rd floor was hard to find but the view was great.  I would highly recommend taking the Guinness Brewery tour and also using the green bus ""the Dublin bus tours""  right outside the hotel.  they come every 10 minutes and its on/off as many times as you want for 15 euros. the guides gave some great ideas for pubs and other eating/drinking establishments. Have a great time in Dublin, we did!",4,2009,04,14
207,Truly a Gracious and Pleasant Place to Stay,"We arrived at the Shelbourne around noon and were immediately checked into our room. The room was beautifully decorated, with furnishings I would have been happy to have in my home.  The room had plenty of space for the two of us.  Although there was no view (and the rate we paid never led me to believe I would get one!), the room was off the street and very quiet, with lots of natural light.  I really appreciate the individual heat/air controls.  

There were two robes and two sets of slippers.  Plenty of room for storage if your trip will be more than a few days.  A safe designed to hold a laptop.  All the standard amenities, except there was no coffee pot.  The room and bathroom were spotless, the housekeeping staff very discreet and out of the way.

The reception and concierge went out of their way to be cordial.  They helped with all the details.  Marta, in particular, was friendly and helpful.  We loved the tasty treats at the reception desk everyday.

The location was just a few steps from St Stephen's Green, a marvelous place to enjoy the sunshine and flowers.  We took a picnic lunch here one day.  Lots of galleries and restaurants in the area.  We intended to have lunch or dinner at the hotel, but got caught up in other places and never did.

We had afternoon tea in the Lord Mayor's Lounge.  What a treat!  Everything was tasty, the presentation beautiful, and the service attentive, yet not hovering.  They accommodated our special request without a blink.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a lovely stay in Dublin.  

Just as a mention- we must have had older beds.  Although not uncomfortable, they were not the normal Renaissance/Marriott quality.  Great pillows, though!",5,2009,04,11
207,A Fine Grande Dame....Especially in the Deluxe Rooms,"I stayed a few nights on a Marriott promotional which included an upgraded king deluxe and breakfast buffet in the Saddle Room.  I fully agree with other reviewers about the wonderful quality of the food and service in the Saddle Room, and also about the buzz and vibe in the hotel's bars, which is a real plus if the weather is especially crummy and you don't wish to venture out.

I'm a notoriously light sleeper but slept wonderfully at the Shelbourne, as the staff was great about honoring my request for a room in a quiet area.  Because of the modern HVAC, you can select your temperature and fan speed, which isn't common in older European hotels.  The deluxe rooms are significantly larger and are worth the extra dollars, especially with multiple people in the room.  The decor is warm and rich, which can be a welcome end after a day of dreary weather, and the beds quite plush.

Other pluses included a gracious and truly excellent reception staff and a very accomodating team in the restaurant.

My slight niggles were the lack of a whirlpool, steam, or sauna and passable but unexceptional maintenance standards.  Housekeeping was excellent, but wear and stains in high-traffic areas are managed more to 3.5 star Marriott standards than to a 5 star standard you expect at the Four Seasons, which was my runner-up, but the Shelbourne has a far better location and I'd much rather foot a city like Dublin than hire a sedan.  Great charm, great food, great bars, great location, and close enough to perfect to earn a high score.",5,2009,04,07
207,Most Comfortable Bed in Ireland,"The Shelbourne Hotel is a beautiful building in an excellent location right across from the beautiful park, St. Stephen's Green.  Breakfast was not included in our rate and after seeing the cost, which was 21 euro for the cold buffet and 29 euro for the full buffet, we opted to walk just down the street to the St. Stephen's Green Shopping Centre where we had a wonderful breakfast at Kylemore on the 2nd floor overlooking the park at a great price (around 10 to 15 Euro for 2 people depending on your selection).  We could walk to the Temple Bar area in about 15 to 20 minutes and Grafton Street is right around the corner.  We traveled in Ireland for 15 days staying in 9 different places and I do have to say that the bed in the Shelbourne was absolutely the most comfortable in all of Ireland.  I would without a doubt stay here again.  To sum it up....Great Location, Great Historic Building, and WONDERFUL BED!!",5,2009,04,07
207,classic luxury hotel,"Excellent stay at this great hotel. Staff friendly and efficient, lovely rooms and great location. Evening meal and breakfast very good.",5,2009,03,29
207,A Dublin landmark,"We stayed for four nights using Marriott (platinum) points.  We have to guess at value, since we didn't pay.  The room was small and looked out only on the side of another building.  The hotel itself could use a little sprucing up, e.g. the hall carpets on our floor.  The staff was welcoming and helpful.  We had a super breakfast buffet in the dining room during the week--thanks to the Platinum level--the executive lounge was closed on the weekend.  The hotel's location is convenient.",4,2009,03,26
207,Lovely hotel!,"We stayed here for 2 night and it was great! The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to everything, it is beautiful and the staff was wonderful. The bar is a lot of fun at night, as well.",5,2009,03,26
207,refurbished but still lovely,"My family has been staying at the Shelbourne for many years. We knew the doormen and requested favorite rooms. The hotel closed for two years after Marriott bought it and did massive renovations to the 185 year old hotel. While we preferred the hotel in it's older version, it is still lovely. We have been upgraded upon both of our two recent stays. I can not have gluten and they have accommodated me wonderfully. They even have a gluten free high tea with cupcakes and all! The price is dear; but  you will understand why Yeats, Joyce, DeValera, and Michael Collins preferred to stay and do their work at the Shelbourne. It is truly inspiring.",5,2009,03,22
207,Lovely Hotel in the heart of Dublin,I stayed for 5 nights and this is a very beautiful and historic hotel.  The rooms are a tad small but lovingly redone.  The service is great and the bar downstairs is very charming and buzzing.  No free internet in the rooms which was too bad.,5,2009,03,20
207,Great stay at the Shelbourne!,"We stayed at the Shelbourne this week and had an excellent experience.  Our upgraded Hertiage wing room was ready for early check-in at 8:30am on Saturday after our early AM arrival from the states.  The service was top notch, with turn down and chocolates nightly.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was incredibly spacious.  The Heritage lounge was also beautiful; however, the opening hours and appetizer and beverage choices left a lot to be desired.  Still can't complain though, since the rate we paid was less than other area hotels that didn't even have such a lounge.  All and all a great stay!",5,2009,03,11
207,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"I'm staying at the Shelbourne for a month for work, and couldn't be happier.  The rooms are gorgeous and very spacious (although I believe I do have an upgraded room in their ""Heritage"" wing).  The rooms are nicely decorated and look elegant and classic, but still thankfully have lots of the modern amenities (flat screen tv, completely updated baths with separate tub and shower, etc).  

We've tried the food in the restaurant, which is excellent, and the bar scene at ""27"" is nice too.  

The location on St Stephens Green is close to eating, drinking, and shopping.  Grafton St for shopping is a few streets down, and we found plenty of food/pub choices right outside the door.

Possibly the best thing about the hotel though is the outstanding service.  As I said, we're staying for a month, so that could've played into all the extra personal attention we received, but we found everyone at this hotel to be extremely helpful and welcoming.  Everyone has given us excellent tips on places to eat and hang out at after work, and the staff are constantly asking what they can do to make our stay even better.

The only negative we've encountered was with the valet parking.  It took > 45 minutes to get our car one morning, which was definitely irritataing as we had to be at work for a meeting.  However, the manager quickly apologized, and we just parked the car ourselves the rest of the time.  (There's no onsite parking, but we parked in the Dawson Parking Garage, which was 1.5 blocks away...I believe its where the hotel valet parks the cars as well...very easy).

Overall, the Shelbourne is a fantastic hotel and if I come back to Dublin in the future for work or pleasure, I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else!",5,2009,03,05
207,Luxury Stay,"I just got back from staying at the Shelbourne, all I can say is that the staff is way above the industry standard.  Not only were they so helpful, but they seemed as if they truely enjoyed helping the traveler..  It pays to travel when no one else is,because you are treated like royalty.   This hotel is in a great location.  I loved how we walked 3 blocks and were on Grafton street.",5,2009,02,24
207,A wonderful hotel but not truly five star,"I really really wanted to give the Shelbourne a fantastic review, I love this hotel and it is a true Dublin Landmark and a beautiful building. This is the first time we have stayed since the refurbishment and whilst I can't complain about the decor I feel the levels of service left a lot to be desired.

We arrived at check in at 6pm in the evening with a toddler and a baby, there was no one else at check in but even still it took about twenty minutes to complete. I had contacted the hotel directly to make the booking as i wanted a one bedroom suite with an interconnecting room for my children which they said would be guaranteed, at check in my husband confirmed our room preference and we were told yes that's what we had so imagine our surprise when entering the suite we found that the connecting door was not open, they had put my children on the other side in a double room on their own with no interconnecting door!!

I went immediately to reception and it was a total farce trying to sort it out, first they tried to fob me off saying they couldn't guarantee room preference, i produced the e-mail from their reservations confirming my request and that we would have the rooms requested, they then tried to tell me we couldn't have the interconnecting room as there were two guests arriving tomorrow and they wanted twin beds and our interconnecting room was the only one with these beds....! I asked to see a manager and we eventually got it sorted but it was 1.5 hours later which was just not acceptable!

They did send us a bottle of water and some chocolates to apologise. The rooms were beautiful, they were some of the older ones with high ceilings and elegant decor, we had wonderful views overlooking the green and a lovely sitting area.

We had room service that evening and the food was great however we ordered a bottle of red and they only brought a half bottle, it then took them half an hour to replace the half bottle with a full one!!! This happened again during our stay and mistakes like this are just sloppy and not what you expect in a hotel of this standard.

We had breakfast each morning in The Saddle Room, this restuarant has been refitted beautifully, it has a lovely feel to it and it is very inviting. Again the food was fantastic but the service was a joke, on each occassion we had to wait ten minutes to be seated and then it was just bad service, tea delivered with no milk, toast with no butter, no orange juice, a cold hot chocolate etc, just sloppy.

We also had dinner in The Saddle room and the food was outstanding but again bad service, our wine order took 30 minutes to arrive. The one thing I will say although the service was bad the staff were so very pleasent and smiling.

The atmosphere in the hotel is great and we had late drinks there one night and it was lovely, I love the hotel and the location but service issues just becoming annoying and detracts from your stay, the previous month we had stayed at The Hassler in Rome and I'm sorry but the service in The Shelbourne doesn't even come close to this. I don't think the Marriot Group is the right brand for this hotel as they don't seem to be able to provide the finishing touches which should make the Shelbourne a true five star hotel and is what this ""Grand Old Dame"" of Dublin deserves.",4,2009,02,16
207,Just a wonderful experience,"We booked a three day reservation on priceline and bid for a five star hotel.  The price was very good and the hotel was exceptional.  It had been recently renovated and everything about it was first class.  Also, it is a local landmark directly across from St. Steven's Green and it was apparent that it was a local social site for the Dublin regulars which made it even more comfortable.
Particular praise should be given the concierge, Denis O'brien.  He and his staff were unbelievable.  They always treated us as if we were the most affluent guests in the hotel.
Wonderful suggestions for pubs, sites and formal dining.  Thank you Denis for making our stay in Dublin so memorable.",5,2009,02,16
207,In the heart of it,"My wife and I had a great stay in the Shelbourne although I was a little taken aback by the charge for connection to the net at €20 per day when a lot of other luxury hotels advertise free wifi.plus the parking charge of €25 per day this is the first time I have had to pay for car parking at any hotel.Other than those minor points, we had a fantastic two night stay.Hotel staff will actually fall over themselves to help you, every staff member was friendly and smiling,and only to willing to assist. The hotel is perfect for a city break with everything on the doorstep.This is not a cheap hotel but nice for a special occasion  I do hope to return in the future as the time just passed to quickly on our visit.",5,2009,02,08
207,Wonderful Hotel,"We had a lovely three day break in Dublin, and the Shelbourne helped make it even nicer.  

Check-in:  Flawless

Room:  Wonderful beds, toiletries, all perfect

Housekeeping:  I am really picky and found everything as it should be.  Immaculate bath.

Staff:  Friendly and helpful

Location:  Perfect for tourists.  My daughter found it perfect for shopping, too.

ONE COMPLAINT (If you are reading, Shelbourne, I hope you change things)  There was no tea service in the room.  I was very disappointed.  When I come back from a long day of touring, I like to put my feet up and make a cup of tea.  I don't want room service bothering me, I just want to make a cup of tea.  At checkout I mentioned this and they informed me I could have tea service for the duration of the stay for a fee.  (I don't remember what, but I don't think there should be any fee at all- the hotel is pricey enough.  We've stayed at many four and five star hotels across Europe.  Almost all offer a complimentary tea/coffee service.)",5,2009,01,27
207,Best bed in the world,"I'm a bit of a hotel snob when it comes to comfortable beds.  Love W's, Westins and Ritz Carlton's.  This bed was the best bed I have ever stayed at anywhere in the world.

High tea was very nice too.",5,2009,01,09
207,Great Place fab Hotel Excellent staff,"Brillant time in this old hotel in Dublin on the Stephens green 
Its expensive but it's a treat, rooms are lush, service is 100% dining experince is mouth watering breakfast is to die for 
Well Done",5,2009,01,04
207,Very Irish atmosphere,"Stayed in the hotel twice this year. I love its livelyness, happining kind of atmosphere. It is in the very center of Dublin, lots of Irish people use it as a veneu and it has its charm for it. It is NOT a quite place at all! The restaurant is excellent and the rooms are very nice. The staff is very good. Loved it!",5,2008,12,25
207,Shelbourne atmosphere and luxory,"Visited the Shelbourne for a birthday treat, and I couldn't fault it.  Lovely Xmas atmosphere and great central location for shopping.  Strongly recommend it. The bar does lovely food and we had a delicious lunch there.",5,2008,12,23
207,Perfectly Posh,"I stayed at the Shelbourne for four nights while visiting Dublin for the first time. It's in an ideal location-- walking distance to Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green park, Trinity College and many other sites in Dublin. 

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. It was great that they mailed my postcards at no cost, that was a nice touch. 

I was traveling with a friend and we stayed in a room with two beds. The room was a decent size and the bathroom was very clean and modern. I travel a lot for business so I'm fairly picky about hotels. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to those on business as well as leisure trips.",5,2008,12,19
207,"Good Landmark Hotel, but?","Having heard and read only the good things about the Shelbourne Hotel, which is managed by the Marriott-owned Renaissance brand we have decided to brave it and booked a room, folks! Here are our views on what we found:

1.) Positive:

Our room nr. 356 with Heritage Club Lounge access, which was really nice and comfortable with a Hotel side view to the outside, big new bed, even bigger bathroom with Kohler appliances, fully marbled, big TV, fully stocked mini-bar, large size and art on the wall. At our evening we had roomservice which was very good indeed. The Heritage Club Lounge was large and had snacks and drinks provided all day with a view over St. Stephens Green Park which was very well chosen as a location for this lounge. They even offer irish books in the lounge to read while you eat or drink! Evening at the lounge provided nice snacks and drinks. The next morning the breakfast was larger than usual in lounges which must be applauded. The Giftshop was well stocked in the hotel. The location of this hotel is just superb and the free lemonade at check-in was just as good! We found also very good that in our room was a history of the hotel provided. 

But was it all luxury or more luxury gloss?

2.) Need improvement to be a real Landmark Luxury Hotel:

Remember the Lemonade at check-in? While the taste was very good, the paper cup clearly wasn't! On their website they have claimed each Heritage room comes with Ermenegildo Zegna bath amenities, which was clearly not the case. Instead we got White Company products like in all other rooms incl. Standard!
The Hotel has also not CNN or a very big in-room dining choice after having seen the hotel in Sept. 2007 at their wedding show where we have also enjoyed a room tour at the time! Back then they had CNN and a bigger choice of meals on offer as roomservice. On another note of the appereance of the hotel which looks at least when you take just a casual look from the outside into the Bar like a normal pub! Having also seen that their menu for the Saddle Room Restaurant was very much uneven glued in the viewing platform before the hotel! We are clearly knowing this are only minor things for some people out there, but when you expect to stay at one of the best hotels in the whole country this is clearly not enough! The Heritage Lounge has no free alcoholic drinks even during their so-called Happy Hour in the evening, this means folks must pay for the drinks! But not the food!

BTW. at the moment we are writing this there is a campaign from the owners of The Shelbourne Hotel to elliminate the contract with Marriott's Renaissance brand. This is because as has been reported of miss-management of this property. However, when the owners are really serious about the status of The Shelbourne as a real Landmark Hotel for the whole of Ireland, they should probably look elsewhere then the too big Marriott Corporation!",4,2008,12,05
207,Gorgeous Hotel,"This hotel was absolutely stunning.  The rooms were fabulous as well as the lobby, bar,etc.  We chose to eat at a local breakfast place as the buffet was very pricey.",5,2008,11,26
207,Vastly Improved,"I stayed here in June 2007, just after it re-opened and had a terribly disappointing experience. It was so awful and so expensive I wrote a letter of complaint to the Customer Service Manager. They contacted me and sent me a voucher for one nights B&B to apologise. We went to stay again in Nov 2008 and had a fantastic time. The service has improved no end - with the Shelbourne now having dedicated residents areas - something that was not there before. It is a buzzing hotel with a huge passing trade that adds to its character but it is great to see that they don't forget their guests. The room was lovely and I could not  fault the staff who were extremely friendly and helpful. 
My recommendation if you are staying here though is to not bother with breakfast, it is very expensive (glad we weren't paying!) and you can just amble down the streets of Dublin to go somewhere for a fabulous brunch for half the price.",4,2008,11,25
207,"Loved, loved, loved this hotel","Out trip started at the front door of the hotel with a welcome greeting. Three days later the welcome did not falter with any member of staff.
Seldom have I stayed in a hotel where all staff get it right all the time.

We were 3 ladies travelling for a short break looking for  a hotel in a good location, offering comfort & service. 
The Shelbourne lived up to it's reputation. We had De Luxe rooms. They were what you would expect in hotel of this class. Everything you would want. the beds are a joy.
The Lord Mayors lounge is great for relaxing and the No 27 bar is busy & fabulous for people watching.

Breakfast was excellent.

We had considered a nearby hotel of the same standard. We visited it and all agreed the Shelbourne was the right choice for us.

The location is central and most things are walking distance.
Some superb restaraunts very close by.
Over the years I have stayed in more hotels than I care to remember however I would have no doubts about recommending this hotel. Unpretentious quality .",5,2008,11,21
207,At the heart of the city....,"I was lucky enough to stay in the Shelbourne Hotel, on a weekend when Dublin became even more alive (than it is usually) with a hugely anticipated rugby match between the New Zealand All Blacks and Ireland at Croke Park.

I arrived at the hotel mid afternoon - in the midst of a huge crowd of Irish rugby supporters - and whilst getting through the lobby to check in was not easy - once up to the room - it was a calm and peaceful place to be despite the ""organised chaos"" in the foyer.

No expense has been spared in the recent renovations but noting the other comments made earlier - it is worth paying the little bit extra to get the superior room - it was HUGE - and a bathroom with a bath to match !!!

The hotel was completely full on this weekend - and although stretched - the staff were always attentive and available - although not intrusive. OK, it took 10 minutes for the concierge to be available to collect my bag at the end of my stay  - but in the big scheme of things - this was a huge weekend for Ireland, Dublin, and the Shelbourne hotel - so 10 minutes out of my day - was not an issue. 

The food was not cheap - but of the quality expected in a hotel of this calibre - and done exactly as you ordered - no complaints there.

I have stayed virtually exclusively in Marriott hotels for 8 years, in lots of places - I can honestly say - this property is an absolute jewel in the Marriot portfolio !

I will definitely go back !!!",5,2008,11,17
207,Luxury in Dublin,"We also used Mariott points to book 2 nights here on the first weekend of November. From the moment you step through the tiny revolving doors, the place just oozes elegance and you know right away that things are going to be much more than their worth. Great location, about 2-3 mins walk to Grafton Street and very nicely decorated reception area. Also the residents lounge and the No. 27 bar are places you just have to sit and people-watch.

Rooms were excellent and one of the most comfy beds i've ever stayed in..i wanted to steal those sheets!

Concierge was OK, not too helpful when recommending places to eat ..""yeah there are alot of places to eat in Temple Bar..""

Paid £18 for two drinks at the No 27 bar on Sat night (Jamesons + mojito)..ouch!

If you have the money, its nice to stay here but there may be places just as good for a lower price. But yeah, id do it again..if we have the points.",4,2008,11,10
207,Lovely Dublin Hotel,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for two nights on the way back to the
States from a two-week vacation in Italy.  It was our first time
in Dublin, and this was a great place to stay for a short visit
to the city.  We hopped the on/off excursion bus down the street 
from the hotel and were able to see pretty much everything
we wanted to in one full day of sightseeing.
Our room was beautifully decorated, and located in a quiet back corner of the building.  
They have done a great job renovating this hotel--
the common areas are simply beautiful.  And the two
lobby bars are lively and fun, which is pretty much the case
with all of Dublin, as far as we could tell.  Great city, great hotel.",5,2008,11,03
207,5 stars but not special,"It was definitely 5 stars.  It didn't have any real problems.  But their wasn't really anything really exciting about it.  It was a nice as a Four Seasons.  They tried to accent their Irish heritage, but i wasn't that exciting.  Although I would definitely recommend having tea there.  That was a amazing experience.",5,2008,10,29
207,Lovely in every way,"We cashed in ""points"" for four nights at this luxury hotel, but even if we didn't have those points, this place would have been worth every penny.  The only disappointment was not having the room ready when we arrived from the airport and an exhausting overnight flight.  We really indulged in the huge bathroom, plush bathrobes, great location, and especially evening cocktails in the lobby lounge.  We were fortunate enough to have access to The Heritage Room, where a light breakfast, snacks and drinks were available to us each day.  In fact, we even extended our stay in Dublin because we enjoyed the hotel so much.  If you want to do it up and do it right, this is the place to do it.  I have only two complaints. One is that there were several issues with our key cards during the trip, and several times we had to go to the front desk to have them reprogramed. Very annoying. Second problem was that we often got weird looks, coming in the lobby in our less than snazzy clothes because the place was crawling with the rich and fashionable. Other than that, amazing, wonderful, great. I'd go back in a minute.",5,2008,10,19
207,"True Class and Luxury, except...","This is a Marriot property and I booked a Weekend Break from California on the phone through Marriot where you pay for two days and receive one free. Total cost including taxes and tips with an ailing Dollar was only $600 for three nights, but more on that later. This is a wonderful property. Go to the website and read about all of the history. It's location looked to be too far on a map from the night life downtown district, but that was not the case. We walked off our food and Guinness every night with no worries. This is the place to feel pampered. The top notch staff are very professional. Even a very young man from the former Soviet bock was so happy to be working there. An example of the service is when we wanted another smaller towel, they brought it right away and then phoned to make sure that it was correctly delivered. Another time, my personal pot of breakfast coffee was not hot enough and one raised finger brought a proper replacement. Always be kind and smile and you will receive the same. The hotel is THE PLACE for the 30-60 year old Irish, who want to be seen, to gather for drinks. Ask the concierge for tips about what to see in the city and you will not be disappointed. Try to book your room to include the breakfast, make that the $100.00 per couple breakfast, and you can eat well in the morning and then have a big dinner without lunch. I read that in reviews and it certainly worked for us every day. If your breakfast is included in your program, they still bring you a bill at every sitting for a signiture and so that you can add a tip for the staff. Bring nicer clothes to wear in such a fine establishment, but there is no dress code. The staff uniforms are formal, as is the dress of most of the visitors. Our room was just about the nicest that I have ever seen, and we asked for a quiet room in the back in advance. No noise at all. Now for the bad part. It is a big property and I accidently wandered down the wrong hallway one evening. There appears to be an older section in the back that is not of  the same standard as the main section. If that area is reserved for Marriot exchange Members or anyone else, I would be very disappointed. Maybe it was staff accomodations, but I doubt it. I am not too sure what I saw there. My only problem was when the bill arrived back in California on my credit card statement. My detailed invoice upon checkout was correct, but the amount charged to my credit card was wrong and seemed to charge for all three nights instead of only the two in the offer. I phoned the USA Marriott help line, but they were not any help. I wrote a detailed letter with copies of all reservations and the invoice and faxed it directly to the hotel itself in Dublin and asked for a telephone or e-mail response, but there was no response at all. Impossible to believe at a place that strives to be 100% perfect. CapitalOne Visa/MasterCard took 100% of the hotel's charge off of my bill and is waiting for the hotel to bill the correct amount after more than two months. I only asked for the overcharge to be removed, but CapitalOne has their own system.",5,2008,10,13
207,very comfortable,"Very centrally located and with all the comforts and facilities expected of a hotel of this type. Everything from the reception, the rooms, the food, bar areas and staff were all very good",5,2008,09,26
207,VERY dissapointed!,"We stayed here for a special weekend away and persuaded our friends to book here despite the price! 

We were very dissapointed by the entire experience!!

From the minute we arrived we felt unwelcome. The public areas were packed and not a single member of staff ever greeted us or asked if they could help.

The concierge were RUDE and clearly had better things (or perhaps better tipping guests) to deal with than us!

The whole atmosphere of the hotel was cold and the staff were not friendly at all as mentioned in previous reviews!

The rooms on the 7th floor were both VERY small and although well furnished had no baths (instead massive walk in showers with bad water pressure!),  no tea or coffee making facilities and air conditioning that sounded like a car driving through the room.

I always get a newspaper when staying at Marriott properties but was not asked on check-in. Instead I called down to ask for one before going to bed. It DID NOT arrive. I called again in the morning to be rudely asked if I was aware that 'you I would be charged'  for the service. This I found typical of the arrogant and unfriendly staff at The Shelbourne.

The 'fitness centre' was a few treadmills and weights inside converted guest rooms.....WAY below 5 star standards.

On check-out we lined up for nearly 20 minutes to be dealt with by a rude receptionist who again clearly had better things to do!

After checking our bags for a few hours, the bell staff then would not give us back our suitcase because 'someone else with another name has the same bag'! We eventually had to go behind the desk and retrieve the bag ourselves only be 'told off' by the Guest Relations Manager.

Overall APPALLING staff service that is a real let down to the Marriott name.

This hotel is living on being THE SHELBOURNE and has completely forgotten the basics of hospitality. That is unless you clearly have the money to tip well.

I am a Marriott elite member and only stay in Marriott hotels. This proprerty was not only way away from 5 star but not even up to Marriott standards.

The hotel was a huge let down to an otherwise great weekend in a great city!

SAVE YOUR MONEY and stay somewhere else in Dublin!",1,2008,09,22
207,Disappointed,"I was given a gift certificate for 2 rooms for one evening each. There were no charges made to the room account that were not paid before leaving the hotel the next day.  Upon arriving in the U. S., I checked my bank account and found a pending charge of $258.56.  I did not receive any services that weren't paid for either by gift certificate or in cash.  I've now been told that the hotel put a temporary hold on my charge account in anticipation of charges during my stay. It will take a week for this Temporary Hold to drop from my account. I was never told of this temporary hold. Nonetheless, the Temporary Hold should have been removed immediately at time of checkout and verification that no charges had been made. While the hotel is beautiful, the rooms excellent, and the staff extremely helpful, this failure to disclose has left a very bad impression of the hotel and its procedures.",2,2008,09,15
207,Shelbourne Luxury,"My husband and I just returned from a  5 night stay at the Shelbourne.  The hotel is fabulous, everyone is very helpful and pleasant form the front desk to concierge and doormen!  We stayed 2 nights checked out to go to another town and returned 2 days later.  The first room we had was in the newer part of the hotel.  The king room on the 8th floor was spacious and bright.  The bathroom was well appointed and average in size but certainly not small.  The view was not spectacular- it looked at another building but wasn't on top of the other building.  The 2nd room we had was a complimentary ""upgrade"".  It was in the old part of the hotel.   The hallways were much narrower and the king room was smaller than the first room.  The bathroom was HUGE. Shower and soaking tub were nice.  Both rooms had soaking salts to add to the bath.  Airconditioning in both rooms was more than adequate and not noisy. View from this 4th floor room was of the side street and if you craned your neck of St. Stepen's square.  The bars were both very busy on the weekend nights-lots of locals- which is always nice.  All in all it was a great stay. A privelege to stay in such an historic hotel.

207,Beautiful hotel - Exceptional Staff!!,"The Shelbourne is not the cheapest hotel by any stretch of the imagination however you certainly get what you pay for.  The Hotel itself has a wonderful location overlooking St Stephens Green making it a great point to explore the City.  The building is beautiful, it has been wonderfully restored and you get a real sense of grandeur when you enter.

Although not a huge hotel it certainly makes the best of what it has, the rooms are small but very nicely furnished, as a building made up of what was 3 private residences there is only so much that can be done with the available space but it has been used to good effect.

There are 2 lovely bars, and if you fancy a treat try afternoon tea in the Lord Mayors Lounge.  Although we did not eat in the Restaurant in the evening, if breakfast was anything to go by you won't be disappointed.  

The one thing that I have to say about this hotel is that it's staff are fantastic.  I sometimes find with 5 star hotels that the staff can be a little aloof and unwelcoming, however this is definitely not the case at the Shelbourne.  They are without doubt some of the friendliest yet most professional staff I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  Little touches like chef putting free samples of cakes each day at reception along with the recipes, the lady in the restaurant who opened up the bar early for me to take photographs and the concierges who helped us with so many things whilst we were there.  The General Manager should be very proud of his team!!

I would defintiely recommend this hotel and will certainly stay there again the next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2008,08,27
207,It was everything I expected and more!,"We stayed here as part of a Scotland-Dublin mini tour for my partners 40th. Upon our previous visits to Dublin we always said we would stay here one day and so we did for 2 nights in a Deluxe room with Heritage Lounge access. 

Upon arrival, I was blown away by the grandeur of the place. All staff that we met made us feel highly valued and could not be more polite or helpful. Champagne and chocs were delivered to our room upon arrival and was a memorable event. Some people have said that the rooms were small, but ours (348) was spacious and was as I expected. Throughout the visit, I found the amount of staff astonishing, at times there appeared to be more waiters than guests. Everytime we left our room, some went it and tidied up, turn-down service etc. It was so lovely to be pampered. We found the lounge access to be worth every single penny, however beware - the hotel is a maze of corridors and I got lost from the lounge to our rooms several times!! 

No tea making facilities in rooms is a shame but I know this is common in Dublin but the fact that you can drink tea to your hearts content in the lounge more than makes up for it. The bits of food available are also tasty and moreish. The drinks in the hotel were very reasonably priced with Guinness at 5.70 (which is only .30 more than in Temple Bar) and I pushed out and spent the weekend drinking champagne at a good price of 18.50 per glass. We did have a slight hiccup in the restaurant one evening but when I made a point of it to the manager they could not be sorry enough and although I was not after anything, they sent up yet another bottle of champagne to room and then pampered us at breakfast the next morning. 

All in all, this together with our stay in Inverness made it the perfect 40th birthday ever. We have already booked another 2 night stay in December at the Shelbourne.!",5,2008,08,23
207,Substandard for a 5 Star Hotel,"It is 4 am and I am sitting up in my very comfortable bed at the Shelbourne Hotel unhappily writing this review.  After having been awakened at 3:30 am by the sound of slamming doors and women screaming in the hallway, we have been kept awake by the sound of an alarm clock in the suite adjacent to ours.  My husband called the front desk  to complain only to be left holding the telephone while it rang again and again.  He hung up after 55 rings with no front desk response and went downstairs to ask them to handle the alarm situation.  They phoned the room but did nothing else.  The alarm continued to ring.   My husband went back down to the front desk.  They phoned again with no result.  
We have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world and are sad to say that we would not count The Shelbourne among them.  While the hotel is exceptional looking, and boasts a proud history, it seems that this may be a case of all style and no substance.  At best the staff can be described as indifferent, at worst as ill-mannered. 
 As I have already mentioned the bed is very comfortable; however,  the rest of the suite is unexceptional.  The sandpaper textured towels in the small bathroom remind me of the cheap hotels I endured in my travels as a university student backpacking through Europe with little money.  Management might want to consider the use of fabric softener or environmentally friendly dryer balls.  As I post this review the alarm has finally been turned off.  It is 6:10 am..  Sadly, we are unimpressed and will not be returning.",2,2008,08,22
207,The Grande Dame of Dublin hotels is back!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at the newly renovated Shelbourne. The hotel is beautiful and the staff cannot do enough for you. I requested a room overlooking St. Stephen's Green and this is what we received. I also had requested early check in as our flight from the US got us into Dublin Airport around 6:00 AM. No problem, our room was waiting for us...

The beds were wonderful and the bathrooms were extremely elegant. The hotel restaurants and bars were packed at lunch and at night, a sure sign that Dubliners and foreigners alike have re-discovered this great hotel. With easy access to Grafton Street, Merrion Square, the National Gallery of Ireland, Trinity College, and Temple Bar, you cannot find a better hotel location in the city. The Shelbourne definitely ranks near the top of my list of favorites in Ireland along with Adare Manor and Mount Juliet. I can't wait to return Dublin and hopefully stay in the same room.",5,2008,08,19
207,Great Hotel - but could be exceptional,"We stayed at the Shellbourne in a heritage room with access to the lounge. It was a treat stay to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday.
The hotel has much to commend it: a first class and loving renovation has restored the hotel to a thing of real beauty; history - the Constitution Room where Michael Collins and others debated and signed the Irish constitution is on show for guests only (his seat and the constitution are on display); art work like I have never seen in a hotel - over 200 pieces of incredible art adourn the hotel; exceptionally beautiful and elegant public spaces and bars. I also found the staff very welcoming an friendly - we were there for three nights and experienced several shifts of staff. All demonstrated that there are clear standards which are consistent across the staff team. The location is just what you'd want for a short break and the double glazing makes the rooms really, really quiet despite the location.
Now for the 'however'...
For the rate I paid my room was very small - furnished to a very high standard and with a first class bathroom (except oddly for a tiny bath in a massive bathroom which could easily have accommodated a large bath) but very small and not close to the standard I have experienced in other international hotels in the same market. There were no tea/coffee making facilities - room service was way too expensive especially for a cup of tea - I thought this omission was mean. 
There were some service problems - the unpleasant 7.30am alarm call on the Sunday which I did not book; the gift bag delivered to our room which was not for us; the failure to deliver the turndown service on one night (after providing feedback about that the response was excellent - we were sent mimosas and a bowl of strawberries with a written apology).
And the Heritage Lounge - where to begin? This is a very expensive hotel. Having stayed in a number of other hotels of this standard I found the facilities on offer below the value you would expect. The opening hours of the lounge were limited. Given the hords of crowds in the other bars in the hotel (I am not exaggerating here - I've never had to fight my way through crowds at the front door of a hotel to return to my room - Shellbourne - you've got to do something about that!!!!) access to the lounge beyond 10pm is necessary. The website tells you there are five servings of food a day when in fact it is two. Alcohol is pricey and at no point during the day is it complimentary - this is not what I have experienced elsewhere. Normally there would be some kind of cocktails and canapes slot between 5.30-7.30 in the evening. The savory canapes were very limited, the sweets much better. The staff were excellent and extremely helpful. the hotel already knows that the location of the lounge is ridiculous.  It is near impossible to find and In recoginition of this the hotel provide you with your own individual guide the first time you access the lounge. Shellbourne - you're a very big hotel. Move this to somewhere guests can find it and also crucially where anyone with a physical disability can reach it. It's current location prevents anyone in a wheelchair from reaching it - something I didn't see on the website when booking.
Final point - please update your website Shellbourne - the advertised spa and swimming pool opening this summer is in fact still under construction and will not be ready until next year. 
Sorry to be so long winded in my review. It is more out of a sense of frustration that such an exceptionally beautiful hotel just isn't reaching its potential. I hope in years to come that it does. Until then I wouldn't pay the rates to stay there again or recommend it to others.",4,2008,08,18
207,Beautiful hotel with a walk-out-the door location!,"We just returned from a wonderful trip to Ireland and stayed at the Shelbourne for 4 nights.  It is a beautiful hotel-stately and elegant.  The rooms are modern, roomy and the beds are of European comfort (plush feather mattress pad, high quality sheets and pillows).  

The location is outstanding.  Just a short walk is Grafton St., a bustling, busy mass of people, shops, pubs, and street entertainment.  One can walk to other top tourist areas such as Temple Bar and Trinity College. 

The staff is very helpful and nice, however, the hotel is a bit understaffed.  We arrived at around 2:00 however we were told our room wouldn't be ready until later.  We didn't get our room until almost 5:00 even with the advertised check-in at 3:00.  Oh well, we survived and had a fabulous stay!  I would definitely stay here again!",4,2008,08,15
207,Best deal in Ireland,"We stayed at The Shelbourne with 2 children 12 and 7 years old.

Our room was small but very nice. It had the BEST beds and a very nice and moden bathroom. Since you are out sightseeing all day a small room is ok.

I prefer small and comfortable rather than large and not good quality.
 We had tea and ate at No 27 and the food was always very good. Also breakfast offers everything. We got a very good deal considering we were 4 people.

I must say though, after staying in other 5 star hotels in Ireland 5 star in Ireland would be 3 or 4 star in Germany or Switzerland.

You have to accept that.",5,2008,08,15
207,One of the nicest hotels in Dublin,"I stayed at the Shelbourne while in Dublin for a business trip.  It's a very nice historic hotel that has modernized its rooms.  One of the most frustrating items for me in European bathrooms is the partial glass wall as the enclosure for the shower, rather than a shower curtain or sliding door.  My bathroom at the Shelbourne was great, in that it had a full sliding door for the shower and a lovely vessel sink.  The room is definitely small, but if you're just sleeping there, it shouldn't be a problem.

The artwork throughout the hotel is lovely.  

The location is also very convenient for shopping on Grafton Street.  

The cost for connecting to the Internet is a bit steep.

Because of my busy schedule whilst in Dublin, I did not have a chance to check out the bar or restaurants at the hotel.  I ordered room service on my first night there and it was quick.  The food was ok, but I generally find the food in Ireland to not be overally interesting.

I spend approximately 3-4 weeks in Dublin each year, and so far, this has been the nicest hotel I've stayed in.",4,2008,08,09
207,Not a 5 star hotel,"No doubt the location is excellent and the hotel does have nice features, especially the bedding.  I reserved a deluxe parkview room with lounge acess--the best of the non suites.  I did so based on the picture on the hotels website.  Well, what do you know--the room assigned  was  not as pictured and when I complained, I was told that they only have 2 of that type and all the others are similar to what I was assigned which was not nearly as attractive.  This really bothers me.
   We changed rooms to a lower priced deluxe room which was quite small and  had a balcony directly facing the post office 20 feet away.. The lock to the balcony door did not work but, despite my asking, it was not fixed.
     The towels were terrible like the ones you are given at a health club.  
   I was especially perturbed by the absence of the doorman who on the 1 occasion that I saw him, was engaged in converstion with another employee and we were completely ignored.
  In summary, the Shelbourne is not a 5 star hotel like the great hotels of the world.  Instead imagine a Marriott in an older building which is not that grand.",2,2008,08,08
207,Nice but too jammed,"Our stay was part of a birthday treat to for my husband who had worked really hard over the year and deserved a mini break. I upgraded to a deluxe room which was disappointing in size. It was in the new part of the hotel. The older rooms, from memory of a stay back in 2004, were bigger and much nicer. I'm not too sure if those have changed since the refrub though. 
We couldn't get a dinner reservation as the hotel was so busy despite booking weeks in advance. There was a queue (no joke) of people trying to get into the hotel for drinks. The Shelbourne is always busy in December but this was bordering on the ridiculous. Luckily we had brought our rooms keys with us as we had to show them on the door to get back in! 
We then waited for 15 mins trying to get served in the Horse Shoe bar without any luck. The other bar was even more packed. Luckily the hotel had reserved the side drawing room for residents but we still had to wait 5 mins before we could get a seat. Once we did the service was excellent and the atmosphere was great with a lovely piano playing. 
Best advice I can give you - don't stay in December and you will be able to enjoy the hotel, its great location and its atmosphere at a more relaxed less hectic pace.",3,2008,08,07
207,Luxury in a great location,"Superbly located on St Stephen's Green, within walking distance of most of the main tourist sights and many excellent restaurants.
It has been superbly modernised, reatining the character of the older parts but adding modern convenience and comfort. It is decorated and furnished to an extremely high standard, creating a very luxurious atmoshphere.

We stayed in the Eamonn de Valera Suite which overlooks St Stephen's Green. On the third floor, it was spacious, very well decorated and luxuriously furnished. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in and, thanks to excellent double glazing, the noise from passing traffic was minimal. The bathroom was superbly fitted.

Our room rate included Continental breakfast and various other freebies in the Hotel's elegant Heritage Room. The quality of the food there was excellent, although it varied little during our 3 day stay. 

On the Sunday evening, we ate in the Hotel's main dining room - elegant and relaxed, despite its formality. The service was excellent, as was the food (don't miss the oysters if they are in season).

Before we arrived, the Concierge was very helpful in booking us into 2 other restaurants we wanted to dine in (including the amazing but expensive Patrick Gilbauds).

I'd recommend using the Hotel's valet parking, due to Dublin's many one-way streets.

We would definitely recommend the Shelbourne for a comfortable stay in an excellent location.",5,2008,08,03
207,Pretty Good for an Old Gal...,"The Shelbourne is probably the most elegant hotel in Dublin, similar to New York's Plaza or Waldorf Astoria. We stayed here just one year after the complete renovation. The rooms were great, spacious and new in all amenities. However, the service was awful. Both hotelwise and in the restaurant. The Afternoon Tea was good value however service made it disappointing as well as the main restaurant and the bar. That said, located right across from St. Stephen's Green it is a great location, close to Grafton Street and the Centre.",4,2008,07,31
207,Perfect,"I've just returned from Ireland which included a ten night stay at the Shelbourne in Dublin.  I had requested the same room I had stayed in last year and it was ready and waiting for me upon arrival.  There a few other less expensive and very tasty hotels in Dublin that would suit me fine but the Shelbourne is simply everything one needs, and all in one place.  Great rooms; service; style; staff; food; drink; and LOCATION.  I love this place. It's in the center of activity in Dublin City but with a quiet  elegant ambiance (except for the two exceptionally lively and fun bars in the hotel). Will be back again next year.",5,2008,07,30
207,Wonderful,"Unfortunately we only had one night at the Shelbourne. It was at the end of our tour of Ireland and I chose this hotel because we had tickets to see Riverdance at the Gaiety and it was right down the street. 

The room was perfect, we had a junior suite for 3 of us. Staff was wonderful. Breakfast was great. We left early to catch the plane, but I would love to go back.",5,2008,07,21
207,"Nice hotel, great location","Stayed here last year for 2 nights on my honeymoon. Very nice place, and teh location by St. Stephens Green is great. I definitely recommend it.",5,2008,07,18
207,Great historic place to stay!,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for 2 nights with the family on a weekend break.  Liked the hotel, personnel was friendly, had dinner in the Saddle Room, which was OK.  I would actually recommend a small French restaurant just down the street over Saddle room.  The hotel is a major tourist attraction (it is even being talked about at length on tourist busses) so it is understandable why staff is not overly friendly with every person who walks through the door.  This being said, as soon as they realise that you are their guest, they are very friendly and helpful.  We enjoyed our stay there, it is a historic place and we would definitely stay there again next time we are in Dublin.",5,2008,07,08
207,smallest room ever,"To be fair, , we were the last people to check in that night, but when we reached room 774, we were amazed to see the smallest room that I have ever been in.... anywhere. 
 There was a queen size bed that you could barely walk around with one lamp and that was the lighting for the entire room!  

When we checked about changing rooms, a very snooty receptionist told us that there were ""No complimentary upgrades available"".  when we informed her that we were happy to pay for another room, said that she would see what she could do.  and she never called back.

The bathroom was a sliding door to the ensuite and .... wait for it..... No bath!!!! in a Five Star Hotel.....  shower sprayed all over the place and there was no room next to the sink for a washbag.  so so disappointing.  we paid 305 EURO and were really disappointed with the room.  

 otherwise the hotel is lovely but really busy at weekends as it is a popular hotel for the Beautiful Dubliners to drink Champagne.  when you make your reservation, just make sure it is not a Queen room on the 7th floor.",2,2008,06,20
207,Superb experience,"Wow, it's a lovely hotel, the bedroom was gorgeous and a spacious bathroom.  But more than that, the staff were just so welcoming and nice and focused on you as the guest in a very pleasant and non-fussy way.",5,2008,06,13
207,bedroom too small for 5 star hotel,"The communal areas inthe Shelbourne have been beautifully
refurbished but the size of the bathroom in the standard room and also judging by the listed measurements of superior rooms leave a lot to be desired !The bathroom in a travelodge is bigger.
One always worries when one sees a sliding door into the bathroom-----it obviously is a space saving device and looks cheap.While the standard of fittings was of a high standard the bathroom was too pokey for even a 3 star hotel.
I note a report from somone in Washington saying they had a huge bathroom-----it must have been one of the very expensive suites !
Apart from the bathroom the hotel is very pleasant but being very popular with non residents the bar can be too crowded so it's sometimes difficult for residents to have adrink there.
Again we couldn't get a place in the lounge for afternoon tea.",3,2008,06,10
207,"5 Stars - but yes Virginia, the room is SMALL","We arrived in Dubin after an overnight flight from Chicago and took the AirCoach bus (12 Euros r/t) to a stop about a block from the hotel. Even at 10am,the hotel gave us our room.  This place reaks of Irish history and I was felt honored to spend one night there. The location across from St Stephen's Green was nice and is easy walking distance to all city centre sites.  The hotel is old and therefore the rooms are very, very small. No big deal as we spent our time sightseeing. All the standard room goodies and more. The hotel has an bar/lounge on the first floor that really draws in the Irish powerbrokers.  The Shelbourne gets a big minus because it lacks a healthclub/spa/gym.   The front desk promises one in the future. Otherwise, it's 5 stars all the way!",5,2008,06,08
207,TIny Room but lovely hotel,"As the Shelbourne is an Irish institution, it was nice to stay there once! We were going to an event there so booked a standard room. The room was TINY! We had to get ready one at a time cos it was so small, we were tripping each other up. The bathroom was like a broom closet. The room was comfy, the bedding lovely, the bathroom (while tiny) was lovely and the shower great but it was just the size. The hotel itself is great!!",4,2008,06,04
207,5-star quality all the way,"We decided to treat ourselves to a night in a luxury hotel before heading out to the countryside of Ireland and the Shelbourne exceeded all our expectations.  The moment we arrived, the porter took our bags outside the hotel.  The check-in area is located off to the side and the hostess at the restaraunt personally walked us over rather than simply pointing the way.  At check-in we were offered lemonade and banana bread, asked if we'd like a complimentary newspaper, if we needed a wake-up call and anything else we could have thought of.  Upon entering our rooms, we were speechless - the room had a hair dryer, slippers, robes, an ironing board and safe and every other amenity you could ever need.  The bathroom was huge and was outfitted with soaps, shampoos and even had a speaker so you could hear the TV from the bathroom.  The beds were so comfortable we didn't want to get out of them.  The location is excellent - just across from St. Stephens Square, just down the block from the tour  bus stops and walking distance to most of the major sites of Dublin.  The next morning our rental car was delivered to the hotel - the rental company had left hundreds of floor mats in the back of the SUV and the bell staff graciously removed them, stored them and took care of getting them back to the rental company.

This hotel was everything I could have dreamed of for my first stay in a 5-star property and any future trips to Dublin will always include at least 1 night at the Shelbourne!!",5,2008,05,31
207,"Best Location, rooms not as good as four seasons","Best location in dublin, right on Stephens green and within walking distance of many great restaurants. Restaurant is good and bar is very good, Lee in the bar is a really great cheerful person. Rooms are ok, just refurbished but no way up to the standard of Four Seasons , Ritz Carlton or the g in Galway. If they spent as much money on the bedrooms as they spent on the ground floor it would be a fab hotel.",4,2008,05,30
207,Lovely traditional hotel,"Spent the recent bank holiday weekend at the Shelbourne.  We thought it was a really lovely, traditional high quality hotel.  The room was v ery spacious and well appointed, the location of the hotel would be hard to beat and staff were a perfect combination of efficient and friendly.

The main bar in the hotel on all three nights was very busy and was clearly a place where the local 'beautiful people' hung out - make sure you pack your best togs if you intend to spend the evening there.  Other more traditional watering holes could be found within an easy 2 minute stumbling distance

All in all a little expensive but worth it for a quality hotel in a beautiful city.",5,2008,05,28
207,PERFECT in every way,"Enjoyed a 3-night break at The Shelbourne during May.  Had high hopes and weren't disappointed!  We were able to reserve a 1-bedroom suite at a very reasonable price, which included access to the Heritage Lounge and included breakfast.  Beautiful room with a view over St Stephen's Green.  Very friendly, helpful, staff and everything was spotlessly clean.  We had our wedding here some 15 years ago, and I hope it wont be that long before we visit again.  All-in-all 5* treatment!",5,2008,05,19
207,Rip Off Ireland,"Booked into hotel 7/8 Mar for the weekend of Ireland v Wales rugby match in the 6 nations.The cost was 450 euro per double room , that had to be paid 6 weeks before the arival date.

Bearing in mind the cost of 450 euro was room only, we went to breakfast on saturday morning, it was a shambles, , insufficient staff, queues to get a table and then long delays in tea, coffee and  toast being served to the table. When going to the Self Service hot buffett all  teas, coffees plates were taken by serving staff. Is it usual for a 4/5 star hotel to have a self service buffett ??Bear in mind KO was 1.15 on the saturday at Croke Park.

When checking into the hotel on friday we were advised to carry the room ket at all times as access to the hotel would be  restriced to residents only over the weekend. On Saturday evening it was impossible to get a seat in either bar, and the patrons were nearly all non residents.

I  did write to the manager asking just what I received for 900 euro and did not have the curtesy of a response, I did however complain on line and received the normal glib response..

I  would advise any English or French rugby supporter to think long and hard before booking this very very expensive hotel in Dublin. will be staying in my usual hotel close to Landsdown Road in future where I am treated well and can obtain a drink in an unbusy bar that has real class.!!! 

This a hotel with a fine tradition in central Dublin that has recently been renovated, but it charges more than most London Hotels and offers a poor service and value for money.",1,2008,05,15
207,Great Location But not worth the price,We had a suite on the 6th floor and I have to agree with the previous post we couldn't get the a/c cool enough and it was very loud which made it difficult to sleep in the end we had to open a window ( So even more noise !) our bathroom was big but the shower was very poor the water just trickled from it.   The location is great but I was expecting more after the major revamp the hotel as just gone through. I'd usually stay at the Merrion around the corner and think I'll be staying there in future,2,2008,05,12
207,Great location,"Six of us stayed at the The Shelbourne for 3 nights over the early May bank holiday weekend. 

We managed to get  a very good rate for the hotel however the rooms were very small and could only just turn 360 degrees in the bathroom. The bed was fantastically comfortable which just about compensated for the poor shower and noisy A/C.

The location is fantastic - on St Stephens Green and 2 minutes to Grafton Street. The Dublin tour bus stops diagonally opposite to the hotel front door which was very useful!

We found the service in the bars poor - particularly as a young party, the waitress was hesitant to let us into the guest only bar and was quite abrupt.  Recpetion staff however were fantastic and the concierge very helpful.",4,2008,05,08
207,Fine Hotel but Improvement Still Needed,"The Shelbourne is a fine hotel and it should be for the average price per night.  My wife and I were fortunate to go on a company sponsored event.  The decor, design, historical preservation, etc. are impressive.  The rooms were large, the bedding was very comfortable and the room service (cleaning etc) was efficient and non intrusive.  The bars - saddle room, horseshoe etc. are fun and definitely the place to be seen in Dublin - very well heeled crowd and a few celebrities also.  The food is marginal.  We expected better from such a fine hotel, but unfortunately they have a lot of work to do in this regard.  The service in the Tea Room is extremely slow and the attendants are disinterested at best.  The breakfast buffet in the saddle room is fantastic - highly recommended - great omeletes, fruits, etc. with many items cooked to order - 21 Euros per person.  The 'signature' oysters reminded me of low tide - I tried all of them and not a good selection in the bunch.  Very strong, silty and like swallowing ocean water - I eat oysters quite a bit from other parts of the world and these were awful - maybe my unrefined pallate.  I suggest lunch or dinner elsewhere.  Cookes in the Theatre District was a hit with us.  Fire is also quite good - right around the corner from the Shelbourne.  All is all, a great place to stay - quiet, luxurious and fantastic central location.  Almost Ritz Carlton quality, but not quite yet.  Have fun!",4,2008,05,06
207,Loved the location,"We stayed at The Shelbourne in November 2007 and loved it.  The hotel's historic feel and opulent lobby interiors made us feel very special.  The staff were very courteous and helpful.  We had some trouble finding our way around the hotel because some of the hotel's construction is more recent, but this was really minor. The room we had was spacious and comfortable and the service great.  The hotel is walking distance from major city attractions and is one of the first stops for tour buses, making it easy to get good seats (important since a lot of the scenery is seen through the windows of the bus!).   The train station is a bit of a walk, but was very manageable even in November weather.  I would strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2008,04,28
207,Wonderful!!!,"Dublin is NOT cheap for hotels... yet the Shelburne experience was worth the $500 per night for the end of our Ireland Trip.  Right on St. Stephens Square, it was close to all of the main sights and locations.

The rooms were opulent, and the bed the most comfortable I have ever stayed in.   Breakfasts at $50 per person are over rated (we walked around the corner to the coffee houses on the shopping street and enjoyed them more.)

Would recommend starting or ending your Irish trip here!",5,2008,04,28
207,Top Notch,"Just came back from four days at the Shelbourne. I found the hotel to be lovely and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. My room was very large, overlooking the green. The location was fabulous.

My only criticism would be that I have to agree with everyone who said that the two bars were overcrowded. My husband and I had difficulty even getting our feet in the door of either bar on Friday or Saturday night, which is a little disappointing after a long day of walking around in the cold and damp...",5,2008,04,24
207,Really unimpressed,"Really unimpressed. For a 5 star hotel I thought it was about a 3, in terms of staff and the rooms.

First we arrived at about 3pm and told the room wasn’t ready. They suggested we go away for lunch and they would call us shortly, an hour later with no call we popped back in – no room, another hour later after looking around Dublin AGAIN we popped back – no room. Another 40 minutes later we thought we would try again, this time they had rooms, but no one bothered to ever phone us – seriously a 5 star hotel updates you and apologises it someone has to go thru a delay like this normally!!

The room we were allocated was a disabled room and the smallest room I have ever seen!!

We asked to be moved and they moved us to a pretty nice room but no view – looked onto the back of some office block.

The lights in the room did not work properly  - either all on or all off – the bedside laps seemed to be mis wired.

More grief than it was worth to try to change rooms

Great location though, can’t beat the location, oh an the valet parking was pretty good",2,2008,04,22
207,"Opulent luxury, perfect location","Visited Dublin in early April, after having spent several days traveling around the western and southern parts of the country, enjoying the sites and the incredible sunny weather every day (would you believe?) The nice weather continued in Dublin for the next four days we were there. As for the Shelbourne, it's quite luxurious now after the total renovation it underwent a few years ago. We got a good rate for the stay with breakfast included (combination direct pay and Marriott points). We had requested a room facing St. Stephen Green, but because of the weekend, they were full but offered to move us for the last night of our stay , which we declined. Very smooth check-in and check-out. Impecable service across the board by everyone. It seems to be one of the most popular places for the locals to congregate at the hotel bars. Beautiful room, although somewhat small, excellent furnishings, gigantic marble bathroom, which I'd made smaller to make bedroom bigger, facing a side street with a partial view of the park (less noisy than the front rooms facing the green). Location is excellent, close to all the attractions, a couple of blocks from a shopping mall and Grafton Street (the pedestrian only main shopping street), and Trinity College. Tons of restaurants around, which you'll need reservations on weekends, because all of them are packed around the hotel area. The main restaurant at the hotel is nice, reservations are also needed, but we didn't like it because it was small and the tables for two are all packed closely together making impossible to carry a private conversation. Had room service for breakfast the first day (included in room or restaurant), but the selection was so poor that we opted for going to the main restaurant instead (the room service breakfast for two was 70 Euros-good that it was included in the room rate). Dublin is definetely a fun city to visit, very expensive (second more expensive city in Europe after Helsinki) but nice. People were wonderfully friendly and helpful. All in all, it was a wonderful stay in a wonderful place.",5,2008,04,22
207,Fabulous for our family,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights in March 2008, over St. Patrick's weekend.  The weather was chilly and damp, but the hotel was warm and welcoming.  Our family of 6 had 3 rooms, and they were all together with 2 adjoining.  The rooms were plenty big and quite comfortable.  The staff was extremely helpful, especially in helping us find restaurants and pubs.  We had breakfast twice in the restaurant, and enjoyed drinks and food in the lounge.  This hotel was fantastic, and I would absolutely recommend it.",5,2008,04,22
207,Disappointed with the Shelbourne,"I was very disappointed with the level of service which myself and a friend received following what I perceived an unfortunate incident in the bar of the Shelbourne a number of weeks ago. A friend of mine and I went into the bar on the recommendation of colleagues. Unfortunateley we were intimidated by some ladies, having reported to the staff that we believed they had pick-pocketed some customers. The bar staff informed us that these ladies were in fact 'well known prostitutes'. The staff did not report the matter to security as we found out shortly afterwards as the ladies approached us, and proceeded to intimidate us until we were forced to leave. We reported the matter to security ourselves on leaving the hotel.

Following our less than satisfactory treatment in relation to the matter on the night, we lodged a complaint to the manager of the hotel. Unfortunately the manager was very dismissive of the fact that we were intimidated out of the establishment by these ladies. While I have tried on a number of occasions to contact the general manager of the hotel, I have not received a return phonecall, nor an apology of our treatment by the staff in the hotel.

I am very suprised and quite upset at the fact that we as customers were left in a very vulnerable situation. I am also very concerned as to the clientele that are frequenting the establishment, and are allowed to carry on in such a manner.",1,2008,04,22
207,"Beautiful Hotel, Fabulous Location","This hotel was awesome.  We stayed 4 nights in June 2007 while touring Ireland. The lobby is quite lovely and the restaurants and lounges are just wonderful.  We had tea at least one afternoon and ate in 2 of the other restaurants.  They do a fabulous breakfast buffet.  The location couldn't have been better.  It was an easy walk to everything.  Our room was just beautiful.  The staff was extremely nice as well as helpful.    If I recall correctly, we walked to Dublin Castle, National Gallery, Trinity College and actually, the Guiness Storehouse (but that was a really long walk!).  It's quite close (walking distance) to Temple Bar where we found a number of good restaurants.  In fact, we ate at a tapas restaurant one night that was just great.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2008,04,19
207,Great bed in small room,"My wife & I spent three nights at the Shelbourne on our first trip to Dublin. The room was very small, it was hard to move around from one side to the other. The bed was fantastic. After touring the streets and surroundings it was a pleasure to get into the bed. The bathroom was a nice size. The services in the hotel were very good - great restaurant and very busy bar. The workout facilities were not to be found.

You can't beat the location. Right on Stephens Green and close to all of the best in shopping, dining, drinking & exploring.",4,2008,04,14
207,"Substandard service, rude staff.","Being a resident in Dublin, I assumed that the newly refurbished Shelbourne hotel would be a fantstic place to celebrate a special family occassion. It has always given excellent service in the past, before new management took over. It was a terrible experience. 

The staff were rude to me and my guests. We were in shock at the low level and haphazard standard of service. The decor is beautiful, as are the surroundings. BUT the attitude is below what one would receive at a fast food restaurant. Furthermore, our complaint letter was dealt with until 2months later. 

They ruined an important family occassion, and the staff were insulting to my elderly grandmothers. For this they will not receive any further custom from my family.",1,2008,04,12
207,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at the Shelbourne for four nights in late March on Marriott points, which made it affordable.  This is a terrific luxury hotel -- excellent and friendly service, with great attention to detail.  Rooms are good size and very comfortable.  But perhaps the best thing about the hotel is its location, at the heart of official and commercial Dublin, with most tourist attractions within an easy walk and plenty of nearby shopping, restaurants, etc., for any budget.  It makes for a great base, whether your visit is business or pleasure.",5,2008,04,11
207,From Grande Dame to Drunken Tart,"As they say in the Carlsberg ad, this is probably the most historic hotel in Dublin and it has just been refurbished with new rooms added.  In another era it used to host the Saddle Room restaurant, famous for the American saddle at its entrance and the fine beef and prawns that it served, which were legendary.  However, don't let the fact that the name of the restaurant has been resurrected fool you.  The food is appalling - do not eat here.  Choose Patrick Guilbauds in the Merrion Hotel (Michelin Star French cuisine), Shanahan's on the Green (American and nearby) or Roly's Bistro in Ballsbridge (cheaper).

This is really a hotel inside a large bar.  The night we stayed the bars were full of rowdy inebriated customers.  The rooms are not up to a five star standard and the hotel is in reality rooms above large drinking areas on the ground floor.  What a shame, because the location is the best.  It's a pity that the same can't be said about the hotel, food and service.",1,2008,03,30
207,"wonderfulhotel,great location","Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Shelbourne. We found the best rate on the Marriott website which included breakfast. The hotel is in an ideal location for exploring the city on foot although there were tourist buses and taxis available outside the door. The room 369 was large and faced a central courtyard so was very quiet.The hotel had just been refurbished so the fixtures and fittings are like new.We only ate breakfast which was buffet style with pleanty of choice. Staff were friendly and helpful.Shopping inGrafton street is a 5 minute walk away and the park is just across the road. My only criticism was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in hte room. However they do afternoon tea with sandiches/cakes etc in hte lounge so if money is no problem ... I bought coffee to go from the shop 50 yds down the street which also sold papers,sandiches etc.",5,2008,03,28
207,A lovely property!,"Upon landing in Dublin at 9:30 in the morning I lugged my bags to the Shelbourne figuring that they may very well tell me to come back at 3pm to check in.  Fortunately, they paid my grubby plane attire no mind and quickly gave me a key to my room, which was gorgeous: big bathroom, nice closet, and a gorgeous view of St. Stephen's Green.  

The property offers a free shoe shine service, so I called down and requested someone to come pick up my boots, and a few hours later they were delivered back to me looking fantastic.  Later that evening as I prepared to head out for a business event I was surprised by a delivery of a demi bottle of wine and a plate of cheese and crackers.  Each day during my stay a new treat was delivered in the evening: chocolates, sparkling water, nutrition bars, etc.  The Shelbourne truly provided those much-needed comforts when one is traveling for business.  

The only drawback is that the hotel lobby and bars get absolutely crazy on weekend nights.  It was hard for my colleagues and I to even sit in our own lobby for a drink.  When we came back to the hotel from dinner out one night we were pounced on by a doorman who wanted to make sure we weren't just trying to grab a drink.  Understandable, I suppose, given the line of beautiful people snaking down the street who did want to have a drink at the Shelbourne, but given that we just wanted to go to bed, it was a bit much. Nonetheless, I would absolutely stay at the property again...and can only hope that I will!",4,2008,03,25
207,Elegant,"This is a Classy Hotel, we popped in for social drink on St. Patrick's Weekend.
We went into the saddle bar, you get this luminous feeling off the shelbourne.
The bar staff were friendly and very helpful.
I would recommend this place 
Very good indeed!!",5,2008,03,20
207,"Trading on history, but a piss poor property","My introduction to the Shelbourne was dragging my luggage to the front door with the cabby because the door staff who had just put a family of five in a van head of us disappeared in the rain. 

I was checked in with the assurance my room was ready, only to find a disturbed bed, a used robe thrown across the chair, and a filthy bathroom showing the room was not ready. I have never had this happen in 25 years. 

10 minutes later, the bell man showed me into a standard medium grade business room.  Bathroom was OK with larger tub. no coffee maker, No apology from management they screwed up the entire stay.  

The bellhop was wrong when he said there was laundry service on Sunday.  Mini bar price for a 350 ml of wine was 38 Euros.  Outrageous.

This is a fake hotel trading on it's history.  Few of the rooms are in the orignial building -- most in a non -descript modern building.  You pay for the name, not the service.

For the price, look to Westin or Four Seasons.   More authentic, less a fraud.  Better off staying somewhere else, do the bar and restaurant as non-residents.

Status in Marriott Rewards seems nil.

Will never stay here againl",1,2008,03,16
207,Fit for royalty!,"The Shelbourne is a hotel that makes you feel like royalty.  From the warmth of the reception staff, to the sumptuous common areas, you feel as though you are being treated like a queen or king.  Located just across the street from St. Stephen's green, it is within walking distance of most tourist attractions in Dublin, such as Trinity College and Grafton Street.  Although the street in front of the hotel is wildly busy during the day, the traffic ends at dinnertime and the hotel is exceptionally quiet.   Although the standard rooms are quite small, for two people it seems just fine.  On our second night, we moved to a deluxe room.  This large room had an entry hall, large bathroom and huge sleeping area. We found this to be much more comfortable.  Breakfast was not included in the price of the room and was very expensive.  We found a small breakfast place just up the street and it was more reasonable and just as delicious.  One of the perks of the Shelbourne is the afternoon treats.  Items such as warm cookies, fresh scones and tasty muffins along with cider are placed in the lobby for hotel guests. I would also definitely recommend having a drink in the downstairs bar. We have stayed here before and most definitely will return in the future.",5,2008,03,15
207,sickening,"to celebrate my birthday, myself and my girlfriend decided to go for dinner in the saddle room at the shelbourne hotel.on arrival we were promptly shown to our table and the services was professional and friendly. we had a nice bottle of white wine and for main course we shared the seafood platter. when the very decorative dish arrived we were surprised to see that some of the mussels were heavily refrigerated and looked quite old. we decided due to the 5 star rating of the hotel it was probably safe to eat and nothing tasted or smelt bad. when finally finished we paid our bill of €150 and made our way home.

24 hours later the situation started to unfold. both myself and my girlfriend started to feel very sick in our stomachs and soon both of us became violently ill. i managed to recover slightly after 48 hours, but my girlfriend was ill for 3 days. in total both of us had to take 4 days off work and took along time to get our appetite's back.

when recovered i decided to get in touch with the shelbourne and explain our situation. i got transferred to the food and beverages manager, who seemed mildly understanding, but said that it was very unlightly that it had been their seafood that had caused the sickness. he suggest that i leave the issue with him and he would talk to the chef and then call me back.

after a week i received a phone call from the f&b manager to say that really it wasnt his problem, but that the next time i came back into the hotel to ask for him and he would offer me a bottle of house wine. i told him that i would not be back to the hotel and so  had absolutely no intention of taking him up on his offer.

to sum up, i guess i feel for a hotel of the rankings of the shelbourne that they could of done a lot more. at the very least refunded us our money for a meal that caused us so much pain.

you have been warned, beware of the seafood in the shelbourne, fresh its not!!",1,2008,03,11
207,If only for the Historical value,"We stayed here for two days during one of the rainiest vacations I have EVER experienced. Despite looking like drowned rats when we arrived, we were treated with respect. 

Our room was ohsosmall. Clean and with a view of the alley, this may have been because we stayed using Marriott points instead of using cash, and I have found that we often get the wrong end of the stick when we do that.  Ambiance a plenty, with a nice fireplace and sitting area adjacent to the dining rooms. Took a while for the hot water to reach our room, but I've found that is typical in most of the places I've stayed.

The hotel is spectacular and well situated (across the street from my favorite pub, O'Donoghue's) and full of rich history. I'm a nut about those types of things, so I was totally impressed to be staying in the building where the Irish constitution was signed. 

All in all, a very classic place to stay and you can't go wrong by doing so.",4,2008,03,04
207,Excellent,"It was over 6 years since we last stayed in the Shelbournce, and what a difference!

We had expected changes to the property due to the recent investment, and these changes are indeed impressive, however we were more impressed with the casual and professional attitude of the staff at the Shelbourne.

Once you get past the busy bell hop/security desk on arrival - you're in very a terrific hotel experience.

We had a seemless booking, there was freshly squeezed lemon juice and brownies for children during the friendly check in, porters (seemingly) more concerned about customer service than a tip - and that's just before you get to the room.

The location can't be beaten, excellent rooms and efficient / friendly room service, beautiful public areas, checking out a breeze - we have come to expect a lengthly process in other properties from check out (for us checking in/out with young children is usually a low point in a trip) to getting into the car - it was not the case here.

We passed the luggage to the porter in the room, and didn't have to look at it again until we arrived home.

The best part of our stay at the hotel was the friendliness of the staff on the ground, reception and the concierge - a genuine welcome - it led us to believe that the management must be doing something very right.

I had recommended the Shelbourne to family on the strength of views here on TA, and they in turn had convinced me of the Shelbourne's suitability for children from their own observations - consequently , I can't imagine that we'll ever stay in another hotel while in Dublin.",5,2008,03,03
207,Great location but well short of true 5 star quality,"I have marked this against what I would expect of a 5 star hotel, having experienced several lately through work. The location is excellent - you could not wish for better to explore Dublin. The entrance is grand and all looks promising as you approach the check-in desk.

After check-in is where it starts to fall down. The rooms are relatively ordinary - something I would expect in a good 4 star - although the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was very ordinary, and was supplied with rather non-luxurious toiletries (heading for good 3 star here).

In my 2-night stay I had the maid service disturbing me 3 times (barging in unannounced on one occasion). My requested newspaper was hit and miss too. Not the best on service then ...

The food - what can I say, except don't eat here! I had the worst evening meal I can remember from anywhere (OK, I don't eat fast food) in a very long time indeed. It was disgusting. Lunch was barely any better, although it was ordinary rather than disgusting.

One saving grace was breakfast (in the restaurant) which was extensive and of good quality. So I would recommend bed and breakfast here but eat out otherwise.

I cannot comment on value because my company paid. However, don't think you are coming to a true 5 star quality hotel and you might not be as disappointed as I was. Think of it as a 4 star in a great location, and try and get a deal that reflects that rating.",2,2008,02,29
207,All great until the breakfast,"First impression; the hotel is fantastic.  But for 400 euro per night that was what we expected. Located right in the centre of Dublin with Stephen Green on your doorstep.  

Probably the best located hotel in the city.  We were upgraded when we booked in and had a room looking out on the Green.  The room was fantastic.  Beautifully decorated, simple yet classy.  The bathroom was lovely, all marble.  The bath was a bit on the small side though.

We were very disappointed with the breakfast.  We filled out our order card at night and ordered a full irish breakfast and left it on the door to be collected.  Right at the requested time there was a knock on our door and our breakfast was wheeled in with a heater to keep it warm.  The heater was not turned on and our breakfast was cold.  The bacon, mushrooms and hashbrowns tasted like they were cooked an hour previously. Both of us ordered eggs and they were missing.  After the rest of the experience I was so surprised that the breakfast was so disappointing.  

I would recommend staying in this hotel for a treat but maybe skip the breakfast and get the Luas to Ranelagh and get a super breakfast in one of the cafes there.",4,2008,02,27
207,Great base for Dublin,"Stayed in Dublin for a mid-week break 18th to 21st February and it was a tough choice between the Dylan (currently ranked #1) and the Shelbourne - in the end we stayed here purely on the basis of a more central location.

It is part of the Marriott group and as a member of their reward scheme invariably the best deals are available direct with them - most of the internet deals were marginally cheaper but didn't include breakfast which is charged at 29Euro each so the breakfast inclusive deal worked out much better. One point - the Heritage lounge closed for refurbishment half way through our stay and will be out of action for a few weeks.

We had booked a Deluxe room and on arrival were assigned room 252. As several other reviewers have mentioned some of the rooms are small and this was one of them - it appeared to be more like a standard room. A quick call to reception got us moved next door to room 252 which was much bigger. 
The bed was VERY comfortable and we struggled each morning to get up in time for breakfast! 
Turn-down service with chocolates and bottles of water each evening was a nice touch.
Only thing the room was lacking was tea/coffee making facilities. There is wireless internet in every room but be prepared - this costs 12Euro per hour!

We ate in the Saddle restaurant on the first night and the food was fine - nothing spectacular and to be perfectly honest there is much better (and cheaper) available in numerous restaurants within a few hundred yards of the hotel. Breakfast was excellent with a really good range of food. The main bar is the best part of the hotel with a really vibrant buzzing atmosphere and we spent some time in here each night; the bar staff are very efficient and friendly. 

Overall we had a very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend it as a great central location to use a base for exploring Dublin.",5,2008,02,23
207,Fantastic,"Probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in!

Stayed in the delux room with an amazing King sized bed, breakfast in the morning was great too. 
But the best thing about this palce is the staff. Very very friendly and professonal, but not in your face, and they make you feel like nothing is a problem.

Would definitely stay here again. If you're looking for a top hotel in Dublin, this is it.",5,2008,02,04
207,The Cocktail Bar,"Popped in this hotel for a drink and a snoop around for consideration of a future stay. Loved the entrance and the way the hotel has been done up.

We decided to stay for a drink in the cocktail bar and unfortunately the bar failed miserably to live up to expectations. We ordered a Martini and a Vodka...the Martini was delivered in hi bal glass rather than a Martini, so we asked for it to be changed and so they obliged, but there was no space to pour in the mixer, thus ending up witha full to the brim glass of martini and no possibility to mix in the tonic. The Vodka was fine. At 21:05 we asked if there was any light food available and was told that the kitchen closed at 9pm and there was nothng they could do. I asked if it would be possible to order some food through the room service department and was told no because the chef will be busy with room orders and my order would take very long to arrive as they had to give priority to the guests staying in the hotel. At this I was quite surprised so we decided fair enough...paid for our one drink and took our money elsewhere. The bar staff did not even bother to place some nuts on the table with our drinks but had to ask for these and even whn we did they did not seem to happy about it.

Will most definitely not stay in this hotel in the future",2,2008,01,28
207,Excellent hotel,"Hotel was excellent for a weekend stay in Dublin, good location and the staff in general were very helpful. Fitness room is poor but I understand a new spa will open in 2008.",4,2008,01,25
207,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed at The Shelbourne during the Christmas holiday 2007. 
We chose this hotel because it is in the Marriott family of hotels and we used a combination of points as well as paid room rates.

One word describes the hotel.  FANTASTIC!!!  The front desk staff, concierge, Heritage Lounge staff - all were super, pleasant and  helpful.  In fact, my husbands suitcase was lost by the airline for 2 1/2 days - and the Concierge Staff was MORE helpful in getting it to us than the airline!  

Grafton Street for shopping is 5 minutes away, great restaurants  a few minutes walk......

The  Heritage Lounge (if you have access) is wonderful for a light breakfast, snack....drinks.

We are already planning a return visit - and we will be returning to the Shelbourne!",5,2008,01,09
207,Disappointed,"The hotel is in a good location in dublin city.

The service  food etc was excellent however the rooms are very small.... I have read the other reviews and some of the photos and I reckon the other reviewers were lucky intheir room allocation! Our room was part of a newer building it just wasnt what we expected considerng the money we paid for our one night stay.",3,2008,01,09
207,"Great hotel, and perfect location","The Shelbourne is a beautifully restored hotel in a perfectly central location in Dublin.  Positives: The bar is absolutely stunning, the bedrooms are beautifully appointed, the bed has heavenly down duvets, and mattress toppers, and the service was excellent.  We especially enjoyed the free valet service for our car.  Negatives: the room is quite small, the bathrooms don't have a double vanity and are quite plain, and the room service food we ordered was not very good.  However, overall this cozy hotel with the perfect location is one to go back to.",5,2008,01,06
207,"Lovely, special hotel","We stayed for two nights at the Shelbourne and really thought the hotel was special.
All the staff were fabulous!
The rooms spacious and the beds comfortable.
Meals are great!
The hotel is truely a special place to visit!
Although it is big and very popular (not just for guests who are staying there) the staff make you feel special.
Worth the money!
Great position.
Though I cannot believe the traffic in Dublin!!!!!!!!",5,2007,12,08
207,Sleep and more sleep,"After a week in Germany i was delighted to spend two nights in The Shelbourne. Beds were unbeliveably comfortable, the suite was spacious and grand and the breakfast has to be the best i had in 25 years globle trotting in business. 
Open fires, Georgian sitting rooms, and excellant service make this a truly great hotel. 
One critical tip is to book your evening dinner in Dublin 3 years in advance. Places are in short supply. Good job my wife is understanding and sleep was a desperate requirment.",5,2007,12,05
207,very nice,A very nice hotel.  The concierge was helpful (but unsuccessful) in trying to find dinner reservations for us.  Our room was lovely - the bed was very comfortable.  It is about two blocks from Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green mall.  My only complaint was that the fire alarm went off for nearly 30 minutes at 4:30 in the morning and no one answered the phone at the front desk to confirm that it was a false alarm.,4,2007,12,03
207,The Shelbourne shines,"Stayed for a week and found the staff and accomodations to be excellent.  Had access to the concierge lounge which was outstanding in terms of both staff and food.

Lots of historical signficance to the hotel too.  One thing I didn't understand was the seemingly casual approach to history in the room where the Irish constitution was drafted.  For example, it looked like the chair that Michael Collins presumably sat in at the time is being used as part of the daily meeting room setup.  There was an original typed draft of the constitution in a display box that didn't look very secure.
I would think that management would want to ensure that the artifacts from the time are not destroyed or lost so that the room retains its historical signficance.  Michael Collin's chair, etc., ought to be taken out of use and put on display in the room in a secure manner.",5,2007,11,27
207,loved the bed,stayed in deluxe room lovely with great bed breakfast not worth the money liked the athmosphere however agree with other reviewer that front of house should be irish as this hotel is an irish institution .,5,2007,11,24
207,Much better than nice...,"The location is ideal.  The staff are solicitous without being unctious.  The rooms, which were renovated at enormous expense ( maybe ten or twenty minutes ago) are luxurious, comfortable, crisp and immaculate.  Everything works.  The shower was fine, the complimentary shampoo and soap good enough that I went shopping for them on nearby Grafton Street.  The windows opened---which is a plus for me.   And the lighting in the room was as good as, or better than, any hotel I've ever been in.  Flat-panel tv, comfy robes, complimentary newspaper and a grand bar on the ground floor.
    I'm guessing this hotel would not work well for Shane MacGowan, Sid Vicious or Pol Pot, but for just about everyone else, it will do.",5,2007,11,22
207,Are there 4.5 star hotels>>,"We had the pleasure of staying here a couple of Saturdays ago. It's easy to see where the millions in renovations went, the building is fantastic. 
Unfortunately though, the hotel falls down when it comes to its staff. It felt like everyone was trying way too hard. Most come across as disingenuos. Not fake in anyway, just trying to be something they are not. Obviously following orders from someone who doesn't know what his/her clientelle expect from and upmarket hotel.
If I was someone travelling in from outside Ireland, I would expect that traditional warm Irish welcome. However, you will not get that here. This could be a nice hotel in any major city in the world. It's a pity because this hotel has been an Irish institution for such a long and it seems they have missed an opportunity to offer it's clients a unique experience.

Overall this is a great hotel and I guess things will settle down over time.",4,2007,11,21
207,Mixed Emotions,"My first Shelbourne experience was about ten years ago when I was younger and traveling with my parents. I can't remember the specifics but the reservation had been wrong and they tried to put us in a very small, dank room.  We checked out immediately, and avoided it for years despite living in Ireland. 

Since the recent renovation, I've attended events there and have spent a bit of time in the bar. The atmosphere is great for meeting someone for a drink after work or to relax on a lazy Sunday afternoon and the main bar is beautiful. I also find the staff quite friendly, and the bar food is good.

Despite being wary from my initial experience there, my boyfriend and I booked a room there for a special occasion because our favorite Dublin hotel was fully booked.  I thought after recent revamp it would be great.  Our room was tiny, and the sheets were marked with something that looked like lipstick or nail polish. They were very helpful when we brought it to their attention and changed them immediately. The staff was great in general, but the room was very disappointing...comfortable bed but no view and very closet like.  The bar was also jam packed for the entire night, and we avoided having a nightcap before bed because we couldn't be bothered wrestling the crowds. 

Generally, a very nice classic Dublin spot to socialize- but look elsewhere for a fresh, comfortable hotel room in the city.",3,2007,11,21
207,My stay at the Shelbourne,"As an Irish person myself and my boyfriend decided to treat ourselves to a romantic stay at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin last weekend. We knew it would cost a lot but knew it would be an utter treat!!

I contacted the hotel directly to make a reservation and was advised to book a Deluxe Room and to avail of a Park and Stay special offer of B&B for 2 people for 1 night including parking for €295 in a large deluxe room. As you can imagine it all sounded fab!

When we arrived at the hotel on Saturday morning we checked in and everyone was nice and pleasant at the reception. We were both very disappointed with the room as it was actually quite small and had an adjoining room ie a room joining our bedroom with a door. These rooms can be very noisy. 

The hotel was on the 1st floor at the back of the hotel with no view but that was fine as there was no street noise. However you could hear
everything from the room next door! 

We did enjoy our stay at the hotel but were disappointed by the atmosphere. It was very stuffy and the staff barely smile at you. Apart from the staff we met at the reception on check in the rest of the staff werent that pleasant and some of them had very little English which was annoying. 

We are both in our early 30s and look quite young and casual. I got the feeling that the hotel suits older couples better and definitely those who show they have lots of money!!!! 

Breakfast was ok but disappointing. Lots of very very well dressed staff running around clearing tables but very little attention given to guests. It was buffet style but simple things like getting a waiting staff to give you teat and coffee was confusing and a but stressful.

Overall i would recommend staying there but dont be expecting extreme luxury. It looks very luxurious and only seems like a place which welcomes the rich and famous but at the end of the day its just another hotel. I always think a hotel needs to have a team of staff with personalities to carry it and a nice welcoming friendly every day
atmosphere.

207,because you're worth it,"Never underestimate the joy of dumb luck.... this hotel was just going through it's grand re-opening when we stayed there.  Service was impeccable.  Hotel staff members walked around the counter to present your hotel key and lemonade was served on a tray as I arrived.   I'm used to staying in budget hotels, so all of this was a bit overwhelming for me at first.  But I'm VERY adaptable! Location couldn't be better and I want that bathroom in my own home!  Yes, you'll pay a pretty penny.  But if you want a lovely and luxurious experience, this is it!",5,2007,11,18
207,Absolutely Perfect Stay,"We stayed at the Shelbourne for 3 nights on part of a 2 week trip. It was our 15 year anniversary, so we splurged all our Marriott points for our stay. I can only say good things about this hotel. We were upgraded, which I thought was awesome since we were using points. Everyone was super helpful and nice. We had dinner at the Saddle room, the food was great (best lamb I ever had), and they even gave us complimentary champagne. The room and its amenities were all top of the line, and the a/c worked FANTASTIC. Asked the concierge for info. a couple of times and he was very helpful. Would I pay the full price to stay? Probably, if I was going to Dublin for any kind of special trip or occasion.",5,2007,11,08
207,Great Energy and Location,"My husband and I chose The Shelbourne for the location and we were not disappointed.  It was a quick walk to Grafton Street which is filled with shops and restaurants.  

The lobby is always filled with great energy.  There is a harp player during Tea and the Bar is busy every day of the week.  It is not a traditional boring hotel bar.  We met people that live in Dublin that come for a great bar scene that is filled with local celebs, writers, politicians and world travelers. 

The beds are extremely comfortable, they are pillow tops with an additional feather bed on top.  The bathrooms are covered in marble and the room is equipped with large screen tv.

The restaurant serves breakfast which includes organic eggs, fruits and fruit juices.  Bit pricey but good.

Overall good place to stay.",4,2007,11,07
207,Grand Hotel,"The Shelbourne Hotel is beautiful.  The hotel has just undergone an extensive renovation and is one of the top hotels I have stayed at.  The level of finish and quality of workmanship is remarkable.  

The rooms are very tasteful and done in a traditional manner.  The rooms were quiet and the bathroom was beautiful in white marble.

The hotel bar off the lobby is georgeous and has a wonderful crowd.  The breakfast/buffet in the hotel restraunt was very nice.

Awesome, just steps from the pedestrian shopping district and several museums the hotel located off a beautiful park.

This is getting to be known as one of the top hotels in the world and I would highly recommend a stay before word gets out.",5,2007,11,07
207,very Nice!,"Hard to find fault with this hotel, but there are two things that kept me from giving a 5 star rating.  1st, the room smelled like smoke.  I mentioned it to the hotel staff and they brought up some swirly water thing and I must admit it worked right away. The 2nd reason is the internet prices were too high.  For the price of these rooms  and being a Marriott member, I felt the business center should have been free.  15 euro for 15 min is absurd.  The bar area was always filled so I got room service instead.  The food was ok--not american that's for sure.
The shower could have been designed better.  I almost slipped and fell.",4,2007,10,29

The only downer was, both bars filled early to overflowing capacity and it was very loud.
Great hotel!

207,Shelbourne-Great Location & New Look,"We stayed at the newly refurbished Shelbourne Hotel for 3 nights in October 2007. The hotel is in a prime location for visiting the main attractions in Dublin. We were upgraded to a room with a beautiful park view, and could easily walk to the Temple Bar area. We were also close to some of the museums and other historical sites.

The hotel itself was very nicely redone. We stayed in a heritage premium room, which was good sized. It had the most comfortable bed we’ve ever had in a hotel (including the George V in Paris). The bathroom was also great – a huge soaking tub, separate shower and separate toilet area. The chairs in the room were not quite as comfortable as the bed; they probably need to be broken in by a few more guests.

The lounge area was nice (we had drinks there one afternoon), and the Horseshoe Bar was very quaint (smaller than it looked in the pictures), but very comfortable. We didn’t eat at the Saddle Room, as it looked pretty pricey.

All in all, a very nice hotel, nice staff, comfortable room and excellent location!",5,2007,10,22
207,5 star !!!!,"Just back from a 2 night family trip to Dublin and The Shelbourne was a fantastic 5 * hotel.  Stayed in a Deluxe twin and the location was excellent around St Stephens Green. - (quieter than staying along O'Connell Street) Also a short walk away was Merrion Square where we had lovely walks around.  The open top buses are good, we stopped off at the zoo and jumped back on to come home.",5,2007,10,16
207,Fabulous place to stay for a treat,"I had a fantastic weekend in Dublin with my two adult daughters. We stayed in the new part of the hotel and the room was lovely although I have to agree a bit bland. I found the service absolutely fantastic, everyone was very polite and helpful. The man from Turkey who served at breakfast was very helpful and had  excellent customer service skills. We had breakfast and dinner at this hotel and both were excellent, plenty of choice and very tasty.
Location is fabulous, and we indulged in afternoon tea which was a real treat.
Only have good things to say about this hotel and am hoping to return with hubby and stay in the older part of the hotel for our 10th wedding anniversary next year.",5,2007,10,16
207,Beautiful hotel in perfect location,"The old Shelbourne in Dublin has reopened with elegant renovations. The staff is very attentive and competent, and the concierge staff is quite accomodating. The rooms and bathrooms are lovely. My only complaints are that the lighting in the makeup alcove is woefully inadequate, and the tub is quite deep and should have a security bar on the edge of the tub as it's quite tenuous to step over the high ledge. Of course, the prices for the restaurants in the hotel are absurdly high, but we did splurge one day for high tea which I would highly recommend. Plus you cannot beat its location. We walked everywhere in the city from there.The other delightful plus for me was the incredibly creative and changing flower displays throughout the hotel.",5,2007,10,10
207,great location,"My husband, toddler and I stayed at the hotel for a couple of nights.  They were sold out and unable to do any upgrades.  We had booked a deluxe room.  It was a nice size room, but there was no view at all, and it seemed very standard.   They have very nice TVs, large marble baths but decor was bland, no pictures etc.  For large rennovation that was done, it was not all that impressive.  It was very clean and service, especially door staff, was excellent.  Location is great, right across from St Stephen's Green and a couple of blocks off of Grafton street.   Other than the location, it could have been any other 4 star hotel in any other city.  No Irish flair, perhaps with a park view where you could see some green.  We had a nice stay but had really hoped for more.",4,2007,09,24
207,Terrific Tops!,"After a recent extensive renovation that shuttered the joint for a couple of years, the Shelbourne has reopened and is terrific. Minus a few bumps and lumps on the concierge side (which needs an overhall - or maybe it's the newness since it reopened to find the right staff) we couldn't have been happier.

The hotel is comfy, hip, elegant, fun and wonderfully located.",4,2007,09,24
207,Great Stay at The Shelbourne,"Although not quite as nice as the Four Seasons, the Shelbourne is a beautiful property.  Book a room with a view of St. Stephen's Green and you will not be disappointed.  Housekeeping does an excellent job and the rooms are spotless with marble baths.  I especially enjoyed the large, sunken tub in the bathroom.   For Marriott members, the Heritage Lounge is a treat, and has multiple meal services throughout the day.  Front desk staff were very efficient.  Only negative - quality of room service food was extremely poor.  Otherwise, a great stay!

207,Heaven on Earth,"I can not say enough wonderful things about the Shelbourne. From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like royalty. Aug 22 was our son's 15 month birthday, when the staff found out they delivered a small birthday cake and present to our room for our little one to enjoy. We are platinum members so we had access to their heritage lounge. The heritage lounge is absolutely beautiful and the staff is soooo attentive, nice and efficient. The heritage lounge reminded my husband and me of Princess Diana's rooms at Kensington Palace in London. I am not kidding and not exaggerating. Huge crystal chandeliers and delicious food morning, noon and night. The tea service I had at the Shelbourne was much nicer than the afternoon tea iI had in London (The Orangery) Our bedroom and bathroom were very comfortable, the bed and pillows are out of this world. In hind-sight we should have stayed a shorter time in London and booked a longer stay in Dublin so we could have had more time at the Shelbourne.

207,a class of its own,"welll what can i say. absolutly amazing. i was aware that it was an expensive hotel but it far surpassed what you would call value for money. i was there for two nights. i stayed on the fifth floor overlooking the park. the room was lovely spacious well thought out and the bed will make you never want to leave. but i did and im glad i did. as i went down to the bar i was greeted with a smile from everyone of the staff. i sat at the bar and ordered my usual. ""mojito"" the barman Ben who i have to say is an absolute gem. i asked him anything about dublin and he knew straight away. after 10minutes he and myself had a scheduale planned out for my stay.not to mention the 3 best mojito@s i ever had. i ate at the restaurant that evening and it wes delicious. the best fillet steak i had for a long time and im a steak man. organic fries with a chocolate martini that sent me over the moon. the following day after i struggled to get out of bed i began my scheduale. dublin is amazing the culture and history is second to none. from check in to check out those two days i was a world away. a special thankyou to all the staff in the hotel. they make you feel like a king.
",5,2007,09,12
207,Elegant and great service,"We booked a room with two double beds for 255 euro/night and 285 night on Saturday night. This was worth it! The hotel is very fancy on the exterior, I was concerned about it been stuffy but it was not. The breakfasts are expensive so we ate in other locations nearby. 

If you can afford this place or want to splurge, please do! One cannot beat the location and the furnishings were impecible.

The kids loved the muffins and cookie treats at reception and the bell-hops were super!

207,We'll be back!,"We hadn't been to Dublin for 20 years, so we did a substantial amount of research when deciding where to stay.  After much consideration, we chose the Shelbourne, and were delighted with our experience.   The hotel recently re-opened after a two year renovation, and our expectations were fully met.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful, both inside and out.  Our corner room (255 Euros a night) was huge, spotless, quiet and extremely comfortable.  The staff was attentive, friendly and efficient.  (Ask any staff person to see the Constitution Room.... they gladly showed it to us).  The location can't be beat.  We would highly recommend the Shelbourne for your trip to Dublin, whether it be for pleasure or business.

207,"Lovely Hotel, Fantastic Location but pricy.","Booked a 3 night stay at The Shelbourne Hotel Dublin via Expedia for an average room rate of £185 on a room only rate in a deluxe room with King size bed. Taxi from the Airport cost about 35 Euros.

The Hotel
Absolutley fab location overlooking the corner of St. Stephen’s Green about 5 mins walk from Grafton Street and 10 mins to Temple Bar area. Also very close to Taxi rank and pony and carriage rank for those romantic trips around the city!

This hotel has been extensively refurbished and we had a lovely luxurious room on the 7th floor with a small balcony but sadly a view overlooking offices and rooftops. The bed was fabulous and probably one of the best, most comfortable that we have ever slept in. Lovely bathroom with some nice toiletries etc and lovely plush towels. There were also free robes and slippers to wear. Nice TV and all other mod cons expected in a 5* hotel mini bar, safe etc but no in room Tea and Coffee making facilities! And to order a cup of each from room service would have cost approx 15 Euros! The breakfast menu was very expensive at 29.95 Euros each for a cooked breakfast not including drinks! We ate out every day as felt that the hotel’s offering could not possibly be worth over 60 euros for 2. 

We found Bewleys in Grafton Street did a fantastic breakfast with excellent choices from full Irish to basic toast etc for less than half the price of the hotel. And Bewleys is lovely. We did not eat in the hotel at all as it was just too pricy for us and we wanted to explore Dublin. The hotel is very popular with all the beautiful (rich) people of Dublin so the hotel bars were always very busy in the evenings with well turned out people and it seems like a very popular meeting place. Later this year they are opening a spa! 

Where we ate
We chose various restaurants/cafes for snacks/drinks throughout our stay but Bewleys was by far the best with fantastic huge cakes. Enjoyed Gallaghers Boxty House  in Temple Bar which was typically Irish with some interesting Irish dishes on the menu, excellent fast service and no need to book at 10pm. and this was by far the best VFM place we ate all weekend. We also enjoyed a Chinese at the Imperial Restaurant in Wicklow Street which was rather empty but had a good write up in rough guide and was lovely food. Our favourite meal was at a place called Il Baccaro which is in meeting house square (temple bar area) Fantastic little Italian tucked away in the corner, we had to book in advance but the food and service was 2nd to none all weekend.

Where we visited
Really enjoyed the City Tours guided bus tour around Dublin which cost about 12.50 Euros for a 24 hour ticket. (There are 3 or 4 companies doing these tours all with about 24 stops and we chose the cream and green bus). In hindsight we probably should have bought a 2 day pass as it would have been better value. The guided tour which visits all the top Dublin attractions was great with very informative and entertaining drivers who cracked jokes and had funny stories to tell all the way round. We stopped at Kilmainham Gaol which was a great guided tour with the chance to look inside and walk around this very old building that was built in 1894 and was used as a prison right up to the early 1920s. We got to go in the cells and heard all about the Easter Uprising of 1916. It was quite spooky really. We also went to the Guinness factory tour (doesn’t everybody!) and having paid our 12 Euros to get in (you get a discount with the bus ticket) we enjoyed an informative 2 hour ish self guided tour culminating in a trip to the bar on the top floor with fantastic views of all Dublin and a “free” pint of Guinness.

Shops
Well for shops, but for the Euros we could have been in London! Top Shop, M&S, Next, Debenhams, Oasis, Wallis, mobile phones etc etc and a few other shops with very similar names to UK ones. Dublin is a shoe shoppers paradise with more of these than any other and I still couldn’t find exactly what I was after. Typical!

Overall we really enjoyed our 3 nights in Dublin, but did not see very many Irish people! We could have been anywhere in the world really. Dublin was full of Eastern Europeans working in all the bars and restaurants and Dublin also seemed very popular with the American visitors. Sadly, also there were lots of beggars and vagrants who approached us every time we sat outside a restaurant on a terrace etc. This was a little annoying especially as they were all non Irish and often had babies strapped to their backs/fronts to try and get more sympathy! The restaurateurs chased them away but they were not easily shaken off. 

The street entertainers in Grafton Street were excellent and so were those in Temple Bar, also saw a few preachers but no one really took any notice of them! In summary a nice enjoyable break, Lots of churches to look round if this is your thing, but in our opinion, 3 days was long enough. Nice hotel, very helpful concierge etc but very pricy. Would we go to Dublin again? probably not.

",5,2007,08,29
207,way overpriced,"We stayed the Shelbourne for a special treat to celebrate our wedding anniversary and to have a night on our own (a break from our 6 month old son!).  I booked well in advance and therefore paid full rate for a 'heritage premium room'.  This was in the old part of the hotel and I thought it would be particularly special.  The service was as you would expect for a hotel of this price range: very attentive and helpful on check in.  However, the room was quite disappointing.  First, it was quite small.  The bed was luxurious, but it was pretty much the size of the room.  The furnishings were fancy, but some of them (not antiques) were already damaged.  The paint was chipped in places, some wallpaper peeling in the bathroom.  This, to me, is not acceptable for the €285 room price.  In addition, the hall was dingy, the ceiling rattled every time the guest above us walked across their room and the toilet shuddered and ran for several minutes every time it was flushed.  Since this was our one night away I did not want to spend it on the phone complaining to management.  Instead, I expressed my displeasure on check out.  I was offered a refund for the bottle of wine we had (about €30) in the room.  I was also told that 'lots of people' had complained about the creakiness of the ceiling but there was nothing they could do as it was a listed building!  They could start by charging LESS rather than more for those rooms!  Anyway, while the hotel is very nice, it is way overpriced.  If you want to drop this much cash on a room, go somewhere else.
",3,2007,08,26
207,"Beautiful hotel, bad value for money","Stayed in a room which cost EUR395 which was lovely but when we were checking out they tried to charge us for breakfast at EUR29 each! I was sure the rate I booked included bfast and indeed would not have booked room only under any circumstances. They eventually agreed to take it off and when I checked their website upon returning home the EUR395 rate does include breakfast. Good thing I persisted!

207,Lovely Hotel,"This hotel was lovely. It was perfectly located for us and we were more than happy with it. We would definitely consider staying there again.
",5,2007,08,17
207,"Overall, a Great Experience, but the Negative Reviews Have Merit","Readers may notice a more-than-usual love it or hate it review of this hotel, and, after 4 nights at the hotel last week,  I think I can explain why.  The folks that loved the Shelbourne appreciated the renovations and probably stayed in one of the original rooms overlooking St Stephen's Green, with great size and high ceilings (the traveller's photo is such a room: 5 stars out of 5.)  We stayed on this side after requesting a room change and reluctantly agreeing to pay a much higher rate (worth every penny, though.)

The hotel is extremely popular, and yes, the lobby can be chaotic and the bar and restaurant can be crazy and loud.  If you appreciated being part of this experience you would have given a thumb's up.   

On the other hand, those housed in the newer addition in the rear get nothing special - a small, albeit modern room with no view: 3 stars out of 5.  And if you are looking for a more quiet hotel in Dublin (if that is possible the summer of 2007!) you should look elsewhere.

What pushed me to a thumbs up was the staff, always positive and willing to please despite the intense pressures on their attention and time, a great meal in the Restaurant, and yes, staying in the superior front of the hotel, with the ability to imagine what it must have been like to experience the hotel in its original glory.  

One final comment.  The location is also perfect.  Minutes to Grafton Street, 10 minutes walk to Temple Bar.  And I wished I could have seen the REM show!
",5,2007,08,09
207,Wow!,"Wow! they really have spent some money on this place and it must be the best place in Dublin and in my view would rank as one of the finest hotel in Europe.

Nothing has been spared in refurbishing the hotel and it is back to it's former glory and maybe even better.

Book it go there see for yourself!

207,never again,"My husband booked two night stay as a surprise for my birthday. He had read of its refurbishment and felt that it would be the perfect hide away in a busy city. The hotel did not meet our expectations in many ways. Firstly we arrived on a Friday evening at 6.15 to find that our room was not ready. The noise level in the foyer was defeaning as both bars were full to capacity, 5 deep at the counter and the noise level was what you would expect in pub in Temple Bar. It was full of wannabes to the point that we had to walk the street and go to our room to get away from the noise and embarrassing behaviour of the clientelle.

We had dinner in the restaurant which was so noisy it was uncomfortable to eat (we had to be moved to a booth). We cancelled on second night, complained at reception and to the manager both had the same thing to say ""its a happening place in happening city where people who want to be seen go to"". NEVER AGAIN!

207,leaking toilet,"myself and my husband stayed for a weekend in this 5 star hotel and were disappointed to find a very small room,a 4ft6inch double bed,and an air freshner plugged in and when it was unplugged thats when we noticed the smell!! the staff had very kindly plugged in an air freshner so we wouldn notice the stench from the bathroom..nice.. we rang  reception to lodge a complaint about the room and were told the hotel was fully booked so we shut the bathroom door and asked to be moved in the morning.. by 12 oclock the next day we decided to ring as now the toilet was actually leaking..eventually my husband went down to speak to someone and they did move us but with no apologies and not very interested not a happy stay at all and just to add to it the room that we were moved to had a not very efficent  but loud air conditioning unit  we wont be going back in a hurry!!

207,The Shelbourne Shines!,"Our family of five checked into The Shelbourne for the last two days of a five week long trip to Ireland.  It could not have been more delightful.  The two adjoining rooms I'd requested were not available when we checked in, but they offered us a two bedroom suite for the same rate.  Their recent renovation was beautifully done.  We found the staff to be exceptionally friendly -- from the doorman to the concierge to the housekeeping staff.  Their location on St. Stephen's Green is centrally located to many of Dublin's attractions.  We enjoyed dinner in the Saddle Room restaurant and drinks at the bar called 27.  Our young children loved the hotel-provided babysitter, who came equipped with coloring books and crayons.  I highly recommend The Shelbourne as a high-end hotel that we found to be worth every penny.

207,Service with a smile...,"I have read the reviews of others, and wondered what room they  could have had to be ""small"". Our room was wonderful, King bed, sitting area, large screen tv and a lovely bathroom too along with a dressing area outside.  The location on St. Stephen's Great is really great also. We were worried on arrival, knowing it was a very nice hotel and after walking in the rain, we didn't look to good, but surprisingly as we walked through the door, a man took our bags and wisked us through the Wedding celebration that was in the lobby right to check in, which took all of 3 minutes, the bellboy had our luggage and showed us our room, total time...7 minutes.  I had called for ice, hung up the phone and there he was at the door, after our 2 great nights, at checkout it was pouring, the cab was at the door, luggage loaded and we were umbrella'd to the taxi door.  I have been to many, many hotels in the US and abroad, one of my best experiences so far, a Marriott Member I shall always remain!
",5,2007,07,19
207,Great Stay,"My boyfriend and I just returned from our trip to Ireland. We spent 3 nights in Dublin as we were in town for the REM concert at the Olympia Theater. 

Upon check-in we were greeted with smiling faces and the check-in process was very easy. We had very good help from the concierge who I believe was from Spain as he booked dinner reservations for us just down the road at Brown's. 

Our room as of nice size and there was a cheese and fruit platter waiting for us upon arrival. They had sent me a pre-arrival questionaire to fill out and I suppose they took queues from that. Very nice touch. 

The first evening we had drinks in both bars pre and post dinner- both were nice with good service. 

Our second day we walked around and attended the concert in the evening. Our plan was to leave the next morning for Cork but my boyfriend got a stomach bug and couldn't leave. 

I had booked my first 2 nights using Marriott rewards points and unfortunately had to pay for the 3rd night but what can you do?

The staff was amazing. Denise in the business center was a gem as she had some boiled 7up sent to the room for Bryan after she had heard me telling friends back home that he was sick. 

Our TV was broken as it wasn't allowing us to buy movies-- a day with a sick person in a hotel room can be a bit boring. The tech came up and couldn't figure it out but was very kind and tried to help Bryan and offered him to bring medicine. 

The offered us to move rooms but we couldn't manage the strength to gather all of our belongings. 

The next morning we were on our way to Killarney but had breakfast first. It was great...some of the best Chicken sausage ever and the fruit trays were just gorgeous. 

All in all the location was great, food & drink was good, and the staff was amazing. They made a horrible day a little bit better.

207,Posh and Pricey,"We just returned from a two night stay at the Shelbourne. The hotel is a piece of Irish history and still the Grand Dame of Dublin hotels. We used my husband's Marriott points for the stay so cost was not an issue for us. Check-in was efficient and friendly. Lemonade and cake was offered. The concierge upgraded our room, allowing for a view of St. Stephen's, albeit through a rather small window! The room was quite posh. The beds are amazingly comfortable, and the bath was divine. Nice little extras, like 2 bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, etc... My husband alerted the hotel that it was my birthday and they left some trufffles, fruit and soft drinks in the room. Always say that you are celebrating something! The staff were efficient-perhaps a bit staid, but this is the Shelbourne. Honestly, we never ate at the hotel as we found the prices to be hefty. We were a family of four on a budget so we stuck to late Pub lunches. (O'Neill's has a great, filling Guinness stew for 11euro). Also, you must indulge in one of the fantastic pastries at Leon. Expensive, but well worth it.  Overall, the hotel was fabulous.  We felt quite swanky staying there-however we probably could never afford to if we had to pay!
",4,2007,07,06
207,Disappointed - Big Let down,"We stayed at this the hotel for one night. The room was 300 euros per night not including breakfast. The room was tiny, the shower had no power.  The staff and doormen were extremely rude and came across as if they were doing us a favour. Drinks and food are way overpriced, although the food was very tasty. 

Overall I think this hotel was very uncomfortable to stay in. I would not recommend it to any of my friends or family. I was very disappointed; I was expecting a five star hotel and five star treatment..A big let down. If you want to stay in one of Dublin's five star hotels do not chose The Shelbourne,

207,Fantastic Experience,"My husband and I are still on a ""high"" from our five nights at the wonderful, newly renovated Shelbourne Hotel.  The location is terrific, in the heart of Dublin across from St. Stephen's Green, within walking distance of famous sights, shopping, restaurants, and just across the street from the City Tour stop. 

The historic property has just reopened after a two year restoration, preserving all the best features of the elegant Georgian buildings, but adding the most up-to-date conveniences.  You could spend an afternoon walking around the public rooms enjoying the authentic architectural details, Irish art, stained glass, lavish window treatments, chandeliers and gorgeous flower arrangements. Especially fascinating is the Constitution Room where Michael Collins helped draft the famous document.  Our spacious and exeptionally quiet room was beautifully appointed with a fabulously comfortable bed and large marble bath with all the best amenities.  

We are platinum level with Marriott this year so we were able to take advantage of the concierge suite called the Heritage Lounge which is open from 6 am until 9:30 pm, serving breakfast, midday snacks, afternoon tea, hors d'oeuvres and desserts. Besides serving delicious food and drink in the sumptuous surroundings, the Heritage team, led by the delightful Shauna, could not have been more helpful with dinner reservations, car rental, touring advice, shopping tips and even Irish history.  

A recent addition to the Shelbourne's services is that of Helen Kelly, the lovely and very competent Genealogy Butler, who, for a fee, will help you connect with your Irish roots.  Contact the hotel for an appointment and the preliminary questionairre needed before she meets with you, if you are interested.  Finding information about my ancestors during our stay was an unexpected bonus!

The Shelbourne's maxim is ""Delighted to serve"" and this is apparent in every staff member we met who was willing to go the extra mile to make our stay not just pleasant, but memorable.  I could cite many examples of dedicated employees who went out of their way to help us enjoy our stay.  In all our travels we have never encountered so many wonderfully friendly, professional and hospitable people in one place before.  We can only say great things about our experience at the Shelbourne and hope to return soon!

",5,2007,07,03
207,"In general, a great hotel in Dublin!","My husband and I stayed at the Shelbourne for his surprise 30th birthday trip.  Overall, we had a great stay!  I was a little leery when I decided to book here, only because there weren't a lot of reviews posted post-renovation of the hotel and change in management.  (I also booked the Westin and Four Seasons... ended up canceling both to stay at the Shelbourne.)  

The hotel itself is beautiful; the renovation has kept a lot of the original charm, but has provided all of the modern updates that are necessary for a 5 star property.  Location was great - we loved being able to wander around St. Stephen's Green when we had a few moments to spare each day, and it was a short walk to Grafton Street, Trinity, and Temple Bar.  We very rarely had to take taxis to get anywhere.

We arrived at noon to the hotel after an overnight flight, and were able to check into our room right away.  Service was courteous and prompt, everything we expected.  We were served a glass of lemonade while we checked in and the guest services folks sent a bottle of red wine and pitcher of iced tea to our room for my husband's birthday.

The room was great!  Although not huge (I believe we had a Deluxe), it was extremely clean and well-appointed.  I appreciated having outlets for many different types of plugs - it was nice being able to use my hair straightener and laptop without an adaptor.  Bed was extraordinarily comfortable.  My husband rated it the best bed he's ever slept in (although I argue the Ritz in Santiago is my fav, with this a close 2nd).  Bathroom was spacious, although I found the placement of towels and a place to hang them a little difficult/awkward.  I also 2nd a previous reviewer's comment that the bathrooms do get very steamy!  Housekeeping was generally good, although we did not receive turndown service on our first night there - but did get it on the 2nd night.  Sort of confusing...

I was surprised at how crowded the lobby and bars were in the evenings.  I knew that the property was one of the new hot spots in Dublin, but I didn't expect it to be a sea of people in the lobby and such a scene at all of the bars!  We almost weren't allowed into the No. 27 bar on Friday night because it was at capacity, but once we informed the bouncer that we were residents, we were allowed in.  However, because of so many people in the bar, getting a drink quickly was a challenge.  Same with the Horseshoe bar, it was so packed we didn't even wait around to get a drink there.

There were really only 2 small things that happened that would take away from an almost perfect review.  On Sunday, we went to get brunch in the Saddle Room.  We couldn't find hours of service anywhere for the restaurant, but we assumed that at 10:45am, getting brunch wouldn't be a problem.  We were given a table quickly, however, upon sitting down, the server informed us that they were closing in 10 minutes and if we wanted food we had to get up to get it ASAP.  Although the food was good, we had to rush to eat, and they took everything away after our first trip to the buffet.  We couldn't go back for juice or pastries.  I wish the hostess would've told us the restaurant was closing so that we could go somewhere else, or at least list the hours somewhere in the hotel info.  Also, on Sunday afternoon, we tried to get tea before leaving for the airport - we had about 30 minutes to spare.  While the Lord Mayor's lounge was full of people, the hostess showed us to seats in the No. 27 bar and said we could get tea in there.  However, we sat for 20 minutes without *anyone* acknowledging our presence and had to leave.  Both incidents, while small, made us disappointed that our overall great experience at the hotel was slightly marred.

Also, the 20 euro charge for 24-hours of internet is outrageous.  It would be one thing if we were on a business trip and could expense it, but I wasn't about to pay that much just to check e-mail.  I wish I had known in advance - I lugged my laptop all that way and didn't use it!  On top of that, there is a fee to use the computers in the business center - also unfortunate! 

But, overall, my husband and I agree it was a great stay and will definitely return there in the future.
",5,2007,07,02
207,Good not perfect,"My wife and I had dinner in the Shelbourne restaurant recently.  The hostess led us through the restaurant to a smaller room.  There were approximately 8 tables in the room, mostly empty, but she thoughtlessly placed us right next to another couple. The tables were practically together, we had not planned on dinner  with two strangers. I immediately asked if we could move to another table but was told they were reserved.  The hostess then said she would see what she could do, she disappeared and never returned. The room was very quiet and we could over hear every word and vice versa.  It was uncomfortable to be packed so close to another table and ridiculous as there were several empty tables.  After awhile the room filled up and increasing noise levels made it tolerable.  Apart from the poor seating arrangements the food and service were good but sadly over priced.
",2,2007,07,02
207,"Great dining, but tiny room","We were really looking forward to our weekend stay at The Shelbourne, especially after its recent re-vamp. The hotel is very impressive inside, great bars, lounge and restaurant areas. The staff are efficient and polite. We enjoyed a great dinner in the Saddle Room, expensive, but not overly-so considering the quality of the food and the attentive but not intrusive service, everything you'd expect from a hotel with such a high reputation. Problems? The very small size of the room. We had booked a Queen room, so the gods alone know how small a standard room would have been. Bathroom was OK, with an impressive-looking walk-in shower, but the water pressure was terrible and the shower control knob kept threatening to fall off. The only way I could dry my hair was to put a chair in front of the closed bathroom door, which had the only mirror (other than the bathroom mirror). There were the usual business acrutrements for internet connection etc. but a decent vanity area would have been preferable (can't believe there are huge numbers of business-people staying there). The large flat-screen TV with satellite was good, but why no tea & coffee facilities in the room? All in all, we did enjoy our stay, but felt it wasn't value for money, and probably wouldn't stay there again. The Shelbourne didn't live up to its reputation (apart from the dining/drinks) and we were disappointed.
",3,2007,07,02
207,Great hotel...but a glitch.,"But for our check in problems, the hotel would get at least a 4-star rating.  It is very recently renovated, and simply lovely.  The rooms are fair-sized for Dublin and very sound proof.  It is also a perfect location.  The big complaint is that our room was not ready to check in until almost 7pm.  We returned several times before then only to be told ""5 more minutes"".  That said, this is a superb hotel otherwise.

207,Loved the Shelbourne,"Stayed in Shelbourne for one night mid-week when on a shopping trip.  Would have in the past stayed in the Westbury but due to its failing standards we decided to try the Shelbourne and wow! The supposedly five star Westbury should take a leaf from their book.  This hotel is fantastic, the staff are so friendly and professional and really welcoming, the room was elegant and the bed so comfortable.  Have booked to go back for a full weekend in December.
",5,2007,06,28
207,Almost perfection,"So close to being perfect. First, I need to go on about what a splendid job they did renovating this place. Still the classiest hotel in Dublin but now classy and chic and modern. Public areas are beautiful, flower arrangements stunning, everything spotless, clean and colors and styles are stand out but not overdone. The staff is very professional. The rooms are very well decorated and for being on the smaller side, very comfortable. The linens are luxurious, the bed is divine [although my partner thought it too ""fluffy""] and there is air conditioning [we were there during a freak hot spell]. Bathrooms are spacious and come with the usual amenities.

So why not perfect but only close. Three things: First, all of the extras such as breakfast, coffee, wireless access, business center computer, parking, etc are way over priced. For the going room rate, I would have at least expect a coffee maker [like every where else in Ireland] or a bit less nickel and diming. Second, although the whole property went through a renovation, they didn’t seem to get down the idea of bathroom ventilation down. I would think it would be relatively easy to make a shower not steam up the mirror in these days of modern science. And last, when someone leaves the room late in the day [which happens a bit on weekends in Dublin] they should not need to call housekeeping to have the room made up.

207,Luxury First Rate Service and Attention,"My husband and I spent 2 nights here and loved it. The service was second to none. The location was convenient for sightseeing and pub hopping. The beds rate right up there with the Westin Heavenly Beds. We will definitely stay there again and recommend it to everyone.

207,Surprise engagement,"Stayed in the shelbourne for the weekend and surprised my girlfriend by proposing on friday night, Matthew and Anna in the saddle bar were excellent. There was a mix up with my restaurant reservation but before panic set in they sorted me out with a booth and got the pastry chief make up something special for me to surprise her. They also provided us with some free champagne and the reception sent us a bottle of wine. The atmosphere was excellent and the location for the shopping unbeatable.... our room was a heritage room and one of the best I’ve ever stayed in. We will be back next year for our anniversary and if things go half as smoothly as this visit we will both be satisfied. Thanks again Matthew and Anna for all your help

207,worth the wait and every bit what I expected,"I anxiously waited for our visit. We were not disappointed. Wonderful location, wonderful restaurant and room and exectionally friendly and helpful staff. Denis, the head concierge, is what you would expect in the european tradition. Dobbins and other restaurants he chose for us were most enjoyable. Their rating is a solid 5.

207,Fabulous Shelbourne,"We were fortunate to stay in the Shelbourne for two nights in May and this is a beautiful and well located hotel.  This is a real 5 star hotel in any part of the world.

The customer service was great from the reception desk to the bell hop.  The renovation is beautifully done while still retaining the character of the hotel.  Our room was lovely, the bed comfortable, the bathroom had everything you need including a power shower and wonderful products.  The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet.  

I can't comment on the hotel restuarants because we only used room service for coffee.  Room service was prompt and the coffee was great.

I hope to return someday and hope the smiles that were on all of the employees faces are still there.  The excellent customer service is what will make me want to return again and again.

207,Superior Shelbourne,"The Shelbourne was fantastic, with service superior.  My husband and I, along with our daughter and son-in-law stayed here in May 2007, using Marriott points, but would definitely stay here again even if we had to pay!  The location was perfect, just a block down from Doheny and Nesbitt and within walking distance of most everything.  Excellent!
",5,2007,06,09
207,Excellence in Dublin,"My husband and I normally stay at the Westin in Dublin, but for the weekend we wanted a reservation, it was fully booked, so we went in search of a 5 star property that suited us.  The Shelbourne met and exceeded every expectation we have for a luxury hotel.  From the moment we arrived curbside the service, attention to detail, and staff attentiveness never faltered.  From the offer of lemonade and a brownie at check in, to our wonderful bathroom complete with bath salts and luxury robe, every portion of our stay was excellent.  

Our initial stay was for only one night, as we were continuing on to the Sheraton Fota Island Resort in Cork the following day, but we were so impressed with The Shelbourne that we booked a suite for a night following our return from Cork.  That overnight suite reservation turned into a two-night stay!  

Room service, housekeeping, bellman, and check-in staff were all pleasant, professional, and discreet.  Room service from the Saddle Bar was fantastic and they accomodated things that were not on their menu easily and cheerfully.  No doubt, we will stay at the Shelbourne again and again.  Although it may be on the pricey side for some, we believe it's worth every penny.

",5,2007,06,07
207,The good life,"Every need is taken care of,  Food , drink entertainment, travel is all excellent.  The location is the best in Dublin.
But it's pricey, very.   No free internet access, I found that rediculous for a place like this.

207,The Old Lady of the Green restored to its former glory,"The hotel has been superbly restored with really excellent finish to all the rooms and public areas. 

We stayed for one night in a Delux double and when the front desk found out that we had a special anniversary, a complimentary bottle of champagne with strawberries and chocolates  was delivered to our room. The rooms at the rear are quiet and extreemly well finished. 

The staff are young very eager to assist and starting to settle in to there new roles. The ambience of the old hotel has settled back into the new surroundings very well. We had lunch in the bar, dinner in the saddle room and breakfast also in the saddle room. Drinks in the bar and residents lounge.....and 2 o'clock in the morning is just as pleasent as early evening with no pressure on you to get to bed.  

The food in the saddle room was vey good with very relaxed surroundings and excellent service. Its very much stilled on a classy American steak house theme with super steaks and shell fish. Not cheap. Lunch in the bar was also good but servie a little bit slow - But since it was back doing what Dublin does best - raining - who cares.

The pool and other facilities are not yet open, so cannot comment

This isn't a budget hotel but it certainly is worth the extra investment.
",5,2007,05,27
207,Pure luxury!,"Stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel for one night .... so sorry it couldn't have been for longer!  This Hotel is absolutely gorgeous and the staff are very friendly, efficient and attentive.  While we were checking in we were offered hot towels and a glass of homemade lemonade and muffins .... really nice touch.

We had a double room with a kingsize bed - the furnishings are really lovely and the bed was very comfortable, huge plasma tv, cd player - the bathroom was huge .... bathrobes, slippers, really  nice toiletries.  Attention to detail is very high.

If money is no object then this hotel is perfect.  We were on a budget so we decided to take the bus  (think No. 746) from outside the arrivals hall at the airport and it dropped us of at the side of the hotel at a cost of €1.90 per person .... extremely good value.  We decided to get a taxi back to the airport and it cost just under €30 which isn't bad.

This hotel is in a fabulous location for exploring Dublin - we decided not to spend €30 each on breakfast in the Hotel but went to a diner very near for less than €10 each.  

Would love to go back .... hopefully on a bigger budget the next time!

207,Shelbourne New and Improved,"The newly remodeled and renovated Shelbourne reopened March 12th after being closed for almost two years. Since then I spent five nights in the hotel and it is better than ever. (Have been staying here since 1989). General Manager Liam Doyle has done a brilliant job with the new staff. As a frequent world traveler the new Shelbourne is my favorite hotel.

207,Delighted to Serve,"I've just returned only a few days ago from The Shelbourne Dublin. I was originally staying in another hotel just across the park, but one visit to this magnificent beauty and I knew I had to change hotels. The concierge even came to pick me up from the other hotel.
As one knows, beauty is only skin deep, but The Shelbourne's allure goes far beyond. In addition to it's historical significance is it's attitude of service, which was what I loved about this hotel most of all. Nothing was a bother, as ""Delighted to Serve""  truly is in the heart of every employee. From the the conciege who hand delivered forgotten car rental keys to the Dublin airport rental agency, to the doorman who held on to my room pass as I left for a quick walk, to the chef who made my eggwhite/no oil omelete just to my pleasing. The list goes on and on.
And then there is the location. Not only does The Shelbourne sit directly across from St. Stephen's Green, but this hotel is only a short walk from many of Dublin's best restaurants, pubs, shops, and major tourist attractions such as Trinity College, The Post Office and even the Temple Bar area to name only a few.
This review could go on and on, as the newly reopened and refurbished luxurious Shelbourne has so much to offer. I imagine that soon the word will get out and it will be listed on Trip Advisor as one of the best hotels in Dublin, if not the best. By the way, this is not a paid advertisement. I'm just an average gal from Orange County, California who now loves Ireland and can't wait to go back!

207,Hotel eccezionale nel cuore di Dublino,"Hotel di lusso davvero molto bello situato nel centro di Dublino vicino a St Stephen's Green e, dunque, ideale per visitare a piedi la città. Abbiamo soggiornato in una camera Deluxe con letto king: la stanza era ben arredata, pulita e molto spaziosa, così come il bagno in marmo e le armadiature; le finestre sono molte ampie così da rendere l’ambiente molto luminoso. Tutto è curato nei minimi dettagli e il letto è molto comodo. La colazione, servita nella Saddle Room, è abbondante e varia (si può scegliere tra colazione continentale o irlandese, oltre ad opzioni à la carte). Durante il soggiorno, abbiamo usufruito anche del servizio in camera, molto professionale: il cibo era squisito e il cameriere preparato. L’hotel offre, inoltre, una svariata serie di bar e ristoranti tutti molto belli e tra loro differenti: tra questi, abbiamo provato solo il No. 27 bar e l’esperienza è stata più che positiva. 
Tutto il personale (dallo staff del check-in/reception al Concierge fino al personale di servizio e ai portieri) è davvero molto gentile e disponibile. Molto comodo il servizio di couverture serale.

E' una struttura molto grande e per certi versi un po' anonima. Alcuni bar sono molto carini e sempre pieni di gente. Purtroppo siamo capitati durante la ristrutturazione della reception e questo ci ha creato un po' di disagio.

207,C'era una volta lo Shelbourne!,"Shelbourne
27/12
Arriviamo alle 12,40. Pur avendo richiesto in prenotazione ""check in anticipato"" la camera non è disponibile, transeat.... daltronde non è garantita!
Per aspettare decidiamo di mangiare qualcosa al bar ""No. 27"" dove ci sediamo alle 13,10. Attendiamo 20' e solo su nostra sollecitazione viene presa ordinazione. Si fanno le 13,30. 
 Vorremmo ordinare un fish cowder, ma è finito!!!
Ordiniamo un classico sandwich al pollo e un chicken korma.  Oltre ciò chiediamo un caffe americano decaffeinato, ma ci viene detto che anche il caffè decaffeinato  è finito!!!
Alle 14,10 (alias 40' di attesa ed un'ora da quando ci siamo seduti) arriva quanto ordinato. 
Il sandwich ha al suo interno dei pezzi di pollo e null'altro, niente maionese, niente formaggio, niente pomodoro, il tutto poggiato su delle foglie di insalata!!! Un sandwich comprato per strada è migliore!
Nulla da dire sul chicken korma.
Peraltro sul tavolo macinini per sale e pepe ben contraddistinti.... peccato che tutti e due contenevano pepe!
Si fanno le 15,00. Torniamo alla reception dove ci viene detto che la camera non è pronta adducendo come giustificazione che avendo noi chiesto una camera su piano alto ed essendo la stessa occupata con clinte che ha optato per un ""late checkout"", dobbiamo aspettare almeno altri 30 minuti. (Suona come una presa in giro!)
Siamo alla presa in giro!!!!
Non ci rimane che aspettare. La giornata è ormai rovinata. Pensavamo di poter avere la camera in tarda mattina in modo da avere il pomeriggio libero, ma così non è considerando che i negozi chiudono tra le 17 e le 18!
Alle 16,10 ci viene al fine consegnata chiave camera. 
Per il resto nulla da dire salvo che il personale non ha più quel senso di appartenenza che lo rendeva simpatico e vicente. I comportamenti sono piatti come in qualsiasi altro albergo!
Peccato. 
Lo Shelbourne che conoscevamo non esiste più!
Con l'acquisto da parte del gruppo statunitense Kennedy Wilson e la gestione Marriot lo Shelbourne è diventato uno dei tanti. Per la serie ""come si distrugge un caso di successo""!!!
A non più rivederci.",3,2018,01,07

Leider ist das Frühstück (29€) viel zu teuer für das was geboten wird, ebenso der Nachmittagstee (49€ Paischale). Der Kaffee ist ziemlich schrecklich, der Service nicht überragend (Amenities wurden nicht richtig aufgefüllt, keine Ersatzserviette beim Frühstück, Joghurt bei Frühstück um 08:00 aus, Kaffee wird nicht nachgefüllt...).

207,Hotel für viele Anlässe - Lage perfekt für Besucher der Stadt,"wir waren zu einem verlängerten Wochenendbesuch in Dublin mit Freunden und wählten das Shelbourne. Es war eine sehr gute Wahl, weil es einerseits ein hervorragendes Haus in bester Lage ist, aber vor allen Dingen waren außer dem sehr guten Twin bedded room auch die Räumlichkeiten 'Horse Shoe Bar' und 'Lord Mayor's Lounge' für uns alle ein Treffpunkt vor - nach oder zwischen den Besuchen bei den nahen Stadtattraktionen. Diese beiden Plätze waren eigentlich ständig gut besucht, aber das immer sehr sehr freundliche Servicepersonal hatte auch für eine Gruppe von 8 Personen immer einen Platz gefunden. Wie schon im Prospekt geschrieben, haben wir einen guten Querschnitt der Gästekultur kennengelernt. Eine Hochzeitsgesellschaft, die sich dort sammelte, eine Gruppe junger Leute, die den letzten freien Tag des Bräutigams feierten, junge Leute, die scheinbar nach dem Büroalltag sich hier trafen, ähnlich einer Pub, aber auf hohem Niveau. Sicherlich waren, wie im Prospekt beschrieben, auch Millionäre, Schauspieler und Künstler hier, allerdings haben wir sie dann wohl nicht erkannt.
Wir kommen gerne wieder !",5,2016,10,16

una sera abbiam cenato anche al ristorante dell'hotel: davvero curato in tutto: piatti, location  e presentazione! fortemente consigliate la colazione e il momento del the! le camere molto belle, anche se i letti (a meno che prendiate un king) sono per uno comodissimo, o due ""molto intimi"" in quanto non son larghi come un matrimoniale italiano!  recensione positivissima, ci tornerei in questo momento !!!",4,2016,09,23
207,Fantastischer Aufenthalt,"Geschäftlich war es mir vergönnt 4 Nächte im renommierten Shelbourne Hotel zu nächtigen. Beruflich lerne ich mehr und mehr auf die auch kleinen vielleicht zunächst unscheinbaren Details zu achten.
Trotz der kompletten Auslastung zu meinem Aufenthalt, wirkte jeder Mitarbeiter stets freundlich und zuvorkommend, eine stressige Situation wurde gekonnt in eine humorvolle und angenehme Atmosphäre gewandelt. 
Ich musste mir zwar das Zimmer mit einem Kollegen teilen, dennoch hatten wir ausreichend Platz, alles war blitzblank sauber und man fand jeden Tag eine andere kleine Aufmerksamkeit auf seinem Zimmer. 
Das Hotel ansich in top Lage ist im Renaissance Stil gehalten, aber nicht zu erdrückend, sodass man sich sehr wohlfühlt. Es gibt sogar ein kleines Museum, dass die Geschichte des Hotels mit Exponaten wiederspiegelt.
Auch das Frühstück(-sbuffet) war ebenfalls ein Traum, sodass ich dem Hotel gerne die Bestnote übergebe.",5,2016,09,01
207,Erholsamer Schlaf mitten in der Stadt,"Zu Beginn des Aufenthalts mussten wir noch den Haustechniker bitten, ein offenes Fenster zu schließen, das sich verzogen hatten und vom Room-Service ignoriert worden war, aber dann wurde es ein angenehmer Aufenthalt in einem guten Stadthotel. Hervorzuheben sind die ganz ausgezeichneten Betten, die großzügigen, gut ausgestatteten Badezimmer und ein funktionierender Turn-down-Service. Die Zimmer sind zwar relativ groß, aber leider etwas vollgestellt mit ausladenden Sesseln. Das Frühstückbuffet ist ausreichend groß und der Service sehr freundlich. Etwas Zeit muss man für das Valet-Parking ansetzen. Ebenfalls sehr gut ist die Lage am Park mitten in der Stadt, so dass man alle Sehenswürdigkeiten bequem zu Fuß erreichen kann. 
Insgesamt ist das Hotel aber zu teuer, weil man für die erhobenen Preise dann doch den Tick mehr an vorausschauendem Service, die absolute Perfektion in den Zimmern und bei der Sauberkeit sowie großzügige Aufenthaltsbereiche ohne Beschallung erwartet, was es am Ende dann doch nicht gibt.",4,2016,08,24

Überhaupt war das Bett spektakulär -riesiggroß und unglaublich hoch aufgrund des sehr üppigen Boxspringaufbaus. Wir haben sehr. sehr gut geschlafen.
Das Frühstücksbufett war gut und reichhaltig, mit 25 Euro für die warme Variante aber auch im oberen Preissegment.

Menzione speciale per il concierge Denis, che appena arrivati ci ha aiutati a ritrovare un bagaglio disperso, permettendoci non stravolgere negativamente la nostra vacanza.

Fino a questo momento avevo valutato l'hotel come un buon 4/5 stelle (la colazione degna di un 4 stelle) ma adesso lo rivaluto a 2 stelle per il servizio, lento e pigro.

207,Mitten in einem Buch von Jane Austin gelandet,"Ich liebe dieses Hotel. Ich habe viele Jahre in Dublin gelebt und bin einmal im Monat zum Afternoon Tea dorthin gegangen - das war ein kleiner Luxusurlaub vom Alltag.

Das erste Mal dort zu übernachten war ein lang gehegter Wunsch - teuer, aber jeden Penny wert. Das Hotel ist vollständig saniert worden ohne ihm seinen Charme zu rauben. Die Zimmer sind wunderbar luxuriös, schöne Bäder mit vielen handtüchern und jedwedem Luxus. Man muss das aber mögen, die teilweise sehr opulente Pracht. Ein kleines Stück altes England mitten im trubeligen Dublin.

Unbedingt sollte man ein Zimmer nach vorne raus zum Stephens Green nehmen. Es ist zwar etwas lauter wenn die Fenster auf sind, aber es lohnt sich!

Das Hotel liegt mitten im Zentrum, nahe an Grafton Street, wo man toll einkaufen kann oder auch nur bummeln (ich empfehle Brown Thomas, eine Institution). Auch Theater oder Pubs sind in der Nähe. Das Shelbourne hat ebenfalls zwei Bars, die in der Art wie die anderen Pubs sind, nur etwas teurer. Man also getrost woanders sein Pint trinken.

Preislich ist das Hotel schon ordentlich teuer, man bezahlt verhältnismäßig viel. Da muss man wollen. Ich kann es jedem Jane Austen Fan nur empfehlen - ein Erlebnis. Für die Fans des minimalistischen Designs ist es wohl eher ein Albtraum.",5,2014,12,18
207,Bello ma con qualche sbavatura,"Ho soggiornato 4 notti nella settimana di Halloween appena passata. E' indubbiamente un buon albergo e anche bello. Posizione centrale, elegante, belli i due bar e bellissima la sala da the (attenzione però al prezzo: the pomeridiano con tartine e dolcetti e mini-tramezzini = 38 euro), buonissimi i biscottini offerti alla reception. Camera ampia, ottimamente fornita del necessario (pure ombrelli in caso di pioggia), e arredata in stile, anche con chaise-longue. Servizio piscina e palestra ottimi. Lo consiglio ma qualche sbavatura c'è, e in un 5 stelle non dovrebbe esserci. Non c'è un salottino in cui appartarsi per leggere o conversare: è vero che ci sono i bar, ma magari si vuole solo leggere e non consumare, e poi qualche bel salottino in stile sarebbe pure bello da vedersi. Poi, la moquette è pulita ma inizia a mostrare qualche macchiolina, e se la rinnovassero sarebbe meglio. Comunque, pulizia ottima dappertutto, Sala colazioni bella e varia, con molto assortimento di salato (un po' meno di dolce, ma è capibile dato il Paese). Bellissimi anche gli addobbi per Halloween, e immagino altrettanto belli saranno a Natale. Ci tornerei certamente. Io avevo camera de-luxe.",4,2014,11,05
207,Grand old Lady in zeitgemäßen Gewand,"Wenn schon Dublin, dann doch ins Shelbourne. So haben wir bei dieser Kurzreise gedacht. Insgesamt wurden wir auch nicht enttäuscht.
Das Shelbourne befindet sich in einem wunderschönen Gebäude und auch die öffentlichen Bereiche können mit diesem Standard mithalten. Die von manchen Gästen bemängelte Bahnhofsatmosphäre konnten wir nicht feststellen. Allerdings ist der öffentliche Bereich im Erdgeschoß etwas verwinkelt, aber sehr schön und geschmackvoll ausgestaltet. 
Bei der Ankunft wurden wir herzlich begrüßt und unser Gepäck in Empfang genommen. Leider waren die Zimmer um 13:30 noch nicht bezugsbereit, was man aber akzeptieren kann, da die offizielle Check-In-Time mit 15:00 angegeben wird. Dass viele andere Hotels auch schon vor 15:00 die Zimmer bereit stellen, sei dahingestellt. Einen gewissen Ausgleich erhielten wir durch einen Late-Ceckout am Abreisetag. 
Was uns weniger zufrieden stellte, war die Tatsache, dass trotz mehrmaligen entsprechenden Hinweisen unsererseits und mehrmaligen Bestätigungen durch das Hotel, die Zimmer doch nicht federfrei waren. Das Personal benötigte auch drei Anläufe bis tief in die Nacht, bis beide Zimmer für Allergiker geeignet waren. 
Das begegnete uns im Hotel auf Schritt und Tritt. Sehr freundliche Mitarbeiter, die jedoch bei Abweichungen von der Norm, zusehends ins straucheln gerieten. Sonderwünsche korrekt zu erfüllen, gehört für uns aber zum Service eines 5-Sterne Hotels einfach dazu. Deshalb hier ein wenig Punktabzug. Positiv hervorheben möchten wir ausdrücklich den Head-Concierge Dennis O'Brien, der noch ein Concierge alter Schule ist und für unsere Wünsche zu Hochform auflief. 
Wirklich sehr gut empfanden wir das Hotelrestaurant Saddle Room. Fisch und Seafood vom Feinsten. Insbesondere die Austerngerichte, z.B. Austern Shelbourne und Austern Rockefeller, waren ein Gedicht. Leider sind die Preise entsprechend gesalzen, aber für die gebotene Qualität akzeptabel. Der Service war freundlich und professionell. 
Afternoon Tea in der Lord Mayors Lounge ist ebenfalls ein sehr angenehmes Erlebnis. Die 27-Bar serviert gute Drinks und verfügt auch über eine interessante Karte für Snacks, war uns aber abends eindeutig zu laut. 
Die Lage des Hotels ist natürlich über jeden Zweifel erhaben.
Die Premium-Deluxe-Zimmer sind klassisch ausgestattet. Penibel sauber und dem Niveau des Hauses entsprechend. Es ist ausreichend Platz vorhanden und die Badezimmer sind wirklich sehr groß. Der Stil ist für manchen vielleicht etwas zu klassisch - uns hat es gefallen.  
All in all ein sehr schöner und angenehmer Aufenthalt. Beim Service noch ein wenig nachsteuern und das Angebot stimmt. Aber das ist jammern auf hohem Niveau. 
Nach unserer Heimkehr meldete sich die Guest-Relations-Managerin noch einmal und hat sich für das Tohuwabohu bezüglich der Federkissen und -betten entschuldigt. Als Wiedergutmachung hat man uns für den nächsten Aufenthalt 20% Discount und ein upgrade auf das Heritage-Level zugesagt. Fortsetzung folgt nach unserem nächsten Besuch im Shelbourne.",5,2014,08,11
207,Excelente servicio y ubicación,Esta situado en la zona más céntrica de Dublin. El servicio es excelente. Muy amables y serviciales. Limpieza total. Están todo el tiempo limpiándolo todo. Los restaurantes excelentes. Las habitaciones muy justas de tamaño pero muy bien decoradas. En resumen un excelente hotel y muy recomendable.,5,2014,08,06
207,Excelente Hotel!!!!!!!,"El hotel es hermoso y esta muy bien ubicado. Esta a solo 2 cuadras de la peatonal de Dublin, la zona comercial y a unas cuadras de los principales pubs. Es realmente un hotel 5 estrellas, la habitacion super comoda, el baño 10 puntos, con ducha y bañadera. El Healthclub estaba muy bien tambien. El desayuno y su servicio son excelentes. Muy amable el personal del hotel. Altamente recomendable!",5,2014,06,09
207,Klasse Hotel,"Wir waren hier anlässlich eines Business-Meetings von Mittwoch bis Sonntag.
Das Hotel liegt hervorragend zentral, alles ist fussläufig erreichbar. Die Zimmer sind schön, unseres da zurück gelegen auch nicht so laut.
Das Frühstück ließ keine Wünsche offen.
Lediglich die Bar am Abend war zu laut und der Service in der Bibliothek deutlich verbesserungsfähig.",5,2014,05,29
207,"Precioso hotel, gran servicio y excelente ubicación","Antes de llegar a la recepción, una persona nos recibió y nos llevó a registrarnos; un detalle bastante inusual.  El hotel muy agradable con unos salones y restaurantes hermosos y alimentos de gran calidad.  Tomamos el te un día y fueron buenísimos los alimentos y el servicio.  La ubicación no puede ser mejor, nos encantó el hotel.",5,2014,04,03
207,fantastico,"bellissimo hotel in centro a Dublino, addobbato fantasticamente per le feste natalizie! ottimi i biscotti allo zenzero alla reception! Le camere sono stupende, i bagni pulitissimi! La colazione strepitosa, le sale al ground floor sono una più bella dell'altra! Promosso a pieni voti!!!!",5,2014,01,06
207,"Gutes Hotel, viel Personal, aber auch viel zu teuer","Ich denke das Hotel zehrt von seinem Ruf. Die Lage ist optimal, aber für diesen Preis sind die Zimmer zu klein und zu dunkel. Die Atmosphäre im Eingangsbereich ähnelt einer belebten Bahnhofshalle, Es gibt unendlich Personal welches auch ausgesucht freundlich ist, aber ein Gefühl von Luxus hat sich bei mir nicht eingestellt.

Wir hatten 2 Einzelzimmer bei einem war die Minibar gefüllt, bei dem anderen total leer. Das blieb auch die 2. Nacht so. Normalerweise sind Minibars für mich kein Thema, aber in so einem Hotel sollte das nicht vorkommen. Der vorhandene Kleiderschrank war gefüllt mit Tresor, Bügelbrett und Bügeleisen. Für Kleider ist darin kein Platz.",4,2013,11,27
207,Ottimo hotel e grande location,"Situato nel pieno centro di Dublino, offre un servzio a 5 stelle. Estrema pulizia e cortesia del personale. Dotato anche di piscina. Molto buono anche il ristorante, anche se i prezzi non sono proprio economici. Forse la temperatura nelle camere è eccessiva, ma comunque sono molto ben isolate.",4,2013,10,04
207,Guter Platz zum Teetrinken - aber nicht zum Übernachten!,"Wegen einer Flugverspätung kamen wir erst kurz vor Mitternacht im Hotel an. Wir hatten bereits ein halbes Jahr zuvor ein ""Heritage Park View""-Zimmer (größeres Gästezimmer mit Blick zum St. Stephen's Green) reserviert, das mehrfach bestätigt wurde. Beim Check-in wurde uns ein ""suite-upgrade"" angekündigt. Nach längerem Herumirren samt Gepäck - (niemand hielt es für notwendig uns zu begleiten oder sich um das Gepäck zu kümmern) - fanden wir die sogenannte ""Suite"" in einem abgelegenen Seitentrakt des Hotels. Sie war offensichtlich seit langem unbenutzt (überall dicke Staubschichten und völlig verdreckte Fensterscheiben). Vor allem aber lag sie zu einem finsteren Lichthof hin mit Brandmauern unmittelbar vor den ""Fenstern"", in dem eine riesige Belüftungsanlage einer Garage o.ä. die ganze Nacht über Lärm und Gestank verbreitete. Trotz unseres sofortigen Protestes und des Hinweises auf eine mehrfach bestätigte Reservierung eines weitaus besseren Zimmertyps stellte uns die Rezeptionistin erst für den nächsten Tag eine entsprechende Übersiedlung in Aussicht. Das hat dann auch - wenn auch erst nach mehrfacher Intervention unsererseits - geklappt. 
Meine Bewertung bezieht sich daher ausdrücklich auf die erste Nacht - die aber natürlich für den Gesamteindruck eines Hotels von entscheidender Bedeutung ist.
 Diverse andere Service-Mängel sind zwar weniger gewichtig, tragen aber auch zu einem doch recht mäßigen Eindruck bei. So war der angekündigte abendliche Turn-Down-Service nur auf ausdrückliche Anforderung erhältlich und beschränkte sich dann auf das Aufschlagen des Bettes - weiter nichts. (Das macht z.B. Mandarin Oriental ungleich besser; für die ist aber auch ""Hospitality"" kein Fremdwort.)

Lobend erwähnen wollen wir unseren Besuch in der ""Lord Mayor's Lounge"" zum Afternoon Tea - hier hat alles hervorragend funktioniert und wir haben hier angenehme zwei Stunden verbracht.
Gleiches gilt für die ""Bar 27"".

Unbefriedigend war auch die Reaktion des Hotels auf mein ausführliches Feed-back. Erst einmal war es schon schwierig, überhaupt eine geeignete Ansprechperson bzw. -adresse ausfindig zu machen. Die bei anderen Gästen offenbar übliche automatische Zusendung eines Feed-back-Fragebogens wurde bei uns wohlweislich unterlassen. Erst ganze 16 Tage nach unserer unerfreulichen Erfahrung erhielten wir dann eine Antwort, die lediglich eine Entschuldigung für Nebensächlichkeiten enthielt. Das komplette Versagen der Verantwortlichen bei der Handhabung unserer Reservierung - die ja schließlich einen gültigen Vertrag darstellt - wurde hingegen vom ""Director of Operations"" weiterhin als großzügiges ""Angebot"" eines ""upgrade"" hingestellt - da fühlt man sich als zahlender Kunde (bei einem ohnehin schon ""günstigen"" Übernachtungspreis von € 344,-) nicht wirklich ernst genommen. 

Als Kompensation wurde uns übrigens eine Gratis-Nacht angeboten (nein danke!) oder alternativ zusätzliche Marriott-Rewards-Punkte. Nun denn - die werden wir sicher in einem anderen Hotel einlösen.

Fazit: Gehen Sie zum Tee-Trinken oder auch auf ein Bier ins ""Shelbourne"" aber übernachten Sie nicht dort.",2,2013,07,31
207,"Grande atmosfera, grande fascino","Abbiamo soggiornato per 3 notti in questo hotel pieno di storia e quindi di fascino.
Professionalità e cortesia, colazione ottima.
Da vedere il museo per ""entrare"" nell'atmosfera dello Shelbourne, da provare anche la spa, molto accogliente e rilassante.
Prezzi da grand hotel, ma ottima posizione per visitare Dublino.",5,2013,07,29
207,Elegantissimo!!!!!,"Ci sono stata questa estate, con la mia famiglia per una vacanza di qualche giorno nella splendida città di Dublino. L'hotel si trova in una zona molto bella, abbastanza vicina ai monumenti principali e anche all'affascinante St Stephen's Green park. E' un hotel enorme con sei piani e stanze molto belle, pulite, accoglienti e curate, dei ristoranti semplicemente fantastici e un ingresso molto lussuoso. Bello anche il bar, gentile il personale: complessivamente è uno dei migliori hotel in cui sia mai stata!",5,2013,06,17
207,Excelente servicio,"Céntrico, con una gran historia de Hotel de referencia en Dublín, amplias habitaciones, merece la pena el dinero que pagas. Excelente servicio de recepción, atentos a satisfacer las necesidades. Estuvimos alojados durante nuestro aniversario de boda y nos sorprendieron con unos regalos y un arreglo especial en la habitación. Excelente. Imprescindible tomarse una Guiness o un coctail a media tarde, en el Longue, lugar ideal para ver y dejarse ver en Dublin",5,2013,05,06
207,molto bello,"Ho trovato l'albergo molto bello ed elegante, personale perfetto, gentilezza al massimo. Buonissimi i bar e il ristorante. La prima colazione è perfetta e adatta a tutti i gusti. La posizione poi è strategica, difronte al St Stephen's Green parco molto curato e delizioso per le citazioni sulle donne, a pochi passi dalla casa di Oscar Wilde. Bello.",4,2013,04,15
207,di stile,"Soggiornato qui a metà gennaio. Reception ineccepibile, check in e check out velocissimi. Camera spaziosa, peccato per la vista che non era granchè. Buon posizionamento, vicino a Grafton Street. Di ottima qualità il ristorante all'interno dell'hotel. Bellissima la hall con il caminetto :)) sembra di essere proiettati in un'altra epoca.",4,2013,03,15
207,Outstanding,"Das Shelbourne Hotel ist eine der besten Adressen Dublins. Nicht nur die Lage, sondern auch der Service, das Essen, SPA und Wellness sowie die Räumlichkeiten sind 1a. Bei einem Besuch sollte unbedingt der SPA Bereich aufgesucht werden. Der Relax Raum mit großen Fenstern und Blick auf den Park ist einzigartig.

Im Gegensatz zu Four Season & Co. sind insbesondere die klassisch schöne Fassade und die Räumlichkeiten mit viel Stuck unübertrefflich.",5,2013,01,28
207,"Tolle lage, mittelmaessiger service","Das shelbourne wird ja durchaus als eines der besten business-hotels in dublin gehandelt. Diesem anspruch wird es jedenfalls im interntionalen massstab nicht ganz gerecht. Die zimmer sind recht klein und teilweise etwas ""verwohnt"" bis renovierungsbeduerftig. Die qualitaet des service wird dem 5* anspruch nicht ganz gerecht; z.b. wurde vergessen, das am abend vor abreise bestellte taxi zum flughfn zu organisieren. Sehr nett dagegen die lage im stadtzentrum sowie die bar.",3,2013,01,06
207,molto bello,"hotel molto bello. la nostra stanza però non era da 5 stelle. la colazione ottima.
la posizione è centralissima.",4,2012,06,25
207,Beste Adresse in Dublin,"Nach der Renovierung ist das Shelbourne für mich wieder die erste Adresse in Dublin. Die Lage direkt an St. Stevens Green ist einzigartig und der Service ist überragend. Die Oyster Bar im Hotel  bringt jeden Fischesser ins schwärmen. 
Die Zimmer sind geräumig und nach der Renovierung im echten 5 Sterne Niveau. Zukünftig werde ich hier immer absteigen.",5,2012,05,28
207,Muy recomendable,"El hotel está muy bien situado, junto a un parque enorme. La recepción está un poco escondida, pero el servicio es impecable. La habitación bastante grande, el baño muy bien (bañera y ducha), la cama enorme... Sólo eché de menos el wifi.",4,2012,05,17
207,Bello ma......,"Splendido Hotel old fashion, confortevole, camere curate.
Peccato che il terzo lettino (eravamo con la bambina di 8 anni) era una branda senza neppure i piedini (ha dormito ""per terra"", praticamente).
La cosa che proprio stonava, però, era che la connessione wifi è a pagamento (20 euro al giorno) e che si paga una connessione per ogni device che attacchi! quidi se uno ha computer, iphone e ipad....dovrebbe pagare 60 euro al giorno per potersi connettere.  Nel mondo anglosassone questo è outrageous.",4,2012,05,17
207,"Ein Hotel mit Geschichte, Stil und ausgezeichnetem Service","Drei Nächte Aufenthalt, in denen eigentlich alles stimmte. Ein Hotel mit Stil, aber nicht überkandidelt. Sehr angenehmer Service durch rundum freundliches Personal. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist nicht übermässig gross, aber sehr schön angerichtet, frisch und fein. Die Eierspeisen, die man am Tisch bestellen kann, schmecken ausgezeichnet, ganz besonders die eggs benedict! Auch Bar und Lobby laden zum gemütlichen Aufenthalt ein. In fünf Fussminuten befindet man sich mitten in den Einkaufsstrassen Dublins.",5,2012,04,24
207,Ordentliches Hotel aber nicht Superklasse,"Das geschichtstraechtige Gebaeude ist etwas verwinkelt und man braucht evtl etwas um sich den Weg zu seinem Zimmer zu merken. Doorman, Pagen, usw alles in klassischem Ambiente. Nur die Bar ist etwas auf modern gemacht.",4,2012,04,01
207,Exceletente estilo en el Shelbourne,"Este hotel fué el primer punto de una breve ruta de descanso por europa. Desde aqui puedes recorrer a pie los puntos mas emblematicos de la capital irlandesa, asi como las zonas mas famosas para comprar desde souvenirs hasta unas buenas prendas de lino irlandés. La habitación del hotel era espaciosa, con una cama king size con colchón amoldable al cuerpo. Todo muy limpio y la sustitución de insumos para el baño y servibar era diaria. Si debo poner algun ""pero"", es que para ir al gimnasio debes cruzar por el lobby, no hay otra ruta, y si decides hacerlo por la noche, regularmente cruzarás enmedio de muchas personas vestidas de etiqueta que se encuentran departiendo algun coctel y que al verte con ropa deportiva te lanzarán miradas de desaprobación, aunque para nosotros fué muy divertido ver la cara de la gente al vernos pasar. Lógicamente, escuchamos la trillada frase: ""Estos son americanos"". Esto no demerita la calificacion del hotel, check-in y check-out fueron rapidos, la atencion de primera en todos los aspectos y el bufett durante el desayuno muy surtido y riquisimo. 
Este es un hotel para no fumadores, por lo que debes salir a la acera del hotel para poder disfrutar de un buen cigarrillo. Si reservas una suite, algunas tienen balcon y ahi podras echar humo las veces que desees.",5,2012,03,16
207,Excelente hotel!,"Excelente hotel en pleno centro de Dublin. Todo está cerca a pie! Aunque el hotel es antiguo y las habitaciones más bien pequeñas, el mobiliario es de primera. El personal es buenísimo. El Concierge es una verdadera ayuda. Objetivo y orientado a la satisfacción del huesped, no a sus contactos.
Los bares y restaurantes son muy populares. un poco caros pero muy buenos!",5,2011,11,07
207,"Adorable, destestable a la vez...","Un hotel fabuloso y desastroso a la vez...

El lobby es encantador, asi como los salones de te, el desayuno completo... pero la habitación pequeñisima, y de limpieza mejorable en especial el baño.

Un servicio de portería supereficiente, y mas apreciable debido a la zona caótica de trafico en la que se encuentra el hotel, una recepción con un check in rapido y eficiente en un espacio realmente reducido, queda completamente estropeado por un servicio de consergeria nefasto, mas pendiente de contestar los mensajes personales del móvil que de atender los clientes...  

Así que servicio de 5 estrellas en algunos departamentos y nefasto en housekeeping y consergeria.

Dirección, tomen nota... no vayan a estropear un hotel histórico como este...",2,2011,10,22
207,Irregular,"Un hotel bastante irregular. Nadie te recibe en la puerta para hacerse cargo del equipaje; éste lo dejé en conserjería y tras una hora, después de reclamarlo, tuve que bajar a por él, y si tardo cinco minutos más me lo cargan en el autobús de una expedición que se marchaba. La habitación aceptable, con una buena cama. El baño viejo, no alcanza el aprobado. El buffete de  de desayuno algo pobre y repetitivo; buenas salchichas, y pésimo café aguado. El hotel cuenta con un agradable bar y un acogedor irish pub. La ubicación es magnífica en el centro de la urbe. No hay piscina ni spa. Aprobado y punto.",3,2011,10,17
207,No repetiremos,"Hotel antiguo, con mal mantenimiento, con posible encanto en el pasado, con habitaciones 3 ó 4 estrellas, que dan a un patio MUY feo. El servicio malo, que no ayudan en caso de tener algún contratiempo. Lo mejor: el grandullón que está al lado de recepción, un crack, cualquier ayuda para buscar o reservar algo, él te lo resuelve",3,2011,08,31
207,Im internationalen Vergleich schlecht,"Das Shelbourne mach von vorn betrachtet einen guten Eindruck, wenn man von der bröckelnden Fassade einmal absieht. Die Bars machen ebenfalls einen guten Eindruck, das Personal ist freundlich. Aber leider ist der Ausblick, wenn man nicht ein Zimmer zur stark befahrenen Strasse hat, eine Katastrophe. Man schaut auf Betonfassaden oder Stacheldrahtmauern, deren Anmut man in einem dritte Welt Land erwartet. Zudem lief im Hof ein lautes Aggregat die ganze Nacht, das Fenster musste also geschlossen bleiben.
Pluspunkt: Das Frühstück ist erstklassig, das habe ich so selten gesehen.

Fazit: Das Haus bietet nicht das, was es zu sein vorgibt.",2,2011,06,30
207,Tradition mit Charm,"Da es sich um ein Geschichtsträchtiges Haus handelt empfehle ich unbedingt ein Zimmer im  Heritage Wing. Das Hotel besitzt zwei Flügel den Neueren der auch sehr schön und komfortabel aber der im vordern Teil des Hotel gelegene ""Altbau"" hat eben nicht nur die Geschichte sondern auch Blick auf den Park. 
Die Lage innerhalb Dublins könnte kaum besser sein. Das Personal ist immer aufmerksam und freundlich. Allerdings kommt das alles zu einem recht Stolzen Preis. Das Frühstücksbüffet für 36€ pro Person nur zum Beispiel!",4,2011,06,27
207,"sauber, bequem für einen unglaublichen Preis!","Diese Eigenschaft ist Fünf-Sterne-Standards, da der Dienst ist vorbildlich. Allerdings ist die Größe der Zimmer eher klein. Wir kamen früh, aber es gab keine Zimmer bereit. So bot der Rezeption, um unser Gepäck und rufen Sie uns überprüfen, wenn ein Raum zur Verfügung stand. Nachdem ich eine Empfehlung für ein großes Frühstück Cafe 'in der Nähe, erhielten wir einen Anruf in etwa einer Stunde. Die Lage am St. Stephen's Green ist außergewöhnlich. Sie sind in einer prestigeträchtigen Gegend mit einer 2 Blocks zu Fuß zur Grafton Street. Die Lage ist auch viel leiser als einige der Temple Bar oder nördlich des Liffey Bereichen, so dass Sie nicht hören, die spät in der Nacht Pub Crawling Menge von Ihrem Fenster. Frühstück im Saddle Room (onsite Gaststätte) ist außergewöhnlich, aber teuer. Der Speisesaal ist sehr schön eingerichtet. Wir aßen dort wegen einer vorzeitigen Abreise am Tag unseres Rückfluges. Der Preis ist ein wenig teuer für den gesamten Unterkünfte, aber Sie werden keine Beschwerden über das Eigentum oder Ihre Erfahrung haben.",4,2011,04,16
207,Klassisches Hotel mit sehr gutem Restaurant,"Das Shelbourne ist ein echter Klassiker mit sehr angenehmer Atmosphäre. Das Restaurant ist empfehlenswert und bietet ausgezeichnete Steaks und Austern. Die Zimmer sind im klassischen Stil gehalten, was nicht unbedingt für jeden ansprechend ist. Die Badezimmer sind modern eingerichtet, die TV Geräte allerdings stark veraltet. Das Personal ist sehr gut geschult und zuvorkommend. Beim Frühstück wird es allerdings etwas hektisch.",5,2011,01,27
207,"Gemütlich, seriös und freundlich","Wir waren eine Gruppe von 10 Personen (ausschließlich Männer) und durften für 3 Nächte im Shelbourne verweilen. Das Hotel liegt fast zentral in Dublin und ist per Bus, Taxi oder zu Fuß sehr gut zu erreichen. Das Hotel hat ein eher historisches Ambiente, aber das m,acht gerade den Charme dieses Hotels aus. Die gesamte Einrichtung ist im Stil des Barocks/Renaissance gehalten, aber sehr angenehm und hochwertig. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer sind von der Größe her ausreichend, die Bäder/Duschen sehr sauber und komfortabel. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist OK, außer man ist britisches/irländisches breakfast gewähnt, dann ist es sehr gut und ausreichend. Besonders einladend fanden wir die große Hotelbar im EIngangsbereich, die immer - zu jeder Tageszeit - sehr gut besucht war. Das Service dort war zuvorkommend und sehr nett. Das Hotel ist sicher eine der Top Adressen in Dublin, denn auch Prominente Gäste waren vor Ort: z.B. Keith Richards von den Rolling Stones (+ Begleitung) Wir können das Hotel nur weiterempfehlen!!",5,2010,10,28
207,"Descuido y deterioro extremo, un desastre","Estuvimos hospedados en una habitación Heritage Premium, después de pasar por tres habitaciones y ante los reclamos por falta de limpieza, toallas rotas, cortinas  y alfombras sucias y colchones totalmente hundidos,tuvimos que resignarnos La gente de recepción se justificaba diciendo que es un hotel viejo y mi marido le explicaba que viejo no es sinónimo de sucio y que nosotros habíamos pagado por un hotel 5 estrellas",1,2010,09,19
207,Luxushotel im Dubliner Regierungsviertel,"Das Shelbourne scheint eine Institution in Dublin zu sein. In der sehr geräumigen und stilvollen Hotelbar treffen sich des Abends Banker, Geschäftsleute und Regierungsmitglieder zum Feierabend-Guniness. Also ein guter Platz zum Schauen und Kontakte knüpfen.
