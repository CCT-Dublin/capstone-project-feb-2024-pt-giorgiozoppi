230,Delightful Boutique Hotel Near Everything,"We were greeted with a smile and friendly service throughout our 4-day stay.  The room was ready and available to us early (a wonderful option) after our long overnight flight.  This enabled us to enjoy Dublin later that morning.  The room was compact, but well laid out.  The quiet side street is a short walk from TCD, shopping and many other attractions of the city.  The concierge gave us thoughtful advice and made dinner reservations at wonderful places for our group.  I would stay here again.",5,2024,10,16
230,Fantastic Stay,"Best experience for a one week stay at a hotel.  The room was well appointed and to call it ""very nice"" is an understatement.  The breakfast, included in our stay, was great with a starter then main course.  The location near Trinity College is ideal.  The nightlife and friendly atmosphere we experienced was superb.  It was a 20 minute walk to Busas station for a bus to Wickllow, and a shorter walk to the train station to travel to other locations was filled with the sights of Dublin.  We took a tour to the Cliffs of Moher also, that was fantastic.   Highly recommended!   Cannot say enough good things about our visit.",5,2024,10,15
230,Great Stay,"Extremely Clean comfortable, Friendly Very professional staff. Breakfast was fantastic.  Excellent location.",5,2024,10,11
230,"good, just one remark","well, almost perfect. But in Room 111 (and potentially some others) it would be nice to have the switch for the towel heater clearly marked, like in room 310",5,2024,10,09
230,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"This is the epitome of what a boutique hotel should be.  We only spent one night here and wish we had stayed longer.

The hotel is located in a great area.  It’s practically next door to the Book of Kells and Grafton Street and is quite close to other sights.  

They have rooms in 3 different buildings.  The reception desk is in one of two adjoining buildings.  We stayed in a 3rd building that is across the street.

I initially booked a classic room but decided to upgrade to a superior room for €70.  It was a good decision as the superior room was larger and similar to a junior suite.  It was nicely appointed and looked just like the website photos.  It was also on the ground floor which was a big plus as they there are no elevators in the hotel.

The bathroom was very nice with a great shower.  The sink was in the bedroom, though, which we didn’t like.

Breakfast was served in the Library Street Restaurant, which is adjacent to the reception area of the hotel.  The restaurant also serves dinner on some nights and received a Michelin recommendation. The a la cart breakfast was outstanding with a very calm atmosphere. It’s surprising that the hotel doesn’t promote its relationship with the restaurant and offer dinner bookings or discounts.

We stayed in Dublin twice on this trip to Ireland.  On the first stop we stayed at the Morrison Hilton. It’s also in a good location but cost roughly €100 more per night for a basic room and mediocre breakfast.  This hotel provided a vastly superior experience and value.

Highly recommended.",5,2024,10,09
230,Ideally situated hotel for visiting Dublin,"This hotel is perfectly situated for exploring Dublin.  Grafton St., Trinity College, O’Connell St, many restaurants all within walking distance.  Being on my own, I felt very safe. The staff were very helpful.  There is no lift in the building but staff help with luggage and storage.  Breakfast is serviced, no buffet, and food was very good.  It is a small dining area and sometimes you had to wait.  Being so close to the main hub, it was a very quiet street.  I’d absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2024,10,07
230,Perfect location,perfect stay and would recommend - good breakfast - try the Italian restaurant across the street which is very good,5,2024,10,07
230,Very comfortable boutique hotel,"Very comfortable, welcoming and clean. Great central location. Rooms well equipped although fairly compact. Breakfast in adjoining Library St restaurant was excellent ",5,2024,09,28
230,Ridiculous price for a cupboard sized room,"£430 a night , champions weekend , room was minute , you literally had to walk side on to get round the bed , shower room so small you could barely turn round , sink was in the room , outrageous price , breakfast the next day had been incinerated , dry as a bone .",2,2024,09,21
230,Top Notch Hotel,"We just made a second stay at the Trinity Townhouse Hotel and, once again, our experience was perfect.  The front desk staff offered helpful recommendations and friendly service.  Our room was super-comfortable, spacious, and very well appointed.  And the included breakfast included attentive service and was absolutely delicious!  We highly recommend this property.",5,2024,09,17
230,Highly recommended,"We really liked this hotel.  4 rooms, each for a 3-night stay.  Great location in Dublin, walk to most everything.  The rooms were very clean, nice, and quiet.  Mine was a little bigger, but the others also enjoyed their stay.  Delicious full Irish breakfast included.  The staff was very friendly, helpful and professional.   

The only point that could have been an issue, but wasn't for any of us, is no elevators.  Just know that beforehand if your room is on the 2nd or 3rd floor.

All-in-all, we would highly recommend Trinity Townhouse.",4,2024,09,15
230,A cosy room in a cosy hotel,"The welcome at the Trinity Hotel was lovely. Given its age and attention to detail, I was a little surprised there was no lift as to top rooms were on the 3rd floor, so you needed to schlep your luggage up the stairs. Once workout was complete the room was lovely and well appointed. If I were staying more than 1-2 nights, I might have opted for a larger room as there were no seats - so it was sit on the bed or perch on the window sill. Although the room was cosy, it was clean beyond measure, the bed and pillows super comfy and had everything you needed (including a fridge). Breakfast was in the restaurant area down stairs and the menu was excellent. the staff were attentive. I couldn't  have asked for nicer hotel to stay in. Being central to down town Dublin and walk to Trinity College I highly recommend .",5,2024,09,15
230,Fantastic location – a hidden gem,"Fantastic location – a hidden gem on a quiet street. All major attractions are just a 5-15 minute walk away. The room was excellent, and the staff were exceptional. Despite being close to everything, the street itself is very peaceful.  We were able to walk to every where - bring an umbrella.  The weather can be unpredictable.",5,2024,09,05
230,"Perfect location, lovely room and fantastical staff!",The property is just a few feet from Grafton street an walking distance from anywhere you'd like to reach in the city.

230,Historic Comfort,"Though our time in Dublin was brief, our stay at Trinity Townhouse was superb. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent and the perfect size. Having water in the room when we arrived was a nice surprise, especially after flying all day. It was nice being located so closely to Trinity College, Grafton street and other local places. I would defiantly stay here again and recommended it to friends.  ",5,2024,08,14
230,Fantastic Stay!,"Had a fantastic stay in the Heart of Dublin. Close to everything, but far enough from the craziness of Temple Bar to escape from the crowds of tourists. And great Breakfast.

However, the breakfast staff are very accomodating, it's also a very nice breakfast room.I would recommend this for a city stay and will be back. ",4,2024,07,14
230,Beautiful hotel but disappointing experience,"
The hotel was beautifully decorated and very clean. The location is perfect. The breakfast was fine overall, but I would have appreciated more variety.

The room, however, was disappointing. I specifically booked a Deluxe Double Room due to the advertised size of 26 square meters. It was frustrating to receive a much smaller room that was also located in the attic rather than on the ground floor as stated during booking. When I addressed this with the staff, they dismissed it politely, saying that the room appeared smaller because of the large bed. Finally, a staff member promised that I would receive feedback from the manager, but I never did.",3,2024,07,10
230,Dublin City Break,"We booked 2 comfy rooms. Steep stairs to these but we knew at time of booking. Extremely clean and comfy with everything supplied including excellent coffee.

230,Almost 5 Stars!,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, wonderful staff, excellent breakfast, and great location!  There were only two things that hold back the extra star: our room was very small, although we expected small … this was very small. Secondly, the shower was very awkward. I commend them for trying to use every inch of space, but the angles of this shower were really difficult to maneuver. If you’re a larger person, you would really struggle!  Otherwise, this was a fantastic stay!  On the upside, we got the family room for our adult kids and that room was absolutely incredible! Kinda jealous! Thanks for the great stay! ",4,2024,06,03

230,A Beautiful Place in Dublin,"After spending two weeks visiting Scotland we ended our trip staying three nights in Dublin.  This boutique hotel was just what we needed to unwind and relax.  Great location, beautiful rooms, and a delicious breakfast served every morning made our stay fantastic.  One of the nicest hotels I have ever had the pleasure of booking.",5,2024,05,31
230,Lovely hotel in the heart of the city,"Our room was well appointed with plenty of space (opted for a Superior room based on previous reviews). V comfy bed. Location superb.

230,Perfect location,"Great location, lovely room (Superior), fabulous breakfast served by a welcoming, efficient team. We are so glad we stayed and would come back with no hesitation if we ever return to Dublin. We had one small suggestion for the future (and it was small) which we passed on to the reception team when leaving, 

There are many wonderful restaurants and bars within a few minutes’ walk. Our only advice to travellers would be to explore and find your favourite. Don’t just settle for the next door Italian which may be convenient but was not good, in our view. It is not connected with the hotel.",5,2024,05,01
230,Good hotel close to Trinity.,"This hotel would achieve a 5 star rating apart from several small niggles. The room was small, to the point that the wash hand basin was in the room rather than the en-suite. We were moved from our table at breakfast each day - simply a lack of planning on the part of the restaurant manager. Room service was OK but limited choice of tea, when asked about a tea pot the staff member rudely insisted that there was one in the room, which was not the case also seemed to have  problem with refreshing tissues and toilet tissue!",4,2024,04,30
230,Cosy hotel in perfect location,"Very nice hotel near Trinity college and Crafton Street. The room was ok for a weekend trip (oldstyle and with carpeted floor) , the modern bathroom and amenities were  good.We love the outständing breakfast and very friendly staff . ",5,2024,04,29

230,Perfect location,Everything about the hotel was great especially breakfast. Our room 205 was very small. There are steps to go to room but they help you with the luggages.,5,2024,04,24
230,Lovely place to stay in the heart of Dublin,"Lovely boutique hotel spread across Georgian style town-houses. Good location very near Trinity College.  Quiet street so sleep was good even though the windows are not double glazed. 
The refurbishment is really good and once you are in your room it is a modern hotel room with much better furnishings than most. All services in the room such as coffee machine, kettle, water bottles and good lighting. Even books left around. 
The rooms are small as is normal in this type of building; our bathroom was tiny. 
Breakfast in the adjacent Library Street restaurant was excellent - they actually serve you!  Beautifully prepared fruit salad or yogurt and granola and great freshly cooked hot dishes accompanied by a basket of fresh bakeries. Coffee also good.  Only Quibble was lack of range of herb teas - they think that mint or Earl Grey (!) are enough
Service in the hotel is fine. 
Only quibble is that there is no lift (elevator) and some rooms are 3 floors above the ground.  Annoying with luggage...",4,2024,04,22
230,Superb hotel with lovely staff,Absolutely gorgeous hotel with super helpful staff. Delux room was really great with a delightful ensuite. Cosy and noise free. Breakfast was delicious. All in all a great experience and we will be returning ,5,2024,04,21

230,Amazing Hotel,"This is one of the most unique and amazing hotels I’ve ever stayed at. The staff is extremely helpful and so friendly. Everything was very clean and the rooms were very comfortable. The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city but also on a quiet street. We only have great things to say about this hotel. Thank you for having us. ",5,2024,03,23
230,Trinity Townhouse,"The hotel is really central and the service from all staff members is exceptional.  The only downside was the lack of a lift, but considering the age of the building it is understandable.  Next time I will request ground floor.  Definitely worth a second if not third visit.",4,2024,03,19
230,Adorable hotel in a great location,"My husband and I stayed in one of the cosy rooms and we loved our stay! The property was very pretty and the staff was super friendly and helpful. The cosy room was a bit tight, but it was clearly advertised as such, so we weren't surprised by the slightly small space. And even so, it was roomier than other ""cosy"" rooms we've stayed in elsewhere. The hotel was within walking distance to all of the main attractions in Dublin which made it the perfect hub for a weekend trip. Overall we loved our time there and would definitley stay here again!",5,2024,03,19
230,Perfect choice for Central Dublin,"The hotel is on 2 town house sites opposite each other. As you come up from Trinity College the reception and the breakfast cafe is on the left, our accommodation was directly opposite.
First class room, very clean with a comfy sofa, a fridge & good amenities. The bed was super comfortable and the. Breakfast definitely worth crossing the road for ",5,2024,03,16
230,Amazing,"We had the best stay! The hotel kindly upgraded our room, and it was absolutely beautiful. So spacious, elegantly decorated, and with THE coziest bed! 

The location was unbeatable. This was very important to me, as it was my first time in Dublin and we only had 24 hours until the next leg of our flight. I was able to easily walk to everything I wanted to see. 

The Irish breakfast was fabulous. Couldn’t have asked for more. 

The staff at both the hotel and restaurant were professional and friendly. Our only regret was that we didn’t stay longer! We will absolutely stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2024,03,15
230,Disappointing end to a lovely weekend,"After a restful night in a lovely room we were looking forward to the breakfast which we had read great things about. We had booked the last sitting (9.45am), our room was across the road
from the restaurant area in a separate building, we arrived at 9.48 and
were greated by the pleasant receptionist who showed us where to go. However the waitress looked annoyed when she saw us and checked a guest list in the kitchen, we overheard someone comment that we
should have been there at 9.45, to which the waitress came out and said ""you're late"". We were shocked, I showed her the time on my phone and she replied that we should have been
there at 9.45 (it was now 9.49). We sat down and felt so uncomfortable that
we decided to leave. The waitress stated that she had not intended to insult us and appeared surprised at our reaction to her comments. We then realised that the manager had infact been in the room when all this was happening and had not intervened. We spoke to her and she also apologised for the way we had been treated but by now it all felt very unprofessional and awkward so we left. We requested a refund for the breakfast, a follow up email from the hotel would have been appreciated but unfortunately this never happened.",2,2024,03,09
230,Just What   We  Wanted,"The room was great, staff was great, location was very good.  I am sorry that we only had a couple of days, but will hope to return late next summer. My wife was ecstatic with this location. I would recommend this location to any and all. Try it you will like it.",5,2024,03,07
230,Short stay,"We stayed just one night in the townhouse on a flying visit in a compact but cosy room.

230,Great little hotel in a great location with nice staff and a good breakfast.,"We decided to surprise our dearest friend on his 70th Birthday by joining them in Dublin for a couple of days.

We were impressed by the quality of the rooms and the location was great for us.",5,2024,02,24

230,Fantastic Hotel in a great location,The hotel was  clean and comfortable to a high standard. The breakfast was good and the hot options individually cooked to order to perfection. There was a car park 2minutes walk from the hotel which the hotel provided discount vouchers for.,5,2024,01,30
230,No other words but perfect,"The hotel is superb. Its location and staff are undoubtedly the highest points of this awesome place. I’d only say that the room is too small for the number of things they have inside, so, if I had to advise a change, I’d suggest them to diminish the number of items in the room (fewer cushions, glasses, etc) as these tend to tighten the space and get scrambled with clothes, suitcases and everything. Anyway, all in all, it’s an excellent place to stay. Breakfast is delicious, staff is always nice and helpful and the location is close to everything you need. ",5,2024,01,21
230,Brilliant boutique hotel,Stayed in a deluxe room which was really comfortable and quiet.  The building is on a lovely street with an excellent Italian restaurant opposite.

230,Excellent,"Excellent location, very friendly staff and great service. The breakfast was very nice and the room was lovely. Make sure to try the eggs and salmon with guacamole. Perfect location, just outside the busy city center (temple bar) and close to the DART trainstation. ",5,2024,01,06
230,Perfect location,"Perfect location, quiet and nice street in the middle of everything. Comfy bed, cozy rooms, very good breakfast served in the nice restaurant behind the hotel. Staff polite and helpful. Very good experience.",4,2024,01,06
230,Simply marvelous,Location was extremely central. Rooms was very modern and comfortable. Staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast was outstanding. Would definitely stay here again.

230,Excellent post wedding stay!,"We stayed here following our wedding ceremony in the city centre. The hotel itself is a great city centre location. The hotel is beautiful and boutique, the room was fantastic - I'm pretty sure we were upgraded because if our wedding and we were so grateful, would definitely return!",5,2023,12,29
230,Perfect Hotel in Dublin,"The hotel is very central. Most of Dublin's attractions are within walking distance. The room was perfect. All employees were always friendly and helpful. I can recommend the hotel to everyone and will stay there again when I'm back in Dublin.
",5,2023,12,19
230,Very enjoyable hotel on a truly remarkable location in Dublin city centre,"This stay in one of my favourite cities worldwide was one to remember, thanks to the Trinity Townhouse Hotel. The location is really superb: a few footsteps away from Grafton street, but in a very peaceful street. Temple bar is a3 minute walk, and Trinity college is right next to the hotel. Couldn't be any better. 
The room was tiny, I think I never had such a small room, but remarkable nice and a very high finishing standard. All of the staff was very helpful, we felt really welcome! Special notice for the breakfast: truly a gem, and well above standard. Also here: love the staff, nothing was too much. 
My wife and I highly recommend this place, and it will be the only hotel we will attend again in Dublin in the future. ",5,2023,12,18
230,Midweek couple escape,"Cosy hotel centrally located to shops, restaurants, bars, museums all within walking distance. Near Grafton Street. Adjacent carpark. Fabulous breakfast cooked to order. Friendly staff. Highly recommend for short stays.",5,2023,12,14
230,5/5 stay!,"We had a fantastic stay here! I’ve stayed in many hotels in Dublin and this was by far the best stay! Lovely staff, super clean and cosy rooms, excellent location right next to Trinity College and Grafton street. Excellent value for money and has to be one of the best hotel experiences I’ve ever had. We’ll be back for sure! :) ",5,2023,12,08
230,A lovely stay,"My fiancée and I had the pleasure of staying at Trinity Town House for 3 nights for a special trip to Dublin. We were in room 309 on the top floor. As other reviewers have mentioned there is no lift in this hotel. If you are on the top floor you probably will be slightly out of breath carrying your luggage but this was not a massive issue. The rooms are relatively small but we appointed. The bed is raise for extra storage space. I think it would be a good idea for the hotel to install a hook on the back of the door as the only other place to hang a coat or jacket was inside the wardrobe and this had limited hangers. Again not a massive issue. 

The best thing though about this hotel is the service provided by the staff and the excellent breakfast. The location is perfect for a central location but still a quiet street. 

Would definitely recommend and would come back again on our next trip.",5,2023,12,01
230,Thoroughly Relaxing,"This was our first time at TTH and  certainly won't be our last.  Our room was ideal. We were in the building opposite the hotel. It was comfortable, warm, clean and quiet. It was a very relaxing stay and we will definitely return  ",5,2023,11,27
230,Great choice,"Everything in the hotel worked  well - the hotel is nice and comfortable, the room was  cosy, staff helpfull and friendly, the location is perfect, it is quiet hotel in the centre  of Dublin, the only slight discomfort  we felt  is  that you have to book the time for your breakfast as the breakfast is served, it is not buffet - but anyway the breakfast itself was excellent.",5,2023,11,20
230,Lovely hotel in a beautiful part of Dublin,"Exceptional hotel inside and out, staff very friendly and professional. Room of a very high standard with excellent amenities. Breakfast was very high in standard, the restaurant is intimate and inviting would absolutely recommend ",5,2023,11,15
230,Amazing breakfast too!,"Lovely hotel near to amenities with excellent helpful staff. 
Wonderful tasty breakfast offering a choice of freshly cooked food and warm bread and pastries. Coffee was awesome too!
Our cosy room was a little small for two though. ",5,2023,11,10

Great Italian restaurant right next door for when you want a break from the many great nearby pubs.  We liked The Duke.",5,2023,10,25
230,"Excellent location, clean room, friendly staff and great food.","My partner has difficulty with stairs, so the hotel allocated a room with good access from the ground floor which was much appreciated. All aspects of our stay were outstanding including a large clean, comfortable room and bed, an excellent selection of breakfast options served in a modern, bright dining area. All members of staff were polite, friendly and helpful. The hotel location is excellend for the city centre, public transport and shops etc. I will stay here on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2023,10,24

230,Fantastic Base for Dublin,"It was the perfect place to stay while visiting Dublin.  It is off a quiet street, but just steps from Trinity college and a short walk to central Dublin.  It is close to the historical sights, museums, dining and shopping.   The room itself was outstanding.  it had a king bed and a studio living area with a couch.   It was much bigger than I expected and comfortable.  The staff were fantastic!",5,2023,10,22
230,Great Stay!,"Excellent stay. This is my 3rd visit and the only place I stay when traveling to Dublin. Fantastic location, friendly staff, extremely clean and comfortable. There breakfast is complementary and super tasty.    ",5,2023,10,22

230,Excellent hotel in great location,"Booked at the last minute for two nights. We had a “small double room” but it didn’t feel small at all. Bed was extremely comfortable, bathroom amenities were lovely, breakfast was very good and the staff most pleasant.",5,2023,10,15
230,Charming boutique hotel,"What a treat. This lovely little hotel is super upscale, but does it with warmth and charm instead of glitz. Reception is thoughtful and efficient. My deluxe room was spacious, beautifully appointed and had all of the important amenities. The location is ideal for visiting Trinity; it is 1.5 blocks from the main gates where you enter for the Long Library and Book of Kells. There are many attractive restaurants and shops nearby; it is 2 blocks from the glam Grafton Street. Loved it.

To be clear, this is not a ""happening"" place. There is no bar, the restaurant is only for breakfast, and there is no room service. As a result, it is quiet and reserved. And I loved it.",5,2023,10,13
230,Great stay at the Trinity Townhouse,"Location: Excellent! Very near everywhere but silent at night
Breakfast: Excellent as well! The breakfast room is very cosy and the food delicious. 
Room: Very good size room 
Service: Excellent! Everyone was very helpful 
Conclusion: I can recommend this hotel 100%",5,2023,10,11

Beautiful breakfast
Great room
Fantastic location.

Would definitely recommend and stay again if we're back in Dublin.",5,2023,10,09
230,"Charming townhouse hotel in Georgian Dublin, near museums, squares and government offices.","Picked this hotel for location and price - wanted to be walking distance to St. Stephen's Green, Merrion Square, and their adjacent museums, but wanted better value than the ""grand"" hotels that are right on these squares.  The Trinity Townhouse Hotel (consisting of updated Georgian rowhouses) proved to be an excellent choice.
We had a Superior King Room, up one flight of stairs.  Other hotels might call this room a suite.  Besides the sleeping area, it had a large sitting area with classic and comfortable furnishings: a full-size sofa, chairs, desk, TV and (non-working) fireplace.  The room occupied the entire frontage of the second floor of this rowhouse - we had no neighboring rooms and no disturbance from other guests.  
The room wasn't ready when we arrived at 8am - but was available to us by noon.  One benefit of the delay was that the front desk staff brought our stored luggage up to our room while we were out sightseeing.   The staff offered to bring our luggage downstairs when we checked out - eliminating my only concern about being in a hotel with no elevator.
As others have remarked, the included breakfast (with waiters, not a buffet) was excellent.  Waiter staff were very hospitable, as were all the front desk staff with whom we dealt.
The location was perfect - besides being close to Dublin's two classic squares, the hotel was a block south of Trinity College, and an easy walk to Dame Street and Temple Bar.  A stop (Dawson) on the Dublin light rail Green Line, is two short blocks away, allowing easy access north and south.  (The Green Line has a transfer point to the east-west Red Line just north of the LIffey.)  ",5,2023,10,06
230,"Excellent comfort, service and location","This is an excellent hotel for comfort, service and location.  Its the best of both worlds being in a quiet street, but only minutes away from Temple Bar, Trinity College, St Stephen's Green and shopping in Grafton Street.  
The rooms were beautiful, we had a superior one with a nice sofa area and a view to the front of the hotel.
The breakfast experience was top notch - table service with food freshly prepared to order.
We could not fault it and are very likely to return on our next visit.",5,2023,10,03
230,"Great Location, Breakfast and Room","Trinity Townhouse was the perfect hotel for our stay in Dublin.  Location was perfect- easy to walk over to Temple Bar and other major attractions, but the neighborhood was very quiet at night.  The room was very clean and nice and cozy.  The breakfast might have been the highlight- it was a wonderful way to start our day every morning (also nice to have a variety of options so you could do a lighter or heavier breakfast for whatever you preferred for that day).  Staff was always incredibly kind as well.  Thank you for an amazing stay in Dublin!",5,2023,10,01
230,Quality put pricey,Great place to stay arrived early and asked if I could have breakfast as I would be leaving early the following day he just said no and laughed at me which I thought was a little out of order. Paid almost the same amount of money for a 3 night stay in Berlin last month for the price of one night here so criminally over priced but it was lovely ,5,2023,09,29
230,Delightful Stay,"Having stayed at many different kinds, sizes and styles of hotels around the world, I have to applaud the experience at Trinity Townhouse. The staff, without exception, were welcoming and friendly and the accommodation was spacious and comfortable. It was a little strange having a washbasin separate from the bathroom, but this was the only thing I would change. The breakfasts were of high quality and we would certainly look to stay here again when we return to Dublin.",5,2023,09,28
230,Wonderful place to begin our Girls Trip.,"What a fantastic start to our girls trip when we checked in here!  The rooms are spacious, super comfortable beds/pillows, plenty of outlets and our room was perfectly laid out for 2 friends to share the room and bathroom.

Breakfast was delicious, wonderful variety.  The staff is attentive, helped with reservations as well as transportation.  They even provided plenty of umbrellas.  Would for sure return on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2023,09,22

230,My Stay at TTH,"Hotel is extremely well located, very charming building and spacy and superbly decorated  romm. Bed very confortable. Bathroom tiny but confortable, bathroom eating system very efficience maybe a bit too much for this very warm weather period; Overall I highly recommend TTH .",5,2023,09,11

230,Nice stay,Nice hotel. We had a small room (but knew this when we booked) in which everything was perfect. Our room was located on the 3rd floor and there was no lift. The location is great and the breakfast delicious (could be until 10am instead of 9.30am). ,5,2023,08,22
230,Superb,Superb accommodation and very convenient location. The staff were wonderful and service was very friendly and punctual. Loved the breakfast with lots of options and great coffee. The room was spacious and en-suite very modern. Highly recommend,5,2023,08,19
230,A very pleasant stay,"Simply a great stay in Dublin. Rooms have been excellent, and friendlyness and helpfulness of staff cannot be better. Also breakfast was served from heart and was very delicious. When we visit Dublin again, our choice will be Trinity Townhouse again",5,2023,08,19
230,A WONDERFUL WEEK-END,"Great experience at the Trinity Townhouse.
Everything was quiet and perfect
We loved the room, the location, the cleanliness and service.
Staff gave us good advices to visit the town.
The italian restaurant in the street is also a great pleasure.
",5,2023,08,16
230,Nicest staff would definitely stay again,Stayed for 1 night with my sister the staff were so nice and went above and beyond to make our stay special. The room was lovely and spacious and clean. Location wise it's really close to Grafton street and the luas line so easy to get around the city. Would definitely book again and recommend this hotel I've stayed in a good few hotels in Dublin and by far the nicest staff I've ever encountered. The only downside is there is no elevator but the staff that greeted us at reception offered to help with our bags,5,2023,08,14
230,Early August 2day stay,"Friendly helpful staff, lovely atmosphere, excellent breakfast menu, loved the room, incl fridge and bathroom, which was nice and roomy with with easy to use shower. Dimmer switches for lights were a Godsend and air conditioning. Convenient to good restaurants and to shops but very quite street - no nighttime interruptions. If I was to find a fault it would be some background noise, presumably from kitchens/water heating systems in the hotel or from nearby premises, which we could hear in the distance but was not that bothersome. It did not stop us from sleeping! We have been a few times and will be back again. ",5,2023,08,10
230,Amazing place. Best staff,"The Trinity Townhouse Hotel is probably the best place to stay in Dublin. Right beside Trinity College where you can see The Book of Kells exhibition and the library Long Room (featured in the TV Show Foundation as the Trantor reading room).
Fantastic neighbourhood with a lot of pubs and lively streets and a lot more relaxed than the Temple Bar zone which is just a very short walk away anyway.
Many thanks to the staff at the Trinity Townhouse Hotel who were always helpful and made our stay very pleasant.",5,2023,07,29
230,lovely place,"Great location, impressive breakfast, lovely room. Close to Trinity college, Library ,Archeology museum. Not far from Grafton Street,St. Stephens Green.  Helpful and friendly staff, good wifi connection. We'd stay there again.",5,2023,07,25
230,"Beautiful hotel, great breakfast but lots of stairs",Lovely place to stay and the details and extras were lovely. great location and breakfast. from a practical perspective we were on top floor and there are a lot of stairs to climb even for a fit person its a challenge. The rooms are as described cosy with not a lot of space for movement. no chair but also no space to have one. The room was hot and whilst there is air-conditioning it can be noisy but there was no top sheet only a duvet so sleep was disturbed. also the seagulls are noisy which I know is outwith your control. Staff were very friendly.,4,2023,07,17
230,Amazing hotel!,"Partner and I went to Trinity Townhouse Hotel for a night for his birthday and I can't describe how amazing everything was. We were welcomed with big smiles at the reception and explained everything. Room was very clean and super spacious. Shower is amazing!! Breakfast was beyond delicious, there was no noise throughout the night although we were located in city centre. Staff was so lovely and helpful. I definitely recommend this place, we will be back! Thank you for an amazing day!",5,2023,07,17
230,Perfectly situated,"Excellent location and very comfortable room (although noise can be clearly heard from the room above. The hotel, appears to be plagued by a faulty hot water system. A decent breakfast but don't expect a second cup of coffee.",4,2023,07,09
230,"Super location, good breakfast. The right place to stay in Dublin if your not sensitive to noise. A bit overpriced.","The room, a superior room was fairly large and well equipped.
The bathroom has a shower and is extremely small and narrow. hardly space for one person let alone two.

Unfortunately although we asked for a quiet room we received a room towards the street which inspite of being a side street is rather noisy.
Continuously alarms going off in the night.

The location was perfect, everything within easy reach.
Loads of restaurants and bars and attractions just a few short walk away.

The breakfast is served at the Library str. Restaurant which is on the corner of the house. Breakfast is served A la carte and is very good. The service is excellent.

The small restaurant is opened in the evening but very difficult to obtain a reservation as it’s very small and also popular with the locals. Shame really we would have liked to tried it out.

There is no bar at the hotel but there are enough places nearby.",4,2023,06,30
230,Quaint Townhouse Hotel,"Perfect location, stunning property, best included breakfast I have ever had. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Ended up here because of a missed flight, but it was a happy accident and I greatly enjoyed my stay.",5,2023,06,28
230,Lively little hotel,Lovely hotel with a beautiful room but the breakfast did not match the quality elsewhere. The ingredients were poor and disappointing I had to book a time.  Staff were hospitable and facilities excellent. ,4,2023,05,21
230,Superb,"Superb location, excellent friendly staff, amazing breakfast only downside in our room which was 203 at the back was the noise from the fans otherwise highly recommended as it was central to everything. ",4,2023,05,06

230,Excellent Hotel in a Great Location,"I always stay in the Trinity Townhouse Hotel whenever I stay in Dublin. Not just because it is a beautiful hotel and in an excellent location,  but because it's staff are excellent and always so helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel.

The breakfast and the breakfast staff are also second to none, they are so friendly and the food is delicious also. 

Fernando and his team are excellent!",5,2023,03,31
230,Weekend Break,"Lovey hotel in an excellent location with friendly and professional staff.
The only issue we had was with very noisy guests in the room above which prevented a good night sleep 3 nights in a row. Just bad luck but take ear plugs if you’re planning to stay! ",4,2023,03,28
230,Extremely comfortable stay,"I stayed here for 2 nights due to an event i had to attend. Staff very welcoming and attentive. Food quality pretty good and there was a good choice to pick from, so i had full irish breakfast first day and smolked salmon with egg on brown bread with avocado the 2nd day and absolutely enjoyed it.
Room was extremely comfortable, carpets soft to walk on and pure luxury.
Bathroom a little small but more than acceptable.
Location is great and close to st. Stephens green and will most definitely stay again in the future.",5,2023,03,28
230,A remarkable place to stay.,"Wonderful hotel we stayed at recently.

Me & my wife went recently and we loved it from the minute we stepped in the front door.

The room over the road was just a knockout and spacious and was really cosy.

We had a lovely breakfast in the morning and the staff were really friendly and were unbelievably helpful. The Hotel is situated perfectly to get round all the Dublin attractions and has lovely restaurants just next door and a cafe and coffee shop just down the road.

We are definitely going to stay here again when we’re on an overnight to Dublin. It’s the best hotel I’ve stayed in in a long long time.",5,2023,03,25
230,Simply wonderful!!,"This hotel is a TREASURE and I loved everything about it! I stayed in a cosy room .. which is very cosy  but perfect for one person .. and had been very well thought out with regard to space and necessities. The bed was a 10/10, with lovely pillows and bedding, and the place was spotless! Breakfast was divine, and the staff couldn’t do enough for me! I’d come back without hesitation! The hotel is also very well situated .. easy to walk to all the attractions .. and lots of food & drink places nearby. My only warning would be that there is no lift but the gorgeous Georgian style of the hotel more than makes up for this.",5,2023,03,13
230,"A great hotel and highly recommended for comfort, location and service","We stayed in the cosy room 306 - and it is cosy - but the clever use of storage space meant we had enough room for everything.  The bathroom is small.  The hotel is centrally located which means you are close to everything, but the road itself is quiet, so we were not disturbed.  We slept with the window open and you do hear cars/voices but it wasn’t noisy.  The breakfast is excellent with lots of choice: it set us up nicely for each day’s exploring.  The staff and service were excellent and cannot praise them enough.  There isn’t a lift which may be a problem for some.  In short, a great hotel run by a good team and we highly recommend it.",5,2023,02,26
230,So nice and delicious,"A very nice and sweet place to be for a seightseeing weekend. A warn welcome, a very comfortable room and an extraclean bathroom. All was perfect! 
Sweety fully Irish breakfast. 
This hotel is full center located, we have done all our visits by foot. The Aircoach bus stop from the Airport is close to it.
We recommand, absolutely!",5,2023,01,16
230,Excellent place to stay in Dublin,"Good location in a quiet street near Trinity College. An old mansion with a restaurant/breakfast room in more modern annex. Our room was across the street: no problem for us. The airco/heater was a bit noisy, but besides that the (big) room was quite comfortable, with a small but adequate bathroom. Wonderful breakfast is being served out. Very friendly service!",5,2023,01,06
230,Good but physically testing and overpriced!,"My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel in mid-September.
Pros:
- Excellent location in Dublin
- Very good breakfast, cooked to order from at wide menu
- Perfectly clean bedroom
- Friendly and helpful staff at the reception
Cons:
- Vastly overpriced taking the following into consideration:
- Very slow (if bespoke) service at breakfast
- Shockingly small bedroom
- In particular, 3 stairs to climb to the bedroom (no elevator!)
Had it not been for the two blissful young ladies at the reception, I do wonder how we could have managed to move our baggage up to and down from our room!
We stayed a week later at another hotel in Dublin, slightly less central but also significantly more reasonably priced (and providing elevators!) and we would most likely prefer to stay there again rather than at the Trinity Townhouse.",3,2023,01,03
230,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed in the cozy double room and even though it was small, it was thoughtfully appointed and quite comfy for 2 people.  My husband and I loved this room.  The bed was very comfortable and plush.  On a quiet street we slept very well. The breakfast’s included were fine dining and very good.  A wonderfully beautiful and romantic hotel in a very good location to St Stephen’s Green, Grafton street and all sights.  Excellent restaurants close by.  I highly recommend The Pig’s Ear less than 1/2 block away.  Michelin rated restaurant and very good for modern Irish cuisine.",5,2022,11,18
230,City centre location. ,"Very convenient location in city centre. Easy to get there by bus. Quite a few restaurants in vicinity. Check in with no problems. The ""cosy "" room a bit small,  but functional and tidy. Bed very comfy. Breakfast very good. Overall a nice conversion into a hotel. If in need for a base in centre and close to everything,  a perfect place to stay. ",4,2022,11,10
230,Luxury hidden gem in prime Dublin location,"We booked this hotel the day before we arrived and we weren’t sure what to expect but we were delighted with this hidden gem. It is in a fabulous location in the heart of Dublin with the partner car park 1 minute walk away. The decor smacks of luxury and the ‘cosy room’ was just that but it also had everything we could have needed.  This is a luxury boutique hotel with a very cool, laid back vibe.  The breakfast was amazing and the breakfast room equally so.  The staff could not have been any nicer - so pleasant anytime we needed something or even just when we happened to be in the lobby.  I have been recommending this hotel to anyone who cares to listen and we are looking forward to returning very soon.",5,2022,11,06
230,Great hotel in perfect location.,We are just back from a great weekend at this hotel. Location is perfect for everything you need to see in Dublin. Room was lovely; very spacious and spotlessly clean. We really enjoyed the breakfast each morning. Staff were very friendly. Q Park are just behind the hotel and you get 50 percent discount on your parking for staying at the hotel. Thank you to Trinity we will definitely be back!!,5,2022,09,25
230,"Convenient, Quiet Location in Dublin!","Trinity Townhouse is close to everything in the town center, but removed enough to enjoy peace and quiet in Dublin. The bus line is very nearby, and it is walking distance to  the town center. The room was tiny, but nicely appointed. The bathroom was well equipped but small as well. For $300/night, I would expect a little larger room as we were having to dodge each other as we prepared for the day and night. No place to put suitcases except on the floor in the way.  Maybe all rooms in Dublin are small. Walking up three flights of stairs with luggage was difficult as well for us seniors. There is no lift. Breakfast was delicious, with several cooked to order entrees. There are also breads, fruits and cereals to choose from. Overall it was a nice stay, but not great value for the money.",4,2022,09,22
230,"OK stay, with few problems, not the best value for money","The stay was overall fine, room is quite, and had good night sleep. However:
1) The room is really tiny. There was not even a place to put the luggage in the room!
2) The service is cordial but quite inflexible. We arrived at 4 AM after long delays in flights and other airport hurdles, happy to reach our destination. The staff allocated early breakfast (usually I don't mind, but it was 4 AM!), and wasn't' able to adapt to the situation (either change the time or subtract breakfast money from teh bill). Not big deal , I agree, but it was a discouraging and disappointing ""welcome"" to the hotel.",3,2022,09,17
230,Gorgeous Find,"My husband and I spent two nights at this hotel, after having booked more than two years ago for a trip that was cancelled due to Covid. When I contacted the hotel to see whether they would honor a voucher two years later, Lydia was most helpful, courteous, and encouraging. Once we arrived, after a rather harrowing search for the hotel due to misinformation from the bus service, we were greeted graciously, shown to our suite, and provided helpful information for getting around town. 

In addition to beautiful and comfortable accommodations, we were treated to breakfast in a lovely dining room. The hotel offers many choices, made to order, all delicious, and excellent coffee drinks. Upon checking out, again the reservation desk was most helpful in calling a cab, assisting with luggage to the cab, and seeing us off. This hotel is an excellent find in the midst of a busy city, with proximity to good restaurants, shopping, and tourist attractions. Once tucked into our quiet room, however, the busy city seemed far away. We strongly recommend this hotel for its accommodation, food, service, and location.",5,2022,09,14
230,"Quiet, clean, charming little hotel in Dublin","Walking distance from everything, but off the beaten path enough to provide a quiet, restful stay in the bustling city of Dublin. Our room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean, and had a newly, beautifully updated bathroom. Nespresso coffee maker in the room, comfy bed, and just across the street from a nice Italian restaurant with good wine. We'd definitely stay here again. ",5,2022,09,11
230,Could Not Have Asked For A Better Place!,"I have just returned form staying 3 nights (31 July-3 August, 2022) at the Trinity Townhouse Hotel in Dublin.  We were fortunate to be have had a ""Superior"" room, #105, which is located across the narrow street from the ""main"" building.   

  This inn exceeded our exceptions, and I am one who is choosy about things such as cleanliness of the rooms, attitude of the staff etc.  This inn was impeccably clean and well maintained. The staff friendly and very helpful in arranging taxis, advising what we may want to see, etc.  

  It was only on our last day that we took advantage of the cooked to order breakfast which is included in the price.  As soon as we were seated in the Inn's private restaurant, we new we had missed out on the previous two days na should have set time said to enjoy their wonderful  breakfasts.  

  Obviously, I am excited about our stay at the Trinity Townhouse facility and I do intend to make a point of staying there on my next trip to Dublin.  And as a first time visitor to Dublin, I'll add it is a charming city and I do desire a return trip.  

  The location of Trinity Townhouse was perfect.  A few minutes walk, literally, to the front gate of Trinity College with its' ""Book of Kells"" and ""Long Room"" library self guided tours.  Grafton Street, the famous shopping district, runs one street parallel to Frederick Street South, where Trinity townhouse is located.  The cross streets between offer an abundance of bars, street side cafe's with outdoor seating, etc.  The ""Hop On -Hop Off"" bus stop is a block away and it is as short walk or ride to the Oscar Wilde home and monument in the direction opposite of Grafton Street.  O'Connell Street, another ""main drag"" is also a short walk away and make sure to stop off at ""Butler's Chocolate"" for a coffee or the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted along the way. 

The Temple Bar neighborhood is a short walk away as well. So, in a nutshell the location is perfect.  As was our stay at Trinity Townhouse!  

I'm a guilty as many in that  I will write negative reviews for a bad experience, but fall short of praising the good.  I am excited about my trip to Dublin and Trinity Townhouse 
contributed significantly to this great experience.",5,2022,08,06
230,Fancy,"This hotel is in several buildings (2 across the street from each other) with a restaurant in the back with a side entrance.  The place is very fancy feeling with spacious rooms and comfortable beds.  Breakfast was good and served in the restaurant in the main building.  We were able to enter a little early as we needed to get to the airport.  The location is great- centrally located so you can easily walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar area, the river, Molly Malone statue, GPO, etc. all within 3/4 of a mile.  We parked in the Q-park Setanta that is just around the corner from the hotel (you can make a reservation online ahead of time).  The only downside to this hotel is that reservations are non-refundable.  We had to cancel & reschedule our trip twice due to Covid and this was the only hotel of the many we booked that we would've lost money on if we ended up not able to come at all.  I would suggest to the owners that they rethink this policy.",4,2022,06,28
230,Fantastic!!!!,"Travelled with my wife for a weekend away in Dublin in June 2022. From the moment we arrived I knew that our stay in Trinity Townhouse Hotel was going to be special. From check in it was clear that the staff were properly trained - attentive but not intrusive. We stayed in Room 301 which was on the ground floor - I had booked an upgraded room and it had all of the usual amenities and also extras (Robes, slippers and even Dental Kits!). 

Breakfast was ordered from a menu and all aspects of it was table service. On the first morning we were asked to wait 15 minutes for our table and the staff served us Tea and Coffee to drink while we were waiting!

The location of the hotel is so central that you're a 5  minute walk from Trinity College or Grafton Street. 

Bravo to the Hotel Management for ensuring the service and product are delivered to the highest standards. We'll be back.",5,2022,06,26
230,Great find,"We stayed 3 nights, this is a great place to stay. Nice breakfast each morning, centrally located so could walk everywhere, the staff was so helpful and always available, couldn’t ask for a better stay.   The rooms were well thought out, easy to get to public transportation or taxis. Definitely coming back.",5,2022,06,18
230,"Classy Hotel, Excellent Staff, Nice Room Fit Out","A very nice hotel indeed in the Georgian part of town, Its quite quirky inside and dressed accordingly.  

The staff were great from checking in to checking and out and when I was leaving, I was working down stairs in the lobby and needed the WiFi, the guys servicing the cooling units delayed switching off the WiFi until I had finished - thank you and this coupled with the free cup of coffee was most welcome.

The rooms quite elegantly fitted out and the shower excellent and even lots of milk for the coffee.

WiFi was a reasonable speed 8 Mbs

So after all the good things - no lift, and the breakfast items I had were a little overcooked / dry.

Would I stay here again most certainly and probably will next time I am in town",4,2022,06,08
230,"Outstanding stand, terrific location!","We recently booked my parents into this hotel for couple of nights.  They are not fans of larger, corporate hotels, so we decided on the Trinity House Hotel based on a recommendation.
It's right in the city centre, in an old Georgian House , but it's just far away enough from any street noise.

I accompanied my parents for check in and I was delighted at how helpful and kind the staff were when we arrived. They simply couldnt do enough and even as i left, they asked if i would like to join my parents for breakfast the following morning...
Throughout the stay, the staff were checking in to make sure they had everything they needed.

Breakfast ( i did go back!) was fabulous and again, full compliments to the staff here too.

There are so many great hotels in Dublin city centre, but this is the one i will be recommending in the future.

10/10 for staff, location and a great property.",5,2022,06,02
230,Perfect property in the perfect location.,"This hotel was centrally located to the City center, allowing us to walk everywhere!
The staff was wonderful.  We arrived in Dublin via Philadelphia at 530 am.  After clearing customs, and getting our luggage, we were taken to the hotel at about 7 am.  Two of our three rooms were ready and we were provided immediate entry.  We were also permitted to have complementary breakfast, even though we were hours earlier than our 3 pm check in. 
The rooms were all wonderful, large and accommodating. The black out drapes helped, when sunset was not until 9:40pm.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2022,05,29
230,Wonderful stay!,"We loved this little gem of a hotel.  It really feels like a home away from home in Dublin.  The location is outstanding (walking distance to tons of fun spots as well as tourist spots like the Trinity College/Kells).   The staff was very friendly and breakfast was yummy.  The rooms were well appointed and a very comfy bed.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the absence of a restaurant/bar.  However, there is an excellent Italian restaurant across the street and lots of local places to eat and drive within a 2-3 block radius.",4,2022,05,23
230,The perfect place to stay if you're me in Dublin,"I booked three Deluxe rooms at the Trinity Townhouse for three couples traveling for the first time to Dublin.  After much research of hotels in Dublin, I landed on Trinity because of its location, the Georgian architecture, and the stellar reviews on Trip Adviser and in travel books.  We are all in our 60's and 70's so the climb up the stairs to our room might be daunting in another place but we loved the people and the place so much, we found the energy to do it. We opted for the bed and breakfast and loved beginning our days in the lovely little restaurant behind the front desk.  Any need or question we made of the staff was met with warmth and enthusiasm.  One day as we returned to our Townhouse, my most particular traveling friend said to me, ""Look at this street (Frederick St.), where else in a city would you rather stay then a charming, lively street like this, with cafes and bistros right outside our door?""  On our last day, we had a major problem with our driver to another city and the lovely young women at the front desk came to the rescue with support, suggestions, and finally hands-on action to help us solve our problem.  We cannot thank them enough--they were all wonderful!",5,2022,05,16
230,"Civilised, central, very comfortable hotel","Charming Georgian building which houses a very smart, comfortable hotel which gets all the details right. Terrific cooked breakfast included in room price.  Next to a pay parking garage.  Central but quiet and within walking distance of central Dublin’s many attractions and dining options.",5,2022,05,16
230,Gem in the heart of Dublin!,"Stayed here for three nights in April 2022 in a superior room. Room was amazing, spacious with beautiful and comfortable couch and chair. Decorations were awesome, room was various shades of green, yellow and purple. Bookshelf was stocked with books by Irish authors as well as books about Dublin and Ireland, nice touch. Shower was AMAZING and water gushed from the ceiling. Best of all, room was quiet, which is key in such a busy area. Hotel is centrally located and ideal!",5,2022,04,16
230,Excellent stay from start to finish,Trinity Townhouse made us feel welcome from the minute we checked in. The service and staff were so friendly and nothing was a problem. The room was beautiful and top quality features. Thank you so much for everything we hope to return soon.,5,2022,03,30
230,Perfect place away from home!,"Great location, you can walk everywhere. The rooms are extremely clean and updated.  Bathrooms very modern.  Lobby warm and inviting.  Very nice. The staff is competent and extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast is very good and nade to order.  Looking forward to returning.  ",5,2022,03,23
230,A gem of place in the heart of Dublin.,"This hotel is perfect, location is amazing (hidden gem), and the staff...unbeilable fantastic! I want to start the review by thanking, Lidia, Abby, Alon, Dana and Lidia.  I stayed at this hotel: 2 nights on my first trip (mid February) and then 3 nights with my family (early March).  From the moment you arrive, you know this is not your typical hotel.  It is more like an exclusive apartment with guest services.  Do not expect the traditional hotel feel.  I felt like I had my own apartment in the middle of Dublin and I had a friend at the front desk to guide me, provide me with recommendations and assist me with any question or service that I needed.  Amazing! It made my stay in Dublin feel like I was at home.  They knew me by name and knew what I needed.  There is no elevator, which made it even better as I was able to do a bit of work-out getting to my room and along the way, I met a few of the other guests.  This is not a party place, a loud and obnoxious place, you will not find rude people.  Just guests who are interested in feeling like they are home.  Since I stayed here in two different occasions, I was able to experience two different rooms both in the upper floor, one facing west and the other east.  No street noise at night and its was quiet.  The rooms have their own AC units which allows you to control the temperature in them.  The housekeeping ladies (Dana and Lidia) will make sure your room is tidy every time you come back from your daily outing.  Lidia will make sure that your are welcomed and Abby and Alon will make sure that you are taken care in the weekend and evenings.  Can't say enough about this place!  Perfect gem and a great place to be at.",5,2022,03,22
230,Perfect in every way!,"This hotel is absolutely stunning! The proprietor, who is an absolute darling, kindly upgraded my room. The room itself is beautifully decorated and impeccably clean. Gorgeous attention to detail, stunning interior design, lovely scent, everything seems new and not in the least worn out. When I entered the room, soothing music was playing and everything was absolutely perfect. The room even features a Nespresso machine and amenities from Rituals (Happy Buddha). 

I could not be more pleased and will definitely chose this hotel for my next stay in Dublin. 
Highly recommend!!",5,2022,02,12
230,Perfect Christmas Stay,My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night coming up to Christmas. I can’t  fault this hotel! We stayed in one of the cosy rooms- the interiors are lovely and a delicious breakfast was included. The staff were also very welcoming and happy to help with anything. We will be back!,5,2021,12,21
230,Lovely little boutique hotel - excellent location,"The hotel has been very tastefully decorated for Christmas - looks lovely. Cosy and clean rooms with good facilities (fridge, hair dryer, radio, safe). Fantastic location. Only thing that let it down was the breakfast - vegetarian and vegan options are not very 'breakfasty' (e.g. aubergine...) and they apparently 'don't do scrambled eggs' which is rather dissapointing. Otherwise, a very good stay.",4,2021,11,28
230,Quiet elegance,"The hotel is decorated in an understated style, and was very restful. We appreciated all the little extras of water in reusable glass bottles, the Nepresso machine, the comfy robes. The breakfast area was bright and cheerful. The breakfast was always good and the server wonderful. It is very quiet at night, ensuring we were well rested for the next day!",5,2021,10,08
230,Our new go-to hotel in Dublin city centre,"We stayed here for a weekend recently and loved the place. It’s a hidden gem with a fantastic location just a couple of minutes from St. Stephen’s Green and Grafton Street and less than ten minutes walk to the National Gallery. Despite being in the heart of the city though, it was actually very quiet as well. The room was well appointed and the bathroom was very big for a city centre hotel. The staff were all very friendly and professional and we felt very welcome. There was no kitchen when we stayed (though the manager told us that they plan to open one soon), but instead they left breakfast boxes outside the room each morning, containing juice, yogurt with fruit and nuts, a banana and a croissant, and we could make tea and coffee in the room, which I thought was a very good workaround. We’d definitely stay here again.",5,2021,09,29
230,The prettiest find,"A truly fantastic experience was had at this hotel. The hotel is situated in the perfect spot, the street scene is beautiful, the location is great for exploring the beauty of Dublin and well within walking distance to the majority of attractions. The room was decorated in an excellent and elegant manner. The team working at the hotel were continuously warm, caring and helpful offering a high level of service. We weren't sure on whether the breakfast would be served at the room with the current covid restrictions however it was great news to find ourselves being offered to be seated in the light modern breakfast room with delicious choices available on the menu. I look forward to returning again.",5,2021,09,27
230,Fabulous gem in a perfect location,"Had the pleasure of a two night stay at Trinity Townhouse on 17th and 18th of September. The room was beautiful and spotlessly clean as was the bathroom, very comfy bed and the hotel was really quiet at night making for a great nights rest. The staff were friendly, helpful and courteous. Lydia on reception was so helpful as was the lady who served our beautiful hot breakfast in the modern, bright breakfast room. The manager Priony Baruah was really helpful to us in planning our day including providing us with passes to the whiskey distillery which was a very enjoyable experience. The location of the hotel is so convenient for an array of cafes, bars and restaurants in Dawson Street with Grafton Street a short walk away for the shopping experience you may also enjoy. I would highly recommend the Trinity Townhouse for a truly enjoyable stay in the most vibrant area of Dublin.",5,2021,09,20
230,Fantastically located hotel with beautiful rooms.,"I've stayed twice in the Trinity Townhouse Hotel, and will stay again. It's one of the best-located hotels in the city.

The rooms are newly upgraded and are nicer than some of the more expensive hotels in Dublin. The attention to detail is what makes them particularly good - as a repeat guest, they had a handwritten note in the room, welcoming me personally, which was a simple but lovely touch.",5,2021,08,27
230,A very nice Dubliner apartment in Dublin center.,"The room was small, nevertheless very well cared: comfortable bed, big TV, coffe, tea and water, very excellent furniture in the room. The bathrom has a big shower and good soft towels.

 Very very clean! Position very close to the city center.

 The house has a very nice and original traditional  style.

 Breakfast, due to COVID, was served at room door prepacked. Fresh yogurt, banana, a croissant, and a fruit juice. We were advised about... Not bad, but surely not aligned to the structure service level. Surely after Covid they will do better,  considering the general level.

Very kind personnel.

Note: there is no free parking, there is a private parking, but expensive.",5,2021,07,30
230,Perfect Location,"Lovely little gem located on what must be one of the quietest streets in Dublin city centre. Seems to be recently refurbished and room was absolutely spotless and tastefully decorated although maybe a bit on the small side. Big shout out to Gregory the receptionist who let us back into our room after we left without the key, very friendly and polite guy :)",5,2020,08,21
230,A secret I don’t want to share,"My husband discovered this hotel in a recent business trip and after lockdown we chose to venture a little further and book in for the night as a family. Wow..Lydia greeted us with a very warm welcome and was able to tell us that we were able to stay in the same room as before ... the rooms..wow...perfectly furnished with everything you could wish for...compact yes. but everything you need is there...we ordered the breakfast boxes which are filled with THE most delicious continental selection. Special thanks to Elena who allowed us the longe to our ourselves when we came back from the restaurant 
I hate to recommend this hotel as we want to keep it a secret and to ourselves. Central..parking beside the hotel...and a fabulous Italian opposite. Do not stay here!!!  Cause we want to xxx",5,2020,07,12
230,"Great location, friendly staff and a lovely, cosy room!","A great experience which really made our trip to Dublin special! Staff were friendly and helpful (especially as we arrived quite late) and the room was lovely. Quite small (super cosy!) but had everything we could need - including facilities like a mini fridge, hairdryer, robes and slippers etc. Location was perfect - a quiet street but incredibly central and a lovely Italian resultant/bar opposite which I would recommend also. Great value too!",5,2020,03,16
230,Super Place,"Located in a quiet street in the centre of Dublin and near Trinity college .lovely Italian restaurant opposite. Rooms small but everything you need including a large firm bed, large TV and one of those expensive showers. I thought the room had been well designed and I am sure at some cost .
No lifts , but not a problem for me but perhaps for others.Staff both very polite and helpful. breakfast was included in the price and was excellent. In short, I highly recommend this place.

",5,2020,03,06
230,superb,"Terrific hotel.   Extremely central.   Very well run.  Good breakfast.  Loved the restrained classic decor.
Room was in annexe across the small street from the main hotel.  Was on third floor ,62 steps but an easy climb  and not difficult for my husband in his late 70s. If feeble ask for a room on lower floors.
Room was very very quiet was at back of the building.  Beautifully appointed.   Even had toothbrushes and clothes brush and coffee machine with coffee pods.   Very relaxing lounges both in main building and in the annexe, hand newspapers and books
Loved the fact that there were books in the bedroom in my case Yeats poetry etc.  Would that all hotels were as thoughtful in every way as the management in this hotel.   And for bibliophiles there is a fabulous bookshop called Hodges Figgis in nearby Dawson St.

",5,2020,02,29
230,"Great hotel, but ..","The hotel is in a very nice and quiet location close to Trinity College and St stephens Green. The bus station to the airport is a 5 minutes walk away. 
The rooms are a bit small but very nice and comfortable. The bathroom is compared to the room big. 
Breakfast was included which was good. 

The check in was very smooth and friendly. As there is no elevator the Receptionist  offered to carry the luggage as the room is on the third floor.
Check out is 11 which is compared to other hotels early.
I asked for 12 and I got it which was nice.
As my suitcase was very heavy and I have shoulder problems I asked for help. 
The receptionist on this day said i have to do it on my own as she is alone. I said, at check in I was told to ask for help when I check out. She replied then in a very rude tone that I should ask the colleague who told me this (but he wasn’t  working on this day). 
When I came down with my suitcase she said, why I complain, it is not heavy at all ( 20 kilos!) and that she had a heart operation.
I totally understand if she was alone and can’t help me but talking like this to a guest is unbelievable. You should always be nice, but this was very very rude! 
It leaves a bad impression on me and I wouldn’t stay there again although the hotel is very nice. But it takes more to have a great stay. A hotel always comes with the people working there.",3,2020,02,23
230,What a find!,"Booked very last minute. Staff are great, location brilliant, rooms lush, bed dreamy, shower and lotions & potions upmarket, breakfast gorgeous. Please don’t spread the word as I want to stay again and don’t want people finding out about this secret gem!!! ",5,2020,02,09
230,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel, situated within walking distance of the city centre & most attractions.  Rooms were lovely, ours was small but had everything we needed in it although could be a bit tight at times.  The decor was gorgeous, rooms were spotlessly clean.  Staff were very friendly & were there to help whenever needed.  A lovely hotel for a short break.  A great Italian across the road from us & a lovely wee cafe at end of road for breakfast, nice and reasonably priced.",4,2020,01,13
230,Lovely hotel,The staff were very friendly and the room was very modern and clean. We booked a small room because it was only one night but they have larger ones. Room still had all conveniences and again very clean.  Real treat to stay in an old converted Georgian house and the area is very quiet even though it's only 2 minutes to Grafton Street. Highly recommended.,5,2020,01,02
230,Ireland vacation,"This is a quaint, yet beautiful hotel in Dublin.It's  walking distance to Trinity College and St. Stephens green. They had a wonderful breakfast downstairs each morning.  The only downside was the lack of an elevator, which was unfortunate given our unwieldy luggage!",5,2019,12,30
230,could not have found better,"I have stayed in this cozy Georgian townhouse near practically everything in Dublin. Grafton Street just bedind the corner, St Stephen's Green, Merrion Square or Temple Bar at walking distance. The townhouse is really the same appearing in the website. The room has all the facilities you may need, well equipped and elegant, with taste. Despite its central location, it is quiet. Receptionists welcome you with a smile and are ready to help you in suggestions to visit this surprisingly beautiful city. Absolutely recommended",5,2019,12,30
230,Lovely stay!,"My husband and I stayed with another couple for two nights at the Trinity House Hotel. First of all the location cannot be beat - it's in the heart of the city yet is nice quiet. Quite a find indeed. Lydia, one of the staff, was wonderful. She made sure that we were comfortable, which was were, and was so hospitable and kind. That makes a huge difference when you know you have someone at the desk to help with anything you need. The decor was elegant and very tasteful and the beds were comfortable. My husband loved the shaving mirror the placement of it (who knew such a detail could be that important :D  I highly recommend this beautiful townhouse hotel.",5,2019,11,21
230,In the midst of Dublin,"The hotel is located in two buildings situated opposite. The location is highly recommended. There is a parking garage, one minute to go and you can ask at the reception for a voucher which provides a discount on the daily fee. The rooms are elegant and very convenient and the bathroom is modern and state-of-the-art. Although the bathroom is narrow it has smart equipment an thus sufficient space. There is a highly recommended Italian restaurant next door to the hotel.",4,2019,11,09
230,Fabulous,"Wonderful townhouse hotel. Beautiful building and surrounding area. Restaurants and shops on your doorstep yet an extremely quiet street. 
The room was perfect, clean and had everything you need. Tea and coffee facilities in the room. I wouldn't be concerned in relation to no breakfast as there is cafes galore on your doorstep. Can't beat the location.",5,2019,11,06
230,Great location!,"Loved our stay at this townhouse/hotel in Dublin! It was a great location, so close to Trinity College and Grafton Street. Very quiet street too. We’re were in a room where the main reception was located, but they also have the townhouse right across the street. The room was very comfortable, especially the plush bed! Great bathroom too! We were there 4 nights and highly recommended. ",5,2019,11,03
230,Very nice but big letdown.,Great location with very nice finishes in the room. Were given a room in the building across the street from lobby. No elevator made it a little bit of a test to get luggage up and down the steps from second floor.  Big disappointment occurred when we went out for the day and returned in the early evening only to find that our room had not been serviced.  I had to go to the lobby to get fresh towels and coffee/tea for the morning.  I assume this was a rare incident..,4,2019,10,19
230,Lovely place and perfect location!,"This was the perfect place to spend our first night in Dublin!  Beautiful old Georgian townhouse that has been converted into a boutique style hotel.  Rooms were very large with a separate seating area, double bed and modern bathrooms. Lovely details in both rooms (old fireplace in one of our rooms with flowers in the window boxes and view of the street).  Staff was friendly and helpful. Location is central to everything you want to see in Dublin.  No restaurant when we were there but we were told it was being renovated (would have been nice to have breakfast before setting out the next day). We highly recommend Trinity Townhouse!",5,2019,10,14
230,Great little old-style hotel,"This hotel is a cute little old-style hotel with all necessary amenities right in the center of Dublin, near Trinity college. Great location. They also called it ""Bed & Breakfast"", but the restaurant was closed. So no breakfast, but there are ample options around the hotel.The hotel was in the process of being refurbished/ renovated. I had requested one of the renovated rooms. Was really nice, and wifi worked great as well. Yes, it is a very small room, the bed is overpowering the room and funny, the sink is in the room underneath the TV. There really is no space to even keep an open suitcase, but I did find a spot in front of the door where it fit ;) There is no elevator but I was traveling with a small carry on suitcase, so it was fine for me. It is a little pricy, but well, it is Dublin... I found it really charming and endearing.  would stay there again.",5,2019,10,11
230,"Great location, lovely details","We leave here very pleased with this accommodation. So many lovely details in rooms...little things like a ceramic teapot and kettle, an incredibly comfy bed, quality finishes everywhere you look. The furnishes are all pleasing to the senses. Loved the radio in the room! 

Location was great. Close to grafton street, we walked everywhere from here. 

I recommend this hotel, we were room 300 across the street, on the lower level. Very impressive. 

Thank you to the staff that were more than accommodating when needed.  You have sent us on our way with happy memories of our last couple nights in Ireland. Well done.",5,2019,09,28
230,Great location and stay,The rooms were beautiful and clean. Great location. The staff were so kind in holding our luggage and helping us around Dublin. There was no breakfast available due to renovations but thats ok we found some great places close by. We will be back for another stay.,5,2019,09,24
230,Superb,"We chose this hotel because it was close to Tara train station, and we couldn’t get one in Temple Bar where we had stayed before. We are so glad we did.  Everything about it was lovely....decor, peaceful, and the best bathroom in Dublin I believe! We will always choose this area, and we would definitely return to this hotel. No breakfast was available at the time as the hotel is undergoing some renovation.  But the restaurant next door was terrific!",5,2019,09,24
230,The second stay lowered their rating.,"We were looking for a place near our tour pick-up and drop-off, and we were most concerned about comfort for our one-night stays. I also wanted a place that offered breakfast. Trinity was only two minutes from our tour. I initially saw that they offered breakfast but, everything after that indicated that dining was not available until Oct 2019. Probably not a deal breaker, but finding breakfast in that neighborhood at 7:30 on a Sunday morning was a challenge.
Anyway, we showed up for our first night too early to check-in. They were very nice about taking our bags for storage (They even took the bags to our room before we returned to check-in). Our room was spacious and very nice and, despite overlooking the street, it was quiet. We truly enjoyed our stay. In the morning, they again watched our bags while we went down the street for breakfast. Altogether a very good stay, where we were treated like valued customers.
On our return two weeks later, we were placed in the annex across the street. Our room was tiny - kind of what we had experienced in budget hotels in Norway. There was neither a luggage shelf nor much of any place to put one - unless you think outside the box and install a fold-away. We were left to put our bags in whatever space where we were least likely to trip over them. The bathroom was likewise tiny. Whoever designed the bedside cabinets may have a promising future as a fry cook. They were placed intrusively close to the bed and had sharp corners. I had the thrill of getting painfully cracked in the head in the middle of the night. At least the staff was again pleasant about watching our bags while we went out for the day. We had a late start the next morning and, about 8 AM, I was in bed waiting to take my shower, when a man appeared on a ladder outside our window, working on our window planter. Had it been my wife in bed, she would have freaked out!",3,2019,09,23
230,Great Location,"Wonderful place to stay in Dublin. The room was comfortable, clean and quiet. In addition, Lidia at the front desk was extremely helpful in getting us set up for a three day stay. Great location and as the other reviews have stated within walking distance of so many sites and events. Grafton Street is just two blocks away and Trinity University is right there. My wife and I along with two friends that stayed in another room give this hotel a two thumbs up.",5,2019,09,19
230,Staff needs to brush up on their people skills,"Room in the basement was nice enough. Television was located so that it couldn't be 
 viewed from bed.  No elevator ok but no one to help with luggage either up or down. Desk clerks not at all warm.  In fact quite rude compared to the 4 other hotels we stayed in during our trip around Ireland. No breakfast as was listed but were later compensated by upper management (not on site).  Good location and would be a great place to stay if the help improved their attitudes.",2,2019,09,10
230,Beautiful room but squeaky floorboards ,"Loved the high end finishes of the room. En-suite was great with a big shower head and heated towel rack. Bed was comfortable. Only very minor issue was that the floorboards were a little squeaky and so could hear the people above walking around. But understandable as it is an old building.
Our room was quite compact, but sufficient.
Fantastic location. Lovely staff.",4,2019,09,03
230,"Great location, lovely room",We arrived in Dublin and spent 2 nights here. The location is AWESOME. It’s near everything and is walkable which made acclimating to Dublin easier. We had breakfast next door which was very good. Only issue is that there’s construction going on out side the rooms and it starts at 8am. Other than that the room was spacious and lovely. The bed was very comfortable. ,5,2019,07,30
230,"excellent hotel on a quiet side street, but in the  heart of tourist area","Booked this small hotel , which is recommended by Rick Steves and Lonely Planet, with TripAdvisor reviews to match.It is located in the VERY busy main tourist area, but is on a quiet side street. It is just down the street from Trinity College, ect. Staff was friendly and helpful. Given a surprise upgrade to the lovely deluxe double.Rooms are as pictured. They were doing something with the breakfast room-so  can't comment on their restaurant ( the Italian restaurant next door, Dunne and Crescenzi, had a good breakfast)",5,2019,07,26
230,Central hotel in Dublin,"We stayed only one night and I must say that this hotel is central very welcoming, very clean, friendly and welcoming staff and with a great breakfast. Parking close to payment but agreement. Only flaw very small room.",4,2024,07,13

230,Excellent hotel for location and environment,"A hotel in an excellent position in relation to the centre, friendly breakfast staff, a good and varied range of food in the morning.

230,All perfect,"All perfect! From the rooms to the breakfast. Cleanliness and kindness of the staff.

I would definitely recommend it.",5,2023,10,24

230,Stay in Dublin,"Excellent hotel in a strategic position. Initially the proposed room was not to our liking (rather small deluxe with a single window overlooking the wall!!). Our change request was promptly satisfied and we were assigned a much better, much larger room still on the ground floor but at least with a view of the internal courtyard.
Very positive notes from the breakfast, good choice and everything freshly prepared.
Extremely friendly and professional staff.

230,Besser geht es nicht - Top,Wir hatten ein sehr schönes langes Wochenende - super Unterkunft - super Frühstück - direkt gegenüber ist ein super Italiener - alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind innerhalb von 5 - 20 min. gut zu Fuß erreichbar ! Top,5,2023,07,12
230,Super soggiorno a Dublino!,"Ho soggiornato qui per 4 notti con il mio moroso e siamo più che soddisfatti! 
Camere pulite con letti comodissimi, dotate di macchina del caffè e di bollitore con tutto l'occorrente per potersi fare un tè. Bagno molto ampio e luminoso, unica pecca la mancanza di un mobiletto per poter appoggiare le cose e una presa di corrente. Colazione alla carta veramente fantastica, con piatti preparati al momento. Posizione ottima a pochi passi da Grafton Street e a meno di 1 km da Temple Bar, ottima per raggiungere tutte le maggiori attrazioni a piedi. 
La perla va allo staff, di una cordialità unica, ci hanno aiutato fornendoci qualsiasi info utile e anche prenotandoci il taxi per la mattina del check-out visto che avevamo il volo presto.
Ve lo consiglio per trascorrere qualche giorno in tranquillità in giro per Dublino.",5,2023,01,05
230,Tutto super!!! ,"Sono 5 stelle tutte meritate! 
Servizio, camera, posizione, colazione. Il rapporto qualità-prezzo è sbilanciato a favore di una qualità davvero al top!!! 
La camera è pulita, con tutto l’essenziale: due bottiglie di acqua, caffè Nespresso, bollitore, biscotti. Buoni i prodotti da bagno, accappatoio e ciabatte. 
Si dorme molto bene sia per la temperatura perfetta che per la zona non rumorosa. 
La colazione è davvero superlativa, viene servita al tavolo, con ampia scelta di piatti elaborati per tutti i gusti. 
L’hotel si trova in una posizione strategica, vicino al centro e ben servita dai mezzi pubblici. 
Che dire, lo consiglierei senz’altro! ",5,2021,12,07
230,Top!,"Posto al top, per ambiente,per il personale, per la posizione strategica (a due passi da Grafton street cuore pulsante di Dublino, dalla zona di Temple Bar piena di ristoranti e dalla statua di Molly malo è da cui partono tutti i tout) per la colazione! Veramente da consigliare per un soggiorno romantico a Dublino. Prezzi in linea!",5,2021,08,19
230,"wär super gewesen, aber....","super Lage, Hotelzimmer gemütlich (sehr ringhörig), Badezimmer tip top, hübsch eingerichtet, bequeme Betten, aber....

...das W-Lan hat in den 3 Tagen auf den Zimmern nicht funktioniert, angeblich war das Problem schön länger bekannt. Die Dame an der Reception war sehr unfreundlich & hat das als läppisches Problem, das sowiso nicht jenes des Hotels, sondern des Providers sei, abgetan. Für uns war das W-lan ein wichtiger Grund zum hier zu buchen, da wir sehr gerne im Hotelzimmer surfen. Nicht die Tatsache, sondern die sehr unfreundliche Reaktion wär sehr ernüchternd....!",4,2019,11,11
230,"Gute Lage, freundliche Mitarbeiter, aber teuer bei durchschnittlichen Zimmern","Die Lage der Trinity Lodge ist für die Erkundung Dublins wirklich klasse. Das Trinity College, die Grafton Street, Temple Bar, St. Stephens Green...alles fußläufig erreichbar. Auch die Parkmöglichkeit im Q-Park Setanta ist klasse. Wir haben das Auto Freitag abgestellt und Sonntag wieder abgeholt - vom Hotel erhielten wir bei Check-Out eine zweite Parkkarte die unsere Parkgebühren halbierte. Super!
Unser Zimmer lag im Gebäude gegenüber, direkt im Erdgeschoss, ein Hinterhofzimmer. Auch wenn wir zu zweit Schlafmöglichkeiten für vier hatten und das Zimmer durchaus groß war, wirkte es sehr dunkel. Das Rollo haben wir lieber unten gelassen, der Ausblick ging auf den nicht sehenswerten Hof. Auch die Fenster hielten wir daher geschlossen und verließen uns auf die Klimaanlage. Zum Glück waren wir den Großteil des Tages auf Achse und nur zum Schlafen im Zimmer. Größtes Manko: Eine Anlage im Hof, die nahezu durchgehend lief und das Surren im Zimmer sehr laut zu hören war. Gut, dass wir Ohrstöpsel mit dabei hatten...
Das Frühstück war in Ordnung. Die Auswahl war okay und alles, was wir probiert haben, hat geschmeckt. Positiv zu erwähnen sind die immer freundlichen Mitarbeiter.",3,2018,08,05
230,Hübsches Hotel im Herzen von Dublin,"Wir haben nur eine Nacht in der Trinity Loge verbracht und waren sehr zufrieden. Wir hatten ein wirklich großes und geräumiges Zimmer. 
Die Lage ist nicht zu toppen. Wir konnten alles fußläufig erreichen. 
Das Frühstück war hervorragend und wurde frisch für uns zubereitet. 
Das Einzige was uns sehr störte, war die Tatsache, dass man für ein Hotel dieser Kategorie den Wi-Fi Zugang nochmal extra bezahlen musste.",4,2015,01,04
