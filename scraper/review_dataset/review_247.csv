247,Enjoyable short break in Sandymount Hotel,"A truly wonderful experience yet again.  Family run hotel with friendly welcoming staff, great food and a great location close to theatres, Aviva stadium, RDS, 3Arena and the delightful Sandymount village. Rooms are spotlessly clean, excellent restaurant and staff, especially Beatrice on front desk, make it feel like a home from home.",5,2024,10,18

247,Great location for Friends meet up,Really lovely hotel - great rooms and very friendly staff.  Good location for Aviva stadium and close to Dart station so very easy to get into city centre also.    We did not eat here but the bar area and other breakout areas around reception were good.  Lovely restaurants close by also if you want to stay more local.,5,2024,10,15
247,Excellent,"Myself and my partner stayed here for one night and the whole experience was excellent. Staff were polite and highly professional, the room was exceptionally clean.

Overall, could not recommend more! 5 stars",5,2024,10,12
247,Good location and comfortable rooms,"I’ve stayed here many times over the years as it’s convenient location for work, with comfortable bedrooms and seating areas by the reception area. The barfood is lovely too. Overall no complaints. I would recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere close to the city centre without being right in the middle but still easily accessible with the Dart.",4,2024,10,09
247,Pleasant stay,Great location for getting into town and south Dublin. On every occasion we needed it the staff were very helpful and friendly. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The bar was convenient and convivial. Didn’t need to use the restaurant so can’t comment.,5,2024,10,08
247,rainy days in dublin,"teams are better than the rooms, sometimes very loud in the room from corridor and neighbarhood, ways and elevator not good for wheelchairs,
quality of bar and restaurant was very good, location in dublin is good for tourists

how much I write is my own decision",4,2024,10,03
247,Slightly disappointing stay,A bit overpriced considering other hotels we’d stayed at in Ireland. Hotel room was ok (despite the large cobweb by the  wardrobe). Bar area was good. Breakfast disappointing with overcooked poached eggs being served(felt like we didn’t matter).,4,2024,09,30
247,Perfect for Dublin vacation,"Great location, breakfast, people. Beds were comfortable. Rooms nice. In sandymount which is a nice residential area near Avila stadium. East access to downtown attractions. Lovely staff. Decor is beautifully eclectic. Would definitely stay again.",5,2024,09,29

247,Great hotel with free parking,"We had a 4 night stay at this hotel, no problems here all was great, the large buffet breakfasts, the comfy room, a lovely evening meal, free parking. It's close to the DART station but we chose to walk into the City via the river walk.",5,2024,09,25

247,"Comfort, well run hotel with parking","We had a midweek 2 night stay to explore Dublin and were able to park up our car for the stay. The hotel is a combination of connected villas so interior navigation can be confusing. Our super king room met our expectations, the TV was a bit small and old! We went to town by taxi but the DART station at Lansdown Road is easily walkable. There were no events at the Arriva Stadium nearby so it was quiet at nighttime. We ate in on the first night and it was very good. Breakfast is served in the lower restaurant and again it was very good.",4,2024,09,22
247,Great location and staff,The location of this hotel is so good. Close to town and the Aviva. The rooms are small but perfect for what we needed. We had to change rooms because my husband’s knee is dodgy. No issue and excellent customer service. Slept well and didn’t have breakfast.,4,2024,09,22
247,Excellent stay,A lovely hotel with good food and a quiet room. Having a carpark was very helpful. Being near to the Dart train station and the ferryport. was a big plus.,5,2024,09,20
247,Well located hotel,Very friendly and attentive staff. Very good breakfast. Room too small for two people plus two suitcases. There are no hooks in the bathroom for towels to dry. Furniture is no longer the latest. The price is a bit too high for that.,3,2024,09,19
247,Very helpful staff,"Our room was pretty small, but had everything we needed and was very convenient. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. We weren't there long enough to eat or drink which was a shame, but the Line Out Bar looked great and welcoming",5,2024,09,19

247,We Will return when possible,"Friendly staff and very willing to help us in guiding us to our event on saterday evening at the other end of Dublin.
Breakfast excellent and I even get a fresh made espresso, of good quality.
We were having the 08.00 hr Ferry on sunday morning, and the staff was well prepared on the early check out.
The breakfast  was also very well on this early sunday morning.
Tip: if you’re to stay in Dublin check this hotel! A very good place to stay, certainly if you should have an event in Aviva stadium.",5,2024,09,13
247,Short but very pleasant stay in the Sandymount Hotel.,"The hotel was in a great location with ample parking and great friendly staff. Our room was a little outdated but clean and perfect for our short stay. The restaurant and bar area was perfect and very conducive to relaxing and enjoying Irish ambience.
Shout out to Rose in housekeeping for mailing my jacket which I left and never thought I would see again. Thank you to all.",5,2024,09,12
247,Great time at Sandymount,"The hotel was great! We were there for two days, and had breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurant - both meals were excellent. The room was luxurious and very clean. The staff was very accommodating and brought us coffee and scones in the lounge when we arrived.",5,2024,09,11
247,"Location, location, location!","The Sandymount Hotel is our preferred hotel in this area. It’s perfectly located for days at the Aviva. Great parking, fabulous food and a lovely atmosphere at all times. Beatrice, at reception, has been a pleasure to deal with over many years and always has a great welcome for us. Whether it’s for a short stay or an overnight, this is a prime location, great for matches but also only a few minutes drive from Grafton street shopping.",5,2024,09,10
247,Good Hotel,Very good hotel and the place is also good. Very recommended for family stay. Place is not too far from the city and just near aviva stadium,5,2024,09,09
247,Nice hotel with a personal feel,"I would recommend this hotel if you have a short break in Dublin.
The rooms were comfortable and clean with enough space for a couple + luggage.
The staff were all really nice and friendly. The breakfast buffet was well stocked, tasty and varied. The building is very big with lots of winding corridors- easy to get a little lost.
My main complaint/issue was stepping in and out of the bath to have a shower. The bath had a very high side and it felt unsafe to get out with wet feet- my husband had to help me get out every time. I'm 5'2"", 40 yrs old and I'm able bodied. If I was a lot older and on my own I think it would be impossible to take a shower safely. Older people might want to ask able accessible rooms?",5,2024,09,07
247,Nice and relaxing staying,"A good hotel, clean, quiet, located in a convenient place to visit the city - the rail stations is very close- and to the leave the car in the free parking. Moreover, th ereception team is very kind and ready to help. Thank you Rose, Leonardo and the whole staff for your support.

247,A shameful way o treat a disabled guest,"I booked the accessible room, after having confirmation that it was fully accessible to a person in a wheelchair. When I checked in, it tiurned out the lift that served the room was too small to take my wheelchair. I was given a different room but this was very small, and the bed and bathroom facilities very low, with no grabrails i the bathroom. access to the room was via the car park and an unattended back door. Not very pleasant given the weather last July.",3,2024,09,04
247,Average hotel,"Perhaps something more for my senior citizen parents.  Small rooms, noisy--though the area is very quiet.  Residential. Not near city attractions. ",3,2024,09,03

Friendly staff
Good chamber
Nice breakfast
In the neigbourhead of the beach
",5,2024,09,03
247,Room down graded,Prior to arrival the hotel sent me a message saying you had changed our room number.  The room we were changed to was tucked away inside the hotel that had a ‘ boxed in ‘ view of two walls.  Why was our room changed because we very much think we were down graded ?,1,2024,09,01
247,Central location. ,"Wasn't aware of this hotel until this visit. Very happy to have 'discovered' it!  Coveniently located for overnight stay for event at RDS. ( even closer to the Aviva stadium) Spacious car park. Quiet area, outside seating and coffee van. Lovely public areas, nicely furnished. Friendly staff at reception and bar. There is a lift but we did also have some stairs to navigate to our room, which may not suit everyone but all ok for us. Spacious, well appointed, very clean room, very comfortable beds, and bedding. Tea, coffee making facilities, iron and safe provided. Fresh milk was available on request. Small bathroom but great shower ( bath mat available on request) and Rituals wash products. Didn't dine in the hotel but will hopefully have an opportunity for this on another visit. Lovely stay.",4,2024,08,31

247,"Good place, ok location","The Sandymount Hotel is a reasonably priced place in the shadow of Aviva Stadium. Unfortunately, we weren’t there for a rugby match. Bottom line: the hotel is ok. Our room was quite tight but we were really only there to sleep. Their restaurant is not fancy but the food was better than passable. The location?  It’s a healthy walk to anyplace you want to go.  Or a quick Uber or taxi ride. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. What we saved on the hotel versus closer in properties more than compensated for the location. We would do it again.",4,2024,08,15
247,Disappointed unfortunately,"Pros: great location to avaiva stadium and RDS. A lovely area of Dublin. Lovely outside seating area and coffee cart. Car parking (only limited spaces and no where else really to park locally. Staff do their best to get you in.)

Negative- when we where given the keys to our room, there was already bags in it! Luckily we exited straight out but I didn't like the fact a couple was staying in that room and didn't know we where in it. Could have been the people actually in it which would have been very awkward for both parties. We went back to reception and the man at reception wasn't rude, but he wasn't overly apologic either. It took him 15 mins to sort and we where just left standing there. The room we go then was the same decorated and was modern but the part of the hotel it was in was older and a bit more run down. The walls where paper thin so you could hear everyone in the corridor. The bedroom doors all slammed closed so from 7am no one on the corridor was getting sleep. The shower was in the bath and the bath plug wouldn't release meaning the water wouldn't drain. We went to the bar about 7pm and only one staff member so took about 15 mins to get served. We were going for my 30th birthday and put this in the comments but no card or comment regarding this. The stay was OK. Would I come back? Probably not. Would I reccomended? Also Probably not. Disappointed as was still about €200 for a mediocre stay.",3,2024,08,15
247,Beautiful Hotel,"I really appreciated the quick check in and check out process. The hotel has multiple seating areas throughout the main floor with absolutely beautiful furniture. The patio areas behind the hotel and in front are lovely. The restaurant has a great menu - I enjoyed a delicious vegan salad. The location is great, in a quiet area with friendly people. We walked into the main street and had some drinks at a pub. There is also a grocery store and beach within walking distance. ",5,2024,08,15
247,Dublin Horse Show - shuttle bus,"Stayed in the hotel for the Dublin Horse Show - the hotel provided a shuttle bus to and from the RDS for guests. It ran every half hour which was great and the fabulous Dave was driving - 10/10, sound man. 
Very handy, would highly recommend this hotel for the Horse Show!",5,2024,08,14
247,Dave the legend,Dave took us to the RDS safely 😊 very friendly and professional service. Shuttle bus is very very handy ......................................................................................................................,5,2024,08,14
247,Great Hotel,This hotel was perfect for our stay. It is within walking distance to a DART station and several great pubs. The staff is friendly and always helpful. We were able to explore the city easily from this location. It is also located in a great neighborhood and was quiet at night. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2024,08,13
247,Amazing stay!!,"What a beautiful hotel, in peaceful area but still close to the centre. The staff are welcoming and do everything they can for you! Service was incredible.

247,"A quality, award-winning, family run hotel in a safe and perfect location for Dublin City centre and the coast.","Our five night stay at the Sandymount Hotel was fabulous from beginning to end. The team are a real credit to this family run hotel. Friendly and professional, they definitely go over and above for their guests. The hotel is located in a safe and peaceful area of Dublin, perfect for stepping away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre, but also just a short stroll from the Dart train, giving easy and affordable access to all the local attractions, restaurants and bars. It is well worth booking breakfast if you are staying at this hotel. A quality spread of both hot and cold options will set you up for a busy day. We couldn’t have been happier with our stay and would return in an instant. ",5,2024,08,10
247,Another great stay,Another great stay with friendly staff that are always helpful. The check in was very smooth. Beatrice the receptionist has a very professional and friendly manner. The hotel is very clean and the breakfast was of a high standard and catered for all tastes.,5,2024,08,09
247,Not a good value for money,"This is our third time in Sandymount Hotel.
We used to have it as a preference when in dublin because of the location and for the room (big room with a clean and big bathroom ), but when we got the room we were very surprise to find a tiny and old bathroom (basin leaking) you can’t use in a comfortable way the WC because it’s too close to the batch… and the room was dark and smaller than the one we had before. 
The worst experience of the 3 in sandymount but the most expensive one (360€ 2 nights). In my opinion it’s not a good value for money.",2,2024,08,07
247,Great stay wonderful staff fabulous hotel.,"I had a lovely stay at the Sandymount Hotel. It’s a beautiful hotel lovely staff dedicated and friendly family run hotel in a lovely area.

247,All Ireland Family Stay,"What a wonderful Hotel. Stayed here with Family when down for the All Ireland Football Finals (which we won!!).  These family run hotels are becoming a lot less common and it's a real shame.  The staff are genuinely welcoming and pleased to welcome you. Bar staff are attentive and the restaurant is terrific.

Bathroom small. Toilet roll holder too far away, could not reach. Kept banging elbow on sink when using toilet. Iron had loose plug and exposed wires on hairdryer. Reported it but nothing done, so unable to use them for my own safety. The drinks we ordered from drinks menu were out of stock. Waited 20 mins for cocktail to arrive. Only saw one member of staff smile. Customer service a little lacking in some areas. Good location and quiet room. Food was good. Plenty of parking ",3,2024,07,22
247,We’ve really found a gem,"Wow - this hotel has it all including Beatrice at the front desk. We arrived early - too early to check in but we met Beatrice.

It was nice to see plenty of activity around the hotel, as our previous stays were during the pandemic and in the period when restrictions were in place.  I would have no hesitation in recommending a stay here during a visit to Dublin. Our room was comfortable and clean. Staff are welcoming and helpful, there is plenty of parking available for those who are driving, easy access to transport options serving the city centre and elsewhere, and a easy short walk away to Sandymount Green which has some bars, eateries, coffee, and of course the green area which is very pleasant.",5,2024,07,17

247,Wonderful experience at the Sandymount Hotel,"Had a wonderful stay and dining experience while attending a concert in the 3 Arena.
The bar staff were so friendly and tried their best to get the tennis on the TV in the bar for us.
Our meal was cooked to perfection and as my wife is coeliac she was able to have a lovely gluten free meal without any issue.
We had a great time and would certainly return again in the future.",4,2024,07,08

247,Short Dublin stay,"A very nice hotel stones throw from the Aviva Stadium and a DART station that is three stops from town. Beds comfy, room was huge. Tea and coffee making facilities (though could do with providing more sugar). Bathroom very modern and clean and the shower was fantastic. Staff all very nice and helpful",5,2024,07,07
247,Car park attendants were so helpful,"A group of us were staying here for the Pink concert but when we arrived the hotel carpark was full. Davy and another man were advising visitors of this and I have to say they were the nicest most helpful men. They tried their very best for us. They got us a space along the street and told us if there were any spaces became available later a member of staff could park the car in the car park for us. Thank goodness for this advice as we got a space after the concert.
Nice hotel friendly staff. Rooms were very warm when we stayed and no air con so we left our windows open. 
Great selection at breakfast and food all tasted lovely. I would definitely consider staying here again",5,2024,07,04

Friendly welcoming staff. A perfect location to stay in Dublin without the noise and traffic.",5,2024,07,01
247,They were really on point with the customer experience,My teenage girls and I stayed here as we were attending the Taylor Swift concert. When we arrived we were directed to a parking spot and they were expecting us as they had our name on the guest list. We arrived at midday expecting to drop our bags off and dander around Dublin until our room was ready. So we were very surprised when they told us our room was ready and we could go ahead and check in early. They advised us they were having a bbq outside later and were very welcoming. The hotel was playing Taylor Swift music for the fans. The bbq was fantastic. The food was great and the atmosphere was brilliant. After the concert the hotel provided complimentary hot finger food for the hungry concert goers. This was a really great idea and much appreciated. Staying at the hotel was an experience in itself. The staff were brilliant and I'll definitely be back. ,5,2024,07,01
247,Our stay in Dublin,"Not so bad, but the room was really small, especially the bathroom and the sink, the Hotel is good, but too dispersive, the staff is kind, but the reception a little bit less",4,2024,07,01
247,Disappointing experience,"This hotel is very well located, if your visit requires convenience to the Aviva or indeed any of the amenities in the Ballsbridge area. It’s very clean, but here the attributes end. It’s a basic hotel charging extortionate rates due to its location. There were thuggish bouncer types on the door who were the rudest hotel staff I have ever encountered. Having stayed at the hotel on Saturday June 29th we asked that our name be put on the list to re-enter on Sunday evening to retrieve our luggage and use the bathroom facilities. However, when we returned in the evening we were refused entry by a dreadfully rude individual who told us he would get our things but would not let us back into the hotel. I have never known any hotel in Ireland or abroad to treat a guest with such hostility. It was very upsetting and utterly disappointing. I would therefore recommend using any other hotel in the vicinity before choosing this one. There are many which are also very conveniently located in relation to the Aviva, and I’m certain there can’t be any that would treat its guests in this manner. Avoid, if at all possible!",1,2024,07,01
247,Taylor Swift,Hotel was exceptionally located for the venue. 5 people stayed. Staff and cleanliness were exceptional. Even provided hot food after concert for people and kids which I’ve never seen this was unreal for my daughter. Security and access was extremely well organised. Overall it was an excellent visit as our first time with hotel. I can 100% say I will return again. Beds were so comfy and rooms were great. ,4,2024,07,01
247,"Amazing stay, great location","This was the best stay abroad!! Me and my friends were in town for the Taylor Swift concert, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time in Dublin. We were able to enjoy free food after the concert even when the restaurant was closed, and enjoyed the complimentary coffee, drinks, and inviting atmosphere. Eddy went above and beyond to help us, and every staff member we spoke to was welcoming and warm. Could not recommend higher!",5,2024,06,30
247,Wonderful service!,We couldn’t have been happier with our stay. The location and service was outstanding. Eddy made us feel welcome while coming back from a long night at the concert at Aviva. Couldn’t have asked for better service. We needed to find food and Eddy provided!,5,2024,06,30
247,Brilliant stay!,"Me and my friends went for a concert and the hotel couldn’t have been better! The staff were amazing, in particular Eddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2024,06,30
247,Amazing location. Amazing staff.,"Seriously great location and the most amazing staff. Came back with ease from the Taylor Swift concert, but due to lack of foresight we were STARVED! The hotel staff had us covered by delivering fries and chicken and Eddy made sure we had plenty of food and that we were well cared for. If you have an event at Aviva, this is your hotel!!",5,2024,06,30
247,Lovely,"Loved the location and room. Very kind bartenders, reception, and housekeeping. Food was decent but average and pricey. ",4,2024,06,29
247,"Overpriced, below average stay that left us feeling cheated.","One of the weirdest booking experiences ever, where the price on the web page and during payment turned out not to match the price on the confirmation email (our fault for not checking the price on the confirmation email after booking, but I've never seen it be wrong before). So instead of the 238 euros listed on the web page, we ended up paying 306 euros. Unfortunately, we were not able to provide evidence that this was the price we booked at (but we know for certain it was, if it had been over 300, we would have looked elsewhere, as we were even in doubt of going above 200), and the hotel was not able to even find their listed prices for when we made our bookings. Meaning there was no way the hotel would reimburse anything, or give us any kind of discount. 

As for the stay itself, it was average to below average, which means rather poor for the price. The room was ok. Nothing special. The hotel itself is rather large, a maze to find your way through, and smells funny. Seems to be clean, but doesn't smell clean. Our stay included dinner in the restaurant. We got a voucher, with check boxes for two or three courses, but they weren't checked off, so the restaurant staff didn't know what to do. We of course ended up with two courses... The staff was friendly enough, but very disorganized. We got the food quickly enough, but every question was met with an ""I don't know"", or some frantic searching, and we had five different servers at our table in as many minutes, each doing a separate thing the last one had forgotten about... For starters, we had chicken wings and mushroom soup. The wings were good enough, but I had asked if it was possible to change the celery for another vegetable, as I don't enjoy the taste of it. That was apparently impossible, strangely enough. The soup was all flour, and any mushroom was pureed, a thinner soup with actual mushroom bits would have been much better. For main courses we had lamb and sirloin. The sirloin was overcooked (I generally make a way better one myself), only about half of the lamb was possible to eat (the rest was tendons). Both came with very bland mashed potatoes and a few pieces of asparagus. 

Breakfast was better, and what saved this from being a one star review. Nice selection, although a lot of the warm food didn't seem to be very fresh, it was good enough. We also opted for a late checkout (ordered in advance), Again something that didn't add up. The web page said that late checkouts were ""from €20"", and we ended up paying 40 for it. So all in all, we paid 90 euros more for this stay than we planned, with no attempt from the hotel to even meet us half way. It simply felt like we were being cheated.",2,2024,06,29
247,Good hotel,Hotel is excellent & ideally situated for the Aviva & RDS but is overly expensive on event nights. It is whether you feel the convenience is worth the price. ,5,2024,06,28

247,A Gem,"My husband & I stayed here last week because we were attending a concert at the aviva. We thankfully arrived early enough for parking. If you’re staying here for an event parking is limited. The parking is also free! The hotel is gorgeous, beautifully decorated with a great atmosphere. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. The hotel was very busy but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. We ate dinner at Whitty’s restaurant in the hotel & the food was outstanding. Breakfast the next morning was a buffet style breakfast & is probably the best Dublin hotel breakfast I’ve had. I will definitely be booking here again for any events I’m attending at the aviva.",5,2024,06,27

247,Enjoyable stay,"I did an internet search and picked the hotel for its location and free parking. It was a good choice and if I ever go back to Dublin, I will definitely book my room here again. With a four-minute walk to theDART, this was perfect for touring Dublin. Added bonus - Aviva Stadium is also the same 4-minute walk.",4,2024,06,24
247,Good location,"Good location for the Aviva stadium but as the hotel was full I think the standard dropped slightly. Staff very busy and rushing about, no cocktails on in bar, breakfast was very slow. Room window didn’t lock",4,2024,06,24

247,"Fabulous Hotel, even better staff!","The Sandymount is a beautiful hotel set in a lovely, peaceful area of Dublin. Although a little further away from the city centre, the transport system is excellent so getting there is very easy. 

The bedrooms at The Sandymount are immaculate, well decorated and very spacious. We opted for breakfast 2/3 mornings and we were not disappointed - everything was delicious, fresh and restocked promptly when needed. On our final day, we also had a few hours to kill before going to the airport, so we spent a fabulous sunny afternoon out on the terrace, being served by the attentive bar staff.

The absolute highlight of the hotel is the staff, in particular Beatrice, on the reception desk. Beatrice was so helpful in giving us advice on getting around the area and on finding out it was my mum's 60th birthday, she arranged chocolates and a card in her room which was such a kind gesture. 

Thanks so much - we cannot wait to return! ",5,2024,06,15

I will say that the bar to include staff, especially Oskar and Josh were pleasant and full of spirit. However the room - the pillows and the bed itself was extremely uncomfortable. The shower was a slanted ceiling, my husband is over six feet tall which was not easily accessible. Overall, dining, food, and laughter was present at this hotel. I thank them for a wonderful honeymoon!",4,2024,06,11

247,Great stay!,The hotel was beautiful and well kept. The only reason I didn’t give it a full 10 was the lack of individual AC in the rooms.

247,Wonderful Hotel in quiet residential area but close to City centre,"We needed somehwere to stay overnight before attending the VHI Mini Marathon.  We chose the Sandymount Hotel due to its location and because of the free parking advertised.  What a good choice we made.  The hotel is situated in a quiet residential area beside the Aviva Stadium, and just a short distance from the City Centre.  A 4 minute walk will take you to the nearest Dart Station which takes you into the City Centre in less than 10 minutes.   Car parking on site is safe and secure.  The hotel provided us with a courtesy bus to the start location of the Mini Marathon which saved us any hassle on the day.  The hotel is spotlessley clean with tasteful modern furnishings and decor throughout.  Our room was spacious, light and airy.  Again the furnishings were modern and all was spotlessley clean.  Windows that opened to allow in fresh air were an added bonus.  We ate in the restaurant for lunch and dinner on the first day and for breakfast and a late lunch our departure day.  The food and service were perfect.  Food portions, quality and presentation were fantastic.  What makes this hotel a 10/10 is the staff.  The hotel is well staffed, and without exception all staff were friendly, knowledgeable, efficient, and clearly enabled to do their job.

We had a lovely room, very spacious and comfortable. We ate  on the terrace of the restaurant before walking to the venue. Our meal was fine. Breakfast the next day was equally enjoyable. Throughout our stay we found all staff to be friendly and helpful. The culture of the hotel was to put the guest first. The hotel was only a short walk from the Dart train into the city. Very convenient. Convenient too for the Aviva stadium. We did not make use of the car park but it did appear that there was ample parking.

One of the smallest rooms I have stayed in and wouldn't choose again",2,2024,05,31
247,Family stay,We stayed at the Sandymount recently as my daughter had a match in the Aviva. We arrived around 9.30pm and check in was quick and efficient. Room was very clean. Unfortunately we had an issue with a buzzing from the circuit board over the door in the room. Reception sent someone to check it out and they told us that the only way to stop it was to turn off the switches when we were ready to sleep. This meant we had no power during the night. Not ideal when travelling with 2 kids. Breakfast was lovely. Huge selection and very tasty. Reception stored our luggage until we were ready to leave Dublin in the afternoon. ,4,2024,05,31

247,Lovely place,Great hotel with very nice staff. The restaurant and bar inside are a great perk of staying here. It's just down the road from Aviva Stadium. Parking was plentiful and the rooms are quiet. Beds are comfortable and every thing was clean. Easy choice.,5,2024,05,19
247,"Best hotel in Dublin for comfort, service, quality and value of offering, and location","Repeat customer because I can’t fault the Sandymount for all of the above. Excellence all round and I’m always delighted to stay here. Comfortable and well-appointed rooms - even the smallest feels luxurious and the larger rooms are beautiful. All your needs are pre-empted and the staff are so friendly and helpful. Good food and excellent service, and free parking which is a rarity in Dublin hotels especially in this area. Why would I stay anywhere else?",5,2024,05,18

247,"Clean, friendly staff and quiet location",Loved the area and the location. Staff super helpful. Very accommodating for our travel needs. The hotel was clean and well maintained ,5,2024,05,13
247,Lovely hotel & great staff,"Return visit, Beautiful hotel, recently upgraded.  Location is great just a short walk to the train.  Safe location.  Food was great & I was served by a lovely waitress Reece who smiled throughout the whole day.  She was an absolute delight and genuinely looked after all the guests in the restaurant.  Staff like her make me want to return again!",4,2024,05,12
247,Great stay,"So comfortable, very clean, great service… had a super comfortable and nice stay for our first night in Ireland. Breakfast was also excellent. We arrived in Dublin around 8am and the Sandymount was able to accommodate early check-in - they had also confirmed we could check luggage there if our room wasn’t available early, both of which we really appreciated. Bonus was that we ended up with an electric rental car and were able to charge at the Sandymount. We also enjoyed walking through the neighborhood and to the beach. Would definitely recommend and would come back myself!",5,2024,05,12
247,Excellent service and a good price,"The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. The breakfast was buffet, with a wide variety to choose from.",5,2024,05,11
247,Poor room functionality and lighting,"Reception:
Upon arrival to reception, two staff looked at us and pretended to be busy with another guest. When they finally offered to assist us, the man checking us in, was polite but not terribly helpful nor chatty and did not provide any info on Dublin City, he was more interested in selling us breakfast than providing us relevant city/hotel information. 
I had to ask about wifi, as no info was provided on this.
Complementary lollipops and sweets are provided at reception.

Room / facilities:
Room number 212 is on the 1st floor (same floor as reception), after navigating the maze of corridors, ramps and stairs, it took (what seemed) about 5 minutes to find the room.  The room was clean and appeared spacious, comfortable and well equipped. 
After using the bathroom, we found the total opposite as it is not very functional, poorly designed and is a slip accident waiting to happen.

The toilet roll was one and a half (1.5m) meters from the toilet, meaning you need to get off the toilet to obtain the paper, there is no hand rail to hold as you exit the wet slippery bath tub, no safety non slip bath mat to prevent slipping, the heated towel rack seems to not function at all, the basin is very low, im not a tall person but had to lean over the basin to shave. 
The mirror is mounted too far from the edge of the basin. 
When showering, there is no shelf to place toiletries, the wall mounted liquid soap pumps once pressed, don’t raise back up to be repressed.  The spout needs to be “pulled“ back up before re-pressing to obtain soap.
Even though the shower has a glass panel to stop water splashing out of the tub, as this is not fitted correctly, water gets all over the floor and toilet making the floor slippery and waiting for someone to slip and hit their head on the bath tub or floor.  The filthy exhaust fan in the bathroom did zero to remove the steam during the shower. I had to clean this in an effort to get some “suction” of the air during the shower.
The bathroom lacks any power outlet to support a hair dryer. The lighting is so poor in both the bathroom and main room, if you were using the Hotel for pre-wedding preparations, it would be impossible to apply makeup or do a ladies hair,  the lightening could best be described as “mood” lighting.

There is a comfortable queen bed, but we found the flat pillows unsupportive and did nothing other than to provide us with headaches each morning.
After searching, the room has minimal power outlets, making it challenging to charge devices or even use the clothes iron in the room.

There is a safe, hanging area, clothes iron and board, extra blankets, flat screen TV, small coffee type table and 2 x chairs, along with a work type bench, where tea and coffee is located, and a oversized chair that does not fit under the bench. 

The room has no air conditioning but does have windows that open.  
Thankfully there were windows that opened as we needed to open these and the main door for air flow, as the room gets very very stuffy.
When we did open our windows, this enabled noise, (from loud guests in rooms in the opposite building), to come into the room.

There was a notice in the lift about DART interruptions.  
We wondered what this was.  Later we found out the hard way,  that it related to the local train system.  Placing a sign in a lift that foreign guests would not understand is impractical and pointless. These need to be put into text that everyone understands, eg “the Dublin train/metro is closed…..”

Parking:
is available at an no extra additional cost.  Whilst there is parking for about 40 cars, this does not accommodate one car for every room in the hotel.  Street parking is paid and has time restrictions.

Wifi:
Complementary with no password required. 
The biggest issue for the room we were in (212) is that, it takes about 3 minutes to connect wifi, the wifi drops out regularly, making it impossible to use social media,  banking apps, surf the net or make a wifi phone call.  Turning my device off and on made no difference to the wifi connectivity. I had to use my phone 4g numerous times to get a stable fast signal.

Breakfast:
Available for additional cost, but not utilised on this stay.
Room service charged an additional “delivery” fee of €7.00 per tray.

Conclusion:
Affordable out of city centre hotel that provides free parking, with “first in best dressed” approach.
All the perfect reviews of this hotel, leave me a bit puzzled as to how and why, after we found the inconsistencies, lack of room functionality, poor wifi, uncomfortable pillows, room stuffiness and not overly friendly staff when we checked in. 
Upon checkout the lady was polite, very cheery, asked how our stay was.

Letdowns:
Lack of room functionality.  If management actually stayed in these rooms they would see the many short comings of each room and the lack of functionality.
Terrible wifi that constantly drops out.
Navigating the maze of halls, ramps and stairs to find reception and get to allocated rooms.

Location / Nearby:
The train station and Dublin stadium both walkable. 

Getting to hotel:
If arriving by car, best use GPS",3,2024,05,09
247,So friendly,Our stay at the Sandymount Hotel was fantastic. The rooms were clean and the full breakfast was well worth the price. Beatrice at the front desk was friendly and very accommodating. We arrived on an early flight from Canada and she made sure that we got into our accommodations as quick as possible so we could catch a quick nap then enjoy our first day in Dublin. Thank you for getting us off on the right foot,5,2024,05,09
247,"Hotel layout is a bit quirky, but overall very good Hotel","Overall, Hotel was very good. The layout was quirky as the hotel seems to be spread out over a number of old Georgian type houses. Breakfast was excellent. Room was clean, but there was a spider cobweb in the corner of the shower in the bathroom. I told the receptionist and she apologised and made a note of it for housekeeping, so I was satisfied with that. I was on a low 2nd floor and my room window faced out onto a carpark at rear of building, but there was no noise disruption. ",4,2024,05,09

247,Great hotel!,This hotel was great. Room was very clean nice bathroom. There is free parking. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to the 3 arena.  All staff were very nice and friendly.

Very good breakfast buffet until late morning. Free off road carparking. Easy access from Dublin Port via Eastlink Bridge. I will be back. My only suggestion is to put grap rails on wall beside Bath to reduce risk of fall. Also improve the internal direction signs on the many corridors. 
I will 100% stay in this hotel again.

247,Sandymount hotel outside Dublin city,Lovely hotel. Very expensive to get back and forth to city center. Ended up taking DART train for a more reasonable option. Breakfast was fine but seemed expensive for what we got. Bar was great.,4,2024,04,29

247,Disappointed in Customer Service,"When asked for directions into the 3Arena I was advised to follow the Canal. This was not the case when I started to walk. When asked a number of people for directions, after walking for about 40mins I was advised to get the bus and Luas to the Arena. I was very disappointed that a taxi was not offered or more advice was given, i.e. number bus, or Luas advised. Ended up missing some of the acts in the 3Arena.",3,2024,04,24

What stood out for me was the good quality for a fair price in the restaurant and the very friendly staff. Especially Orla and Fabio, but also the others, were very friendly and communicative. Not too formal, but just really nice, sharing their thoughts on which dessert would be the best, etc. A really nice experience, that you kind of expect of a service oriented facility, but not always get.",5,2024,04,22

247,"Location, staff, and clean and quiet.  The bestest ever.","Hotel is very nice, great location for sporting events, walk downtown.  But, the staff was 1,000,000 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Stand outs, all pros,,,Sumona, Leo, Giuliano were even higher yet.  They were a port in the storm, a smiley face when that’s what the doctor ordered.  They were nothing short of fantastic. This ain’t no lie, feel safe in your decision to stay at Sandymount Hotel.",5,2024,04,13
247,What a perfect stay and a very special birthday celebration,"The hotel is gorgeous, very well maintained, clean and great amenities. The bar is beautiful, and if you prefer it a bit quieter there are cozy corners to sip your tea or cocktail. It is well located, we didn't hear any traffic at all but you can reach the nearest Dart or bus station within just a few minutes walk and you will be in the city center in no time. What really stood out was the staff! Everyone was so friendly and spread good mood.

It feels just like home - I’d visit more often if I lived closer !  Thanks to Edward and Erin for all their assistance.",5,2024,04,06
247,Poor restaurant experience,"Very disappointed with the 2 courses for €40 dinner, given barely any combination (without supplements) comes to €40.
My 2 courses came to €38.50, my starter had a €5 supplement, so even if I didn't have the deal it would have cost €38.50, yet I had already paid €40 and was being asked to pay another 5. On top of that my daughters 2 courses only came to about €30, so we had paid €80 but our meal only came to €68.50 and we weren't able to offset the balance against our drinks. I just feel this was very sneaky and misleading to offer the meals in advance at a price above what's on the menu, I've stayed in many hotels and have never come across this practice before.
I spoke to the food and beverage manager and was able to get the supplement removed from the bill and she understood my issue and agreed I shouldn't be asked to pay that. Even though the food was nice, I left with a bad taste in my mouth after that experience. For that reason it would put me off visiting the hotel in the future, as much as i like supporting independent family hotels, I felt on this occasion I was taken for a bit of a mug to be honest, paying over the odds for what we actually got.
I hope this issue can be addressed for future customers.",2,2024,04,02
247,Sandymount is TOPS in Dublin,"We stayed for an overnight on a Monday and while the main restaurant downstairs was closed, the menu was the same in the bar and the food was excellent .... it always is at the Sandymount - our base in the capital.

Thank you all, I felt like at home! Can't wait to return!",5,2024,03,21
247,Highly recommend,Hotel was ideally located for a weekend at the rugby. The stadium was a couple of minutes away and nearby Sandymount was walking distance to some lovely restaurants. The city centre was easily accessible by DART and the Aircoach stop was only 10 minutes walk. Hotel was lovely - clean and quiet considering the volume of people and set up for rugby and St Patrick’s weekend. Staff all very friendly and food was lovely. Would highly recommend and would book again. ,5,2024,03,20
247,Superb Sandymount,"Visited the Sandymount Hotel last week on business at short notice, I called the hotel and spoke with Inga in reservations, she couldn’t have done more for me. Really friendly and even when I had to change my date by a day this was no problem, she was a pleasure to deal with. Room and food was superb as were the staff from check in to restaurant. Would highly recommended this hotel for business or leisure as it ticks all the boxes. Also parking is free at the hotel. A really classy family run hotel which is hard to find. I’ll definitely be booking again soon. Well done all in Sandymount Hotel.",5,2024,03,20
247,Keep doing what you're doing,"A well run family hotel, excellent standard of housekeeping and a well planned way of operating on big event days at The Aviva Stadium that resists the temptation to pack the public spaces out with non residents. 
Hopefully the money that our group invested over the bar during our 2 night stay will enable them to invest in another toaster to ease the wait at breakfast time....",5,2024,03,20

247,Overnight Stay  in Dublin,"I recently met some friends for an overnight catch-up. The Hotel is a brisk 35 minute walk from the city which I chose to do.
We opted to have food in the hotel which was marvelous, I had chicken Caesar salad. The staff were extremely friendly.
The bedroom had a beautiful decor and the bed was very comfortable.
A great Breakfast the next morning after a wonderful walk out to poolbeg, sandymound  completed a great short stay.

I will definitely stay again.",5,2024,03,16
247,Sandymount the Saviour!,"I cannot say enough fantastic things about this Hotel... I dream of it, waiting patiently until I can visit again.  The whole experience was lovely from start to finish.  I called the front desk from the Heuston train station in a slight panic because our Airbnb just cancelled and my daughter and I needed accomodation stat!  It was high season at the very end of August with not much available and not only did The Sandymount have a room for us it was the best deal I could find so we hopped in a cab right away! 
We were checked into a nice but simple room and were quite happy with it then there was a knock at our door and the lovely lady from the front desk (Giulia I think) asked us if we'd like to switch into a larger room since we were staying for 3 nights....absolutely!  Our friends who we were planning on staying with next, until our flight home, got sick with Covid....so The Sandymount came to our rescue!  We were totally bummed about not seeing our friends but being in this beautiful place put smiles back on our faces.  The library filled with old books was really cool, the breakfasts in the morning were delicious, the pub was fun and filled with entertaining people and the room was gorgeous and incredibly comfy!  I wish we had more time to explore the area but we did enjoy walking to catch the train into the city centre.  During our Irish travels we adopted a sheep and named him Paul, he enjoyed his stay too!  I don't know why it's taken me so long to write this review.... no idea but this Hotel really does hold a magical place in my heart.",5,2024,03,14
247,Excellent hotel,"Great location, beautiful rooms and excellent staff. I can only highly recommend this hotel.

247,The best hotel - with real hospitality!,"Just returned home from 3 nights at this beautiful hotel and felt compelled to write my first tripadvisor review.  The hotel is family run and I even spoke with the owner John during our stay who chatted to us like we were old friends. The place has been beautifully revamped and our room was a great treat - we were very spoiled. Toni who looked after us from start to end was the most friendliest girl we have ever met in all our many many years staying in hotels.  She gave us lots of recommendations and travel tips and was spot on everytime, really could not have looked after us oldies any better.  The location to visit the local areas was perfect for us as we wouldn't be of the temple bar age.  We met lots of lovely new people in the local area & memories were made.  We could not be more grateful for all her help, she is a credit to you John. Its staff like her that make us return to places like yours so well done!  I just wish we could have stayed longer.  We will he back again in the autumn, all going well.  All the best N",5,2024,03,07
247,A Great Place to Stay,"I continue to stay in this hotel on a very regular basis as it my top choice when visiting Dublin.

247,Superb all round - could not fault anything,A superb family run pub in the Landsdowne area which is walkable to Dublin centre where we visited the Emigration museum - very moving.  We also spent a Sunday evening of music and fun at Darky Kelly’s in Temple Bar,5,2024,02,28
247,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel. Great location especially for events at Aviva. We were there for the Ireland rugby match. The atmosphere before and after the match was amazing. Very friendly staff from reception to the bar and in the restaurant. Will definitely be back.,5,2024,02,28
247,"Calming, relaxing overnight in Dublin","Happy to find this hotel. It's a short drive from Dublin Port meaning it's perfect for splitting the car journey to London from anywhere in Ireland with a really comfortable night! After the slightly warren-like venerable old corridors, our room itself surprised us by being modern, calming, and really well-designed. The shower was the best of any hotel I've known, I enjoyed the Rituals toiletries, everything was spotless, and it was just a really pleasant relaxing experience all-round. Reception staff were helpful and knowledgeable and the car park had plenty of space. We will default to this hotel for future car-ferry trips, but I would also stay here longer if I needed a dependable Dublin pad for a few days.",5,2024,02,27
247,Great for a rugby weekend,Lovely helpful staff for whom it was never to much trouble to provide assistance. The location is perfect for the 6 Nations Rugby. The quality and variety of the food was marginally disappointing but that would not stop us going there again.,4,2024,02,27
247,"Grand rooms and good breakfast, poor service in restaurant for dinner","Grand rooms and good breakfast, brilliant location for 6 nations matches.

247,Sandymount Hotel Review,"I could recommend the Sandymount Hotel most highly.  Staff, rooms, and restaurant are all great.  The hotel is just a 10 minute walk form the Landsdowne Roard DART station, which will take you directly to the city centre, or other trains and Luas.  I have stayed there over 25 times, and will always stay there whenever I travel to Dublin.",5,2024,02,25

247,"Great location, great service, great value for money","My brother and I stayed at Sandymount for 2 nights for the Ireland Vs Italy Six Nations match. I couldn’t fault the hotel, a stones throw from the Aviva. The staff are very friendly & accommodating, nothing was too much trouble them. My brother has limited mobility and even though this is an old building, there are plenty of ramps, there’s also a lift. I would definitely recommend it & I will stay here again ",5,2024,02,14
247,Home away from home,We stayed at the Sandymount hotel for the weekend of the Ireland Italy rugby game with our baby daughter. The hotel was full but the service & experience was still top class. The owner John was there chatting to guests as if he had all the time in the world. This family run hotel has just the atmosphere you’d want - a home away from home.,5,2024,02,14
247,Beautiful hotel great location,Such a lovely hotel. So central for transport. Plentiful breakfast. Spotless bed and bath. Decor pleasing. Bar menu not bad at all. I would recommend the hotel and I would most definitely stay there again ,5,2024,02,08
247,No sleep,Awake all night last sat the 3rd Feb 2024 room 204 had a noise from above like a water tank filling up so if you need sleep for work or event avoid this room.we only noticed noise at night but was there in morning also ,3,2024,02,07
247,Awake all night,Really poor experience in this hotel. Not sure how it is a 4 star. Location is good but the rooms are very basic and far too warm. There was constant noise from a pump/boiler all night. Stay clear of room 204. Cleaners were making noise before 9am with loud banging noise. Went out for a coffee around 930am and when I came back there was a cleaner trying to go in and clean my room!! It was before 10am!,2,2024,02,07
247,Friendly Reception Staff,"Nice hotel, friendly and welcoming reception staff, Beatrice in particular was very helpful. Breakfast is a little overpriced at 20 euros, but there are cafes around. I would stay again at the right price.",4,2024,02,07
247,One Night Stay at Sandymount Hotel,I really enjoyed my stay at the Sandymount Hotel. Great location close to the transport links into Dublin. Beatrice on reception was especially helpful on my check in and offered lots of great advice on local amenities. ,5,2024,02,06
247,Too many emails,"Email after email after message after reminder after communication then surveys after the stay then TripAdvisor surveys, Booking.com surveys, Hotel surveys, constant emails. Just incredible. Would actually put me off staying there again,",3,2024,02,06
247,Great hotel,Lovely room good food and very friendly staff. It was our third time staying at this hotel and our stay has always been a great experience. Will be staying  again for the next leinster match at the aviva which is only a few minutes walk from the hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2024,02,05
247,Lovely Hotel - Great Location,"This Hotel is in a great location - with the Dart Station 5 minutes walk away - with easy and quick access to Dublin City Centre.
The area is very quiet -  (with the exception of Rugby Internationals of course ..!! )
and an easy walk into Sandymount village.
All staff are extremely friendly and helpful with breakfast and evening dinning very nice and great value.
Certainly recommend this hotel for a lovely break.
",5,2024,02,05
247,Lovely hotel in very safe area,This area is so safe compared to staying closer to the city centre which I usually do for convenience. But it is only 10 min drive to get to centre from here. We also walked to and from a restaurant in Ballsbridge at night and we never once felt unsafe.  The hotel has free parking which is very unusual in city. The room was small but spotless. The bathroom was like new with lovely Ritual toiletries. The windows in bedroom and bathroom open fully to allow plenty fresh air. A heated towel rail in bathroom was a nice touch. The corridors  in the hotel are narrow but apart from that I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2024,02,04
247,Awake all night,"Dont stay in room. 204 awake all night with boiler or pump overhead making terrible noise all night
Manager in bar like basil faulty took drink order then asked us did we want a drink

247,Cozy Family Run Hotel,"Very friendly staff and a lovely family run hotel. It for sure feels like a modernized home which is cozy. Comfortable room and great service on the room. Lovely service at breakfast with lots of vegan options. Great location easy to catch the Dart to Dublin city. No temperature control in the room, had to keep my window open.",5,2024,02,01
247,Excellent hotel,The Sandymount hotel is an absolute diamond. From the friendliness of the staff to the fantastic rooms and the location it would be hard to find a better place. I will definitely be staying again very soon.,5,2024,01,30
247,Overnight stay for a hospital appointment.,"We stayed in this hotel for a few nights in 1979 on our honeymoon. In this century my work took me back to Dublin more frequently and I always stayed in Sandymount. The hotel has undergone many changes since then. One of the big attractions is that it is very central and easy to get to from home. Now that I have retired it is medical appointments that bring me to Dublin. Not having been there for a few years one could almost say nothing had changed, yet all had changed. The room was neat, spotless, fully equipped and, apparently, upgraded and decorated. In the dining room it was so welcoming to recognise and be recognised by staff not seen for over five years. Also, at reception, to recognise and be recognised is so welcoming and attractive. One feels at home. Everything appeared new and was spotless. Where have all our family-run businesses gone? I could not recommend anywhere else to stay in Dublin. I even noticed a couple of courtesy buses in the car park. And that is another perk for the hotel, free parking in a spacious accaecible car-park. It was so quiet, peaceful and relaxing to come back to the Sandymount Hotel after a day in Blackrock and stay another night! 
I was an inspector all my life so I have to have one quibble! Why, in the restaurant, has the menu 'sharing' starters and deserts? All we wanted or needed was a normal single starter, a main and maybe a desert. If we both wanted wanted a different starter or desert it was just impossible. Our meal consisted of a starter each and a shared desert (which was really enough for three or four people).
Please return to the single starter and desert!
Despite that it really is a lovely hotel.",4,2024,01,30
247,Sandymount Hotel,"a very nice hotel right beside the Aviva stadium in dublin, bit of a maze though,..easy to get lost in. It has very friendly and helpful staff and free parking was the main reason I stayed there. I dont normally have a car in Dublin but did this time...so perfect place if you have a car ",4,2024,01,30
247,"10/10, would recommend The Sandymount Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin","This is the best 4 star hotel I’ve ever stayed at! The staff were great from checking in with Beatrice. The room was superb, the breakfast was excellent and the location for visiting Dublin was perfect. All public transport links were a 2 min walk away.
The only issue was a problem with the heating which David from the maintenance department resolved within ten minutes.
Would definitely recommend and will be returning to The Sandymount Hotel.",5,2024,01,29
247,Two Night Stay,This is a really great family run hotel. We stay regularly. It’s so convenient to get to and such a friendly helpful staff. Very very clean and delicious food. We had a wonderful room with everything from a Dyson hairdryer to lovely robes and slippers. ,5,2024,01,29

",5,2024,01,20
247,"Convenient, Affordable, Well managed","Nice boutique hotel, very friendly staff. Clean well appointed room. Walking distance from Sandymount village and near stadium. Nice on premise restaurant. Walls a little thin so can hear neighbors. Bring earplugs ",5,2024,01,18
247,Biz traveller,While on one of my regular frequent business travels to Ireland I stayed at the hotel for the first time.  I was surprised by how convenient the location was to Sandymount and city centre. Would consider staying there on a recurring basis for business travel. A little quirky in design but nice overall. ,4,2024,01,17
247,Very nice Saturday stay in the sandymount hotel.,"Spent a very nice Saturday evening in the sandymount hotel. Arrived early had a lovely lunch in the restaurant before popping out to the Aviva for the match. It was very cosy in the bar after the game, as it was cold outside this weekend. Our room was also very nice. Excellent staff, all more willing the other to help with customer requests. We had a very nice breakfast the next morning.",5,2024,01,17
247,Great experience.,"We had the pleasure of staying in this wonderful hotel last Saturday, located close by
the Aviva stadium. Walking in the main door we were welcomed warmly by Beatrice 
with a smile. Staff friendly and service very good. Bedroom was modern with tea/coffee facilities, bottled water, no noise from the road outside or within the hotel itself.
Wood burning fire in reception rooms, even lit early next morning.  Excellent dinner and breakfast. 
Overall, excellent value, a really enjoyable stay - will definitely stay again.",5,2024,01,17
247,Quaint hotel is a great location,Stayed there a few times and the service is excellent. Older hotel which brings in a lot of charm - even had a wood burning fire in the fireplace in the room off the lobby. The dining and room service is also great - they even have great vegan options!,5,2024,01,15
247,One of the best hotels  I have stayed in.,Really lovely hotel. Probably the best nights sleep I’ve ever had in a hotel in Dublin- no noise from the road outside or within the hotel itself. Staff friendly and competent. Bar food excellent. Great location near Aviva stadium and Luas station. Overall a really enjoyable stay- will definitely stay again.,5,2024,01,15
247,I keep coming back. Best place to stay in Dublin!,"It’s been a while since my last review (I really need to write more reviews!). 
Since my last review, I have stayed here many times on business- usually once or twice a month. A lot has changed since then- we’ve moved out from the pandemic & life has returned to normal. 
There have been some renovations recently with the rooms getting a facelift (not that they needed it- they were already lovely!). The beds (ah, the beds- I miss the beds now when I go home!) are as comfy as ever, great showers & bathroom fittings, superb breakfasts & great food in the restaurant for lunch & dinner. 
Some of the staff have come & go since my last review, but most are still there! Beatrice & her team at reception always give such a warm welcome with a smile! The fact that so many staff are still here is a testament to Gerard & John, the son & father team who own/manage this family run hotel. 
All in all, excellent value (I’ve found booking direct with the hotel often gets best rates, by the way 😉) in a location that cannot be beaten in Dublin. It’s absolutely the best part of Dublin to stay- in town, just on the outskirts of the city centre in a quiet, upmarket leafy suburb with so many amenities within a 3-10 minute walk & the city centre only a couple of minutes further by DART, taxi, car, bike or foot. 
The fact that I’ve been back here every 2-3 weeks for almost 3 years (and will continue to return) speaks volumes! I had been coming to Dublin quite a bit before, but rarely stayed in the same place twice. Now, I’ve found my second home in Dublin!",5,2024,01,14
247,December 1 night stay.,"Lovely, 1 night, weekend stay for my husband’s birthday. Great location to drive to. Nice, quiet suburban area. Brilliant that there is a private car park included. Checked in nice and early around 11am as our room was ready. Lovely rooms with nice modern decor. Chocolates and birthday card were a nice touch. Easy to get into the city centre on the train. The station was a short walk around the corner and 2 stops took us in. Inexpensive also. 

Staff were all friendly and helpful. 
Unfortunately when we went down to breakfast they had no record of it being pre-payed through our booking. The member of staff asked if we had a voucher. We had not been given one. We were seated but were left feeling a little awkward. Had to ask for tea and coffee after a good wait. Breakfast itself was nice. 
Would definitely stay again despite the confusion!",4,2024,01,13
247,"Classy hotel, excellent location, excellent food, excellent staff.","The food is top class! The staff are friendly, classy and professional. Eddy, the duty manager, is absolutely lovely to deal with. Even on match days, when it's really busy, the service is top class. The ambiance is serene. The open fire very welcoming.",5,2024,01,13
247,Nice place for solo traveling or family vacation,"Its a lovely hotel with very friendly staff. There are a few nice places in walking distance as well as a dart and bus connection. 
The restaurant has vey nice and fresh food for breakfast and dinner. Jaqueline maia was a lovely young woman with a vey friendly attitude. Can only recommend this place. Would go there again.",5,2024,01,13
247,Well worth a visit,"Beautiful hotel, nice cosy rooms. They have free WiFi, you can watch Netflix and Prime on the tv (if you have a subscription) and excellent utilities in the room. Breakfast is good, staff is friendly and we enjoyed two good meals in the lovely restaurant. Parking is on site and there is plenty of space. Walking to city center takes about 45 minutes, an Uber is about 11 euro.  Not that we complain much but here we really had nothing to complain.",5,2024,01,04
247,Great stay,Stayed for 2 nights and had no issues. The suite was very comfortable and the bed was great. No noise at all so had 2 great nights of rest. Would definitely visit again in the future and would also highly recommend to anyone looking a central location in Dublin.,5,2024,01,04
247,Great service from start to finish,We have stayed a few times now and each time we stay the service gets better and better Nothing is too much trouble From the receptionists who take care of your needs to the dining staff who can't do enough for you to the cleaners who make sure your comfort and stay are enjoyable Service is paramount here A warm welcome awaits you with true Irish hospitality I certainly will be dying again and recommend them  to everyone,5,2024,01,04
247,Room was cold,"Hotel is very nice. Good service from staff. Convenient location with a train station close by and it takes 3 stops to get to the city centre. However, our room was freezing cold and we were advised that the heating doesn’t come on until 5am. No portable heaters were available either which was a shame. ",4,2024,01,03
247,One of the best hotels we stayed in 👍,"We’ve spent the New Years at this hotel and we were very pleased with it. Staff was great, very helpful and they allowed us to leave our bags after we checked out as we had a full day to see Dublin and it would be difficult with the luggage. 
They also allowed us to check in much earlier and free of charge as our rooms were ready (around 5 hours before check in!!) 
Location was great as well, a 40 min walk from the city centre or a €20 uber drive. Not far from the airport either around 25 min uber drive. 
Food was really good and a decent price for breakfast. 
Rooms were on the smaller side but definitely big enough for two people. Very modern (especially the bathroom), clean as well (except from under the bed but who cares). 
I would definitely recommend this hotel and visit again in the future!",5,2024,01,02
247,Sandymount Hotel,"I have been a regular visitor to this hotel for the last four years and it is the perfect location for a trip to Dublin.

The staff, including people like Beatrice, Anne and Rose for example are all extremely friendly and professional. The food is also excellent and it is also the perfect location for families. Already looking forward to my next visit.",5,2024,01,02
247,Amazing Dublin,"We had an incredible experience in Dublin. The hotel is very close to the stadium and the train station, and two stations from Temple Bar. The hotel is further away from the hustle and bustle of the center and in a very pleasant location. We included breakfast in the daily rate, which was really worth it. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and attentive and helped us with everything from the moment we arrived. A super special thank you to Giulia who gave us several tips on how to enjoy Dublin more on our short trip.",5,2023,12,27
247,A Rare Diamond,"We have stayed at this hotel many times before, whilst visiting family and friends in Dublin. The hotel is a very warm and welcoming place to stay and feels very much like a home away from home. We are very happy to recommend this hotel to our friends and family. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and you will be assured to be met with a friendly face, even the decorators were very pleasant.",5,2023,12,22

247,Excellent Experience,"Dealt with Ronan, Inga & Toni to book  a large group into the hotel during December. The team were phenomenal to deal with.
On the day of our stay they were so accommodating with flexible check-ins across the group. They even helped resolve some last minute hiccups with room allocations.
The room I stayed in was beautiful, I was lucky enough to stay in a super deluxe king room on the night. 
The facilities in the room were unbelievable, the usual tea/coffee station with Nespresso machine but also a Dyson hair dryer, which is a dream compared to most hotel hair dryers.
The staff were so helpful and welcoming and every person in our party has only had positive things to say about their experience.",5,2023,12,21
247,An excellent stay…once again! ,"As always, our stay at The Sandymount was excellent. Beatrice at reception is always so warm and welcoming and all hotel staff are equally helpful and friendly.

Beatrice is so warm and friendly and was very helpful throughout my stay. Because of her I'll definitely be back :)

247,Perfect Location,"lovely hotel in a fantastic location.  hotel came recommended to us by family, we came over for a few nights to watch some rugby at the RDS.  everything you need is easy to get to......the nice weather made a lovely walk into the city, the RDS was a 15min walk to get to (longer if you go in all the pubs on the way🤣), and the dart 2mins away made for a easy trip to Sandycove and Dun Laoghaire.
a few minor issues with the room, a 'burnt' pillow etc but everything sorted by the lovely staff without issue. the buffet style breakfast on each day was superb too and value for money too.

all staff encountered were lovely, from front of house, housekeeping, bar and restaurant staff!

Beatrice was very helpful on check too.  highly recommended, will definitely stay here again.",5,2023,12,17
247,Wonderful experience. ,"The cleaning of my bedroom was excellent, the service and attention to detail exquisite. 
The fact the restaurant had gluten free options and the staff was very helpful made the experience even better. Many thanks to Susana, at the front reception for her great help and welcoming. ",5,2023,12,15
247,Relaxing Break,We stayed here for a Sunday afternoon family get together.   We decided to stay for 2 nights to incorporate seeing the city centre and shopping as well as experiencing the night life.  In all areas had a lovely time.  The hotel was fantastic from start to finish. We like to walk and the journey into city centre very manageable and far enough out for it to be quiet.   Staff could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable.   All very friendly and professional. Rooms quiet and extremely comfortable.  Cannot say anything negative about it.  Would not hesitate to recommend here.  Will visit again for sure.   ,5,2023,12,14
247,Highly Recommended ,"Excellent service throughout the hotel from front of desk, bar, restaurant and cleaning staff. I have been staying at the Sandymount regularly for the past 2 years.

247,A satisfied customer.,"I stayed here on an overnight business trip. What impressed me most was the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff - especially Beatrice in reception - who really help to make you feel at home. Also the room was very nice, spacious with a comfortable bed and nice shower. The breakfast was very good and the lobby has some nice cosy little nooks and crannies perfect for relaxing with a coffee and a book or for a chat over a pint. The location was also excellent, a short stroll from Lansdowne DART station. Overall I was very happy and would definitely recommend it. ",4,2023,12,12
247,Great place to stay. ,"Hotel is really comfortable and quiet, have stayed here a number of times in the past four years and you can see ongoing investment is being made to the Hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Beatrice on reception as always is extremely helpful and always checks that everything is as expected. The restaurant is very good. The hotel is next to the Aviva stadium, 40 minute walk to Grafton street or you can take the Dart into the city if you prefer. Would really recommend it.

I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will be back again soon.,5,2023,12,08
247,Fantastic Experience,"Have eaten here before but first time staying this week. I was booking in for a work trip and last minute my husband and toddler decided to join to start a bit of Christmas shopping.
From the moment I contacted to amend the booking, service was 10/10.
We arrived on Tuesday eve (5th) and the two ladies on the desk were so polite. Room was 10/10 as was our food. A minor disappointment would have been the €14+ we were charged for our toddlers dinner as she only ate sausages and mash but we’ll put that down to a miscommunication when ordering. 
I left early the next morning but my husband stayed on and said everyone was so helpful as he tried to manage our toddler at breakfast. Nothing was a problem for staff & they were so kind.
We will absolutely be returning again on a personal trip to stay. 
Merry Christmas All. 
(Special shout out to the lovely lady on the desk from Mayo - I can’t remember her name) ",5,2023,12,08

The staff are pleasant and the hotel is clean and well maintained.

I do not recommend dine in breakfast we got a full Irish which had no sausages and wasn't hot, we didn't get any of the pastries we had asked for either, only got one set of cutlery and the toast was very hard. So I would recommend not to get dine in breakfast. ",4,2023,11,24
247,"Friendly family-owned, traditional hotel away from the madding crowd","Had a nice stay there as our base camp to explore Dublin for a week. Personnel is friendly, competent and attentive. Bed was of good quality, though a little short for tall people. Traditional, meat-heavy, breakfast, lunch, dinner and a solid bar (nothing fancy). 3 stations away from the city centre the location combines remoteness in a quiet part of Sandymount (except when games or concerts are on in the nearby Aviva stadium in Lansdowne Rd) with good reachabilty of locations of interest either by foot or public transportation. There is a hotel car park if a car is needed. Nice place.",4,2023,11,23

A special mention to the Manager Andre - there was a problem on the first day and he quickly resolved it.",5,2023,11,12
247,Wonderful hotel,"I couldn’t have asked for a nicer place to stay for our first nights in Ireland. We arrived tired from our flight in the early hours of the morning and the nice lady at front desk, Anne, was so helpful. Our reservation wasn’t until later in the day, but Anne told us we could check in early. Sandymount had already sent me an email about early check-in which I hadn’t yet had seen. It was a big relief to be able to catch a nap first and then explore Dublin later in the morning. The room was very well appointed. There was a nice bar and restaurant with full Irish breakfast in the morning. I recommend the breakfast!  The hotel has parking and I had no problem driving there from the airport. The neighborhood around Sandymount is very nice. The center of the village was a short walk away with many nice pubs and places to eat if you prefer to go out. The hotel is also a very short walk from the local train going into Dublin center (2 stops). If you’re up for a nice walk, you can also walk into Dublin as well. I’ll definitely stay at Sandymount again on our next trip to Dublin. ",5,2023,11,11

247,Gorgeous hotel,Lovely hotel. Arrived very early to check in and two great surprises-the room was ready at 11.30 am and we were upgraded to an executive room. Love the Barry’s tea and coffee machine with four pods. Baths are becoming scarce in newer hotels but the Sandymount has a great bath and Rituals potions and lotions. Nice walk into town and great parking-don’t like the valet parking in city hotels when you can’t access your car during your stay. Good food in bar and restaurant and nice staff.,5,2023,11,05
247,Great stay,Always a pleasure to stay here in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The location is great with easy access to the city centre . Well worth a visit. The dart is just around the corner and great places to eat in Ballsbridge. ,5,2023,11,04

247,Hotel with a Great Welcome,"The Sandymount is a family run hotel with an extremely friendly staff who possess a very commendable service ethos . They work extremely well together and appear to enjoy working together which transmits itself to the guests who they tend to remember on return visits . On this occasion we were warmly welcomed by Simona Front Office Manager who could not do enough for us. Likewise Louise and her team in the restaurant gave us a wonderful experience. The food in the restaurant is varied ,first class and the buffet breakfast is easily overindulged making it a real heart attack special. Located in Dublin 4 the hotel is located right next to the Aviva Stadium and Sandymount metro station providing 15 minute or so to the heart of Dublin.",5,2023,10,30

We don’t usually spend a lot of time in hotel rooms so we were okay with the room’s ‘sloping’ and location. The room sloped and the view looked out to a flat, wet roof & other rooms. Other than that, the room was cleaned everyday that we needed it & well supplied with tea, coffee, & water. No fridge.",4,2023,10,28

247,Amazing hotel,"This hotel was great!  About a 30 to 45 min walk, closer, if taking a taxi, to downtown Dublin.  The breakfast in the morning is amazing, buffet style.

Restaurant and bar had great service as well. Free parking was a nice touch with a location that was close for all of our sightseeing. ,5,2023,10,24
247,Excellent,"Great hotel with excellent location when going to see the gig - Aviva or 3Arena. The most important - parking on site. Clean, lovely hotel. Beautiful breakfast. I would recommend the stay and we would deffo be back.  ",5,2023,10,24
247,Great Location Near Aviva and DART train,"The location of this hotel is right down the road from Aviva Stadium, so I would imagine this is the place to stay after matches, especially in the summer months (lots of space for outdoor socializing).  We stayed for a few days when there was no action, with rainy weather, so it was a bit quieter.  First, the hotel is in a great upscale neighborhood of Dublin, so you feel safe walking around at any time day or night.  Second, it has free parking, which was a huge plus for us, as we had a rental car (I do not recommend trying to drive around central Dublin - it is a nightmare at rush hour, and parking is not easy to locate).  Third, and perhaps most importantly, it is a short walk from the DART train, which means you can hop into central Dublin in 2-3 stops, which is extremely convenient.  The hotel itself is a really interesting mash-up of interconnected townhomes, with a central area for reception and dining.  The nature of this set-up means that there is a narrow warren of hallways, ramps, steps and lifts, kind of like a Victorian hedge maze.  After three days in the hotel, we still had trouble finding our way, even with signage.  The room was standard and on the smaller side, but it was quiet, and the bathroom had hot water and good pressure in the shower/tub combo.  You're not staying at a luxury resort here - it is, however, well-suited to spending days exploring Dublin and/or attending local events The wall-mounted TV is a bit small for 2023, but it gets the usual channels.  Interest service was fine - no issues.  Like most hotels in Ireland, you rarely hear any staff with an Irish accent, but they seemed friendly enough, albeit it busy given the number of guests at the facility.  We ate at their restaurant one night, and the food was surprisingly good - given the number of choices on the menu we had low expectations.  I would not call it a gourmet dining experience, but for burgers, upscale pizza, and pub foods, this seemed far better than average.  Breakfast was the typical buffet with Irish breakfast, meats/cheeses, pastries and cereal/yogurt, and eggs cooked to order on request.  If the price was right we would stay again, as it tends to be more affordable than the other 4-star establishments in Dublin, and is in a superior location with free parking.",4,2023,10,23
247,Dublin City Break at the wonderful Sandymount Hotel.,"My wife and I have just returned from another highly enjoyable stay at the Sandymount Hotel in Dublin. We have been regular visitors to this hotel for thirty years and do not anticipate changing this ritual. The hotel is, at all times, impeccably clean and comfortable, the food is superb and the staff, individually and collectively, are personable, professional and caring. From arrival to departure guests are treated like one of the family. The Sandymount is, in reality, a genuine home from home. Definitely worth a visit.   Gerry & Deirdre Donnelly.",5,2023,10,23

247,Everything was great!,"Nestled in a safe and tranquil area near the center, easily accessible by train or a short taxi ride (approximately 12-15 euros from Trinity College), this place exceeded our expectations.
Amazingly, despite the cold weather outside, the rooms were cozy. We were wondering how that was possible. Nice breakfast, clean rooms, and kind employees. We strongly recommend the hotel and will choose it again when we come back to Ireland. Thank you for your support.

P.S. We want to express our gratitude for the extra effort made by the receptionist. Although we couldn't secure an early check-in (all rooms were booked), they went above and beyond to prepare our rooms much earlier than expected. This was especially appreciated as we had been traveling since 5 a.m. Thanks again!",5,2023,10,19

It's in a handy location and well serviced for the Bus and Dart into city centre.  It's also a short stroll into Sandymount village, which is a lovely village",5,2023,10,18
247,Great short stay,"Stayed for two nights in a twin room,  the room was  on 1st floor. It was clean and beds comfortable, due to spending most of our time out and about never had much interaction with staff but when booking in and checking out they were lovely. 
We were woke up on both mornings with near by doors banging but it was just doors closing and not intentional but quite loud maybe a slow release on the doors or similar would help. 
We were happy to be up and about so not a big issue really. I would recommend and return when visiting Dublin without hesitation.",4,2023,10,17
247,Nice and beauty hotel,"Beautiful hotel with clean and well rooms. There is a free tea, milk and water in the room. The staff are super friendly and kind. We would come back and recomend 100%. We slept in a fantastic king size bed. The hotel is quiet and calm. ",5,2023,10,15
247,good hotel in a nice location,"We chose this location mostly due to the free parking and reasonable price, but found it to be a good hotel in a nice location too. Our main negative was that it was very warm in the 4th floor hallway and guest room. The ac fixed the room temp but it was consistently hot in the hall and the room would get hot while we weren't there. Sound also passed from the neighbor room easily as we could hear snoring and tv.",5,2023,10,13
247,Disappointed!,"Have friendlier, helpful staff at the front desk.  Change your menus.  Many diets do not allow a massive breakfast,, or else include it in the price of the room like others do.  Snacks and sandwiches should also be served in the pub.  The restaurant is too formal for Dublin!  ",3,2023,10,13
247,Amazing Customer Service,Staff at this hotel are just fantastic.  Helpful cheeeful and keen to do a great job - which they do.  10/10 for customer service.  Great location for doing business but still has a residential feel.  Would happily recommend to anyone considering !,4,2023,10,13
247,Scores highly.,"Very good one night stay here, main reason being to have somewhere nice to stay within walking distance of the 3 Arena (about 20 minutes). Everything was as it should be, and staff were generally very nice, especially in the restaurant and the reception desk at night. My only (minor) issue is there is no bar food, the restaurant is the only option. That said, the burger was so good I nearly passed out! : )",4,2023,10,13
247,"Great location, wonderful staff","Stayed here for 5 nights, everything about the hotel is excellent, location close to Dart, bus service & RDS, staff, food & reception area is pleasant. However the rooms, although clean are tired & shabby. Service in restaurant was satisfactory although had to remind waitress for my order a couple of times. She admitted the chef had make a mistake & I admired her honesty & wouldn't hold that against them.",5,2023,10,12
247,Stay somewhere else,"This hotel needs a whole new attitude adjustment from the front desk staff to the bar and restaurant staff.  They were all very rude.  When asking for directions, they simply would give you a map.  The restaurant has a breakfast buffet for 17.95 Euro.  You cannot just get a cup of coffee and toast.  We had the breakfast and it was terrible.  Cold runny eggs, beans, chewy mushrooms, toaster was broken.  Bread thin sliced day old bread.  The halls were like a sauna, so hot, and when you out the air on in the rooms, you couldn’t stop sneezing.  I then realized the filters had probably not been changed as it kept stating, check filters.  All 4 of us came home with bad coughs.  It is not real close to anything but Sandymount village which has a few shops and restaurants.  The beds were fine but we all had a hard time sleeping as the rooms were so hot and you couldn’t put on the air.  We did ask front reception and their reply was the heat isn’t on.  I would not recommend this place.",2,2023,10,12
247,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel in a really nice area, great value for money, large family rooms, within walking distance of Dublin City center and close to lansdown Road stadium. 5 minute cab trip to 3 arena. Lovely and helpful staff",5,2023,10,12
247,Closer to Dublin than thought,Lovely stay! Sweet cozy room great nights sleep and closer to central Dublin than I expected. I was concerned with the football arena so close but didn’t experience a match and crowds the days I was there. Loved the short walk to restaurants & cafes. ,4,2023,10,12
247,Always my choice,"I have recently stayed in this hotel for the first time after couple of years. I could see straight away hotel had been under significant renovation as everything looked beautiful and fresh. On check in, I was greeted by two lovely ladies, Ann & Beatrice who are, without a doubt, the best first impression anyone can get upon check in. They were so friendly, warm, knowledgeable and, most importantly, efficient. I was given a free upgrade to room 305 which was one of the newly renovated rooms. All I can say - stunning! Breakfast was also great selection and good quality with a lovely staff working in the restaurant. 
I would highly reccomend this hotel due it's convinience such as location and good value for money, but most importantly due to staff that really do make you feel like you're home. ",5,2023,10,12
247,The Sandymount Hotel is a hidden gem,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Sandymount Hotel recently, and it was an incredible experience. From the moment I arrived, the front desk staff exuded warmth and friendliness, making me feel truly welcome. They were always ready to assist with any questions or requests I had during my stay.

One standout highlight was the dining experience at the hotel's restaurant. Jacqueline, who works there, was an absolute delight. She provided impeccable service with a smile, and her genuine enthusiasm for her job was truly infectious. The food was exceptional, and Jacqueline's attentive and friendly demeanor made the dining experience even more enjoyable.",5,2023,10,11
247,Very Good Experience,"the reception was very good. The attendant Júlia welcomed us and told us everything we needed. At the hotel's Bar and Restaurant, the waitress Jaqueline and the supervisor Leandro served us very well, we felt at home. good beer and good food. our stay was wonderful",5,2023,10,11
247,Lovely Hotel,Had a lovely night here. Hotel very clean. Staff are very friendly. Food is good. Breakfast was great. We added breakfast at check in. Although I did have to ask for it and how much it was and where was it served coming from a former receptionist upsell. Great location easy access to city but nice quiet area. Room a little small but still good will upgrade next time Nice little village about 10 minutes walk away. ,4,2023,10,11
247,Wonderful hotel.,"From beginning to end of our stay we had a very enjoyable few days at the Sandymount Hotel in Dublin. The grounds are impeccable and the location is very convenient to everything. The check in staff were friendly, knowledgeable and eager to help. Meals were wonderful. Thank you again. ",5,2023,10,11
247,Room was small but the breakfast was great,The hotel had its plusses and minuses. The room we stayed at was very small and cramped. The bedding was comfortable and the staff was pleasant. The plus was the buffet breakfast. Many breakfast options. Good service.,3,2023,10,10
247,Excellent location and affordable accomodation,"Location and price excellent for what is offered mainly in a city like Dublin, staff could be a bit more helpful and friendly when it comes to basic request, but overall my stay was really good! I would stay again for sure!",4,2023,10,10
247,Hotel review,"The hotel is in a nice neighborhood area which is peaceful. The grounds are kept up nicely. The rooms are updated but on the small size. There was no fan in the room I stayed in so I had to keep the windows open and I could hear the noise from other rooms. I also was placed in a room that had an adjoining room and could hear everything from the other room which made it difficult to sleep. I didn't call the front desk so I am not sure if they would have changed my room, which was my mistake. 

I would suggest a stay here but would also suggest upgrading to a larger room if you are able to, it may be to your benefit. ",4,2023,10,09
247,A Gem!,"The Sandymount Hotel is a little gem.  If you're looking for a massive hotel with halls as big as Grecian temples, forget it.  The Sandymount is blessed with a variety of quiet corners where you can sit and chat with friends.  The food is excellent but, at the same time, presented in a menu that has a broad appeal.  Although the location has an obvious attraction for rugby fans, the fact that the hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the railway station is a big plus.

The overall layout is typical of hotels where additional buildings have been added over time.  The lack of lift access to the seminar rooms could be big drawback for some but the facilties there are excellent.",5,2023,10,09
247,Safe haven,"Our ferry from Cherbourg to Dublin was delayed by a severe storm and we arrived in Dublin over 12 hours late, docking at midnight, and in need of somewhere to stay.  We chose Sandymount online whilst at sea because it had secure parking for our luggage filled car and had a 24-hour service.  We were greeted warmly at 1.30 in the morning and had a very comfortable night followed by a good breakfast, served by friendly staff.",5,2023,10,05
247,Lovely hotel & location,"The room was gorgeous with great facilities, really enjoyed my stay. Ritual products in the bathroom, Dyson hair dryer and loads of space. The only thing that it was missing was a full length mirror. I definitely would stay here again, it’s a great location.",5,2023,10,05
247,Our GO TO Hotel in Dublin.,"We just love this hotel. It's a perfect mix of a homely, classy, welcoming feel. The bedrooms rooms have been decorated beautifully and the beds are so comfortable with fabulous quality pillows and bedding. The food is delicious, the cocktails very moreish and all of the staff are beyond helpful & friendly. We have been coming here for many years now and Beatrice & Rose ( who have been there a year and a few ) always remember our names and take time for a friendly chat. It's so well positioned, a perfect blend of near enough to everything and a nice distance away for peace and relaxation. This is always our go to hotel and we could not recommend it highly enough.",5,2023,10,05
247,Exceptional service,"I stayed 3 nights on a business trip and can only recommend the hotel. The staff were extremely helpful and haven eaten in the hotel restaurant for the 3 nights, the food and wines were excellent. But it was the service that stood out - thanks to Jaqueline, Louise and Diago for the quick and friendly service. I must also mention Bea in the reception. I had pre-ordered a taxi the night before on my first day, but in the morning, the taxi didn't arrive. Bea had a solution that saved my day - she called one of the staff members, Dave, to drive me to my meeting. And after the 20 min drive through the Dublin traffic, and arriving on time, Dave would not take any payment. This was exceptional service - many thanks Bea and Dave.",5,2023,10,04
247,Excellent two night stay,"Excellent hotel, friendly and helpful staff, lovely surroundings and close to transportation into downtown. Would definitely recommend to others and would definitely stay at Sandymount again. We arrived early and were treated to cappuccinos while we relaxed before we started touring around Dublin. Lovely rooms, comfortable beds. ",5,2023,10,03
247,Tattoo convention treat,"The hotel was ideally located with all the amenities of home. The beds were extremely comfortable … much appreciated by a lady with narcolepsy. Breakfast was delicious, fresh hot and tasty with a good selection and the perfect cup of tea delivered to the table upon seating. Residence bar staff were very attentive and overall we had a very much enjoyable well deserved relaxing mother daughter break away with the perfect late next day check out. Thank you and see you again soon!",5,2023,10,03
247,Pleasant Stay,"Stayed in this hotel on Friday 29th of September because of its close proximity to the Aviva Stadium.Everything was lovely .would recommend this hotel to family and friends going to an event in the Aviva. Great dart service,just 5mins walk from the hotel.",4,2023,10,03
247,A Most Enjoyable Stay,Had a most enjoyable stay recently in The Sandymount Hotel.The room was very clean and warm.Staff were very friendly and helpful at all times.A very convenient location and intend to revisit  again soon.,5,2023,09,29
247,Dublin 4 Hotel...mehh,"Overall very disappointing: check-in was with an unfriendly, bespectacled woman who had zero charm.
Bedroom was very small and too hot for sleep - no a/c.
Carpets in lifts and public areas generally grubby.
Asked about complimentary bus but was told it wasn't available on Sunday...even though ours was a Thursday stay. Value for money= €300 for one night of this... awful.",2,2023,09,29
247,"Lovely location, friendly staff",Great location in a beautiful and safe area. Extremely friendly staff. Lovely bar and restaurant area. We will definitely return in the future. Sandymount is a beautiful area and the hotel is in a great spot.,4,2023,09,28
247,"Great Stay, Free Parking and Great Location",The staff at the Hotel were very pleasant. The lady who checked me in gave me a very warm welcome and even upgraded my room. The  bedroom looked like it had only just been don.  up as it was spotless and more modern than I had expected from viewing the Hotel from the outside. The free parking was a gift and the Hotel's location is so convenient to the City Centre with the train station just around the corner ,5,2023,09,27
247,Top hotel,"Can't recommend the Sandymount enough. I use the hotel regularly to stay on business as its located in a central location with private safe car parking. Friendly helpful and accommodating staff. 
Congratulations to the hotel on thier recent renovation of their rooms 👏 ",5,2023,09,26
247,"Nice, comfortable hotel…","This hotel was part of a bus tour which we ended up staying an extra night after the tour. The hotel is in a residential area, however is walkable to restaurants, cafes, etc., We did take a taxi into Dublin City centre although public transit is accessible from this location. The hotel was clean, comfortable beds, and a nice dining/bar area. Because of the historical buildings which make up this hotel, it can seem like a maze of hallways so I suggest if needed let the hotel know if you have any concerns with accessibility or walking. I would stay at this hotel again. ",4,2023,09,25
247,Excellent staff and perfect location for Dublin stay.,"Had the most wonderful time exploring Dublin whilst staying at Sandymount Hotel.

The location is perfect to be able to walk into town or catch the Dart, I had a car and was able to easily park and drive to the local outskirts to explore.

The food at the restaurant is delicious for a quality hotel meal. 

The staff are so accommodating and friendly. Beatrice who works on reception is so inviting and generous of sharing ideas and local places to explore. 

Absolutely recommend for anyone traveling for work or leisure.",5,2023,09,25
247,Amazing customer service ,The best customer services  ever just so lovely. Beatrice was so helpful. The rooms were lovely. Location is fantastic. Good food. Just perfect. We really enjoyed it. We were staying for a party in the city. ,5,2023,09,24
247,Disappointing reservation handling,Couldn’t locate the correct details on check in. Got to my room and was called back to reception. Was stopped at breakfast because I was “room only” when I had paid for breakfast. Just poorly handled.,2,2023,09,21
247,"Warm, welcoming staff; great place to stay just outside the city center","Clean, comfortable, and very welcoming. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and comfortable. The restaurant had good food- breakfast was included so we ate there each morning- was a nice way to start our day!",5,2023,09,19
247,The best hotel in Dublin,"The Sandymount Hotel, is very convenient to the 3 Arena, the Dart at Lansdown Road, and with easy walking distance into Dublin Center. I have been staying here for some years now, and would recommend the hotel to anyone.
The staff are extremely helpful and cheerful, and will always have time to discuss anything that will make your stay fulfilled. The restaurant for dinner is excellent value, and the breakfasts are first class.
The hotel is very well decorated inside and out, and parking is extremely easy in the hotel or in the surrounding areas. The surrounding area is very quiet, and a fulfilling sleep is guaranteed.",5,2023,09,18
247,Never fails to impress,"I have been staying here for years since the Mount Herbert days and it just keeps improving. The standard room we are staying in, now has aircon and a touch mirror that lights up, this saves waking up your partner at night with the extractor fan. The restaurant menu is more varied and the food is amazing. As ever, the staff are a delight and so helpful. 5 star hotel at 3 star prices.",5,2023,09,16
247,Give Stephen Kenny a job fitting aircon and we both might win,"All good except the rooms need aircon, on a mild day of 19c rooms are warm and can effect sleep. Wouldn't return on a warm day or mild due to this.
Apart from that great hotel and location. If they could also give Stephen Kenny a job that would also solve a problem for Ireland fans ",4,2023,09,13
247,Excellent Location!!! Friendly staff!! Excellent Breakfast.,"Having stayed in a lot of Hotels in my lifetime for both work and leisure at home and abroad, The Sandymount hotel has without question topped the list. Myself and my two sons had the pleasure of staying in this wonderful hotel right at the foot of the Aviva stadium for the Ireland V Holland euro qualifier. From walking in the main door (on an extremely busy day out front) we were greeted with smiles from all the staff and nothing was a problem. Rooms spacious and modern and an excellent breakfast also!! A must stay if your looking for luxury and convenience. Thanks to all the team at  The Sandymount Hotel.",5,2023,09,13
247,Perfect place to stay for match,Location was perfect for attending an Ireland game. Really good atmosphere in hotel before and after the match. Gazebos in hotel grounds with a bbq going. Friendly and helpful staff. 5 minute walk to stadium.,5,2023,09,13

The area is tidy and clean.",4,2023,09,12
247,Great Experience,Stayed here during the Notre Dame/Navy football game in Dublin.  It was a wonderful experience for our entire crew that stayed here with 10 of us.

247,Great experience,Nice size room and food was delicious! Room a little warm but temperature was in the 20-22degs outside. Staff very accommodating and friendly. Really enjoyed stay. Close proximity to the Aviva Stadium! Definitely would recommend a stay here.,4,2023,09,11
247,it was  a pleasure to visit the hotel,"
the staff were amazing, friendly, extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble. the parking was good and I got parked on all 4 days. 
the room was spotless and had all mod cons, the bed was comfy and the pillows were as fluffy as you would like them.  The bathroom had a good supply of towels and toiletries.  The water pressure and heat of the shower was spot on. 
The wifi was good enough to allow me to watch movies. 
The breakfast was supreme, buffet style with everything well cooked, tasty and in good supply.  One of the best I have had in a long time. 
We ate in the restaurant twice and the food was bloody lovely. Again, well cooked and very tasty 
The bar area was great and the Guinness was moreish.
All the management and staff should be very proud of the hotel and the service they provide

247,"Comfortable, pleasant, great location and ""character""","We chose Sandymount for a 2-night ""jet lag pause"" from America, to let us do some birdwatching around the bay before moving on to Portugal. We appreciated all the lovely touches at Sandymount very much, with charming nooks for siting and relaxing throughout the building in addition to the comfort and quality of our Standard room. Note that the arrangement of the wings means you may have more of a walk through narrow hallways to get to and from your room. In the warm weather, our room did get a bit stuffy, even with windows open, which gave us the only difficulty sleeping off our long flight. Whitty's Restaurant is excellent, the garden setting is lovely, and the breakfast buffet is outstanding. We very much appreciated the ""to-go"" breakfast bags for our early morning departure. The location was perfect for what we wanted to do, and we had the pleasant surprise of warm, sunny weather for our early September stay. Staff were unfailing courteous, helpful, and patient, adding to the pleasure of the unique building and all its comfort. We hope to stay here again! ",5,2023,09,10
247,Charming,The hotel staff are terrific and very helpful. The restaurant and bar are good as well. It is an old hotel doing its best to stay up to date and they are doing it and keeping it charming. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel as well. Good find.,5,2023,09,09
247,"Very enjoyable stay in the Sandymount Hotel, exceptional service, especially when dealing with Beatrix at Reception!","We really enjoyed our stay, the first person we spoke to was Beatrix at Reception, she has to be one of the nicest people we have met in any of the hotels we stayed in Ireland and abroad.  She was very accomadating and recommended things to do in the area.  In my opinion nice pleasant staff make the difference when staying in a Hotel.  Our room was very comfortable and breakfast was exceptional!  Sandymount hotel is in a lovely part of Dublin,  the Dart is just round the corner which makes it very easy to get into the city centre, along with going to Howth/Dun Laoghaire/Bray for the day!  We will be back!!",5,2023,09,05
247,My favourite Dublin hotel 😊,"I've stayed in this hotel a few times now and I cannot recommend it enough!! Firstly there is parking which is fantastic, it's so quiet and the general area is lovely to walk around! The staff are incredible from the minute you walk into reception, they just cannot do enough for you when it comes to food, room service or anything you might need! The rooms are lovely and spacious and I've always slept well there between comfortable beds and peaceful surroundings! The food it amazing, we had a 3 course meal the last time we were there and it was gorgeous and the breakfast buffet is so fresh also and plenty of choice! Honestly can't rave about the Sandymount Hotel enough 😊",5,2023,09,03

I can’t wait to return what a fantastic hotel ❤️💯,5,2023,09,03
247,Perfect stay in Dublin,"Stayed for one night in September.  Very stylish modern sleek hotel a stones throw from the Aviva stadium.  The hotel is a perfect hub if attending  a match at the Aviva or shelbourne park.
Reception staff were very welcoming and pleasant.  We have an electric car and were able to charge it in their EV charging Bay Free of charge. This would bring us back here again.  
We had a few drinks in the bar before we hit the town and again the staff were lovely and pleasant.   The bar itself is big and spacious.   We didn’t  get a chance to try the restaurant but there was a lovely aroma coming from it.  Overall we had a lovely stay and will 100% be back again.",5,2023,09,03
247,Short break,"Staff very professional & helpful, Hotel very clean, I have an allergy to dust & was pleasantly surprised at standard of cleaning. Great location. Breakfast good quality but sadly cold, if hot would have given 5/5 rating. ",4,2023,09,02
247,Regular visitors,"Myself and my husband, Eamonn, have stayed in The Sandymount many times over the years, its our go to place when we go to Dublin, either on business or to visit family.

There's a very nice restaurant, with a good variety of options, delicious food, and ample indoor and outdoor seating. The staff is what really makes this hotel special.

I couldn't mention them all but will try. Guila (the perfect receptionist), Igor, Leo, Simona, Susana, Rose, Jim, and Ivan. Thank you all. Housekeeping and rooms excellent. The Aviva is right next door, and the pregame party with live music was the perfect place to be before the game. Will definitely come back to the Sandymount. Dwayne 🥰",5,2023,08,29

It is a fabulous hotel and it is spotless, the food is also superb!

The staff are truly amazing and very courteous especially Beatrice on reception and Inga who works magic in the background! 

We would highly recommend a vacation whether it's business or pleasure. 
The Internet connection is very strong and my partner really enjoyed working from here.
Also our teenage son loved his stay  here too and really enjoyed the beautiful walks in the D4 area.

The landscaping and upkeep of the gardens is well done and personally my favourite little spot.

I would love if there was a swimming pool here but there is one within walking distance. 
Sandymount is the place to be! 

Thanks to all the staff who we had the pleasure of meeting. 

Keep up the good work! 
Beautiful atmosphere created here!

247,Quick stopover in Dublin,"This is a gem of an hotel. Brilliantly located next to the AVIVA Stadium & Sandymount Strand. We were warmly welcomed and when we enquired about changing our room there was no issue. 

Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean. Very comfortable beds and complimentary tea, coffee & water. 

We dined with another couple, in the restaurant, and the food was excellent. Both of us like fish and it was cooked to perfection. 

I would have no hesitation in recommending Sandymount Hotel for a city break in Dublin. Enjoy.",5,2023,08,20
247,Over night stay for the rugby.,"We booked this hotel as we were going to the rugby later that day as it’s 2 minutes walk to the Aviva stadium. It was my husbands surprise 60th birthday. We arrived about 10.30am and just reported to reception that our car was in the car park and we weren’t expecting to check in. Susanna who was so lovely surprised me by saying our room was ready. After a long drive from Belfast it was surely welcome. The room was so comfy and spotless, they even had a birthday card and a box of chocolates for his birthday. What a wonderful touch, he was so pleased. They have like a fanzone on match days were you can sit outside they have outdoor bars, serving drinks, coffee and even burgers all day. So we enjoyed this until the match kick off. Even when we came back after the match we hadn’t made a dinner reservation. They made room for us on the outdoor terrace and we had the steak which was amazing. This hotel is perfect, I cannot recommend enough you won’t regret it. ",5,2023,08,20
247,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!","Firstly, the man at reception couldn't find my reservation. After he rang 'reservations' I was told that my booking was there but had been lost since they changed computer systems. I was then told that although I knew I had prepaid 100% of the money for the room, they believed that as their computer systems had changed, the money I paid had bounced back into my account and I still owed over 900 euro. I was very uncertain about this and after checking my bank statement the money had in fact NOT bounced back! Therefore, they agreed that I HAD paid the room in full! I was absolutely appalled by this! The Sandymount Hotel had tried to charge me nearly 2 thousand euro for three nights B&B! On top of that, it is stated on the website that there is free parking, however the parking is EXTREMEMLY limited. I was told by the receptionist that I could park on the side of the road but that I would have to return to my car every three hours to pay for a parking ticket.... outrageous. The man who was the receptionist was the most arrogant and obnoxious person I have ever had to deal with. He spoke down to me and treated me with so much disrespect, I couldnt actually believe how little empathy he portrayed. During dinner we were also charged for two glasses of wine that the table in front of us orded, thankfully I noticed this before I paid for the bill. We had to ask for a bottle of tap water 3 times during dinner and recieved drinks we had ordered 30 minutes beforehand, after our starters. During breakfast we got our tea and coffee after we had eaten and even overheard the man beside us asking for a pot of tea three times before getting up and leaving. I was also told by the male waiter after ordering cider during dinner that he thought only men drank it! I have never had to deal with people who were rude and did everthing at a snails pace. There was a red haired waitress during breakfast who looked like she was the only one who knew what she was doing and kept everthing ticking over! There was also a lady during dinner who was the manger I believe, who seemed to be fixing all the problems the others had created and was impeccable at her job. This Hotel needs to re-train the majority of their staff in customer service and general manners! If you do intend on staying here please ensure you check all your bills before you pay for anything!",1,2023,08,18
247,Good Experience,Rooms and hotel very clean with friendly and welcoming staff. Great location to RDS and Ballsbridge. Check-in was quick and straightforward and free parking was a bonus compared to other hotels in the area.,5,2023,08,15
247,The Sandymount Dublin,"My family and I came here for a one night stay in Dublin. The lady on reception was very polite ,helpful and made registration and check-in  hassle free and uncomplicated.
Check-in to rooms is at 3pm and as we arrived earlier our baggage was put in a secure room for us to pickup later in the day.
Our rooms were clean,fresh and not stuffy and were supplied with tea/coffee making facilities , a nice touch.
We booked a table for dinner as the lady on reception had advised. The restaurant was busy at 7:30 but there were plenty of staff serving.
There was a really good choice of options on the menu catering for varied tastes. The burgers were a work of art themselves.Our meals arrived surprisingly quickly and were of a really  good standard. Staff were really helpful and willing to make our dining experience a lovely occasion. 
The drinks menu was also quite comprehensive offering a good choice of wines spirits beers and soft drinks. 
This is a great hotel - great staff - great food. I'll be back!",5,2023,08,15
247,A gem near the RDS,"Fab stay in this homely hotel just mins walk from RDS. Special tks to Beatrice for making us so welcome as we return year after year .

247,Lovely stay at the Sandymount Hotel,"My sister and I enjoyed a very comfortable stay at the hotel which is perfectly situated for the DART and 10 minutes walk from Sandymount Green. It coincided with an evening rugby match with Ireland playing Italy at the Aviva stadium but we weren't disturbed at all. In fact, we joined in with the pre match fans at the bar and burgers laid on by the hotel in the forecourt. We'll be back!",4,2023,08,13
247,Great experience from check in to check out .,Always a great hotel to stay in with great staff who make you feel welcome . The only gripe I would have is the price of staying has somewhat rocketed but this is true of all hotels in Dublin. Hotel rooms we'll equipped with all you need and if anything is needed you only have to ask .,5,2023,08,10
247,Enjoyed our stay,"room small enough but spotless, food nice, staff friendly. Anti climax after the match as queued for over 30 mins ...very slow... and then no atmosphere. Everyone just sat sipping drinks. Very friendly and clean thought.",4,2023,08,09
247,Super for a relaxed important celebration for all ages,I'm so happy with our choice of the Sandymount hotel for a special 80th birthday. We had the large outdoor covered space and the children could play and all the adults were so happy. Great food. But really it was the team who made me know we were in great hands. Meant a lot. Thank you. Great success. Cristina was so professional and dealt with every question and event booking change with such kindness. On the day Louise and her team were incredible. Always there to help. ,5,2023,08,09
247,Continually great stays,"Another rugby weekend and another great stay!  I've stayed at the Sandymount several times this year and have more bookings over the next few months - as rooms are all slightly different is size and layout, its always a bit of a surprise to open the room door (but all are very comfortable).

The team are always amazing - super friendly and helpful even at busy times. ",5,2023,08,08
247,Excellent stay ,"Stayed in the hotel for two nights, rooms great and spacious , fab breakfast and excellent staff , Beatrice on reception was great, incredibly helpful and friendly. Location excellent and plenty of parking!  Overall excellent hotel and great location , rooms were comfortable and bar areas were lovely !  The atmosphere was great and honestly staff can't do enough for you ! Will definitely be back ! ",5,2023,08,08
247,Saturday 5 August 2023,We booked the hotel as we were going to the Ireland v Italy match at the Aviva.  Great location for game.  Staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel itself very clean and good value for money considering its location,5,2023,08,08
247,enjoyable one night stay,"We were well received even at 1.30 in the night. The family room was up to its description, 2 single beds and a large double bed, in a nice big room, the car park handy and the breakfast as nice as on the pictures. We enjoyed our one night at this hotel.",5,2023,08,08
247,Perfect night away,"Couldn’t fault this hotel. Everything was fantastic. The food was amazing. The staff were brilliant. The room was spotless. Honestly it’s a little gem of a hotel. From check in to check out, everything was perfect. ",5,2023,08,08
247,Very nice stay,"The hotel fully met our expectations. Special requests were immediately addressed, we had asked for a second duvet. The breakfast was rich and the staff friendly. Only the water pressure in the shower was a bit too low, but that is not so bad.",5,2023,08,08
247,"Pleasant, great location but stuff to work on.","Hi all, stayed weekend gone for Italy rugby match with my son, location excellent. Did not have dinner, breakfast in the morning was all fine, nothing remarkable but breakfast was open till 10:30am which was handy. Hotel is full of narrow walkways over a few levels but room spotless & comfortable. Can't judge dinner as we didn't have any. The only negative was post the match.its a hotel so everyone staying did trickle back to the hotel. 2 orderly queues formed but it was clear there was non-one in charge behind the bar, nor was there anyone capable. People got very annoyed at the lack of communication the guys behind the bar had with each other but also the people waiting. No sense of recognising who was next, clearly not capable  of dealing with any form of crowd. I remarked to my son how anything above 6 people, the situation tended to extend into wait longer wait times, unnecessarily. Each bar staff member dealt with one customer at a time..it was all very laboured but also noticeable how they were not tracking who was queuing first & who happened to jump the queue. Also one staff member who's name I won't disclose was asked for a koppaberg cider to which he replied he didn't any. However he was corrected by his colleague to say it was in the store room. This was met with a ""do I have to attitude, threw his eyes to the skies & slowly trudged off, slowly I might add"". This guy does not understand the type of industry he's in. Come on guys, ye could have done better, talk to each other, communicate, be vocal with each other & also look at people in front of you, it keeps people onside when they know they are not forgotten. I want to be clear, the queue at the bar was busy but not an out of control rabble. People incredibly tolerant but they were being ignored alot of the time. An area this hotel with a guaranteed market on match days must do better in. Please, we would like to stay again in the future but please get this part right & clearly have a front man behind the bar to direct staff & the traffic that follows. ",4,2023,08,07
247,"Great hotel - clean, friendly and comfortable",We were very comfortable here for the one night we stayed. The location is excellent and the facilities are what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Food was good and staff were professional and friendly. I gave it 4 because I felt it was a little expensive.,4,2023,08,05
247,Comfortable hotel,"This hotel is like a maze, but it was clearly marked to find your room number.  It was comfortable, and the restaurant was very good for dinner.  We were staying here as the last night for our Trafalgar tour.  I wish they had air conditioning, but they brought up 2 fans for us, which was great.  Also it would have been nice to have the outlets in more convenient places.  We left at 6:15 the next morning, and the hotel fixed all of us a bag breakfast, which was very nice to take with us to the airport.  That was a great addition for us.  Overall, we had a short, but very nice stay here.",4,2023,08,04
247,Perfect spot,"Chose this for the location to both the DART and east access to east link for the north side of the city to visit friends. Did not disappoint and was very pleasantly surprised. Staff were super friendly, rooms fresh and spacious with great beds. Parked with ease and no problems at all during our stay.",5,2023,08,04
247,Lovely hotel stay last weekend in the sandymount hotel so central excellent food and service. We will be back.,We had a lovely weekend in the Sandymount Hotel from start to finish.

247,Excellent Stay. Excellent Staff.,"Excellent Hotel.  The rooms/beds comfortable.  Breakfast delicious. Close to the train station to get into downtown. Absolutely lovely.  The best part however is the staff.  They will go completely out of their way for you because they are just wonderful people, especially Ciaran who chased down our taxi driver because I left my purse in the car.  Could not believe the kindness.  Thank you Ciaran and everyone else who made our stay absolutely incredible. Cannot wait to come back one day!",5,2023,08,01
247,A wonderful hotel with an incredible staff,"We left our passports, phone and cash in a cab from the airport and only realized it some time after it had left. Without getting into all of the details, the extent to which the staff and hotel manager, Ciaran, went to help us is absolutely unheard of. He made multiple trips to the airport with me, to the taxi line, parking lots, airport police detail, etc. in order to help our family.  He was the hero of our trip and we are so appreciative of his and the rest of the staff's efforts.  Truly an amazing man who went above and beyond to help strangers. Thank you!
The hotel itself is lovely, very conveniently located, clean, modern with all amenities. The grounds are well kept, the beds comfortable, the restaurant terrific and the staff just outstanding.  We would come back for sure.",5,2023,08,01
247,Best family-driven hotel in beautiful Sandymount,"I could have written about the spacious and tidy rooms, the lovely breakfast and restaurant, great service at the reception, etc. But what I really love about this fantastic family-driven hotel is that the employees become your friend. You are not ""just a customer"". You chat with them about everything, and you always feel they give more to your stay than you can expect. You feel they are enjoying their time at work, and that I love.
We had a fantastic holiday here and will most certainly come back next time we visit Dublin.
Beatrice and Susana in the reception, Anna and Lucio in the restaurant, Igor and his colleagues in the bar/pub. To name a few...
But my biggest praice goes to Simona in the reception 😀 We had an issue with our room when we arrived and the way you solved it will never be forgotten. And the great chats we had.
Thanks to everyone at Sandymount Hotel for our best hotel-experience ever❤️ And see you all soon",5,2023,07,31
247,Short break in Dublin,"Great location and extremely friendly and helpful staff - particularly at reception!

Sligo couple.",5,2023,07,29
247,Excellent Stay in the City ,"Stayed at the Sandymount on our last day in Ireland, and it was a wonderful way to end the trip.  Breakfast was excellent and the location was only a quick ride from the city center.  Included parking was a nice touch and allowed us to arrive into the city and unload all of our things before returning the rental, super convenient ",5,2023,07,23
247,Lovely location,This was our first visit to this hotel but we knew the area and the fact it has free parking is a major bonus for us. Lovely location and the dart is just round the corner. Also Sandymount Green is a short walk away for cafes and pubs. Room was spacious and clean. We were at the front of the hotel and had no noise at all which was great. Lovely staff and a good bar area. The only small thing was that the wifi in our room wasn't great..enjoyed our stay so much that booked to return next month.,4,2023,07,22
247,Finally a good nights sleep,"I had a super experience in the Sandymount. Spotless room, friendly staff, amazing fresh peeled apricots for breakfast and the bedding is just amazing. If you’re too hot at night and need something lighter, there’s a spare blanket in the wardrobe that provides the perfect solution. I’ll be recommending the Sandymount to friends, family and colleagues. ",5,2023,07,20
247,Our go-to hotel in Dublin,The Sandymount is our go to hotel in Dublin. In a lovely part of the city and very accessible to the city centre via the Dart. Sandymount village and along the seafront are recommended for longer walks. The hotel staff are excellent and have provided up grades to our stay.  ,4,2023,07,20
247,Stay at Sandymount Hotel,"Delightful stay at a very customer friendly family run hotel, refreshing escape from robotic chain hotels who lack personality, 2 rooms reserved, one newly renovated, one on its way to being renovated, both very comfortable and clean. Beatrice at reception was fantastic, friendly and welcoming, Cinthia in reservations was equally helpful and friendly, super location, quiet area, highly recommend 😃",5,2023,07,20
247,"Sandymount hotel, a great experience","I have stayed in Sandymount hotel for many years, on a frequency every few weeks per year. I find the hotel a very friendly hotel with great staff, the restaurant service and food is very good, the rooms are well maintained and very comfortable.
The location is great and easy to access the airport and a short taxi to central Dublin. Car parking is free and easy to access.
I have made many friends with the family run owners and staff.

247,Absolutely Devine,From arrival to departure we had such an easy time here. Friendly staff. Quick check in. Restaurant was beautiful and their portion sizes are definitely something to brag about. The breakfast was delicious too!. The bar upstairs was very nice. Darker lighting which really set the mood. We had a lovely stay and this will be a core memory of our first time to dublin.,5,2023,07,19
247,Great hotel with the best staff,"Our stay at the Sandymont Hotel was perfect. We were warmly welcomed and were able to leave our luggages at the luggage office to go for a walk in the city. The lady at the reception gave us some recommendations as to where to eat. The breakfast was delicious and there was a lot of options. The staff was incredibly nice at every step of our stay and till the end. Big thanks to Beatrice and Ann who called the hotel shuttle for us as it was raining to take us to our car rental agency. They were always nice, smiling and helpful.",5,2023,07,18

Friendly & pleasant staff.
Delicious food.
Great location in tidy, quiet, pretty part of Dublin.
Free parking.

Couple issues regarding our booking at checkin and key cards during stay we’re sorted, our room even upgraded at staff suggestion.

Despite these issues, highly recommend staying in this hotel, and eating here.",4,2023,07,18
247,"Highly recommend, we would definitely stay again!","Great experience all round. The rooms are lovely. Decent size and everything you need.

All of the staff we met were great. There were loads of free spaces in the car park and it was really easy to get to the city centre via the dart.

The surrounding area is very nice and felt completely safe. The breakfast was fantastic. ",5,2023,07,16
247,Warm and great stay,"Family hotel with a lovely staff.

247,All round great hotel,"It’s always a pleasure to stay at the Sandymount Hotel. 
We have stayed there on so many occasions over the years that I have lost count. There is always a welcome from the front desk.  The rooms are clean, bright and a good size.  
We usually include breakfast which works well for me as I’m gluten free. 
Big bonuses are the location close to the Dart, loads of good local restaurants and bars, along with free car parking during your stay. 
I’m happy to recommend the Sandymount Hotel",5,2023,07,14
247,Staying at Sandymount for years. Friendly staff.,"Excellent rooms I’ve stayed in most of them everything always works, consistently always clean and comfortable. Friendly helpful staff. Great breakfast.Good bar with outdoor space Safe parking. 
I would highly recommend the  Sandymount Hotel ",5,2023,07,12

247,Home away from home,"From the moment we arrived in the carpark we felt we were home we had made good time and we were early for our check in so we thought we could have a coffee and then check in we stopped at reception to tell of our plans and they checked us in straight away and directed us to our spotless room which though compact had everything you need and was so quiet it helped me relax straight away
The staff are very friendly and helpful making you feel welcome and nothing was to much effort for them
It felt like we were staying with extended family who were pleased to have us for the weekend staff always had time to exchange greetings and a very happy smile
While the choice of food on the menu is fairly limited the quality is very good and portion sizes are generous and the desserts are worth travelling from Mayo to Dublin for if like me you like your desserts have an appetizer and dessert rather than a main course and have no room for dessert
So if you have to go to Dublin stay at the Sandymount Hotel you will find a haven of peace with fantastic food and friendly staff ",5,2023,07,12
247,100% Satisfied.,"Best customer service ever. The room was spotless and bright, room service was on time. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. Breakfast was great as it included plantbased options. Would definitely go back there again.",5,2023,07,10
247,"Stunning Hotel, Great Location","Wow! What a stunning hotel! The rooms are absolutely beautiful - unbelievable standard for a 4 star hotel. The bed was so comfortable. I had a great night's sleep. The shower was powerful and hot, even during the most busiest times, unlike a lot of hotels I've stayed in recently.  The food at breakfast was delicious. The hotel is right beside the dart so you're in the city centre in less than 10 minutes! And the Aviva stadium is next door.  The reception staff were so lovely and attentive. We had a lovely chat with Bea, she was so friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I'Il definitely be back. There's excellent attention to detail from the moment you walk in, and such a high standard throughout. You can tell the owners and management team care about their business. If you're planning on visiting Dublin, definitely stay here. ",5,2023,07,10
247,A stress free stay,"We enjoyed three nights in the Sandymount. The room was beautiful and very clean. It was a triple room, very spacious.

I would definitely book this hotel and highly recommend.",5,2023,07,09
247,Great stay in D4,"Great hotel in a great location with a fantastic team looking after you. Nothing was too much trouble. Irish Breakfast buffet was very good and matched with great service.

247,Our first choice for comfort and relaxation in Dublin.,"The fact that my wife and I have chosen to stay in this hotel many times over the years says it all. Excellent staff and service, comfortable well equipped rooms, location super, 5 mins from DART station. Sandymount village and seafront all within short walking distance. Not to mention the neighbouring Aviva Stadium for rugby, etc. Most highly recommended indeed.",5,2023,07,06
247,"Friendly, we’ll located hotel with free parking.","We stay here frequently when visiting from USA. Short distance to Dublin center, €1.70 (exact change required) on bus.

Room was excellent everything you needed. Food was wonderful...enjoyed the breakfast selection. 
A Hotel to revisit.",5,2023,07,04
247,Good location but average hotel,"Great location and parking. Room quiet small but clean and functional. Bar and restaurant not very friendly and food poor to say the least, vegetable curry consisted of undercooked potato in a curry sauce, not edible ",3,2023,07,03
247,Updated Review of my Favourite Dublin Hotel,"Following COVID and upgrades that have come into effect it was time to refresh the review.....still a fantastic hotel...upgrades have taken place with new EV chargers on site expanding the original single charge dock to s complete row of up to 6 Cars. Rooms have been upgraded with AIRCON in some and LED lighting throughout. Unfortunately food no longer served in the Lineout Bar and ambience of ground floor restaurant is just not the same. Service as always is top class with friendly attentive staff... The ""Queen Bee"" is still at reception, with checkin seamless and friendly by all staff....one gripe I would have is price of ""Rib Eye"" steak in excess of 40€...this isnt just limited to the Sandymount...cannot see how a €6 piece of beef when presented with mash and a few veg can arrive at that price...but that would be the going price in Dublin at the moment....other dishes on menu are still to high quality and worth the prices...will still be coming back and highly recommend this hotel based on friendly staff and modern finishes.",5,2023,07,03
247,Always a pleasure,Absolutely love staying in the Sandymount Hotel. The rooms are beautifully clean and modern. Added bonus of a Dyson hair dryer too. Dinner and breakfast was fab too. Staff are always polite and courteous. Can't wait until our next stay already.,5,2023,07,03
247,Home from home,"The Sandymount Hotel has been my home from home Mon - Fri for five months, whilst working on a project in Dublin. I have felt appreciated, loved and welcomed by all the staff. From Beatrice (ambassador), Jacqui (joyful), Caio (helper) to the cleaners, waiters, bar staff and reception … all are happy to be part of this hotel family.
When staff are treated with respect and kindness, the joy and peace are tangible in an establishment.",5,2023,07,02
247,"Expensive, Loud, and . . . Weird","The Sandymount charged 261 euros for our one night stay. We got a small room, a queen bed, and no breakfast. At 130 am we were awakened by commotion out in the hall that lasted 20-30 mins and involved a lot of slamming doors. Simultaneously, and for about the same length of time, there was an intermittent pounding at the wall behind our bed. 

As we left the hotel bleary eyed the next morning, we were greeted by a sleepy man wearing nothing but his underpants and socks who boarded lift B as we got off.

Contrast all this with our magnificent stay at the Wyatt hotel in Westport: big room, king bed, quiet all night, and one of the best breakfasts I’ve ever had included in our room cost, which was about 80 euro LESS per night. The staff there—mostly locals—were incredibly helpful and friendly too. 

We come to Dublin on vacation every couple of years. In the future, we’ll be sure to steer clear of the Sandymount.",2,2023,07,01
247,Excellent stay.,Stayed just one night as part of a motoring holiday. Hotel was modern with good parking. Rooms clean and well appointed. All staff were friendly and helpful (especially Bea on reception and Anna and all the other restaurant staff). Easy access to city centre by taxi or bus. Will stay again when in Dublin.,5,2023,06,30
247,Very comfortable and relaxing,Brilliant place a 5 min walk from Aviva stadium but a 30 minute walk to city centre. Staff were brill very friendly. Room 371 is a different story. Toilet up againt the bath very little room.  The view from our window in bedroom is looking out at air conditioning.  Room is well kept and fresh free wifi but sometimes would loose connection. Tv in room no restrictions. ,4,2023,06,30
247,If you are stuck this is an ok hotel.,"While the room was spotless, the whole experience around interactions with reception staff and some restaurant staff was just dull, my check in was bog standard, just robotic and as for the two dudes who checked me out on 29/6, they couldnt care if my stay was good bad or indifferent. The host in the breakfast room was actually a nice guy, but the breakfast experience was really poor. The buffet was uncared for, the gluten free options listed on an A4 poster were no where to be seen and the whole food offering was similar to a petrol station. There are better hotels in Dublin for the rate.",2,2023,06,30
247,Excellent,"Sandymount Hotel Dublin is an excellent hotel to stay in. It boasts a great location, fantastic rooms, great breakfast, efficient & extremely friendly staff. In all the Sandymount Hotel Dublin offers great value for money. I would definitely recommend & pay a return visit.",5,2023,06,28
247,Too expensive,"Too expensive over €500 for a two night stay because of pride being on I guess, we only came to see iron maiden, the room was fine and clean, but was way too hot, not made known that fans were available ",4,2023,06,27
247,Ideal location for game in Aviva,"Great location for Aviva, clean, pleasant staff, good food, free parking, nice room, all good, only downside was quite expensive for one night with no breakfast included, also didn’t like how windows opened upwards fully on upper floors (travelling with young child) ",4,2023,06,24

247,Sandymount Hotel at Aviva Stadium 2-nights,It was easy to come and go/back and forth to Dublin; they called taxis. Or use DART (Lansdowne Rd.) past stadium. Their Whitty's breakfast buffet was great; Line Out Bar was fun. There were stadium events. and the hotel had two Heineken tents.,5,2023,06,20
247,Dubliner,"Came here with my family. The staff all throughout the hotel were very nice. Room were clean. The showers at first were puzzling and hard to regulate at first, but I got used to it.

247,The best staff,"This hotel is absolutely lovely! It’s one of the very few hotels in Ireland that still a family operation, making this feel like a home. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I had the pleasure of having an exceptional exchange with Jackie and Leandro at the coffee stand. Their sweet and warm vibe immediately made me feel at home! It had plans to go walk around the city, but it was raining so I decided to grab a coffee instead. Jackie’s and Leandro’s attentiveness and cheerful chat was a sunshine on a raining afternoon. Absolutely recommend staying here ! ",5,2023,06,16
247,Fabulous hotel,Within walking distance of charming Sandymount visit yet only 10 mins on DART into city centre. Lovely staff who really seem to enjoy their jobs. Beautifully appointed room - we stayed room 134. Great buffet breakfast too,5,2023,06,12
247,"Most friendly an professional staff, and great location.",We had a wonderful experience at Sandymount. The staff was fantastic. Leonardo and Susana took care of us in a professional and very friendly manner. They really made us feel at home. The breakfast was excellent and the room was modern and immaculately clean. We would definitely stay again.,5,2023,06,11
247,Nice and family run hotel within 5 minutes walk from Dart-line,"Fine hotel, nice neighbourhood. We came from the airport by bus and Dart-line (5 minutes walk). It is located right next to the Aviva stadium. The room was not too big, but clean, with a clean bathroom. ",4,2023,06,11
247,Event,"Post Funeral - family lunch for 80 people. Excellent catering, food, service and very pleasant staff. The event room had its own bar and opened onto the garden room where the family retired to after lunch for the evening",5,2023,06,11
247,Disappointed,"We stayed here for the Bruce Springsteen concert in place.  We picked the hotel for its location and price but still €400 + for B&B is ridiculous.  In terms of location, it was ideal though.  Positives are staff at reception and (in general) were pleasant, the room and bathroom, although small, were clean and well presented.  What disappointed us was the hotel felt cramped with lots of corridors that were narrow and its layout didn't make sense.  We felt uncomfortable in the hotel.   The other disappointment was the bar food.  It really was of a poor standard and over priced.  It didn't match our expectations of what we should get at a four star hotel.  Even taking into account that this was Dublin and we all know Dublin hotels are seriously overcharging, we felt we didn't get value for money spent.  Compared to other four star hotels we have visited, this was of a poor standard.",3,2023,06,09
247,Great staff!,"The rooms were typical of European hotels...small, limited electrical outlets, etc.  It is difficult to rate it poorly when they are very comparable to many hotels in Europe.  The staff was very helpful.  They suggested we download the app FreeNow to get taxis wherever we were.  We'd never heard of it and it was extremely helpful.  The restaurant staff was also excellent.  Friendly, professional, excellent service and good food. ",4,2023,06,07
247,An excellent hotel is Dublin,Sandymount is an excellent hotel well located for transit to all parts of Dublin.

247,"Small, dark room with moldy shower","The shower was a moldy and the room was very dark, small and stuffy in what felt like the basement of the hotel. The card to the room that they gave us also didn’t work. The room was what I would expect from a budget hostel maybe worth €30 not €300. I definitely won’t be going back, but if you have to, ask not to be on level 1. Not worth the money at all.",1,2023,05,30
247,Consistently a great experience at The Sandymount,"Being a regular visitor to Dublin I always have this hotel top of my list.

We were going to the 3 Arena but Munster and Leinster were playing in the very nearby Aviva Stadium so the atmosphere around the hotel was great but a great idea that the hotel itself is for guests only!

247,"Sandymount Hotel great location, professional staff, friendly atmosphere, excellent breakfast buffet.  ","Hotel was perfect location for our visit to Dublin, which was primarily to see Bruce Spingsteen at RDS stadium close by, and visit friends on the North and South side of the city. Parking can be difficult as space is limited. On the strengths the hotel is friendly, clean and well managed and the food is top quality.

247,A perfect place to stay for a concert in the RDS or the Aviva.,"The Sandymount Hotel is ideally located between the RDS and the Aviva, perfect for visiting either venue. From Heuston station take bus C1 and get off at Star of the sea stop which is 11 stops from Heuston then a 5min walk to the hotel. Our room was clean and spacious. Reception ladies were very welcoming and friendly. We had a lovely dinner in the restaurant before the show.

Many thanks for hosting our bunch of crazy Bruce Springsteen fans over the last ten days or so.  You and your staff went out of your way on so many fronts, too many to mention.  All of us agree that this was one of our most memorable experiences touring with Bruce, all over the world.

Hotel recently renovated, comfortable, modern equipment, the mattress was very comfortable and the environment quiet, very important for me. The breakfast was copious, nothing was missing. I did not try the restaurant but I drank a very good whiskey at the bar, the waiter was very friendly. You can feel the family spirit of this hotel which is much more friendly than in big chains. Transport is right next door and there are some very good restaurants within walking distance. The area is very pleasant, surrounded by beautiful houses and the small village of Sandymount is very charming. The nature around is fantastic. We will gladly come back soon, thanks again to all ",5,2023,05,05
247,Excellent family run hotel in Sandymount,"Great place to go to for family occasions and obviously for events in the area - the nearby RDS and Aviva for rugby & soccer.

247,Hotel in residential area,"Lovely hotel located in Sandymount next to Aviva Stadium. Very clean, excellent breakfast. I am giving it a 4 because the room service menu is very limited.

Nice bar area & modern rooms with friendly staff.
",4,2023,04,26
247,Visiting Dublin,"Nice hotel in a great area. We stayed for three nights but the bed was small and rock hard so we didn’t sleep these nights. And I was instead listening to the low annoying consistent sound from the electrical box by the door. Stay one more night and I would probably lose my mind with that sound. Cleaning in the room excellent. 
We lived at the top floor but the lift was not working at all so it was hard on the knees with all the stairs up and down several times per day. Staff was pretty neutral, passing the reception no one looked up or said hello so really no interaction with anyone except when we were checking out. Close to the DART station and close to the city.",3,2023,04,26
247,A lovely place to stay!,"My stay at the sandymount has been nothing but wonderful! From the beautiful neighborhood (which is a quick train ride into the city center) to the combination of modern and classic decor to the accommodating and kind staff. Igor was a pleasure to see at the bar each night after a long day of walking around Dublin, always ready with suggestions of things to see and delicious drinks. His old fashioned and whiskey sour were really stand out. Cinthia with the hospitality staff was also so helpful in setting up accommodations and answering any logistical questions I had. I would definitely recommend the sandymount to anyone visiting Dublin and looking for a quieter area to unwind in. ",5,2023,04,25
247,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed in the Sandymount hotel last weekend and we are already looking forward to going back! We stayed in a suite which was very spacious, extremely comfortable with beautiful modern decor. We were greeted in reception by Beatrice who went above and beyond to make our stay relaxing and enjoyable. She was a wealth of information about local activities and provided great suggestions on what to do during our trip. Breakfast was delicious with a huge variety to choose from. We also enjoyed a late night drink in the bar on our return from a concert in the 3 arena which is only a short walk away. 10/10 rating for amazing staff, fab hotel and superb location.",5,2023,04,25

We should particularly like to mention for special praise Jaqueline and Anna who served us in the restaurant - they were unfailingly efficient and always cheerful.",5,2023,04,25
247,Perfect Golf and Guinness Getwaway,"I booked at Sandymount at the recommendation of my friend who lives nearby.  It was convenient and affordable -- and turned out to be much more.  I booked directly (recommended) for five nights.  Early check-in.  Immaculate room, quiet and comfy. Relaxed air, comfortable facilities indoors and outdoors for eating, drinking, and relaxing.  American/Irish breakfast was hearty and tasty.  Daily walks to Sandymount Village and the Strand, plus two skips to the train station, Excellent staff, from reservations to front desk, from pub to restaurant, with double-stars to housekeeping.  Highly recommended, will return.",5,2023,04,21
247,Stay for the room not the food,"In the middle of a 10 day stay. Would move to another hotel if I could.  Location is good for us. Rooms are ok and accommodate our needs as we are staying with 2 grandchildren. Breakfast each morning is flavourless but usually ok. It's Ireland so no vegetables and the fruit is worse than at Tesco. (Did purchase some at Tesco which is only a few minutes walk).  Staff at breakfast  buffet and generally are friendly.  Beatrice on reception is exceptionally nice.

 Dinner was surprisingly tasty but the food was delivered at random. Service issues are widespread. Granddaughter found glass on the floor under her seat (kids explore ). We gave it to the waitress who was unfazed and said her cut from the glass will heal.  I received my salad after my wife received her main dish even though we ordered the same main. No bitters at the bar for my wife's old fashioned. The second person we told assured us there were but he disappeared never to be seen again. Waitress may have another job at the hotel as she too disappeared at times.

 Breakfast this morning was a disaster. Imagine that 50 people were showing up at your house for brunch and you forgot to prepare. That describes the experience. Wild! 

Shared my experience  with two managers who were at the front office. Perhaps there are cultural differences at play (I'm from Canada) but saying he will look into it and not asking my name or room number suggests to me he does not care. 

On the plus side, apparently there was a medical emergency a few days ago with a successful use of the defibulator. Always good when the staff care, even if management does not.

Thank you😍",5,2023,04,18
247,Disappointed,"Staff generally not good enough (reception excepted)Cooked breakfast, apart  from freshly poached eggs, was poor.Bacon was hard like cardboard and everything only just warm!

247,They make you feel at home,"Our family just returned home to the States after a week long stay at Sandymount Hotel with another family. We traveled with 4 adults and 3 children ages 8, 8, and 5. The staff was amazing, the cleanliness was top notch, and since our stay included the Easter holiday the owner treated our children to chocolate Easter eggs on Sunday morning! The location is fantastic for walking to Sandymount Strand, the Lansdowne Rd. DART station, and Aviva stadium. I highly recommend this hotel for everything from business to family travel!

247,"Small room, good shower, no wifi, calm area","Room was small, no seating area only beds. Tv available if you connect it to your own mobile. No wifi in room, good shower.

Decent breakfast selection but not much variety changes. Recommend selecting strong coffee if you dont want heated water with slight coffee flavor.

Friendly helpful staff. Good location for sleep, no disturbances",3,2023,04,13
247,Brilliant Food. Great location. Lovely staff,"I stay here on business  3 times a month. The location suits me, but the quality of the food is the main reason. It is fresh and tasty and always served piping hot. Not overly pretentious, just good wholesome food. Today, 12 April, my wonderful server, Jaqueline, recommended the Special. I ordered a Veg Soup and the special, which was a marinated chicken breast  served with a wine sauce,  mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The soup, as always, was delicious. Tasty and hot. The Special when it arrived was spectacular. Beautiful, moist, piping hot, chicken with a fabulous crispy skin. The flavours of everything on the plate were wonderful. Such a simple dish but executed to a brilliant standard with care and attention. My complements to the fantastic chef and my thanks to Jacqueline for a great recommendation",5,2023,04,12
247,A lovely stay for a city getaway,"On our most recent stay to the Sandymount hotel we stayed in newly refurbished rooms and they were excellent! Such a lovely nights sleep in a quiet area very close to the city centre.

Beatrice at the front desk was particularly helpful and made sure we had great options for places to eat locally and taxis organised for us when heading in to town! 

Will definitely be staying here again, thank you all :)",5,2023,04,11
247,Exceptional Customer Service,"This hotel is always our go to in Dublin.

It's the small touches. Myself and my partner were down for a health appointment. My partner emailed ahead of time to ask could we plug our cooler in at reception prior to check in as we would arrive at 10:30am and we had medication which needed refrigerated. They replied to say it would be no problem. To our absolute surprise, when we arrived at 10:30, Beatrice told us our room was in fact ready as they made special arrangements to have it sorted given the nature of the visit and our previous custom. It just so happens this was the exact same room we stayed in our 2 previous visits. We also had a card left in our room along with chocolates for my partner, a very much appreciated gesture.

The reception staff are phenomenal, especially Beatrice. We were last down in 2021 for the same reason as this time. She remembered us both. Incredible considering how many thousands have probably come and gone in that period that she can still remember us. She's an absolute credit to your business and couldn't have made us feel more welcome. It goes without saying it's no wonder she's been working here 40+ years, such a genuinely nice lady.

The included car parking is a big plus along with the location. Sandymount is a beautiful area. The village is only a 5-10 min walk and the centre of Dublin only a 10 minute DART ride of which the station is only a 5 minute walk.

The room we were in (room 374) also had a facelift since we were last down. The panelling is beautiful and the decor is very modern. The staff also provided us with a fridge in the room for our medication, again, going above and beyond for us.

All in all, this hotel is a must if visiting Dublin. The staff are exceptional, the rooms are very nice, location is fantastic - what more could you want? A very special thank you to both Beatrice and Cynthia. You have made our trip far more enjoyable due to both of your customer service delivery. We will continue to always stay in the Sandymount anytime we're in Dublin in the future.",5,2023,04,06

Great hotel facilities and friendly helpful staff ",5,2023,04,06
247,Nice but not worth the money,"The hotel location is good for the Avivia stadium. rooms nice but not worth the price being charged

247,A little gem,Having stayed at the Sandymount Hotel for over 20 years the standard and quality of stay has consistently been high.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming.  It is in such a handy location with the Dart just up the road and an enjoyable 25 minute walk to St Stephen’s Green.  Sandymount village is a 10 minute walk and of course the Avila stadium is just 2 minutes away.,5,2023,03,31
247,To be avoided,"This has to off been the most disappointing four star hotel I have ever stayed in, I’ve been to three star hotels that are way better than this hotel, our room was very small, the bed was a small double, the noise from out on the corridor was non stop, outside noice stated early in the mot with the crashing noice of bottles been sorted by staff, on a Sunday morning, we got a stand alone wardrobe, that was so full with ironing board , iron, spare blankets, it was not possible to hang our clothes. The wrapping was peeling off . On a positive note, all the staff were lovely and friendly, I complained the next morning to the manager, but I was wasting my time, he really didn’t appear to not, a hot that is totally over priced, it’s pretty much in the middle of nowhere. To be avoided as there is a lot better three star hotels in dublin, never again",2,2023,03,31

When we arrived on theFriday evening the car park was full (there was a function on at the hotel) but we parked in the road outside without any problems.

Hotel staff were lovely and helpful, the restaurant served gorgeous food, and the ambience was  welcoming.

My criticism was that the bed and pillows were too firm for my liking, and the water pressure in the shower was poor.  We were in a standard room.

However, we would happily stay there again, but possibly upgrade to a better room if there is availability.",4,2023,01,09
247,"Great room, great location","Very spacious (executive king), comfortable, clean and quiet room.  Highly recommended.  The only thing they need to work on is the service at Reception, which is not what is shown on their website (ie friendly).",4,2023,01,07

Beata keeps us fed and watered but all of the staff are fantastic and nothing is too much trouble. Great location beside the AVIVA Stadium and easy walk to town and the surrounding areas with the DART on the doorstep. Their carpark is free for residents which is a huge bonus for us. We would highly recommend a stay in the Executive Rooms, which have been newly refurbished and are just beautiful and so comfortable. Every stay we have had has been absolutely brilliant and we just love going back! ",5,2022,12,20
247,"An historical building, comfortable but not unforgettable.","The hotel is a nice old building, more horizontal than vertical, with some strange corridors and a bit labyrinthic. The position is far from downtown, serving more the Aviva Stadium area. My room was unfortunately at 1 level, meaning -1 in the elevator, half underground, facing the parked cars in the internal courtyard. A bit sad. Given that, the room furniture was ok, the bed comfortable and the bathroom small but modern. I tried the restaurant once and the food was good. The common spaces are well maintained. The insulation between the rooms could be better. Service was kind.",4,2022,12,20

The room I was in counldn't have been better, really clean and tidy and nicely decorated. There was everything I needed in the room as well, TV, telephone, clean bath towels, toiletries and a kettle with everything needed to make tea and coffee. The bed was luxurious and very comfortable. The service I got in the restaraunt was really good too. The food was top class and really well presented on the plate.

247,Bit Warm Like,"Bit warm like. The gravy was lashing off me in that room there. Saying that half of Derry was staying there and about 10 of them were booked in so. But here, lash in an old fan in the rooms or stick in a wee bit of Air Con into the room. Bit mad saying a gaff in Ireland is warm in November. Belter location for the Aviva all the same. Pints were beaut. Bit too nice. Not a big fan of that plastic glass carry on though. Grub was lovely too to be fair, but I think they must have spilled half of my chips or something. Or they ran out. Definitely stay in it again though.",4,2022,11,14

We were able to walk to the 3arena, which took about 20minutes. Breakfast was excellent and staff couldn't have been more attentive. We checked out early so we could go shopping in the centre, again we walked but the Dart station is very close. We had asked about leaving our car in the car park and this was not a problem.

247,"Great hotel, friendly and accommodating staff in a quieter part of town","+ The location of the hotel is slightly outside of Dublin centre with accessible train links within a 2-minute walk from the Sandymount Hotel. The hotel was well presented with super friendly staff who were happy to help with any queries and were able to share their knowledge on the local area quite well. Furthermore, staff assisted with booking taxi's to the airport, arranging takeaway deliveries to the hotel and storing luggage before and after check in which was greatly appreciated. In the room there were multiple streaming services available which provided something different to standard Freeview options in other hotels. The rooms were of a good standard, clean and catered for all of our needs. Additionally, the cleaners did an excellent job.

- There was not much that we did not like during our stay the most notable were the price of breakfast which was quite high, so we opted to travel into the city centre to find an alternative which ate up time during out visit. During one night of the stay, the consumer unit near the front door was making a loud buzzing noise all night which did cause some slight annoyance. ",5,2022,11,02

The rooms are clean and comfortable.
The restaurant has a nice menu, but choice is limited for people with dietary requirements.

The location is perfect for those who want easy access to the the Dublin City centre but still want that homely village feel. Sandymount is a gorgeous village with the loveliest people. 

Shout out to Beatrice who helped me so much during my stay and made sure I had everything I needed. 

While this trip was for business, I can’t wait to revisit Dublin and stay here again later this year with my partner. ",5,2022,10,12
247,Calm and convenient,"Sandymount is a great hotel. Rooms are smaller than what I'm used to in the US, but they have free bottles of water in the room for you! No fridge or microwave so it was hard to keep our leftovers. Free onsite parking. Breakfast was hot and delicious. ",4,2022,10,11

247,My Favourite,"I always return to this hotel, I stayed here twice in September, once on my own and the second time as a catch up with two friends. They have spared nothing in upgrading and the décor is simply beautiful. The beds & bedrooms are just so comfortable and immaculate ( I always judge a hotel by the comfort of the bed & bedding ). I had food on both occasions, one a lunch and one a dinner and each was so delicious and served by very friendly & helpful staff. The cocktails are rather nice too...... very moreish. I always receive the friendliest of welcomes and this time again Beatrice & Rose were there & made time for their usual friendly chat. The outside has been beautifully done to allow you to have a sit, a chat and a coffee, whether on your own or in company and you are only a stones throw away from the most beautiful walks or into town. This is my go to place in Dublin and it never fails me. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. I have been going back for the past 34 years and will continue to do so.",5,2022,10,03

247,Fantastic Stay,"Have stayed at the Sandymount twice now and is probably the best Hotel experience I have had globally. The rooms are cleaned daily and when not able to clean a package with fresh towels and water is left at the door for your comfort...never had this before
In particular the receptionist Bee was always helpful and took the time to make sure everything was to my liking...incredible customer service. Also the Bar Manager Kieron would do all he could to make my stay enjoyable
Brilliant and very highly recommended",5,2022,09,30
247,Sandymount is TOPS in Dublin,"Reputation and location are key elements to staying at the Sandymount Hotel on Herbert Road and it's proximity to the Avva Stadium is a big advantage.
The breakfast is superb and the food in general at lunch or dinner is top class.
It's the ideal spot for a pre-match bite to eat before a soccer or a rugby match and I use it all the time now.

We enjoyed the full Irish breakfast and friendly service from the hotel staff. The hotel is quiet and away from the crowds and noise of the Temple Bar district. We arrived in the morning after an overnight flight and asked to store our luggage until time for check-in. However, our room was already available so we were able to check in early for no additional charge!",5,2022,09,03
247,ROOM BROKEN INTO,"Very nice hotel. Great proximity to Aviva Stadium. Staff is very friendly but given the affluent area, this makes travelers easy targets. DO NOT STAY ON THE FIRST FLOOR.

The Hotel sits opposite the iconic Aviva Stadium and is a 5 minute Dart ride into the heart if the City.

247,Back to my Home from Home…,After working from home for the last two years my work has found me back up in Dublin again. I am delighted to say that the friendly faces and the excellent service of the Sandymount staff has not changed over that time. Ideally located near a dart station with good parking facilities and an EV charger for those of us gone electric. A hotel like Sandymount makes working away from home that little bit easier.,5,2022,08,22

It is very easily reachable to the city center by train that is just a few steps away. It is a very beautiful locality. The hotel staff is very nice and the restaurants are very attractive to sit in with delicious food. This is a place for all including business travelers, tourists and family visits. If you are first time coming to Dublin and it difficult for you to choose where to stay, Sandymount Hotel is no doubt worth giving a try.. It will not disappoint you. I liked staying at this hotel.",5,2022,08,13
247,Line out bar,Amazing cocktails by Leo. Service and friendliness from Lee as well ! Worth the visit. Atmosphere and music on point. Very clean and tidy hotel. Bea and Leo on reception will always make you laugh with their jokes.,5,2022,08,12

247,Class of 80 reunion,"To John Loughran and his team, (especially Toni Farrell,) from the reception staff to the bar staff, the diningroom staff and your night porter, can I say a thousand thanks for an outstanding night in the Sandymount of Friday night last.
The service we all got could not be beaten, ANYWHERE!
The food was fantastic, so much so that some of the lads who stayed for 2 nights, decided to eat in the hotel on Saturday night, rather than head out to a restaurant, the food was that good.
The room I got was so comfortable and added to the whole ethos of a wonderful night.
Everyone of the lads I have spoken to since our event have said how wonderful the hotel was, so on their behalf, 
míle buicheas for a terrific service and welcome.
Scal.",5,2022,08,03
247,Class of 80.,"An absolutely fantastic night was had by myself and 40 of my friends on Fri 29th in the Sandymount where the welcoming hospitality stared with the owner, John Loughran and percolated down, through every member of staff.

A fantastic hotel, properly run with fantastic staff.
Sure what else could a person want.
Highly recommended.",5,2022,08,01

247,Overnight stay,"Stayed a Saturday night. Travelling from Belfast was easy to get too through the tunnel, no traffic to contend with. On arrival you can park in their private car park.  The hotel is a collection of houses brought together. There are currently renovations being carried out. However I never heard any noise whatsoever. Checking in was quick and pleasant. Going to the room was through a relatively narrow passage. Our room was 3** and over looking Herbert Road.  Our room was an Executive.  The room is modern, spacious with a good sized bathroom. Nothing to complain about here.  We were going to a show in town so we didn’t have dinner in the hotel.  For those of you going to a match/concert/convention in the Aviva Stadium it is only a five minute walk. 

After our show and a few drinks we decided to walk back to the hotel. From the top of Grafton Street it took about 40 minutes.  We went to the bar for a few nightcaps. There is an outside area which overlooks a garden area. The bar is in keeping with style of the houses that make up the hotel.

Breakfast was the traditional Irish breakfast buffet style.  Plenty available with a selection of chilled and hot foods.  No cranberry juice on show show but was brought to my table promptly. Plenty of staff on hand to assist with any requests and to clear tables.  

Checkout was quick and we were on our way. Overall our stay at the Sandymount was a great experience. Good value as far as Dublin hotels go with the added bonus of off road parking. 

Would I stay again. Absolutely, I’d like to thank the staff for making our stay a good experience albeit a short stay.",5,2022,07,29
247,Birthday Treat,"Just back from the Sandymount and have to say lovely hotel if you don't mind staying a bit further out of the city,the dart is only around the corner and will take you into the city if you want to go there saves you looking for car parks.",4,2022,07,24
247,Ideal place to stay for our purposes,"This 4 star hotel is located in Sandymount a surprisingly quiet district just 3 kilometres from St Stephens Green, Dublin. It has developed as a family run business by linking several large villa style houses with extra space added to the rear.  Rooms are comfortable, clean and well supplied. There is a comfortable bar and  restaurant with glazed out door terrace, garden and on site carparking. Dublin City centre is best accessed from Lansdowne Road Dart station 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Sandymount Village (10 minutes walk) is a little oasis with a great little bookshop, a deli/cafe, pub and restaurants. Sandymount Strand is a great place to walk with coastal panoramas  and strong Joycean connections.",5,2022,07,20
247,A gem in the city,"An interesting layout with quirky features and lovely decor. Comfortable rooms and bathrooms. Great location and parking, value for money. Exceptional staff, very helpful and friendly. Great breakfast. Have stayed before and will stay again. ",5,2022,07,19
247,Lovely hotel in Sandymount,Very very nice hotel . The staff is very nice and accommodating.  There is no AC here which was only an issue as we are here in July and it has been extremely warm. Fan was provided.   Close walk to Sandymount village. Lovely trip. I’d highly recommend if you can do without AC,5,2022,07,19
247,Very good,"Was staying for concert, great location, nice friendly staff, only issue I had was that steps at front are very steep, could use a slope for carrying up luggage. Not a great selection on the menu for dinner either 
",5,2022,07,11
247,Gary,"Great hotel and friendly, helpful staff.  Brilliant location especially for events in Aviva Stadium.Great atmosphere before concert with music and bbq and complementary snacks afterwards.  Couldn't have asked for anything more. ",5,2022,07,11
247,Ideal for Concerts in the Aviva,"This was an ideal place to stay for the Westlife concert in the Aviva. 
Not only was it a 2 minute walk away - they had a brilliant set up outside with burgers and pints before hand. Plenty of staff on hand to ensure all ran smoothly.  The burgers were delicious and food and drink was reasonably priced. 

We stayed in a triple room- was perfect for what we needed. 

On returning from the concert there was complimentary goujons and chips provided in the bar which was a great touch- as we were starving! 

Breakfast the following morning was of high quality and again the staff did a great job- very friendly and efficient. 

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,07,11
247,A disappointing dining experience,"Dined at the restaurant on a busy Saturday evening with three children before attending a concert at the Aviva which is literally only a minutes walk from the hotel. Whilst appreciating it was a busier evening than most at the hotel, unfortunately our dining experience was very poor. We were assigned a table and given menus on arrival at 18:00 but despite asking two different staff members to take our orders, this was not done until 18:30. Children’s menu included a drink, main and dessert option for €12.95. The adult main (chicken burger) was €17.95. The fries were cool on arrival and while the burgers tasted good, presentation was poor with no side salad or garnish. We had to wait another 5 minutes for cutlery and sauces. No one came to clear our plates or offer dessert so we asked for the kids ice cream on payment and ate it on the run. A nearby party told us they had been waiting more than an hour for their desserts. There were plenty of staff on duty and lots of free tables by the time we were dining so it’s a shame our experience was so disappointing. A good supervisor could have directed the staff who appeared quite inexperienced, to more efficient and effective customer service. The hotel was immaculately clean with a good atmosphere in the bar and outdoor area for those having drinks, toilets were spotless. There was complimentary tea and coffee in the foyer.",2,2022,07,10
247,Best hotel ever!!,"It was away from Dublin but close enough to not be an issue due to train very close by. Upon entering we immediately felt at home. Hotel was clean, fresh, up to date but not so much it lacked charm. Lady (didn't catch her name) who signed us in had been at the hotel for  a very long time and her dedication, care to us and knowledge showed her devotion to the hotel. When we went to the restaurant we were met with 3 of the nicest servers I think we've ever had!! Giulia was warm and kind, seated us immediately and made us feel so comfortable. Leo was a delight and fun to speak with as he went here and there helping in anyway he could with each area of the restaurant. Eralp was new but definitely added joy to our dinner with his sweet, calm demeanor. They were such a delight and if we lived in Ireland it would definitely be on our top places to eat because of their awesome hospitality. We loved them and hope they are treated as well as they treated us!! Looking forward to our next visit to Ireland so we will be able to visit Sandymount again.",5,2022,07,09
247,Peaceful hotel in Dublin,"Sandymount Hotel was a wonderful surprise. We booked on short notice, and nothing in the city center was available. It turned out to be a perfect choice, though. Very accessible to the center either by the DART train or on foot, and located in a quiet, leafy residential area that was so nice to return to at night. The breakfast was good, and reasonably priced. Both the restaurant and bar have outdoor seating options which we enjoyed. The room itself was comfortable, with all the usual features. All the front desk and dining staff were really friendly and helpful. We had a great stay!",5,2022,07,05
247,Excellent stay,"Staff is extremely friendly and helpful, Rooms are very clean.
The location of the hotel is very convenient. I stayed there for 7 days for business trip and overall an excellent experience. Highly recommended ",5,2022,07,05
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Nice hotel, expected a little better than what we got, perhaps if you book direct than with a hotel booking website you would get a better room. Although it wasn’t hot weather the room given was stifling with only a small desk fan provided to try and move the air about ",3,2022,07,04
247,Overpriced,"The hotel is very well located near the stadium with a very good connection by train to the city centre. The room was very clean an well equipped, but the insulation of the door towards the floor was very poor, also the insulation to the neighbouring rooms could be better.
Being bikers we chose the hotel for it's guarded parking lot.
As in may hotels in Dublin  the price is unreasonably high. For the price we paid for a double room I'd at least expect a well equipped fitness room and a sauna.
",3,2022,07,02
247,Very happy overall,"I stayed here for a business trip in June. It was booked by our company so I didn’t have any dealings with the booking process. I was driving to the hotel and it was such a pleasure to drive up to a barrier in a Dublin hotel and for it to simply lift up and not have to pre arrange. There was ample and safe parking which was fantastic. Getting from the car park into the hotel was very well signposted and easy and getting to my room was very well sign posted too considering two lifts and plenty of stairs, but so well done considering the space constraints. I ate in the restaurant, food was lovely, choice wasn’t huge. Staff were friendly and possibly being trained in but there were plenty of trained people there. Room was clean, cosy and safe. No AC - that I was aware of but it wouldn’t have been an concern only it was a warm night. Overall I would def recommend for a trip to Dublin for families, business and definitely for something in the Aviva or the RDS.",4,2022,07,01
247,Friendly and helpful staff,"Even before arriving at the sandymount for our stay the staff were very helpful, and once we arrived they were always ready to lend a hand or a word of advice; which was fantastic as we weren't oberly familiar with the Dublin area.

We also found that the room was to an excellent standard with plenty of added luxurious features, most importantly of course the bed which was incredibly comfortable.

A huge thanks to the Sandymount hotel for making our stay a memorable one.",5,2022,07,01
247,Great stay,"Stayed on recommendation from a friend who actually booked for us because we where going to a concert, great place no problems and superb service , the chicken and chip when we got back from the concert was a welcome surprise, brilliant ",5,2022,06,29

247,Lovely stay,"Excellent hotel, right next door to Aviva Stadium. Friendly helpful staff. Enjoyed breakfast and evening meal even though we had not pre booked the staff found a table for us. Clean and tidy everywhere. We would definitely stay again. ",5,2022,06,28
247,Excellent spot to stay in Dublin...even if you're not there for the rugby,"Unfortunately, I had only one night scheduled in Dublin and on the advice of a local friend, chose the Sandymount Hotel.  I needed somewhere to park my car and the Sandymount had a very convenient car park.  That was my main reason for booking here but I got so much more. My room was very comfortable and quiet.  The staff and the service were exceptional.  The full Irish breakfast was indeed full and Irish.  I didn't have time to try out their gym or their bar but I'm sure that they are also top class.  The hotel is a quick walk from Sandymount Village which has a Tesco in case you need to pick up any necessities...like biscuits (cookies for Americans).  If you're a rugby fan, I don't think you can get anywhere closer to Aviva Stadium.  It's right there.  I will definitely stay here again when next I need a hotel in Dublin...and ideally for more than just one night.",5,2022,06,28
247,Sandymount Hotel review,A great family run hotel which goes the extra mile in ensuring happy guests. For example we were staying there to attend a concert in the Aviva Stadium and when we returned there was complimentary food laid on in the bar for all residents. A great gesture. Also the breakfast is great value and quality fantastic. The location is brilliant for any event in the Aviva Stadium or getting the DART into Dublin city centre. Staff are very friendly and professional. Great family run hotel. ,5,2022,06,27
247,"Good location, not worth the value, friendly staff","The location of this venue was very good for going to a show at the aviva stadium or going in to the city centre as the train station was only 5 minutes down the road. On the other hand the room was very average for the price we paid for it, our room was so warm we were given a fan but it did not help and we had the window open our whole stay. The only good thing about the room was the tv and that you could access Netflix, YouTube and much more. Not sure if we would stay again but staff was very friendly and happy to help with anything and answer any questions we asked. ",3,2022,06,26

Charged for Non Alcoholic Drink!!!! €6!!! They can charge for them.... But they don't do them???
Breakfast was disgusting!!! Paid €25.90 for 2 floppy croissants!!! Went to Browne's (10min walk away) the second morning instead was fabulous 👌
Beatrice at reception and the 2 young gentlemen in the upstairs bar on the Sat night are the only saving grace for the staff at this hotel.

247,Great experience!,"Friendly staff, always asking if our stay is going well, what we planned on seeing around Dublin, etc. The reception had lots of helpful suggestions for transport, pubs, and even things to do outside of the city center.

Close to the Aviva stadium which has a tour if you want a trip closer by and you can also catch the Dart to Dublin Centre outside the Aviva stadium and the Dart take 5 minutes to get there.

Overall it was just what we hoped to find!",5,2022,05,02

247,The only place in Dublin we’ll stay,"The Sandymount is in a beautiful part of Dublin, not too far from the centre but quiet and restful. As a large family hotel it is a perfect alternative to the anonymous multinational hotel chains. The rooms are large, spotlessly clean and comfortable. The food is really high quality. The staff though are fantastic. They really make you feel like a guest rather than a number. Having the owner introduce himself and ask if everything was ok before we checked out was a lovely gesture as well. Highly recommended.",5,2022,04,07

No air conditioning so ask for a fan. Only let down was the reception staff. Checking in/out was terrible. Reception staff were not friendly and unprofessional. No warm welcome and a poor first impression of the hotel.",4,2022,03,30
247,Good location,We stayed here while attending a match in the Aviva and you can't fault the location however the price we paid was that of a 5* hotel and the service and quality certainly didn't match that. The food was very average both for dinner and breakfast and the service while not bad wasn't really great.,3,2022,03,29
247,Soccer Trip,Excellent Hotel. Really enjoyed stay. Staff very friendly. Food Excellent. Location excellent. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Everything went to plan. I would definately stay here again. No complaints at all. ,5,2022,03,29
247,Excellent service!,"We have just come back from our 2 night stay at Sandymount & had a great stay. 
Sandy mount is close to Dublin City centre and a 10 minute walk from a beautiful village and beach. 
Beatrice was able to give us lots of information about the area and recommended that we walk to the village which we thoroughly enjoyed. She has also help when directing us to the city centre & told us the easy train route into the city centre which saved us money on a cab! Beatrice gave us excellent customer service throughout our weekend stay and was extremely helpful. Thank you! 
From Amber & Jacob :)",5,2022,03,28
247,Always a pleasure,"No matter how busy the hotel is, the staff are great.  Very professional and courteous.  The rooms are always spotless and the housekeeping crew are very helpful if anything extra is needed.  The food at Whitty's Restaurant was top notch again which a lot of options (the pear and walnut salad is really nice!).  Whilst masks are no longer mandatory, all the staff wore them and there were still hand santising stations in place at various locations within the hotel.",5,2022,03,28

247,Great hotel,"This hotel is a wonderful one tucked away in a quiet nice neighborhood, it was nice to be away from the city center of Dublin, but at the same time there’s a tram station close by to take you to city center easily. Rooms and property were very clean and very helpful staff at every point along my trip. ",5,2022,03,23
247,Average stay,"This hotel is nice but not worthy of 4 stars. The decor is stylish but there was such a food smell as soon as you walk in and also in the area by Reception, it's not pleasant to sit in. The rooms are modern but quite old (creaky beds and floors etc. but it might depend on which part of the hotel you stay in). There was no leaflet/brochure in the bedroom about check-out times, breakfast, dinner etc. It's a good 30/40 minute walk to the town centre, pretty easy route though and nice enough if the suns shining! Would recommend based on value for money and if your happy being slightly further out of the busyness of the city. ",3,2022,03,23

Really convenient to head up to the city centre. ",5,2022,03,21
247,Short Break,Very nice hotel in a quiet location (exception would be if there is an event in the nearby Sports Stadium)  with ready access to city centre via nearby city rail service. Free on-site parking. Friendly and efficient staff and the hotel is spotlessly clean and well maintained. Very good breakfast available from a well stocked buffet. We have stayed here a number of times for one or two night breaks in Dublin and have never had cause for complaint. In terms of hotel standard and location it generally offers very good value for money.,5,2022,03,18
247,Ticks all the boxes,Fabulous family run hotel that as everything and more for a short ir long stay. The reception staff are particularly amazing. With Ballsbridge a gentle walk along the Dodder and the City centre literally 5 mins away in the Dart it is in a perfect position. ,5,2022,03,18
247,A great stay in a great hotel! ,"We stayed here as a group on 16th March. The customer service from the outset was fantastic. We had drinks in the bar, and dinner in the restaurant before heading to a gig in the 3arena.(10 minute drive) 
The lady at reception (I can't remember her name) tried her best to get us a taxi but none were available. So they very kindly dropped us over in the Courtesy mini bus! Both the lady at reception, and the lady that drove us over were just so so lovely, and really did their level best to look after us. We walked back to the hotel after the gig which was only about 25 minutes!
Breakfast the following morning was a lovely buffet in the restaurant, again all staff were very attentive.
The location of the hotel is ideal as it is right beside the aviva, and Dart.
The price of the room and breakfast was really very good for the location also and considering it was the night before St. Patricks day!
Would highly recommend to anyone travelling to Dublin and will definitely be back again. 
Thank you again to all the staff we met! 10/10!",5,2022,03,17
247,Just fabulous service,"I simply cannot say enough good things about the service and staff here at Sandymount. Everyone was not only friendly but went beyond expectations. Bridget (I think) at the front desk was just so lovely. Even when helping another staff. 
The staff are obviously genuinely fond of their regular guest and it was so lovely to see such consistently excellent service to everyone. 
Rooms were lovely and clean. Food was really great (Rocky road ice cream Sunday!!)

We stayed in The Sandymount Hotel for the recent Ireland vs Italy game and this hotel has the best location when attending matches and gigs in the Aviva. The hotel is a short 3 minute walk from the stadium with free guest parking. There was such a great buzz around the hotel ahead of the game.

A 2 minute walk to the stadium entrance. From my check in (which was well in advance of the normal check in time), to how the staff dealt with queries, to the breakfast quality and service - I recommend this hotel most highly. At a time when service seems to be dipped across the hospitality industry in general, the Sandymount Hotel was a breath of fresh air.

Great location for a start. 
Dinner was very tasty and the portions were large. Same again at breakfast. My wife's Full Irish was big enough for two people! 
The staff were so helpful and pleasant at dinner and breakfast. The receptionist that checked me in needs to be more sociable but the others were great, especially the lady that was working last night.
We had a very spacious family room. Very clean with all the accessories you could need.
We will be back.",5,2021,12,31

Dined in the hotel restaurant on one night and the food was excellent as were the staff. The hotel is situated in a lovely area of Dublin close to Sandymount village. ",4,2021,12,09
247,Very good,"Excellent Hotel. A bit disappointed about the training room. It was tiny and a bit claustrophobic. there were only 3 machines in it. Be great if it was more spacious and pleasant to be in, with extra training material",4,2021,12,05
247,A great find!,A great value hotel in a super location. The staff were helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The RDS was only a short walk away. Would definitely return to explore the area a little more. ,5,2021,12,01
247,Excellent service all round,We travelled from England for a dance convention and found the staff to be extremely helpful-couldn't do enough for us. From cleaning staff to reception the service was excellent throughout our stay .,5,2021,11,30
247,Fab for concerts and events,"We had a concert to attend and wanted somewhere within walking distance that we could park at without any worries.  This was perfect.  It is just over a 20 minute walk from the 3arena, and is just next to the aviva stadium.  The staff are lovely and friendly and the rooms are great.  Perfect. ",5,2021,11,24
247,Great Welcome,"Great Location and great secure parking.

25 minutes walk into City Centre .  Dining room needs an upgrade , great for a weekend trip to Dublin and its a 5 star location for any events at the Aviva Staduuim. ",4,2021,11,18
247,Another excellent stay,"Staying at the Sandymount Hotel is always a pleasure. The staff are fantastic, the food is consistently excellent and the hotel is always spotless.  They have had fantastic measures in place during Covid and it is so good to be back with the hotel now that everywhere is open again.  I have my room booked for stays in February and March and I can't wait to be back in what my friends and I call our second home.  ",5,2021,11,16
247,Stay at Sandymount November 2021,"Excellent staff, good rooms and great location for the Aviva stadium.On site parking is good. Well managed during a busy weekend stay for the Rugby International. Also a good breakfast and simple check out. ",5,2021,11,16
247,Super Location,"It was a joy to stay at the Sandymount Hotel for the Rugby, the location is excellent. The staff were wonderful throughout a very busy day.

247,Nice stay,Brief overnight stay for my wife and I.  The location was perfect and the hotel was very accommodating to our needs.We were possibly not there long enough to provide an accurate assessment but our stay could not be faulted. We would definitely consider staying here again in future.,4,2021,11,13
247,Rugby weekend,We stayed here because it is so handy for the Aviva stadium and because they really create a great atmosphere when there is a rugby international on. Staff are pleasant and helpful. Food was good but lacked choice if you don't like a lot of red meat or burger type food. I had fish and chips. The fish and batter were lovely but would have preferred the lamb which they had on the menu for the following day. ,5,2021,11,10
247,The best spot in Dublin,After coming across this gem of a hotel through corporate travel I have now continued to return with friends and family as well as stay for business. It is a hotel like no other with style and elegance and a real homely and relaxing approach to their guests. For concerts or sports events at Aviva no other hotel matches it but for a stylish comfortable base in Dublin it can’t be beaten! I have even had dinner the last 2 times we stayed which was delicious and enjoyed by family and friends! The best ever. Round of applause Team Sandymount.,5,2021,11,10

247,Hassle free trip in The sandymount,"The staff in The Sandymount are very pleasant and helpful, from the reservation right through to my departure, eager to assist and made my experience enjoyable and hassle free. Ideal location to the rail line and is only a half hour stroll to Grafton Street. Room was clean and bright, well stocked with tea making facilities. I would strongly recommend this hotel and consider it good value",4,2021,11,08
247,Family Stay,Fantastic location.  Very friendly staff.  Lovely hotel that had lots of charm.  Bedrooms very nice but rooms at the back a little dark as very close to building at the back.  Breakfast the best we have had in a long time.  ,5,2021,11,02
247,A lovely Hotel,"Sandymount Hotel is in a beautiful area if your not looking the hustle of city life, it was perfect for our family. There's a beautiful village just a short work from Hotel with bars ,restaurants and a few shops. We decided to use the hotel restaurant for our evening meal which was excellent could not fault it .. as one of our children has a food allergy the staff was more than accommodating.. would definitely recommend ",5,2021,11,01

Parking is great which makes a huge difference. I would highly recommend this lovely hotel,5,2021,10,29
247,Good,"Three stars is perhaps  a little mean……I would rate it as 3.5.  It was a nice hotel, in an upmarket area p, close to city, and (most important for us) just fifteen minute drive to Stena line ferry terminal (for early morning ferry departure). Very good parking which is a real plus and the hotel is in good condition and certainly clean and well maintained. The staff we met were courteous and helpful. The room was ok,  rather on small size and the bathroom - although pristine and had everything needed - was the smallest hotel bathroom we have ever seen. There are plenty of eateries nearby and as leaving very early didn’t have time to sample the breakfast.",3,2021,10,27
247,EXCELLENT,Recently stayed here again and another great experience. From front of house staff to restaurant staff was what a hotel should be about. From deduction on bill due to what they perceived was slow service. Will soon be back.,5,2021,10,27
247,Great location and service,"This was our first time to stay at this hotel. The reservations manager Claire was so friendly and helpful when booking. Location is excellent, a few mins walk from the Aviva. The staff were very attentive and we couldn’t fault dinner/breakfast. The rooms were comfortable and clean.

247,Lovely individual hotel,"We chose the Sandymount for location, comfortable rooms (ie not just a ‘box’) and parking facilities. Travelled to Dublin to watch CP Scotland football team but hired a car and were able to take in lansdowne Rd, the Guinness factory tour, a meal in Castle Market area, walked round Temple Bar & The Liffey thereafter too. Breakfasts were fabulous both in choice and freshness and the snack of chicken wings we had one night in the restaurant were delicious too. Packed so much into a 48 hour period helped by the location of the hotel & stress free parking 😊",5,2021,10,19
247,Sandmount,Room was comfortable and spotless. Reception staff friendly and very helpful. Hotel in a good location and upmarket area. Close to Dart and local pubs are a short walk away.Only stayed one night as travelling on Ferry the next morning. Convenient for the Ferry Port.,4,2021,10,18
247,Complaint,"We booked a double room and we were put in a room that had the smallest double bed I ever seen, it was a 4ft there was also a single bed in the room.
The room looked like a hostel room very disappointed with.
I went to reception to mention the bed size and was met with a complete contradiction about the size of the bed she insisted it was normal standard size but it was a small double 4 ft.
Then when leaving she charged me for the meal that I had already paid for which I had to stand and wait for her to credit my card which she didn't know how to do.
She was not a very nice person and I don't know have a hotel can have someone like with no people skills on reception.
This was our second time staying, we really enjoyed the first time we stayed but we won't be staying again.
Thanks
Patrick",2,2021,10,17
247,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is fabulous! Staff are great, giving a warm welcome and provided lots of info regarding our stay in dublin and onwards travel around ireland. I mentioned that my husband was celebrating his birthday and a bottle of prosecco was sent to our room 10 mins afterwards.
Rooms are great, booked an executive room, had lots of space, loved the Dyson hairdryer, seating area, robes, iron and ironing board all in room.
Food - breakfast was amazing, lots of choice and good standard, again staff were brilliant.
Hotel bar was nice, good atmosphere.

247,Great stay,"Lovely hotel with free parking with plenty of spaces. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast options were good and lunch and dinner was delicious. Only thing about dinner was I wish there was more options for desserts. A few of the desserts had nuts in them which couldn't be removed which was disappointing. Apart from that stay was great with friendly staff, good rooms and great location.",4,2021,10,14

247,Great location and convenience,"The Sandymount Hotel is in a great location. Close to Aviva Stadium, it is a quiet neighbourhood when a match is not on and an easy walk to shops and restaurants. We appreciate the free, convenient parking and also the free no-hassle wi-fi. The restaurant is very good, and everyone we dealt with was very friendly and eager to help.",5,2021,10,04
247,Very good clean hotel,Very good location near aviva stadium. Free car parking. Very good rooms but no air conditioning. Breakfast Very good. Evening meal very good but once you finish your main meal waiting staff very hard to get attention if you want dessert or coffee. All in all  though very good value for money. ,4,2021,09,28
247,Stay Sept 2021,"Lovely service from the start, needed to check in early, no problem. Perfect location as was able to walk to family. Breakfast had so much choice and very tasty.

247,A gem off the beaten path,"Friendly, helpful staff. Good restaurant. Nice room. It's a little out of the way, but if you buy a LEAP pass you can use the DART train to get to the town center. The station is a short walk from the hotel, and the town center is just two stops away. On site parking is handy.",5,2021,09,24
247,Gem of a Hotel - Wonderful service and location !,"The hotel has the perfect combination of tradition a with a modern twist ..it has a great outside area with seating for lunch or a coffee .....I chose an Executive Room - it was roomy & comfortable, with Smart TV including Netflix, coffee maker and also a Dyson hairdryer!   You are welcomed front of house by a friendly and very professional reception team and they can help with any questions on the local area or wider Dublin Tourist information.  The local area Sandymount has a lovely village about 10-15 minutes walk away and from there it is only another 10 minutes walk to sea at Sandymount Strand.   If you wish to go into the city the local Dart (train) is 5 minutes walk from the hotel and only a short hop into town.  All in all a great family owned hotel in a perfect location
",5,2021,09,20
247,Sean,"Superb courteous and efficient staff throughout the hotel. Breakfast buffet was delightful. A couple of hours after checking out, I received a call asking if I had lost a sum of money and some personal documents. At this stage I had not realised, I had left in the room, which had been found by the person changing for the next guests. The caller stated that they knew I was happy with my stay but the amount left seemed more that a thank you tip. All of the staff were superb and honest too. This is an example of an old style Irish Family run hospitality hotel. I will be back on my next visit to Dublin.  *****",5,2021,09,19
247,Great experience,This is a really lovely hotel. From the minute we checked in until we left we felt very comfortable. The receptionist was excellent and very helpful.

247,Great location -Friendly Staff,"Recently stayed at the Sandymount Hotel upon arrival in Dublin. The staff was very friendly and helpful with tips for getting around the city. The room was spacious and it was very clean, as was the whole hotel. The restaurant staff were also friendly and the food was excellent, including the lovely full breakfast.

I would highly recommend the Sandymount Hotel. ",5,2021,09,15
247,Wonderful Hotel,"I've stayed at the Sandymount five times in recent years and can advise that it is a great place to stay in Dublin.  Close to the Aviva stadium, a Dart station and the village of Sandymount.  The staff are fantastic, they serve vegan food (the peach salad is great!) and there's never any hassle checking in or out.  Thoroughly recommended.",5,2021,09,13
247,Perfect location for a city or coast break - Highly recommend,"We loved our stay at The Sandymount.  We booked a King suite - worth the extra money - and our room was very spacious and comfortable, light filled and decorated in calm, muted tones.  The staff are a credit to the hotel and were all so welcoming and friendly.  It’s a big hotel but had the personal touch that made it  a real family run hotel.  The location could not be better - in a lovely leafy suburb but with easy, quick access to both city and coast.  With the benefit of the free parking, a huge bonus for a city hotel, we left the car at the hotel and used the Dart to easily access the city centre and to explore the coast from Dalkey to Bray.  Highly recommend this hotel and we look forward to returning soon.",5,2021,09,13
247,Fantastic,We had an amazing night. Fabulous hotel food and bedroom. Staff are sooo friendly and helpful. I'd like to mention Beatrice thank you for making are stay so nice and relaxing we will definitely be back.,5,2021,09,12
247,"4.5 stars, amazing customer service","If I could give this hotel a 4.5 I would.

The customer service is exceptional. We travelled for medical reasons and required a fridge for our medication. We emailed ahead and it was in the room when we arrived. I also asked for an extension lead for our firestick as there was only one socket where the TV was, again, it was no hassle. I didn't get the lady's name but the lady at reception with blonde hair/glasses was so welcoming and asked throughout the proceeding days how our trip was going.

We also had breakfast on one of the days, again, it was great.

The only reason for the 4 star rating was a bit of wear and tear in the room. Vanity units with the paint stripped off and the curtains ripped (see photos attached). I understand this is a family run hotel, please take good care of the rooms state. The customer service on its on is worth 4 stars, don't let the room state stop you hitting 5 stars! Thank you for a great stay, we will return again soon.",4,2021,09,10
247,Wished. we’d Been Staying Longer,"Had such a friendly welcome (quite unusual these days) to this clean, comfortable hotel which is in a great location. Picked it for its proximity to the ferry terminal but would definitely come back again for a longer stay. Good food too.",5,2021,09,08

247,Fantastic hotel,"Brilliant staff, location, rooms, and overall stay. Will recommend to anyone looking for a beautiful and quiet neighborhood to relax in while in Dublin. Right next to Aviva stadium, which gets exciting during matches. The Dart (tram) station is just around the corner, along with various other small towns like Ballsbridge and RIngsend/Irishtown. Easy stroll to the city center and more. We definitely lucked out finding this place!",5,2021,09,05
247,Good location for coastal stay outside city centre,"Good location for those looking to stay outside the city centre, but within walking distance, and close to the sea. The hotel is a little dated but comfortable and clean. Decent breakfast, although service could be slightly improved.",4,2021,09,02
247,"A well located, quality hotel","The staff were top class, especially the very helpful receptionist. This Hotel is in a great location right beside the Aviva Stadium and a short walk to other pubs/restaurants. It also has an ample free onsite car park, a facility which is very scarce in Dublin City !",5,2021,09,02
247,City break before return to school,The location of the Sandymount Hotel is excellent for both exploring the city and dining in the excellent restaurants of Sandymount Village. It has the personal touch and customer service often absent in the larger chains. ,5,2021,09,01
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Another great stay in this Hotel great rooms food was outstanding again.

247,"Good stay , great location !","Check-in was quick and friendly , Room was an ok family room , bathroom was small , nice comfy beds and right beside the Aviva which will be very handy if attending a match or event.

247,Excellent as always,"We have stayed many times, which says a lot in itself. The location is superb and while not ""city centre"", it might as well be in that the hotel is only 3 stops from centre on the Dart, which in itself in only 3 mins walk away. Room was immaculate, which is paramount in these times and well serviced. Breakfast is very well organised with very attentive staff and excellent choice and quality. Consistency in quality is undoubtedly a byword here.",5,2021,08,19
247,Great Staff,We were stuck for a hotel and phoned Sandymount in a last attempt to get a room. I spoke to Beatrice who was extremely helpful and got us sorted out. When we arrived the staff were very friendly and the food at their restaurant was very good ,5,2021,08,19

Dart station 3min walk away. So easy to get into city centre. Will Definitely be stopping here again. First class. ,5,2021,08,08
247,Hotel Stay Dublin,Arrived at hotel and there’s free parking. Hotel reception staff very friendly. No upgrade. Room was smaller than I’d expected with a double and a single bed. Take out the single bed and the room would’ve been a readable size. Very small desk to work out if you need to work on a laptop. TV quite small but had Netflix available which was a bonus. The bed was very hard for my liking and not what I was use to from other hotels I’ve stayed in. Bathroom was modern with good water pressure for the shower. The bath is very small. No good for a soak unless you’re under 5’. The room at first glance looked clean but there was dust on a lot of the surfaces like the TV fuse box extractor fan. I told the reception staff and house keeping came and gave the room a thorough clean. (Should’ve been done before the room was occupied). I ate in the restaurant once food was ok and service was ok too. Checkout was ok no problems at all. The location was pretty good and local transport was good also. Overall the hotel has lots good things with pleasant staff and location. There’s certainly room for improvement. ,3,2021,08,08
247,Great hotel!,Fantastic hotel in a great location. Beautifully furnished and spread over what was terraced townhouses. Large family room with proper single beds for the children! Aviva stadium and DART within walking distance at the top of the road. Brief one night stay before returning on the ferry to the UK. Unfortunately did not get to try restaurant. Would reccomend for a city stay. ,5,2021,08,03

247,Got a winner with the Sandymount.,"Exceptional hotel on all accounts , easily located , free safe secure parking , nestled in the leafy suburb of Sandymount beside the Aviva stadium and only 2 stops on the Dart to the city centre ( dart station 5 minute walk ) 10 minute walk to the Ballsbridge area with a wide selection of bars and restaurants and a 10 minute drive to the docks if you fancy a walk out to Poolbeg lighthouse. Location offers everything 
Rooms were clean , spacious and comfortable ( we had a triple ) , lunch was delicious , unreal chips ( fries )  and hearty Irish cooked breakfast with amble selection of continental goodies also. Brilliant beer garden and the best Guinness   
We had a fantastic stay here and wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else when we come back to Dublin ,  thank you to all in the Sandymount hotel for your warm friendly welcome. We have found a winner with you.",5,2021,07,30
247,Ending a great tour of th wild Atlantic way in Sandymount hotel Dublin,"The hotel is in a lovely neighborhood, very quiet and chique. The staff is super polite and helpfull, especially Ciara at the reception was marvelous. The staff makes you feel at home and anticipates on personal matters. The room was relatively small and the windows situated at the inner court yard. Early sleepers should ask for a more quiet room, since the restaurant guests chat away till midnight and that can be a bit noisy. The breakfast is great with a good selection. We would definitely recommend this beautiful hotel run by a family.",4,2021,07,30
247,A hidden Diamond of excellence🤩,"We stay one night. The room was very clean, the restaurant is quality and fancy. I ate brownie, such a beautiful and delicious desert, you need to try it 🤩 (I’m a chef✌🏼) The staff is very helpful and kind. Thanks for everything, we’ll visit again, sure!🙏🏼

247,I’m lucky to call this my home in Dublin,"I have been staying here for the last number of weeks whilst working in Dublin (and have quite a few weeks ahead of me). What a find! The beds are super comfy with nice mattresses, pillows & crisp fresh linen & the the food is great! The location is superb- right next to the Aviva at Lansdowne road with easy access to the city centre, the airport & port. Sandymount strand is only around the corner for evening strolls/jogging. For me, the free onsite safe parking is a huge bonus. I had a nasty shock after staying elsewhere at the cost of parking. 

I’m an essential worker & the Pandemic has made life challenging. At the Sandymount Hotel, they’ve got all the precautions nailed down- hand sanitisers, screens & distancing in the restaurant amongst others. I feel very comfortable & safe here. 

It’s a hotel with real personality- there are great nooks and crannies about the place to relax and read. It has a really welcoming feel that you don’t get anywhere else. Another thing contributing to the welcoming vibe (I don’t know how I only found this out a few days ago) is that it’s a family-run hotel. I think the family feel really shows in the sincerity of the welcome, the attention to detail, and the overall feel of the place. There’s heritage here and you can feel it. 

One of the biggest assets here is the staff- you can see how well the team work together & how friendly & attentive they are. Nothing is too much trouble. 

After trying a few others, I’ve stumbled across what has become my regular base in Dublin. Five Stars.",5,2021,05,15

247,Heavenly Staff,"I cannot thank the staff of Sandymount Hotel enough for their professionalism  , courtesy  and kindness to me ,from the moment of booking  to check out. 
Beatrice , in particular  was fantastic. 
Due to Covid we had to cancel my father's hospital appointment 3 times  and the hotel would not charge us late cancellation fee. 
Unfortunately, at a moments notice, I had to take my Dad up as  an emergency  to BlackRock clinic .However Beatrice held me 2 lovely rooms on ground floor with  handy lift access. 
My father was suddenly admitted for an operation.  The hotel was wonderful
..
They looked after me and did not charge me for the extra room . This is hard for hotels trying to make some business through Covid times. 
Also Beatrice held my room  just in case I needed to stay on for a few days. 
It felt like home. 
The hotel is in  a superb  quiet location situated in the heart of Ballsbridge .Extremely  handy for  St Vincent's and BlackRock hospitals. Also right beside Aviva hotel for Rugby fans and bus / walking route to Dublin city centre. 
The rooms are spotless and very warm. 
The family owner John took time to talk with his guests and check everything  was grand. 
Free easy access parking is a great bonus .
Additionally , the hotel made a good effort to celebrate the Christmas spot with their beautifully  decorated snow village and log fire  nook in the foyer.  
To top it all....the hotel price is very good for the heart of a capital. 
I shall certainly stay there again next time in Dublin.",5,2020,12,22

247,Just what was needed post lockdown,"Booked for six of us for an overnight dinner, bed and breakfast post lockdown as part of an college reunion which was much reduced in numbers due to Covid. 

The experience from start to finish was excellent. 

I was lucky enough to work with Ciara the Marketing Manager and she managed me brilliantly through the options and the twists and turns as our numbers constantly changed 

Nothing was too much trouble for Ciara and the late changes on our end were all handled superbly. 

As always a very warm welcome at reception from Beatrice and once checked in we were off and running. Pre dinner drinks in the Line Out bar which was nicely socially distanced and a very nice stop by and welcome from owner John Loughran. Dinner in the restaurant was very enjoyable and was followed by a few nightcaps. Rooms spacious, fresh and with very comfortable beds. 

Up early the next morning and a walk to nearby Sandymount Strand, a coffee in the village and back for breakfast which was very well managed  and with all the necessary precautions. 

Highly recommend a stay in this very well run family owned hotel, friendly service, lovely rooms, very good food, super location with plenty of parking and excellent value for money.

In the heart of Dublin 4, beside the Aviva Stadium it is a super place to base yourself. 

Highly recommended. 

Tip book early as it is very popular. ",5,2020,12,12

247,Incredible Staff ,"We recently stayed at the Sandymount Hotel. Although we couldn't do much with restrictions, we had a lovely stay regardless. From the moment we walked in Beatrice had a warm smile and made us feel so welcome. She asked if we wanted dinner/breakfast and told us to ask if we needed anything. We are such big believers that the staff make an experience 100% times better and Beatrice did this for us. She has such a gift to deal with so many people but to make them feel special. Our room was lovely and clean, parking facilities and location are also excellent. Upon check-out, Beatrice again went above and beyond asking if we would like a coffee before we go. I thought this was such a lovely little thoughtful touch, in all the hotels we've been in I don't think we've ever been asked that on check out. We will be back ASAP and we sincerely thank all the team for their hard work. ",5,2020,11,02

This is a family run hotel, done with care and consideration. The hotel and our room was spotlessly clean everyday, the restaurant had delicious food, including options for vegetarians and a special menu for kids too! :) Not to mention how friendly and helpful the staff always were to us.
They too have a great area out front and out back which allowed us to see family and friends safely which was so wonderful! Not least to mention, there are tons or restaurants and cafes within walking distance, and you can easily walk in to town within minutes which was perfect for us with a buggy. 
The location couldn’t be more ideal, with a plus that it too has tons of parking on a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood road. No question, we will be back again for sure and we hope soon and we’re looking forward to it! Thanks again Sandymount hotel :)",5,2020,09,05
247,Weekend away,"My husband and I stayed at The Sandymount Hotel for the weekend. This is our second weekend stay this year. I cannot compliment the staff enough, they take time to talk to you, are so helpful, always pleasant and polite and nothing is too much trouble. We will be going back again shortly, it’s our first choice hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2020,09,01
247,My second home Business and Pleasure,"I feel that I have been part of the History of this now very famous Hotel.
I have been made to feel very much at home whenever I have had the need to stay over in Dublin both on Business and pleasure,",5,2020,08,30
247,Okay,"Standard hotel but no complaints here. Upgraded from standard double as it was TINY but the bigger room was nice. Hotel is central enough. Didn’t eat there so can’t comment on that. Hotel is rather poorly laid out a lot of small corridors and steps so not ideal for immobile customers etc. Air con would be really beneficial as room was like a sweat box. Bath robes and slippers a nice touch, same with dyson hair dryer. ",4,2020,08,27
247,One Night Stay,"Very well located with easy reach of the city centre. Would be ideal for the Avivia Stadium when sports start up again. Very good adherence to social distancing and Covid-19 Rules. Convenient with good and free parking. Good price for large room and very helpful receptionist. 
Would highly recommend if staying for a city break.",5,2020,08,20
247,just dropped in for tea,"I just dropped in for tea as I was passing, its a beautiful hotel, there's a beautiful sunny seating area outside, very well spaced out, i was served by Beata, she was so friendly & good humoured I will definitely return for food & drinks & bring friends along too,",5,2020,08,20
247,Lovely hotel with great location ☺️,"Quality of mattress should be better. Everything except mattress was ok, I can't complain. Hotel really well kept. Thank you very much for that. Definitely highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice place for the weekend.",4,2020,08,18
247,Pleasant and relaxing.,A pleasant and relaxing stay. As I was travelling alone I felt the staff went over and above to make me welcome without been to intrusive. Great value great location. Just a pity I couldn't stay for a longer period.,5,2020,08,12
247,short break,An excellent stay ! Great location for this family run hotel central to all Dublin’s amenities.Lovely helpful and friendly staff . Place was spotless. Handy to have free parking on site. Would definitely stay here again .,5,2020,08,12
247,Charming and welcoming,"We found the staff at the Sandymount Hotel extremely friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious and clean, and the food was very tasty. We also were impressed with the hygiene measures taken by the hotel in light of the pandemic, with hand sanitisers in all necessary places. We would definitely recommend the Sandymount Hotel to friends and family! ",5,2020,08,05
247,Great hotel,Stayed for 3 nights. We had a wonderful stay. Hotel very comfortable. Staff were great. Could not have asked for a nicer break. Close to dart. Went to bray then walked to Greystones. Fabulous walk along the coast. ,5,2020,08,03
247,Highly recommended - fantastic staff,"After having to unfortunately cancel our booking back in March due to Corona Virus and with the hotel being so helpful we rebooked to stay.  The hotel itself very welcoming and the bedrooms were very spacious.  We had a proper coffee machine in our room and this was welcomed.  Like most hotels things have changed somewhat but we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay none the less. Toni in reservations is a delight to deal with from the cancellation of our original booking and then to remember me when I came to re-book felt quite special.  Something you really do not see these days. I made sure to thank her in person when we arrived and I am so glad I did, so friendly and charming.  We had dinner in the restaurant on the recommendation from Toni and this did not disappoint.  The staff were so so friendly throughout and it was a lovely evening overall. We had lovely relaxing break away - exactly what we needed.  We took a walk to the local village which is so quaint and only 15 minutes away.  I will be recommending this hotel to many of my friends and family and I hope to return back very soon.  Felt very safe indeed.",5,2020,07,27
247,Anniversary dinner,"Hi would just like to complement Beata, Alex and Junior for there professional, efficient and extremely attentive service that we as a large family received last nite. It was an emotional evening on what wouldve been my parents 50th wedding anniversary but my dad died 7 weeks ago so what wouldve been a sombre evening was not due to gorgeous food lovely ambiance and we all had lovely evening. Thanks again to the above mentioned guys. Would highly recommend.",5,2020,07,26
247,Very COVID Aware Hotel,"We have stayed here several times. Great location, friendly staff and exceptionally clean hotel. Very good COVID precautions in place.

Couple of letdowns this time:
I asked for sandwiches or something small to eat at 5pm, didn’t want much as we were having dinner at 8:30 but they could not accommodate my request, I was told I could have dinner early at 6pm. I went down the road for a sandwich.
Secondly it was a hot day and very warm that night. We were upgraded which was nice but we were put into a dormer room on 4th floor, very small window that only opened a few inches and no air conditioning. We didn’t sleep as it was too warm in the roof space. The hotel was far from full so why put us into that space knowing it was a warm one.

",4,2020,07,22
247,Great place to dine,"We enjoyed dinner recently at the hotel. The first thing to say is the facilities and distancing precautions are excellent. We ate outside in the lovely garden area, under cover and it was a really nice experience. Beata and Junior provided generous hospitality, serving our table with quiet efficiency. The food and wines were  good and overall  it was a very comfortable evening, and good value for money.",5,2020,07,21
247,Excellent Stay - Highly recommend ,We recently stayed at this Hotel. What a gem! The location is fantastic - a short walk to Sandymount Village and the Seafront. We ate in the bar restaurant and had a beautiful meal. We were a little apprehensive about staying in a Hotel considering COVID but we were very impressed with how the Hotel managed. We felt relaxed and safe at all times. The triple room was spotless and spacious. Parking is also included which is a major plus in Dublin! We will be back for another little getaway later this year. ,5,2020,07,17
247,Great friendly hotel,"Had a great trip. We were a bit apprehensive as this was our first stay after covid.  The covid arrangements are excellent and unobtrusive.
We had a family meal in the restaurant ( 6 people ). Food and service was  excellent. Beate & Sylvie are very friendly and efficient. Looking forward to our next trip.",5,2020,07,15
247,Great stay as usual,"Always stay here, lovely comfy rooms, great location and free parking, restaurant very nice also what's not to like 👍🏻 will be back again

Nice walks nearby and very friendly staff all around the hotel ×********************×*******",5,2020,07,10

247,"Fabulous Hotel, Great location","This hotel is just super and the location is great. We stay here on a regular basis and it has never disappointed us. It is in a lovely quiet area of Dublin but so close to the city and other areas. The rooms are spotless and really comfortable. The staff are fantastic, from check in to check out and the room staff have to be commended on the cleanliness of the rooms. The food is superb and Beata and Alex really looked after us when we were there recently. They could not do enough to make sure we were well looked after so thank you both! There is also a super garden for those sunny days and evenings. We love this hotel and highly recommend it. ",5,2020,07,08
247,Like I'd never been away :),"Stayed in the Sandymount Hotel last Thursday. I stay here regurlarly for business mostly altough I've brought my family here as a treat a couple of times. It's a fantasic hotel with very welcoming staff. Nothing is too much trouble. Nice relaxed family atmosphere. Rooms are very comfortable and always spotless. Wifi is excellent.

My first stay post Covid and was really impressed with the set up of the hotel. Plenty of signage, hand sanitizing stations etc. Breakfast is staggered also so everything is very safe.

Tips for first time guests - Eat out in the beautiful patio area if the weather is kind, nice walks into the city or sea front. Amazing atmosphere during sporting / concert events which will hopefully return soon.

Special mention for Junior and Toni who made me feel like I'd never been away!",5,2020,07,06
247,Great,"Had a lovely time here. Great staff and along with a great service. Had a lovely two night stay well worth it, with a great location. The Luas brings you so close to the location which is great for getting in and out of the city centre.",5,2020,07,06
247,Overnight in Dublin on 29th July,"As always, the staff are most helpful and friendly, the rooms and facilities are well-maintained and managed, and we enjoyed our supper there, with thanks to Beate, Alex and Junior.  Although this was the first day of opening after COVID-19 restrictions had been lifted, everything worked very well, thanks.",4,2020,07,06
247,Post lock down dinner,Myself and some colleagues booked dinner and a room to celebrate the easing of lockdown in Ireland. We were greeted on arrival by Toni Farrell at reception who made us feel most welcome and sorted us out with great rooms for our stay. We then enjoyed an excellent meal on the rear patio where we were served by Nagisse. He ensured that we wanted for nothing for the evening and was very friendly and professional. All over the evening was a great success and i woukd reccommend this venue to all. Very welcoming and great value.,5,2020,07,05
247,5 star service,"Due to work commitments I needed to stay in Dublin with work colleagues.  The Sandymount Hotel was recommended to me and I’m very glad it was.  Room was very nice, spacious and spotlessly clean. Free parking was a huge bonus.  All health and safety procedures are being followed & the staff are working very hard to implement new rules.  The coffee dock on the front terrace is a perfect spot, really enjoyed the area.  Lots of open spaces. We had dinner in the garden terrace which is a lovely setting. Great to see Vegan options on the menu. The staff are what makes this place so special.  Huge thanks to Junior for looking after us all so well.  He is a great asset to the hotel.  We will definitely be back.",5,2020,07,03
247,The coffee area :),The new coffee dock at the front of the hotel is a  brilliant idea and great use of the space that Sandymount Hotel have. Staff are pleasant as usual and the seating area is great for the 2 metre rule. Can't wait to go back and maybe have a pint next time :),5,2020,05,27
247,New Coffee Area,"The new coffee dock area at the sandymount hotel is fantastic. I recently met a friend and it was so lovely to be able to sit and chat. All measures are taken to ensure proper distancing so you can relax and enjoy.
I'll definitely be back soon! Staff friendly and helpful as always.",5,2020,05,24
247,Lovely morning coffee,Had a very nice coffee with my friend at new coffee station.  Great idea staff were lovely as was the delicious  coffee.  Plenty of space around for proper distancing also covered in area when the showers came.  Custard creams were a nice touch.  A real effort made in these difficult times.  We will be back,5,2020,05,23
247,New Coffee Dock,"Loving the new Coffee Dock in front of the hotel. Plenty of space for 2 Metres. Staff lovely, friendly and the service is great. Love to be able to get out and relax in a lovely atmosphere. Great idea! Will definitely be back

247,Congratulations on your 65th year in business,"Congratulations to management and staff who have worked hard in this family run hotel over 3 generations successfully 
developing it to a super 4 star, environmentally friendly hotel and achieving 65 years in business. 
The hotel is renowned particularly for its exceptional staff, comfortable bedrooms and generous facilities, conference facilities and great food and bar. Located very close to the Aviva Stadium, RDS and Herbert Park in Ballsbridge, Sandymount village and the beach in Sandymount strand, are all within strolling distance of 1km or less.  Dublin City centre is just a lovely 2 mile walk through some of Dublins most beautiful leafy streets with lots of shops bars and restaurants - en route, no matter which route you choose.  Ask Bea, Ann or anyone at reception for the inside track!

It is also serviced by the DART light rail system and several frequent bus routes to city centre within 500m walk of the hotel, if you don't feel like walking along the banks of the river Dodder.
The hotel is meticulously maintained and has been given a face lift inside and out over the last couple of months.  The gardens and outdoor seating areas are looking fabulous.  
I look forward to seeing you all as soon as Covid-19 current restrictions are lifted.  You have good reason to be very proud of yourselves and of all who have gone before you.
To John and Gerard Loughran and to your extraordinary team - Well Done to one and all.  Wishing you continued success for the future.
Warmest regards,
Pat O'N",5,2020,05,13
247,Location,"We had a one night stay there recently as we were attending a concert in Bord Gais. Very happy with the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff and  Beatrice in reception was very helpful. Great location and a lovely 20 minute walk to and from Bord Gais. Would certainly like to stay there again.
M&S",4,2020,03,26
247,During Crisis,"Stayed 6 nights during the coronavirus crisis and management and staff did everything  to make our stay as normal as possible.

Manager Valentin was always on hand to ensure all our needs were met.

Bar and restaurant staff could not have been more upbeat and efficient

Food was superb and very reasonable priced

Reception and room service were first class

When we had to go it was like leaving home

Thank You ",5,2020,03,20
247,"Great location, Friendly Staff, Free Parking","Great location for the Aviva Stadium and Dart connections to city centre. Friendly and Helpful Staff, Free Parking on site and decent breakfast. Didn't have food at the bar but the menu was extensive.",5,2020,03,16
247,Customer Service - Excellent Staff,I have not had the pleasure to stay here as I had to cancel my reservation do to COVID-19 and travel restrictions.  I have had to to many travel cancellations so it has been quite an ordeal for me and my company.  When I rang to cancel I spoke with the most pleasant lady in reservations.  She completely understood my situation and without hesitation assured me my reservation would be cancelled without any charge whatsoever and I would receive an email to confirm that.  But what I found to be heartwarming was in the process of all this she advised me to contact her in the future should I wish to stay again and she hoped she could welcome me personally should I chose to stay at the hotel.  This is customer service like I have never received before. I have her email and I will absolutely rebook this hotel without hesitation as it is times like these that above everything a hotel without this human personal touch is absolutely nothing.  Toni you are a GEM.  We will see you very soon.  And take care!,5,2020,03,13
247,Outstanding service ,"Everyone here has been so great ! The receptionist gave us recommendations on where to go. The bar tenders and restaurant staff were so kind . And our driver Dave was awesome, gave us a little tour on our ride ! ",5,2020,03,11
247,Good stay ,"Good stay at the hotel , tv facilities in room were good had a large selection of channels and smart functions , staff are friendly , good selection at breakfast , room was always made up and was tidy, car park had plenty of spaces 

Only bad point is that Netflix was still logged in on a previous guests login so maybe some signage should be in place to check or staff to check before new guests stay
But that was a very minor detail ",5,2020,03,09
247,Amazing stay ,"You pay for what you get what more can I say, lovely staff and the cleaners are always replacing tea/coffee and bottles of water. Amazingly clean hotel with lovely food. They go the extra mile without being asked! ",5,2020,03,09
247,Excellent friendly staff and services,"Nice comfortable hotel with very welcoming reception staff, hotel has great facilities in easy reach of the town centre. Courtesy bus available, special shout out to Dave the driver who was enormously helpful",5,2020,03,06
247,Great experience,"Called in late after a rugby game recently and there was no hassle ordering food, they even gave us leftover items, rather than throw them out. Staff were extremeley helpful and pleasant, especially as we arrived so late.
The food was excellent and the diner was clean and comfy.
We will be back again very soon.",5,2020,03,01
247,Poor Customer Care,"I booked the Sandymount Hotel as I had to stay in Dublin for work purposes. I ended up having to stay in a different side of Dublin for reasons linked to a training course and subsequently went on to Hotels.com, where I had booked the Sandymount and used my Hotels.com account to cancel my booking online.  However, a few days after my course I noticed I had been charged the non-cancellation fee of the entire cost of the stay. They informed me I had been sent an e-mail before my stay was due to occur and this was the case but I had not seen it. They told me to contact Hotels.com which I did. Customer care here was much better and they were happy to refund the non-cancellation fee as they accepted I had used their website to cancel the reservation weeks in advance. However, the Sandymount Hotel blocked their attempt to do so. If it was a case of my not having made any attempt to cancel this booking I would be in no position to contest this but as I had cancelled the booking weeks in advance I cannot recommend anyone do business with such a hotel.",1,2020,02,29
247,Weekend away,"Ivor's service and cocktails made our visit. A great stay. Food was great, rooms to a high standard. Compliments again to the bar man Ivor. Very friendly and delicious cocktails. Very enjoyable stay .",5,2020,02,22
247,Excellent,"Execellenr service - Barman Ivor gave us unreal cocktails - so tasty and presented so well with exceptional service 
First class 
Would highly recommend and come here again
Very nice staff also - restaurant staff very polite",5,2020,02,22
247,Excellent Location,"Right beside the train station for the city centre, lovely staff, great food and delicious cocktails by Ivor. As well as that the rooms are clean, comfortable and the atmosphere in the hotel is very chilled. Definitely recommend. ",5,2020,02,22
247,Dry good base and close to the train station,Nice stay whilst visiting Dublin. Very well located to the station and easy access into Dublin. Also near by coach stops from the airport. Clean and nice rooms. Staff very nice and helpful. Nice pint of Guinness in the bar.,5,2020,02,16
247,A TRULY LOVELY FAMILY HOTEL.....,"This establishment is quite large but is very well situated on the outskirts of Dublin. Me and my Wife went for a Rugby long Weekend 5 nights in all. 

We arrived late on Thursday evening, so we were both quite tired when we got to our Room. The Room itself was quite spacious very clean and well decorated along with a lovely En-suite, well done to the Cleaning Staff who by the way were all very friendly and helpful.

After a good nights sleep we went down for Breakfast, the items on the self buffet style menu were very plentiful, all Cooked to perfection and very Hot, the Cold buffet was lovely and fresh to, probably one of the best Breakfasts we’ve had in a long while, apart from the Saturdays experience at Breakfast due to it being Match day and was waiter tended at the Table.....it was all a bit hectic BUT! all was fine in the end.

On one of the nights we met up with Friends for a meal at the Hotel, in a nut shell 3 had a ok meal but nothing to write about? the one I had Chicken in a Satay sauce wasn’t very nice at all as the Sauce was very dry and 1 strip of Chicken was very tough and very chewy, when I asked for it to be returned to the Kitchen for inspection, the Head Waiter came to our Table and advised me that there was according to the Head Chef (nothing wrong with it!!?) but offered me something else....no thanks! hence we never had any more Food from the Evening Menu and thought the whole situation was handled very poorly. 

Hope the Management will have a quite word with those involved as it really does let the other Staff involved in the smooth running of the Hotel down.

The Hotel is right next to the Aviva Stadium which was fantastic, also the Dart Tram line being about 500 yards was also very handy.

Apart from one Evenings visit too the Restaurant......it’s was a great experience. 

We both said we had a fantastic stay at the Sandymount Hotel and would have no hesitation in returning again very soon.",4,2020,02,15
247,Hotel/ restaurant,Great hotel the rooms are very nice and clean and the restaurant menu was very  good it had alot of different options and the manager beata ivor junior she was very helpful with me picking foods off the menu due to my allergies she was very kind and friendly like all of the other staff members in the hotel would recommend staying here,5,2020,02,14
247,Rugby weekend ,"Very convenient location if you are visiting the Aviva stadium. Without exception very friendly, helpful staff. Excellent breakfast with wide range of options. We were in room 611 which was rather noisy as they were setting up facilities for the rugby crowd. Same problem when they were taking down the marquee etc. I would suggest you request a room on the other side of the building as it is much quieter. Over all a very pleasant weekend & I would recommend this friendly hotel. ",4,2020,02,12
247,Birthday dinner ,"Had dinner with the family.  Menu is perfect, something for everyone with a reasonable price. Service was awesome and iona aishling, loana and jr. are a great team  was very accommodating, friendly, and attentive.. Will be back definitely!",5,2020,02,11
247,"Lovely area and feel, paper-thin walls","Third hotel, third city. We did have a few issues with the hotel before checking in (we were in Munich when I got a message from the hotel through the booking app, telling me that they were about to cancel my reservation as they couldn't successfully run the card I had on file. A few frantic phone calls later, it turned out to be an error on their part, which they never once apologized for or explained. That definitely left me second-guessing our stay, but it was too late to cancel, and given the holiday timing, hotels in the city were either sold out or incredibly expensive.)

The exterior of the hotel is incredibly appealing. The whole area is quiet and quaint, and the look of the building is welcoming and oozes charm. Our cabbie helped us drag our heavy bags up the steps to reception, where we interacted with the only friendly person to work there.

We checked in and made our way to the designated elevator, dragging our luggage and ourselves along in a single-file line to make it down to our room. The hallways are tight, folks.

The room itself was large and comfortable, with one queen and one twin bed, a small desk and chair and an armchair positioned in front of the one window. The bathroom was a bit tight - you can't open the door without hitting the toilet - but the shower had great water pressure, and they kept the toiletries filled during our stay.

I have two very large gripes about the hotel itself. The first is the WiFi, which performed about as well as a dial-up modem did (am I dating myself?) There were moments where we'd get decent connection, but it never lasted. 

The second is the paper-thin walls between the rooms and the hallways. I get that hotels don't use the best in sound insulation, but people, the walls here are awful. Getting a full night's sleep can be a challenge. Let me paint a picture.

We went to bed on our first night at a decent hour but were awoken after 2 am by a group of they-really-should-know-better-adults walking down the hallway towards their room. They were in the middle of a very loud, very angry-sounding conversation when they hit our floor, and it persisted all the way down the hallway. For several minutes. Then one of the ladies couldn’t get her key to work, so there was much more swearing, followed by a guy telling her to give him the goddamn key already, and storming off in search of a receptionist, I’d wager.

They stood in the hallway long after the guy returned with a functioning key (or functioning brain, not sure which). They sounded like they had no intention whatsoever of moving on, and like they were nowhere near winding down for the night.

Enter my new hero, the grumpy old man across the hall.

He opened his door and yelled out, “What do you think you’re doing? It’s late, and people are trying to sleep. GO. TO. BED.” Like they were unruly children. I loved it.

One lady tried to apologize, and he bit out, “NO, you don’t apologize. You’re all loud, inconsiderate and rude. Shut up!” before slamming the door.

It was all I could do to not cheer and applaud the man.

Other than that, the beds were comfortable, and we really did love the area around the hotel. It's a quick and super easy walk from the hotel to the closest train station (Landsdowne Road). If you're taking the train to Dublin, cross the train tracks and walk up the ramp (look for the coffee shop; if you see that, you know you're on the right side.) Coming back from Dublin, you'll be on the opposite track. Easy peasy.

It's also a quick and easy walk from the hotel to the cute little town down the road. That leads on towards Dublin Bay, which offers a lovely walking path, park, and some shops and restaurants along the way. Everything is very easily walkable in that direction.

They also have a good restaurant/bar within the hotel (Lineout Bar), as well as another, higher-class option that we did not get a chance to sample. They do breakfast - again, we passed - and have several small sitting/relaxing areas dotted around the building itself.

We would stay again, if the price was right. We'd just pack ear plugs to ensure a good night's sleep.",4,2020,02,08
247,Would recommend it 100%,"I stayed 5 nights at the Sandymount Hotel. It's conveniently located. You enjoy the calm of not being in the city centre and having the public transport at 5min walk. Rooms really clean, helpful staff and good restaurant and breakfast service.
When I go back to Dublin, I'll go back there.",5,2020,02,07
247,Afternoon Delight,"My siblings and I ate A Delightful Afternoon Tea here on  the last sunday of november.
The Food is Amazing and presented beautifully.  Tasty rolls with various fillings - my favourite was the Ploughmans -  Magical Cakes and Fantastic Scones all arrayed on a tiered display. We even had to bring some home there was so much.
The Staff are so welcoming and the ambience in the hotel is just lovely.
A really Special place to go with family and friends - this was our 2nd visit but not our last.
",5,2020,02,05
247,Business Stay,"We were a group of ten people, some traveling to Ireland for the first time. Very welcoming hotel, excellent service, nice, quiet room, good breakfast.Thank you Beata and Joana for your hospitality during our great dinner.",4,2020,02,03
247,Business Stay,"Stayed for 3 nights.  Hotel was far too warm even at this time of year, no ventilation in the rooms even with the small window fully opened. They did supply an electric fan in the room but that was noisy and ineffective.  Customer Service leaves a lot to be desired.  Food is only average bar food. Late night bar service is a bit of a joke as they will only serve bottled beer once the bar closes, which is closed early for a hotel. It's a good location for the Aviva Stadium but any restaurants or bars are a good 20 minute walk. Good parking facilities but very annoying to find all are cars covered in a thick layer of muck following some spraying/power washing that was going on, had we been told we could have moved them, but again nothing.",3,2020,01,30
247,Should definitely have stayed longer!,"We did a very quick overnight visit at the weekend to attend a wedding exhibition at the RDS.  Myself & 2 daughters checked in at gone midnight & out again after breakfast.  Big mistake!!!  We should definitely have stayed the Saturday night as well to fully enjoy this lovely hotel.  I'd asked for a quiet room as I knew we wouldn't get much sleep due to our late arrival time after catching the last flight from Stanstead after work.  It was silent, slept like a log.  Spotlessly clean & a comfy bed.  Breakfast was fantastic, loads of choice & good quality. One of my daughters is doing Veganuary & I completely forgot to advise them in advance.  They were great & quickly made sure she had a substantial breakfast to set her up for the day.  We were offered a lift to the RDS in the shuttle bus which saved us a walk in the rain.  All the staff we saw were friendly, welcoming & professional.  I'll definitely be back to Dublin & wouldn't even think about looking for another hotel.  This one is great!",5,2020,01,28
247,A Gem in a great location,"Beautiful building, both inside and out.  Very welcoming reception.   The room was perfect, and had everything needed for a comfortable stay.    Asked for a quiet room and this request was definitely satisfied. 
Spotlessly clean and housekeeping do a great job there.

Be aware that some rooms may be too small for you, being of average build, the compact bathroom was fine for me, but it might not suit everyone so ask about this before booking if concerned.

Very nice, comfortable bar and dining room.  Little nooks and crannies dotted around for some quiet time, if required.

I had an unfortunate experience with delayed service in the bar on one night but this was expertly dealt with by operations manager Maté

It's a ten minute walk to Sandymount village which is really nice and has an excellent supermarket, a few nice pubs, cafes and restaurants.   I didn''t get a chance to walk to Sandymount strand, but that's for another trip

Highly recommend",5,2020,01,26
247,Hotel Stay,Very nice atmosphere at Sandymount Hotel and only sweet and helpfull people. A quiet street and pleasent walk along the river to Ballsbridge. We would love to come back. Thank You very much for a perfekt stay. ,5,2020,01,23
247,Superb!,"Celebrating New Year and a birthday for the wife in Dublin I wanted somewhere special to stay away from our usual city centre hotel. Sandymount fitted the bill and exceeded all my expectations....short ride on the Dart to Landsdowne Road and an easy walk to the hotel which is a row of linked Georgian townhouses. Friendly welcome at check in and quickly to our executive room on the top floor. Worth the extra for a very good king size bed and facilities in the room, coffee maker, large screen TV etc. Food in the bar was excellent as was the buffet breakfast, we booked on a room only basis and discounted vouchers for breakfast are available from reception. We walked to the nearby village for breakfast as an option on a couple of mornings. The staff here deserve a special mention helping to make our stay really memorable..hotel fully deserves the 4* rating....",5,2020,01,22
247,Reminiscing with Grandpa,"Wonderful stay. We were able to meet other family members here for a trip down memory lane with my Father(98) who is a Ringsender.. Rooms are great! Full Irish Breakfast buffet was amazing.. we spent a lot of time walking so worked it off!!
Elevator from parking lot makes it easy for elderly and disabled. Bar area gets noisy at times due to its proximity to the stadium around the corner,. Family owned hotel.. the owner had a long conversation with us when we were seated in the lobby area by the fire and Christmas tree...Everyone pleasant and as helpful as could be. Larger lobby area for smaller get togethers. Saw one group have afternoon tea there ...looked yummy! We were able to meet there with cousins and uncle with bar service before we did adjourn to the bar/restaurant for dinner. Short walk to DART made it easy to get to Bray, Dalkey and Howth for lunch..a couple of days it was easier to cab into centre of town.. Lots of Christmas parties and functions but the hotel seemed to manage the huge numbers very well. Would definitely recommend if you want something outside the centre of town.",5,2020,01,19
247,Great Value Boutique Hotel,"Just returned back from a two night stay with some colleagues and this hotel was a like breath of fresh air.  I am in Dublin quite a bit and stumbled across this hotel and I am very glad I did (why did I not know about this place sooner?!?!?) Located in a very safe neighbourhood which if like me you want to get out and about is quite important.  On making my initial inquiries I was put through to a girl called Toni.  She was extremely friendly and professional throughout the whole booking process.  She has a wealth of knowledge of the area and Dublin in general and is an absolute pleasure to deal with.  I wish I could steal her for my business!  Some of the bedrooms are smaller than others but that was highlighted to me on booking and the history of the building was explained.  Which is a fantastic story. The rooms are clean, comfortable, bright and airy.  The bar does a great pint of Guinness (you were not wrong Toni) and the food was great.  Only issue was the music was not playing in the bar when I went for a coffee so it felt a bit dead - mentioned this to the bar staff and they put it on straight away. This hotel will be my recommendation going forward to anyone that needs to stay in Dublin.  In fact there are friends now booked to stay next month. It truly felt like a home from home and you will be hard pushed to get the customer care anywhere else.  Some chain hotels can take a leaf out of their book.  I will be back!  Thank you Sandymount Hotel!",5,2020,01,16
247,Impressive,"Loved this hotel so much we booked it again for June. Great service, fab breakfast and excellent value. We got two rooms for 6 of us which were warm, spacious and spotless. So looking forward to spending time in your  lovely  outdoor garden in June.",5,2020,01,15
247,Outstanding!!,"This was our first type to Ireland and we wanted to stay with a ""local"" hotel, not a chain. The Sandymount Hotel was the perfect choice. The rooms were small, as expected, but clean-clean-clean and very comfortable. The tub/shower were spacious but a litte bit tricky getting in/out of due to the height between tub and bathroom floor. We used the hotel bar for dinner on our first night and drinks the second with dessert, just outstanding surroundings as was the traditional Irish breakfast each morning. Above all, the staff in every way was welcoming and always helpful. This was a great stay for us and would recommmend to anyone!!",5,2020,01,06
247,great place to stay,"they have friendly staffs, and they do have great food!
they do have ev charger, which is really handy. private carpark too. 
chose the place for the green hotel awards, but to be honest, they could improve the green bit. 

",5,2020,01,03
247,10/10,"Lovely hotel, very clean and modern. Amazing food... strongly recommend the Beef and Guineas Stew with creamy mash 👌🏻 Friendly staff that couldn’t Do enough for you. Beautifully decorated for Christmas. Close to the station. Highly recommended.",5,2020,01,03
247,Top Class,Stayed at this hotel over Christmas.  A great spot recommended to us by friends. Will definitely return.  Very welcoming staff on reception.  Fab early evening food in the bar.  Room was perfect.  Spotlessly clean and having Netflix on tv was an added bonus for our teen 🙂.  Breakfast was mouth watering and extensive.  Great value too. ,5,2020,01,02
247,Over-priced,"A similar hotel room in any other European city would cost less than half the nightly rate charged here. The room was no frills, with deep cleaning issues. We reported maintenance issues, which took most of the day to get addressed. Conveniently located near the football stadium and a short train trip to downtown. ",3,2019,12,31
247,A nice hotel only a few Dart stops away from the city centre,"My friend and I stayed here in November for 2 nights. It's a nice hotel in a really nice location. The nearest Dart station is only a few minutes walk from the hotel, just beside the Aviva stadium. And the city centre is only a few stops away. We did not walk in to the city from here but am sure it would not take too long. We got a taxi back from St. Stephen's Green one night and it cost us €12 only. Our room was very comfortable and clean and the bathroom was good too. We arrived after 6pm on a Friday evening and left at 12pm on the Sunday and had no issue with parking here during our stay. We did not dine here for breakfast or other meals, so we can't comment on the food. Our only complaint was the bathroom door which is a pocket door - a sliding door that recedes in to the wall. We were in room 457 and this sliding door was not lockable and kept sliding open which was annoying. One other thing - when we returned to our room on the Saturday night, there wasn't one towel to be found in the bathroom. All the used ones had been removed but none had been replaced. This was quickly remedied by a call to Reception and the Night Porter popped up a complete clean set to us. This hotel was great value for money the weekend we stayed there - cheaper than many B&Bs even. Overall, we did enjoy our stay here and would stay here again for sure, if we got such a good rate again. Thank you. :-)",4,2019,12,31
247,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for one night. We arrived early and check in was friendly. Room was also ready which was great. Got tea and scone. Lovely. Room comfortable, spotless clean. Great shower. Quiet hotel. Plenty of seating areas around the hotel. Shuttle bus to 3Arena. Bar food in the evening was tasty and breakfast delicious plenty to choose from. Plenty of car spaces. Would definitely stay here again would recommend it. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great nights stay. ",5,2019,12,22
247,Modern hotel in old fashioned setting,An excellent hotel with exquisite interior decor. Reasonably priced for a Dublin city hotel. Comfortable bed in good sized bedroom with bath and en suite bathroom (as well as shower). Keen awareness of climate protection.The hotel consists of several terraced interconnected houses making it rather quaint with excellent signage and lifts. Friendly and helpful staff. Within easy walking distance of buses to city centre. Try the chowder - it's delicious on a varied dining menu. Hotel situated near to the Aviva Stadium and v. convenient for Internationals.,4,2019,12,18
247,Pre-Match convenience,"Lovely hotel a few metres from the Aviva Stadium, and a short walk to Sandymount village. Friendly, efficient staff, lovely room, plus the bonus of free car-parking. The hotel also makes an extra effort to welcome, and cater for, match fans.",5,2019,12,17
247,Perfect Gastropub Pints and Platter,Family meal at short notice on a busy pre-Christmas Friday but patient and professional staff sorted out a few tables together so 10 of us were well accommodated. Most had the well renowned fish & chips and those Italians with us that went for risotto and pasta were very complimentary. The Pints and Pinot Grigio were spot on too. Our tourists in particular enjoyed the gingerbread Christmas village on display just off the lobby. Ideal night out.,5,2019,12,15
247,Rugby weekend with my sons,Lovely hotel within walking distance of the Aviva stadium. A short taxi ride from Grafton st and Temple Bar. Rooms A1 food fantastic and reasonably priced some quiet spots to sit relax and a enjoy a coffee and a chat. Staff go that extra mile to make the stay a pleasure ( Ivan/Ivana especially ). Can't wait to come back in April for my wife's surprise birthday. Well done to everyone @ Tha Sandymount Hotel,5,2019,12,14
247,Excellent as ever,Have been staying at the Sandymount over last number of years while in Dublin on business. Great location near the Aviva Stadium/Ballsbridge. You are always assured of a friendly welcome and this occasion was no different. Lovely room (305) with all the necessary mod cons. Decent breakfast with complimentary newspapers together with free parking...what’s not to like. thank you!,5,2019,12,14
247,Work,"Great hotel, being refurbished at the moment. Evening food menu and quality is excellent, on site parking is an added bonus. My only small gripe is coll plates and breakfast getting cold quickly. I was in at 8am so plate warmer was on, but plates lukewarm. However had I asked for the plate to be heated the nice staff would have done it, I didn't because of time.",4,2019,12,12
247,Excellent hotel,"What an excellent hotel, very friendly staff from initial booking, to checking in, checking out. We really were made to feel very welcome.  On arrival our room numbers were ready not hanging around.  Hotel was spotless and rooms were very clean.  We had our Christmas party in the Aviva, hotel was stone throw away.  The courtesy people carrier mini bus even brought us over to stadium to save our feet from walking in high shoes.  
The breakfast was also delicious, a great variety of food was laid out for all taste buds. 
Highly recommend a stay in this hotel, great experience had by all.",5,2019,12,11
247,A nice place for lunch,Forget that this hotel is close to the Aviva Stadium. It is a good hotel with nice decor and attentive staff. You might even meet somebody you know there! The sculpture in the garden is most impressive- take a look at it as you go in. This might not be a good place for wheelchairs.,4,2019,11,29
247,Shopping,"What a brilliant hotel, very friendly staff from we got to reception, to cleaning ladies, restaurant staff,bar staff, all made us so welcome we will definitely be back.
Looking forward to seeing you all in the near future. Cheers
Anthony",5,2019,11,27
247,"Best hotel, service and food",My friend and I stayed here. Best food I have had in a long time. Best service in a hotel I have ever had. Just a gorgeous place. Very quiet. Great for families. Very reasonable prices. Two course meal for €23. Bargain. Lovely wine too. Well done. Reception person who worked there 38 years. Can’t remember her name sorry she was excellent. Wee bar man was lovely.,5,2019,11,27
247,"Warm, welcoming reception","This is a comfortable hotel staffed by people who care about their work. The breakfast is excellent, well presented & cooked. The room we stayed in was nothing fancy but having said that it was spotlessly clean and a very pleasant temperature. Sandymount is well located & the public areas in the hotel are lovely. We enjoyed our stay & will be back!",4,2019,11,25
247,Great place to stay,"My wife and I stayed here over a weekend recently. While it was my first time there it was a particularly nostalgic visit for my wife as thirty years ago, she had lived in a flat in one of the houses that now comprise the hotel. 

It is very well furnished, extremely comfortable and very welcoming. It’s very close to Dart and bus services, and a few minutes from Sandymount village, which you should visit. 

Our stay was made all the more pleasant by the wonderful Beatrice on reception, whose lovely warm welcome, is what Irish tourism is supposed to be based on. She is a model for any aspiring hospitality professional and she deserves all the praise she gets!  Well done and thanks again Beatrice. 

Check this out - you won’t regret it. ",5,2019,11,22
247,Very impressed,"Great hotel, fabulous staff, so pleasent and helpful, especially at reception desk, spotlessly clean hotel, room comfortable and nice decor. Dinner lovely. Super breakfast. Overall would really recommend this hotel.",5,2019,11,20
247,Weekend break,"Lovely comfortable hotel with pleasant and helpful staff. No problem checking in early, tasty food in the bar and then a taxi was organised to take us to a concert. Breakfast the next morning was a delight with so many choices. Once again pleasant and helpful staff were available to cater for our needs. We will be back!",5,2019,11,20
247,Great hotel in excellent location,"Stayed here for one night with husband and 2 small children.
Could not fault anything!  Lovely hotel in a great location just 5mins walk from the Aviva stadium.  5mins walk to Dart station.  Easy to find and plenty of parking.
Hotel is so clean and comfortable.  We had a fantastoc room with a double and single bed and room for cot - we were allocated a very large room and it was lovely to have space for children to stretch out and play wth toys after a long day walking around Dublin city centre.
Staff very welcoming and friendly, from Maja in reservations to Beatrice at reception.
We ate in the bar when we arrived and food was excellent.  Plenty of choice and very good kids menu.  Staff in bar very good too, they brought little colouring packs to the kids during the meal.
The room was newly decorated, spotlessly clean, and so quiet.....didn't hear a sound during the night, compared to others we've stayed in where all you can hear are banging doors and traffic.
Breakfast the next morning was very good, plenty of choice, hot and tasty, and again staff excellent.
Will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,11,20
247,A great choice in Dublin!,"An excellent hotel in Dublin! Huge rooms, full breakfasts, big parking area inside the residence and above all a gentle personnel eager to help and serve! This will be our hotel of choice every time we come to Dublin! Nice job guys!",5,2019,11,20
247,One of the friendliest and best hotels we have ever stayed at.,The perfect place to stay in Dublin. Near the stadium it is ideal for fans. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are very spacious and clean. We were a family of 4 and the room was bigger than our bedrooms at homes and the beds were very comfy.  Nice atmosphere and lovely cousine. Reminds you more of a big house than a hotel. It is very close to a train station and the stadium. I recommend it to every one! The place to stay in Dublin!,5,2019,11,18
247,Lovely friendly hotel,Excellent location - very close to the Dart railway system - lot of pre-information from hotel on internet - great breakfast to set you up for the day - staff wonderful - looked forward to getting back to the hotel in evening,5,2019,11,13
247,Very comfortable stay with great staff,"Stayed here for one night. Lovely comfortable room in recently renovated hotel, which is still undergoing renovation but this didn't affect our stay.  Third time to stay here and could not fault it.  Staff are friendly and very helpful. Food in the line out bar was delicious and a great menu available.  Breakfast the next morning was delicious with lots of options to chose from.  Will definitely be back in 2020.  Thanks to all staff whom made us feel welcome.",5,2019,11,09
247,Frequent Visitor,I come for business in they IPA down the road once a month for 2-3 days. Rooms are clean and quiet. Very good value for the location when booked early. Great shower pressure. Lovely breakfast. Particularly good porridge and scrambled eggs (seperately that is. I would not mix those).,5,2019,11,07
247,Great four night stay,"We booked a four night stay for our first trip to Dublin.  Communication with the hotel prior to our stay was very good. We asked if there was the possibility of an earlier check in due to our flight times and although the popped a note onto our booking weren’t given any promises. However, they were able to offer us our room on arrival which was fantastic. They were very welcoming. We stopped in room 308 and it was very spacious, clean and modern. It has a shower/bath, toiletries, hair dryer, iron and board, kettle, safe, and a TV with Netflix. The bed was firm; a bit small for us but we are used to a king sized bed at home. The room is serviced daily by friendly housekeeping staff.There are lifts and ramps throughout the hotel which are good for those that use a wheelchair and with excess luggage. The Line Out bar has a nice atmosphere and the meals are delicious. I was let down when ordering a cocktail which had been recommended by staff to find it tasted like sparkling water without the Pink Gin that should have been present. The waitress was very good in getting it replaced with a Baileys but a nice gesture would have been a complimentary drink. Otherwise the food and dining experience was enjoyable. Breakfast is self service with many foods on offer i.e Full Irish or Continental breakfast served with coffee, teas and juices. The hotel is located minutes away from Aviva Stadium and Landsdowne train station where the DART takes you into Dublin City centre by getting off at Tara St or Pearse. It is in a lovely neighbourhood too. The hotel was undergoing renovations but this did not affect the level of service offered. Overall, a big thank you to all the staff, particularly Beatrice on reception, who made our stay one to remember. We will be sure to return in the future.",5,2019,11,06
247,Bday weekend in Dublin,"Yet again what another great weekend in Dublin with friends and staying in The Sandymount Hotel for the third time this year.

Great spacious refurbished room, great food and very friendly helpful staff.
The breckfast was to die  for each morning and even better when served up to 11am on a Saturday and Sunday Morning.
The Sandymount is in an ideal location especially to the Ballsbridge Area with plenty of surrounding pubs and Resturants.
Landadown Dart station in only a 5 minute walk away and five minutes on The Dart takes you into the centre of Dublin.
Cannot wait again to go back for another break in the New Year I hope",5,2019,11,04
247,Tasteful and convenient,"We stayed at the Sandymount for one night as we were attending a concert at the 3 arena. We arrived early but as our room was ready we were allowed to check in early. We had booked the shopping special and were in a classic double room with our bottle of prosecco waiting for us in the room. The room itself was modern, spacious and more than met our needs. Room service is available and we had the scampi which was delicious. The bar was lovely to sit in and the prices reasonable. In the evening the hotel put on a free shuttle bus to the arena which we thought a fabulous gesture. After the concert, we walked back to the hotel which was about a mile away and only took about 20 minutes. In the morning we had the breakfast which was incredibly tasty with lots of choice. We would definitely stay here again and found the staff to be helpful and friendly. A perfect stay.",5,2019,11,04
247,Dublin marathon family stay,"What can I say only... fantastic in every way. The staff go over and above to look after you in this hotel.  It is true Irish hospitality at its best. Ciara & Iamina are an asset to the hotel as are all of the team we came in contact with.

We travelled as a family of 4 and the room was spacious and comfortable for us all.  The food was wonderful in the bar in the evening as was the service on the night before the Dublin marathon. Breakfast the following morning was top notch again with all the staff being so friendly. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It will be the only hotel we will visit every time we come to Dublin! 
Thank you Team Sandymount, give yourselves a pat on the back!",5,2019,11,04
247,Terrific Hotel,"The Sandymount provided us with a comfortable, relaxing, clean, quiet, and safe home away from home. It is an interesting place, given its quirky design and structure. The main lobby has the feel of a century home, with side rooms, a fireplace, a library. The pub and restaurant were above avg in quality abd service.
Ask for a third or fourth floor room overlooking the private courtyard.",5,2019,11,04
247,Beyond our expectations ,"Booked the sandymoumt for one night as we was going to a concert at the 3 arena. Never stayed here before and didn't know what to expect as booked it purely for price purposes and parking convenience. When we arrived we couldn't if been happier. Check in was quick and done by friendly staff. The hotel was way bigger than it had looked when we first came into the place. The decor is beautiful it's such a fresh clean and beautifully decorated hotel. Our room was lovely warm clean modern and we couldn't of been more happy with it. The en suite was lovely and again very tastefully and modern decor. Bottled water left in the room along with other sufficient supplys tea coffee ect and also in the bathroom shampoos and shower gels. We ate in the bar and once again no complaints I really cannot fault this hotel for anything. 
Added unexpected bonus also. We had expected to make our own way to the concert but upon arrival we where asked was we attending the concert in the 3 arena and if so what time would we like to get the bus. We was given a few different times and upon our chosen time we where taken to the venue for free in the lovely hotel mini bus. So thank you also for that. We have a concert booked for next year and will definitely be staying at the sandymoumt. Also recommending it to anyone and everyone.",5,2019,11,03
247,Good hotel,"Stayed for a night as we had business in Dublin. Twin room as there were 2 of us. All staff were very professional, helpful and friendly. Great hotel Car park. 
Rooms were spacious. Bathroom was tiny. Pillows were as flat as pancakes. Telephone in room didn’t work. Corridors are very narrow and noisy. 
Would I stay again............ only if I had to 😢",3,2019,10,27
247,Comfortable,"The room was good sized, the bed was comfortable, good pressure in the shower and the staff were helpful. The breakfast was ok if predictable and unchanging; got a bit boring after a few days but there are no other options in the near vicinity. It looks a little far our but he DART is only a couple of hundred metres away (beside the Aviva stadium) and it is only 3 stations to Tara just beside the Liffey on the south side of town. If you are sightseeing on the Southside you do not really need the train. There is a great little canal walk from the end of Herbert Road (half way to the station) to Grand Canal Street, turn left and in a few hundred metres you are in the centre of the Southside tourist attractions. Taking the canal walk in the opposite direction takes you to Ballsbridge and a coule of reasonable restaurants/pubs. There is also an excellent bag wash laundry about 350m from the hotel on the corner of Shelbourne Road and Bath Avenue (apparently there is no laundry service at the hotel). Getting to and from the hotel can be a little tricky. The easiest way we found was via Pearse DART station (2 stops from the hotel on the way into town). There is an airport bus stop (757) just across the road outside the station exit and there is a lift at that end of the platform to get your. Heavy bags up and down - €2.25 for the DART and €7 for the airport bus (stops at both terminals with the terminus at terminal 1. The day we travelled there were only 3 of us on the bus so no issues with luggage.",4,2019,10,23
247,A little far out,"The location of the hotel was a bit further than we anticipated.  It's about 6-7 walk from the hotel to station.  Trains are every 15mins (taxi is about 18 euros) - return is 4euros.  It is then under 10mins walk to Temple Bar.  The communal areas of the hotel were nicely decorated but the room was a bit basic.  The room was quite small.  Added bonus, the TV had Netflix!  You do hear quite a lot of noise in the night from other rooms! Banging of doors etc.

Didn't eat at the restaurant but we used the bar - drinks are reasonably priced.  They need more than one bartender though during busy times.  The bar itself is quite small. 

Staff are friendly though and helpful.",3,2019,10,20
247,Just Okay,"While the walk into the city center and the little town is not bad, the hotel should have a couple of shuttle buses that go to various places around town, especially in the rain. The eating options seem to be limited to the bar in the evening which makes having a shuttle that can take you to and from the city center more ideal.  Also the rooms at the ground level, while clean, feel a little creepy.  I was not comfortable with the way they kept the outside door propped open during the day.  It should be locked  always and accessible by room key.",3,2019,10,20
247,The good the bad and the ugly,"The rooms are really nice and well equipped - tea/coffee, biscuits, even offer the option of ringing for real milk, ironing board, iron, case stand, lots of plugs, mirrors, lights etc, toiletries in bathroom.  The double bed that we had was only 4 foot which was too small for my husband and I.  I constantly woke up on the edge of the bed about to fall out.  The breakfast was delicious and there was an abundance of anything you could wish for - the baby muffins were particularly delicious.  I paid on check in for my room and a family room for my daughters but on check out the same receptionist insisted that the family room was not paid for and tried to get my daughter to give her a card to take payment again.  Even after I gave her the receipt with the payment stub attached she still insisted that we had not paid enough.  Then she took my receipt and kept it and asked for my mobile number as if she would need to contact me.  This really annoyed me.  Also, the barman in the Line out bar was so rude to my entire family.  I still can’t actually believe his attitude towards us and I had intended to speak to management about it but then the whole payment situation arose so I just wanted to get out of it.  I really don’t think I would have got anywhere with it and I didn’t want the grief! Judging by the people there we are not the first and won’t be the last who experience this barman’s attitude.  It was like a ghost town in the bar.  Now i know the reason why! ",3,2019,10,19
247,A little disappointing,"The layout of the hotel is not the greatest and requires a bit of walking. Not fun when you have large suitcases with you. There is free parking which is great, but you then have to walk to the tiny elevator and go to the second floor and then walk to another elevator based on where your room is. In our case was on the first floor, and we found it to be a bit noisy. The room also smelled of smoke even though it was a nonsmoking room. There isn't much to do or eat nearby but the restaurant inside the hotel was good.  They provide complimentary bottled water. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful.",4,2019,10,18
247,Fantastic hotel for the business traveller,"Working on behalf of my employer in Dublin from November '18 to September '19, I stayed in the Sandymount for 2/3 days per week. I would class this as probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in on business. The standards of reception, housekeeping and service overall are second to none. The food is excellent as is the bar and restaurant service. I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin. 
Also a special mention for Dave, who ferried my colleagues and me to the office each day in the courtesy bus and went out of his way to be helpful.
Thanks to all the staff for making my many stays so enjoyable.

247,A Special Treat,"My wife had got 2 tickets for Elton John's tour at the 3 arena, and so as a base we chose this wonderful hotel.The location of it was absolutely spot on for getting around. We was literally 5 mins away from the Aviva stadium and Lansdowne road train station.
Our room was spacious and clean with ample storage space , and the bed was comfortable too we was at the front of the building and was not disturbed by any traffic. Past reviews have said about how difficult it was to find their rooms but we had no problems.
Reception was very professional and informative . All areas of the hotel were tastefully decorated.
If you fancy a walk then you are not too far from Sandymount Village, lovely shops and places to eat. Thank you again for our stay.
        Gary and Tracy",4,2019,10,16
247,Beautiful Hotel in a lovely area,"I would highly recommend this beautiful hotel in a lovely, quiet area of Dublin, and yet so close to the City Center - only 3 stops via dart which runs every 15 minutes. 
Rooms are spacious and quiet, with all needed amenities, beds very comfy. Hotel has a free car parking - which is a great plus for Dublin city. Also, guests can use a fitness room for free, as well as the business center. 
Breakfast in the restaurant was delicious, and so was the bar food in the evening. 
Definitely the best about this hotel is the staff. Everyone is really friendly, efficient and  professional. Even though everyone across was excellent, front desk team definitely stands out - Beatrice, Ann, Valentina & Belen would make anyone feel so welcomed and at home.
 ",5,2019,10,16
247,Miss L Cross,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel for 3 nights for a short break for a friends 40th birthday . Staff are so welcoming nothing is to much problem . The rooms are spotlessly clean exceptional high standards. The staff working in the bar can’t do enough for you. Ivor was extremely friendly and the food very good value. The choice of food for breakfast will not disappoint you. The decor in the hotel is very unique and the beautiful log fire in reception.  The staff on the front desk will guide and advise you on how to get to all the local attractions and order a taxi for you. The hotel is near the Dart railway station only 4.10 euros for a day return to Tara street 3 stops to the centre of Dublin.
Our toilet broke and within 5 mins of reporting it the maintenance man arrived then the general manager. We had to be moved to another room and the staff couldn’t do enough we explained we would be out all day so they kindly arranged to move our belongings to the new room. When we returned to the hotel we were given a complimentary bottle of wine and a card saying happy birthday. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. 
Thank you for making us so welcome . We will definitely be back and will recommend this hotel to all friends and family wishing to go to Dublin.",5,2019,10,15
247,Lovely townhouse hotel,"the Sandymount is a wonderful hotel with great vibes. I loved the townhouse feeling and the renovation they have done (great colour scheme!!). If you like boutique hotels with a personal touch, you are right there. We felt comfortable and it is very quiet in that area, no parties, no loud, drunken people. Very nice staff!! Many thanks especially to Beatrice who made us feel very welcome. She helped a lot with sightseeing recommendations and is very friendly and authentic.",5,2019,10,15
247,Weekend in Dublin,"Had such a lovely stay at this hotel. Hotel is very comfortable with amazing staff, couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast was excellent and had food in the bar aswell which was also good. Dart was only 5 minutes walk which we used daily to get in and out of the centre. Definitely recommend",5,2019,10,14
247,2 nights in Dublin,"Great family run hotel, you thought of everything to make the trip great - super hotel, delicious breakfast - really comfy room great line out bar for food and drinks and so close to the dart fog getting into the city - we loved our stay thank you",5,2019,10,13
247,Concert trip,"Booked the hotel for concert in 3 arena.It is a stones throw from the Aviva which is fantastic if you were attending match etc. For a €170 not including breakfast, I was extremely disappointed with the size of the room, it really was a single room with a double bed put in. The bathroom had a sliding door which was extremely stiff to pull across, again very compact for 2 people. My husband injured his finger when he went to pull across the door and it suddenly slid across catching his finger between the door and the frame. I had to edge my way from the wall and the bed to get to my side, no space at all to freely walk unless I jumped over the bed. The bar was very nice, including the food.
The lift broke during our stay also.
Overall the hotel is very nice, nice location, just so disappointed with room size. We met some English guys in the bar, all staying in separate rooms and they said they had lovely big rooms. I had stayed in the Spencer a week earlier and got 2 bedroom apt with balcony room for €200. 
On the plus side, Maja in reservations was amazing as we had the threat of Storm Lorenzo we were not sure if we could travel til that day and she gave us til 1pm without being charged.
Be very slow to return to The Sandymount again if it means just paying a few euros extra to have a bigger room at the other side if the bridge and more convenient.......Pity

247,My favourite hotel,I regularly stay here when I’m in Dublin for concerts etc. I love it’s location as it is in a quiet area outside the business of the city but it’s also just beside a stop for the DART so it’s easy to get to and from. It’s next to the Aviva and super close to the 3 Arena. I don’t think it’s far from the RDS either. Rooms vary from small to large but I can’t complain about them. There is parking too. Breakfast is excellent. Hotel staff keep customer service a priority. I can’t fault this hotel. It’s perfect for everyone. ,4,2019,10,08
247,Ups and downs,"Appearance: very nice old building, well decorated lobby, friendly helpful personnel
Rooms: very small, overheated, no ventilation (the windows barely open), small bathroom, no room to place bathroom items, 
Breakfast: solid, fresh fruit wouldn`t hurt
Price: for that kind of hotel way too high.",3,2019,10,08
247,They will spam you,"The hotel is quaint and comfortable, but they won't respect your wishes not to be put on their promotional spam list. Expect to be hammered with all manner of promotional spam, whether you've agreed to receive it or not.",3,2019,10,07
247,"Convenience, Value and Comfort","The Sandymount Hotel is very conveniently located in Dublin 4.  Easily accessible by the Dart or bus from the city.  If you are travelling by Dart get off at Landsdowne Road.
We have stayed there before and are always impressed by the front of house staff.  The check-in was very efficient and very helpful.  Our room was very comfortable (gread bed) and excellent bathroom facilities.
The bar has a great range of Irish whiskeys - worth pushing the boat out for some of the rarer offerings.
Breakfast was top notch.  Very good self-service buffet.  NIcely appointed dining room and friendly and helpful staff...what more could you ask for.  Oh, yes, we found it represented good value for money compared to other Dublin hotels.  We will be back.  We were very impressed by their Green policy - recycling bins to be found on corridors etc.
As we depend on TripAdvisor for advice when away from base I try to give an honest and helpfl appraisal of hotels and restaurants.  If you fin this review helpful I would appreciate a helpful vote.  Thanks.",4,2019,10,05
247,"Great location, quiet",Very quiet despite being in a big city. Gym was nice and rooms clean. Location good and free parking. The front desk staff was super helpful and breakfast was very good. We were able to easily get a taxis from the location too.,4,2019,10,03
247,Worth a visit to sample the restaurant,"Lovely hotel, very handy to city centre. A bonus was transport to the Bord Gais theatre - thank you. The downside is room locations - the hotel consists of a number of houses linked together so accessing the bedrooms is not straight forward but nevertheless did not spoil our stay. Brilliant car park. The best part was the restaurant - this should get 5 stars - the bar food was simply delicious, plenty of choice and good  portions. ",4,2019,10,03
247,Reception 5 stars,"Great Front of House Staff. Having stayed there for  2 nights. I had the absolute pleasure in dealing with there receptionist on a number of queries from checking in to extending our stay Sean excelled as first person we met in the Hotel and has left a lasting impression. Will definitely  return to this great Hotel with its lovely clean and comfy beds and great breakfast. Near all attractions and city centre
Look forward to returning very soon and again thank you Sean for your help you are 5 star",5,2019,10,02
247,Golf Trip away with the lads ,"We have stayed at Sandymout Hotel for the last 7 years that in itself go's to show how much we love it , the staff are friendly and very helpful always smiling ,I'd like to give a big thanks to Beatrice on reception for all her help in making this another brilliant stay. Big thanks to all your staff see you next year. 
Kind regards Brendan ",5,2019,10,01
247,Excellent hotel located in a  quiet suburb of Dublin with easy access to the city centre,"Located in the quite suburb of Sandymount, about 2 miles south of the city centre is this gem of a hotel. It is big and has lots of rooms. We stayed twice in the same week, in different rooms, and they were equally as clean and spacious. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. There is free use of a computer and printer, just ask at the desk for the password. There is free car parking on site. There is a huge range of choices for breakfast including the legendary full Irish breakfast. I can't comment on evening meals as we chose to eat out in town but have no reason to think the cuisine is less than excellent. The hotel is very near the Aviva stadium but this is not a problem unless you are arriving when there is a large sporting event taking place, in which case you can expect the hotel and surrounding area to be very busy. It's just five minute walk to Lansdowne Road station and  three stops on the Dart train to Tara Street, right in the city centre.A return ticket costs Euro 4.20. The hotel is about 20 minutes drive from the airport. You will find there is a toll of Euro 3.00 to pay on the M50 motorway. If you are considering visiting Dublin I recommend you stay at this suburban hotel and travel in by train or bus as Dublin city centre hotels can be noisy, often have no parking and may have trains running by the windows until late at night.",5,2019,09,29
247,In future I will book here!!,"Thank goodness this hotel was able to help us after a disastrous start to our stay in Dublin in another local Hotel!!
Everything about this hotel is brilliant. The staff were so helpful and friendly. Our room was amazing and had everything, and more, we needed for a relaxing stay. The location is so good for transport, dining/eating/drinking and all in easy walking distance. The breakfast was really good and the choice of the buffet style was fantastic. We have personally never had a breakfast like it in a hotel of this size. Everything was as though it had been freshly prepared even down to the porridge which was yummy. Compliments to the chef and the breakfast staff who were very efficient and made the whole breakfast time good. We would highly recommend this hotel and hope one day to return. One thing we would also comment on was the hotel was undergoing refurbishment in some areas of the building and well done to the contractors as you would not have known they were there and caused no disruption to our visit at all. ",5,2019,09,27
247,Superb location!,"Location is super, nice quiet area with a gorgeous nature reserve and park just down the street.

Town is €2.25 single to Tara street station away. Need a ticket before you board, every half hour on sundays.

I suggest that you book direct, for my husband used booking.com and our room felt pokey and wee (121) we noticed while being cleaned that others looked much larger. The hotel is a collection of homes stitched together so presumably the rooms differ greatly.

Breakfast was very expensive, it was nothing special just the normal average buffet that is normally included.

Great for what you get for the price in leafy Dublin (£150/night) but basic. Basic tea and coffee and toiletries. ",4,2019,09,23
247,Lovely hotel,"I stayed here for work, really enjoyed my stay. The rooms were clean and spacious. I can’t thank the driver Dave enough, I had an issue getting a taxi. Dave jumped to my rescue taking me across town.thank you again",5,2019,09,23
247,Very good,"It was very good and everything was clean, with New devices,furnitures, etc and very good break fast.And OK, it's not in the center of the town but it is so Close to it and you can join a silence away from cars, much People and all this crowd shouting",4,2019,09,22
247,Great hotel and staff,"Stayed in the hotel for a night , rooms great , fab breakfast and excellent staff , Beatrice on reception was great , overall excellent hotel and great location , rooms were comfortable and bar areas were lovely !",5,2019,09,22
247,Just checked out.,Not really impressed. Uncomfortable beds and pillows. Transformer in room buzzed all night. Location is great if your attending an event in the Aviva however I thought it was overpriced for a regular Saturday night.,3,2019,09,22
247,Close to Aviva stadium,Very nice and helpful staff. Rather big room which strangely had beds for 3 persons. Tiny bathroom. Wardrobe seemed old and as if it was breaking apart. No air conditioning; hence I slept with the window open. Nice breakfast. ,3,2019,09,21
247,Good location,"When we arrived the front of the building was covered with scaffolds, though we did not see any work going on. The narrow creaking hallways led to a room which needs a complete overhaul: the cheap particle board bathroom vanity had the formica peeled and broken off; the sink and tub/shower took forever to drain; There we empty bottles under the bed from previous occupants.As it was warm (no ac) we opened the windows which allowed the noise and exhaust of buses and trucks, as well as cigarette smoke from loud drinkers from the bar partying below outside our windows.",2,2019,09,19
247,Overnight stay,"Camped here on our final night before departing beautiful Ireland. The family room was big enough for 2 singles and a double bed and not much more. The hotel was a myriad of hallways and ups and downs in the floors, which indicated to me there was a series of add ons over the years, but was clean, tidy and the staff were very professional. ",4,2019,09,14
247,Excellent welcome & service,"We visited this lunchtime and were made to feel very welcome. 
My wife and I also had our 'Boy', and best friend, Stanley (English Springer) with us who had been very adventurous on the beach and in the sea so was a little, err, well wet!
We ordered drinks and sat down and very soon Sophie came over and offered us a big towel to dry off Stan and also dog treats for him.
She was so helpful and very genuine in her conversation and demeanour.
This was a very pleasant surprise and has compelled me to write this review.
Thank you very much Sophie, you made our visit so much more than the just the 'norm'.
We will visit again because of you.",5,2019,09,14
247,Brilliant night stay ,"Brilliant night stay for a quiet weekend away!! Fabulous hospitality, modern room yet a homily atmosphere! Free parking and the dart is a few minutes walk away- a quick connection to the city centre. Will definitely stay again ",5,2019,09,09
247,"Great location, fantastic staff","Spent a weekend here for the rugby recently, the staff are without a doubt some of the best we've ever come across - friendly, efficient and very hardworking, especially given how busy they were. 
Rooms are comfortable and excellent power shower. 

The hotel has grown over the years to take over several Georgian townhouses which lead to some interesting stairs and twists and turns to the elevators. If you have walking difficulties, I belive they have fully accessible rooms on lower floors. 

Located a stones throw from the Aviva station and a short walk to the village of Sandymount where there are lots of lovely pubs and restaurants.

Food in the hotel was great - huge breakfast buffet.  

Parking included as well which was an added bonus. 

No hesitation recommending and will definitely stay again.",4,2019,09,09
247,"Great hotel, great location ","We spent 6 days at the Sandymount while visiting Dublin. We chose the hotel as we didn’t want to be in the city centre yet wanted to be walking distance (a bit of a jaunt but still a nice walk) plus it was near the DART.  An additional bonus was it’s proximity to the Avila Stadium so we bought tickets for the Ireland vs Switzerland Euro Cup qualifier. A very clean and quiet hotel with great staff and service.  If you can, spring for the executive king room for more space.  ",5,2019,09,07
247,SIMPLY AWSOME,"This is our first time to Ireland and none of new what to expect.  It all started when we checked in.  The reception personnel are all VERY warm and friendly.  They all bent over backwards to accommodate our every whim. We had also  not made reservations for any place to have dinner so we ate in their own restaurant.  This is where it got even better.  The service that the staff gave was the best.  Although there was only one person that presumably was assigned to our table there ended up being three of them making sure that everything was just perfect.  Beata, Elida and Joane can all be commended for their efforts put forth to help us.  Girls you'll have to excuse me if I spelt your name incorrectly as someone handwriting was hard to read......lol....",5,2019,09,07
247,Great hotel close to Aviva Stadium and city centre,Spent a long weekend at this very comfortable and friendly hotel. We booked an executive double room with excellent full Irish breakfast. The room was spacious and recently refurbished to a high standard. It is five minutes walk to the stadium and DART station which is two stops to the city centre. We booked direct with the hotel which offers 10% discount.,4,2019,09,04
247,Average at Best,"Sandymount Hotel is in a perfect location for the Aviva Stadium and unfortunately that is it. 

When we booked this hotel we wanted a romantic stay as it was for our Wedding Anniversary. I had chosen Sandymount because the reviews were great, it is classed as a 4star hotel and it was slightly out from the hustle & bustle of the city. You do get free parking which was nice, but from that moment on it was clear that this is just a business hotel and surely not a 4star. 

We shuffled our way through a maze of corridors to reception and then had to find our room. Upon entering our room it was a box. Our bedroom back home is bigger and our bed is larger. We just felt disappointed to be honest. We spent €150 on something that a Holiday Inn or Premier Inn could have done better and for cheaper.

I have stayed in much better 3 star hotels and feel the hotels reviews/ photos do not match our experience.",2,2019,09,02
247,Very helpful and caring from the word go,I stayed in the sandymount hotel from the 30th of August until the 1st of September and right from the moment I booked they have been more than helpful. This was not my first time staying at this hotel but this visit was certainly an important visit as my girlfriend and my daughter was with me. Everything from the room to the food was perfection I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is thinking of visiting dublin I am already after booking my next visit to the sandymount hotel and I am looking forward to it. Thank you to sandymount hotel for taken good care of us and we will see you soon.,5,2019,09,01
247,Great location and value for money!,"We stayed at the Sandymount hotel and had a triple room. Although at first the location felt outside of the centre it had great transport links as the DART is just around the corner and is very cheap for a return ticket. The hotel room was fantastic, beds super comfy and the amenities with the room great. All the staff were friendly and knowledgeable of Dublin and were always around to assist. Shoutout to Frank who was on hand to take photos of me and my friends before we headed out into town! Great hotel and fantastic value for money.",5,2019,08,29
247,Good location,"I stayed at the Sandymount hotel for one evening mid week on a business trip. The hotel is located right next to the Aviva Stadium at Landsdown Park in Dublin. It is very close to the Dart rail network which gives a very convenient 10 minute ride into the centre of Dublin. The hotel also offers free car parking. Upon check in the staff were warm and welcoming. My room was quite small and located on the bottom floor which is slightly lower than ground level. It was clean and comfortable. The down side however was that the walls were paper thin and I could hear every noise and conversation going on around me, along with squeaky floorboards and doors closing whenever anyone in the room above moved around. This room (No135) is also located under a set of stairs adding to the noise levels. I arrived quite late so mid not ask for a change and was unfortunate that the guests above were early risers, 5:45am. On checkout the staff were apologetic and offered a free breakfast as compensation which unfortunately I did not have the time to take up. So overall, warm friendly staff, very good location especially if you have a car to park and clean/tidy rooms. Just don’t stay in room 135 if you need to sleep!",3,2019,08,29
247,Wonderful hotel with exceptional staff,"Stayed in this hotel for three nights with friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rooms were lovely, better in person that the photos do justice. The bathroom is very nice too, with the shower being actually decent.
The staff were always really friendly and helpful, no matter what time of day or what query we had. We arrived quite late on our first day (midnight), but the hotel were more than happy to check us in and help us when we arrived (I did contact them prior to coming to ensure this would be okay).
The breakfast was really good as well, huge range of choice to suit many dietry needs.
The location for us was perfect. It is far enough out of the city centre that it is quiet and peaceful, but close enough that you can walk or get a quick train. The hotel is right next to the Aviva stadium, so not sure what it would be like when a match is on, but i don't see it being a problem.

Overall, a fabulous hotel. I would 100% go back if / when I go back to Dublin.",5,2019,08,29
247,Great stay,"Me and my mum stayed in this beautiful hotel for 2 nights, excellent value for money. 
The location is lovely - situated in a lovely area and so close to transport. 
The staff were friendly and the rooms were clean. 
The only issue we had - the showers in the morning were luke warm at the best when the temperature was on the hottest it could go. 
When we came to check out the lady although polite did not ask us how our stay was - if she would have we could of told her about the water temp issues we had. 
We would stay at this hotel again and would have given it 5 stars if we didn’t have the water issue! ",4,2019,08,28
247,Reliable as ever!,Have stayed here on many occasions while attending business meetings in town. On this occasion my visit coincided with a big concert at nearby RDS and hotel was thronged. To the credit of the reception team they put me in a quiet room at the top of the hotel to avoid the late night revelers. While hotel rooms have undergone a big makeover over the recent past the absence of air conditioning is a slight drawback in what is unusually warm weather. Other than that the rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Great location!,4,2019,08,27
247,Wonderful Weekend Stay,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend break. It was a lovely hotel, the room was clean and had a newly fitted bathroom. The bed was very comfortable, the only fault was no air con however we did have a small fan! 

There is a train station which is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel. We did walk into the city centre one day which took about 25 minutes! 

I would highly recommend this hotel to those who want to explore the city and still have a good night sleep!",5,2019,08,27
247,Delightful,"This hotel is much larger than we expected. That didn't matter, the welcoming was warm and friendly.  The room was very clean and the bathroom was newly fitted and also very clean. Our room was located under the stairs and unfortunately a bit noisy as people walked up and down. The location was great for us as we like to walk around.  A walk into Sandymount Village was lovely.
Great value for money.",5,2019,08,26
247,Lovely lunchtime venue,"Bright, clean and modern surroundings.  Large sunny terrace and lots of bright seating areas inside.  Excellent menu and great value.  Could not fault the food or the friendly service.  Thank you Beate who made a birthday special!",5,2019,08,20
247,"...great location, great service","I stay in the hotel on a regular basis on business. I have always had a warm welcome from Beatrice and her team at reception. The hotel has been refurbished and the rooms are clean, tidy and comfortable. It is in an excellent location convenient to the Dart station with easy access to a range of great restaurants. Well worth a visit!",5,2019,08,20
247,Great,"we (2 adults, 2 kids 16 and 13) arrived early after our flight from New York. The hotel tried everything to give us our room earlier so that we could have some hours sleep.
Comfortable beds, very good breakfast, close to Dublin center (only two stations ride per rail - which is cheap) 
The employees are very polite. 
I forgot my watch in the room and after e-mail contact they found my watch, they even sent it to my home in Austria! PERFECT! They care!
Will come again!",5,2019,08,18
247,Great meal nice restaurant in hotel ,"We had a lovely meal here surroundings pleasant modern in the restaurant, nice staff great service portions far too big but well served, lovely place to relax as we did a group of family having a meal and drinks very nice, staff were all pleasant and relaxed all good, ",5,2019,08,14
247,Dublin horseshow,"Had a two night stay at this hotel. Check in and car parking very good and straight forward.  
Staying in a double room: bed and pillows rather hard but that's the only negative about my stay , staff helpful in supplying fan as room very hot, dinner in restaurant really good and Dave the shuttle bus driver was fab taking us on both days to the RDS for the horseshow which was provided free of charge . 
I would stay here again location excellent for RDS and Aviva stadium .",4,2019,08,12
247,Good location,"Spent 3 nights here celebrating our 20th anniversary. The hotel is "" quirky"" due to how it has been designed (it has grown and now incorporates buildings which were previously separate I believe?) This means that lifts don't always go direct to the floor / room section you want depending where you enter from and floors are a bit uneven but it's quite charming. Room was spacious and comfortable although very warm even with window open.  The DART is close as are local bus services ( 10 minute walk up alongside River Dodder will take you to Ballsbridge) You can purchase a 3 day Leap card for under 20 euros at the airport and use this for DART, bus & some airport buses.  Staff were pleasant though not overly friendly we found. Breakfast was nice and a good variety. 

This was our 4th Dublin visit and wanted this area as we like Sandymount - beautiful area with a very friendly bar / hotel and some nice places to eat. It's nice to be in central Dublin during the day and have somewhere quiet to retire to in the evening!",4,2019,08,10
247,Fantastic stay!,"We got a taxi from the airport which wasn’t expensive, around €30. On arrival the receptionist was very helpful, she gave us a map of the surrounding areas and told us about the hop on bus which arrives at the hotel on certain mornings. Our room was lovely. We had an executive room, we couldn’t believe how big it was! There were truffles and biscuits, a coffee machine - all this was replenished each day. The room was spotless and cleaned to a high standard. The DART station is literally a 5 minute walk around the corner, it’s 3 stops into the city centre - so quick and easy. The Sandymount village is very nice too, with shops and restaurants. The hotel is such a retreat from the busy Dublin City centre, it was a treat to return there each day. Without a doubt we will return and I would 100% recommend this friendly hotel; it would suit all ages and families. Thank you to the staff for making our stay so great. ",5,2019,08,10
247,Warm and Welcoming.,We stayed at the Sandymount on a family holiday in Dublin for  the Horseshow and theatre. We were made welcome and indeed service was very good throughout our stay.The rooms though compact are comfortable and have a great range of facilities.The many public areas around the reception are what contribute most to the relaxing atmosphere in this family run hotel.Breakfast was tasty and set us up nicely for the day. We plan to return.,5,2019,08,08
247,Didn't live up to expectations (in comparison to photos and reviews on website),"I would agree with the description provided by another reviewer on this site that this hotel is basically a dressed-up travel lodge type of accommodation. If that is what you are looking for and you get value for money, then this is fine. On the upside, they do offer family rooms which seem to be in rare supply in Dublin. However, I was hoping for something a little more luxurious. The lobby, entrance and reception area were fine and nicely decorated. Check in was straightforward and efficient. We booked a family room, but it was quite cramped and nothing like the photo. There was a built-in wardrobe and apart from that no room for additional furniture. This hotel is very close to the Aviva stadium and I suspect that it gets quite crowded when there's an event on (given the state of the carpet in the lifts). The layout is a strange combination of houses linked together over the years. To get to our family room, it felt as if we were traveling into the bowels of the building to the basement using some very old, dingy, small lifts with worn out carpet to get there.  
The bathroom was small but spotless. There is a bath with an excellent shower. Only the minimum toiletries are provided. Presumably if you wanted more you could request these. There is a good carpark and parking is free. We chose this hotel just as a change from airport hotels as we thought we had plenty of time the next day to get to the airport. In hindsight, it was not such a clever idea as we could have been badly stuck in traffic heading to the airport if it was a typical workday. Luckily, we were traveling on a Bank holiday Monday, so roads were very quiet. It still took a good 30 mins by car to the airport.
As we arrived very late and departed first thing the next morning, we didn’t get a chance to check out the whole hotel or other facilities. Room service stops at 9:30pm so if you arrive after that you have to stay hungry. I could not see any additional services provided such as laundry etc. There is a kiosk en route to reception which has one computer with internet access (no business centre).
I would recommend this hotel if you want something purely functional and are not looking for too much luxury but it is not a four-star hotel in my opinion.",3,2019,08,08
247,Wonderful Family run Hotel!!,"Another fantastic stay at this lovely Hotel.  I brought my parents and daughter this time and they loved it!!  Well situated for getting about the Dublin area.  The rooms were lovely and clean and comfortable.  We ate in the Line Out Bar every evening and the food was excellent.  All staff were so cheerful and polite and nothing was too much trouble.  We were particularly impressed with Ioanna, Beata, Junior and Michele in the Bar.  It's lovely that the staff seem so happy in their jobs and the service they provided was top notch.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and can't wait till our next visit.",5,2019,08,08
247,Superb.,"Reception staff were extremely friendly on our arrival and offered plenty of advice and help. Room was modern, and spotlessly clean. Good selection of breakfast too, our first time in Dublin and we would definitely recommend staying at Sandymount. ",5,2019,08,07
247,Nice quiet stay.,This hotel I think is not a modern hotel but a nice quiet getaway for a weekend  away. My room was small but with the usual basics in it. Have no complaints at all about room. Staff were very friendly indeed.,5,2019,08,05
247,Bit pricey for an upmarket Premier Inn,"Good location (very close to the Lansdown Road DART) and pleasant staff, but our room was small, featureless and stuffy. Having to leave the window open in the absence of air con meant it was a bit noisy from the busy road outside, as well as the noisy door closures reverberating down the corridors inside. Rambling, and you have to use two different lists to get to some rooms. Reasonable bed, good shower and decent sized tv is about all I can say about the bedroom,  We ate in the Line Out bar and had a decent meal - a ridiculously generous portion of chicken wings was too much for our combined efforts and the wine list is limited, but there are some attractive areas for sitting with a drink, as well as a small outdoor terrace. Parking on site an advantage. All in all, it’s fine, just not that special and a bit expensive for  what it is.",3,2019,08,03
247,Great place,Amazing welcome by bar tender Ivor. Had a glass of wine on my hand before I knew it and the kids were entertained with colouring books before we even sat down. I would come back just for Ivor. The place also has a great beer garden,5,2019,08,02
247,We love this place,"My fiancée booked us to stay here as part of a surprise for my 30th. This was the first place we stayed together almost 10 years ago when it was then called the Mount Herbert Hotel.

Upon hearing the reason for our stay the lady on reception took it upon herself to upgrade our room, which was a lovely gesture. The hotel itself is in immaculate condition. There was a bit of work being done to the front but it had no impact on our stay or experience.

The hotel itself is a bit of a jaunt to the centre of Dublin, so if you don't fancy the walk, there is a Dart station literally around the corner, This is a lot cheaper than paying for a taxi, as they've been known to take the scenic route if they suspect you don't know the city. 

The only aspect of our trip we which could have improved was breakfast, pretty much all of the cooked food was look warm. However, we were down quite late for breakfast so this may have impacted it.",4,2019,07,31
247,Family stay / room,"Stayed here initially for a couple of nights in Dublin before going on into Ireland & then again for one night in our return. 
First stay was excellent. Family room was large, clean, modern, light & airy & had everything you could want when a family of 4 are staying in one room. Service from staff was also good. 
Close enough to Dublin & with the benefit of the pleasant little village of Sandymount within walking distance. 

Second stay was a totally different experience. Not happy at all. 
We got a much smaller, dark, cramped family room with a very small window. No air conditioning so have a large enough window is important with 4 bodies in a room. Not up to standard & certainly not worth the increased rate we paid for the single night. 
We arrived late & tired & left early for a ferry; so I couldn’t face the time & effort to complain. But this really spoilt the experience & I would think twice before I booked into this hotel again. 
I would suggest other families do complain if they get such a small & inferior family room. 
Reduced to 3 stars because of our 2nd visit. Pathetically small & cramped family room at a much higher rate. 👎🏻
",3,2019,07,27
247,Lunch ,"We just had dinner in the Sandymount hotel, myself and 3 children. We sat outside in the garden and had a lovely meal. Elida and Ivor who work in the bar area were really friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make a fuss of the kids.  I would definitely come back especially as you can sit outside which is nice with kids.",5,2019,07,22
247,Faultless,"What more could you ask for or expect? This hotel delivers everything it promises in comfort with style. 
The bedrooms are exceptionally clean, quiet and comfortable which as a business traveller like myself is what I’m looking for.
Excellent WiFi , unlike the so called 5 star I stayed in just days before, and great facilities both in the room ( tea making etc plus ironing board and hairdryer) and throughout the hotel. 
The buffet style breakfast has a wide range of quality produce while tea is brought promptly to your table.
The hotel is close to Sandymount village which was a lovely short stroll away. Perfect for its pubs, restaurants and shops.
When booking this hotel you can see that it’s NOT in the heart of Dublin itself, which for me is s huge bonus as with every city there is the noise and pollution to deal with. This was one of the deciding factors for me in booking this hotel. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel to my colleagues and other business travellers and will certainly be back",5,2019,07,21
247,Excellent hotel & excellent service,Excellent service & excellent hotel for a business trip in Dublin. Perfect location 2 min from Dart Station and convenient outside parking for guests (no extra fee for parking). 5 stars for Belen and Beatrice!! Thank you!!,5,2019,07,20
247,Fabulous hotel,We stayed there last Saturday night & had a lovely stay there. Our room was great..clean relaxing  great. The food wad great both our evening meal & breakfast were just lovely. A big thank you to all the staff who are all so friendly & attentive. Also thanks to Beatrice at reception..we are looking forward to our next stay there already. Thanks again to all in Sandymount hotel.,5,2019,07,19
247,I recommend it for a visit to Dublin,"The hotel is not in Dublin city centre, but only ten minutes away by train. It is near Aviva stadion and just far enough away from Dublin harbor. Rooms are very nice, staff most helpful, and the restaurant or bar offer great breakfast or dinner",5,2019,07,17
247,Service and attention counts!,From check in through to dinner (and a good menu with choice) and then breakfast ... when instead of having to ask I am offered options (very rare).. staff standards are high here. Well done. Very busy but well managed. Top job.,5,2019,07,16
247,Amazing service,"The wait staff in the bar, especially Ivor, was wonderful. Nice, attentive, and welcoming! You definitely have to stop buy and get a pint at the bar from this wonderful establishment  Would highly recommend. ",5,2019,07,13
247,Best weekend ever,"We stayed in the Sandymount Herbert Road as part of Make-A-Wish weekend.  The hotel was absolutely beautiful and the cleanliness was outstanding.  All of the staff were so kind and could not do enough for us.  The food was absolutely beautiful,  there was absolutely nothing we could complain about.  We would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a real treat.  Thank you to you all  for such a fabulous weekend and your kindness we will always remember",5,2019,07,13
247,Great Hotel,Very pleasant hotel. Stayed here for 3 nights.  Room very clean and comfortable and serviced daily. Large bar and restaurant. Food was very nice. Close to Aviva Arena.  The Big Bus Sightseeing tour bus did a pick up service from the hotel into Dublin which was very handy.  Dart train just a few minutes walk away too.  Staff very helpful.,5,2019,07,13
247,Great service and nice hotel ,"I booked a room for my parents and sister who were staying in Dublin for the a couple of nights. The staff did everything to make them enjoy their stay. The hotel is in a great location and is very clean. They had a lovely, large room. Thank you to management and staff for making it a fantastic trip!",5,2019,07,13
247,Probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in,"I was looking for a place to stay close to holles street as my wife had given birth to our son. I was looking to check in early in the morning as had been awake all night. Rang some other hotels and was told check in was 2pm in a most unpleasant manner. 

So i rang Sandymount hotel and told them the situation and the lady on the phone was so kind and said no problem at all. Stayed for 2 nights. Every member of staff i met was genuinely friendly and helpful, and to have that kind of friendly service when your exhausted and stressed is worth more than anything. 

The food was amazing. Great buffet breakfast and great bar food (line out burger is savage)

Free parking was a god send for me, as there is only on street parking around holles street which is €2.90 an hour. Could walk to holles street and not worry about getting clamped.

I'm looking forward to coming back to stay here in the future with my family. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to all my friends and family. ",5,2019,07,10
247,Overnighter,"Well placed for pleasant strolls round Ballsbridge and Sandymount and easy to find right by the rugby ground (why don't they use post codes in Ireland?!). Food quality and quantity is good, though the afternoon tea service was poor. Parking plentiful, check in and out can be busy. Room was small,as was bathroom, and the set out of rooms made you feel like it was a nursing home. Can be noisy due to being surrounded by the car park and the corridors. Staff were friendly. It sounds daft but as mentioned by another review the room curtains are thick enough but due to their fitting \style, they let far too much light in around the outer edges!!",3,2019,07,09
247,Hen party,"Stayed here for two nights and would highly recommend this hotel . Eight of us stayed here and we all had lovely clean rooms 
We payed extra for breakfast which was €14.95 but well worth it .
We checked out at midday and we kept our luggage in the lockup room till we got picked up
We had to get a taxi into the main part of Dublin which was €15 .
Would definitely stay here again",5,2019,07,08
247,Wonderful service and nice rooms,"Stayed here on business for a couple of nights (separated by a couple of days in Belfast).  The rooms were light and clean, the beds were supremely comfortable.  The only little gripe (and this is purely nit-picking) was the bathrooms are slightly small.

15 minutes from the ferry, Euro13 from Temple Bar (by taxi), ample parking.

Almost perfect!",5,2019,07,08
247,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel with helpful staff. 

Nice modern rooms with really comfortable beds and TVs. 

Do yourself a favour and go to the Line Out bar and try the massive Line Out Burger! One of the best burgers anywhere!",5,2019,07,07
247,Fantastic!!!,This hotel was such a pleasant surprise. We booked it last minute and hoped for the best. We were greeted excellently at reception and treated so well. We were treated to an upgrade and chocolates in the room. The hotel was beautiful. The room was clean and spacious with comfy beds. Breakfast was excellent. Great stay! Thank you to the hotel!,5,2019,07,06
247,Lovely hotel!,"Stayed here for a night and would stay again! Staff were so attentive and friendly, a credit to the place. Lovely bar food in a lovely setting. Rooms were really nice and spotless. Parking is plentiful",5,2019,07,02
247,"Average, great for a night or two","Spent 3 nights here recently with my husband. It is in a great location, we were able to walk to several nearby villages and the Dart train station was just a 5 minute walk. Our room was large but the bathroom was quite small, likely due to the way the hotel was constructed. The staff members were pleasant and helpful. There are no cooling systems (fans, AC systems, etc), which would be ok if the windows had screens. Had a bird fly right in while we were trying to cool the room! There is nowhere to store food or drink if you want to bring them to the hotel. The food at the hotel was not horrible, but quite expensive in relation the quality. Overall 3.5 stars!",3,2019,06,29
247,Be careful the dates you choose to stay,"Good hotel, staff were really good and attentive and helpful. Food was good and served quickly considering how busy they were. Room was very good and clean. HOWEVER. I was absolutely RIPPED OFF for the room because I didn't look what was going on at the RDS beforehand and there was a concert on that night. Make sure you also check what is happening at the Aviva stadium too. Breakfast was good too, but at the price I expect scrambled eggs made wit eggs not powdered egg. Getting to the rooms a bit odd too.",4,2019,06,28
247,Friendly & helpful,"All the staff at the Sandymount are very friendly and helpful. Dave's shuttle bus service was particularly good; lots of local knowledge and insight. The lobby areas are all well presented and clean, as were the rooms.",5,2019,06,26
247,Great lunch and slick service!,"Lunched alone early in the week - refreshing to see different options outside of the soup and sandwiches (which I know the punters demand...) Prices fair I thought- soup or fries with the sandwiches. I chose the roasted cauliflower salad- so easy to kill with dressing or complicate with too many ingredients. Delighted with generous portion, super fresh ingredients, interesting add one Ike macadamia nuts and a spicy kick. Thoughtfully prepared and cooked with love and therefore great value. Bad service can kill an experience- in this case, there were big smiles, efficiency and then a well-judged check in after I got my food. Well done all! 👏",5,2019,06,26
247,Not a Bad Hotel for a Night or Two,"My normal hotels were booked in Dublin in early June do to concerts and general tourism.  I stayed two nights at the Sandymount.  This hotel has the right bones but needs a little more work.  The room I was initially assigned was both small and it smelled.  When I pointed this out to the front desk, they sent someone out, agreed and moved me.  The second room was better--it didn't smell.

The public rooms are fairly basic and somewhat dated.  They're fine.

There is a great fireplace in the entry area.  It was lit when I initially entered the hotel and was allowed to burn out.  It was never lit again during my visit--even though it continued to rain.  Afterall, it's Dublin; it's always raining.

The location is very close to the stadium.  That is a big plus and a calling card for the hotel.  One night; attending something at the stadium; this hotel makes perfect sense.",4,2019,06,24
247,Forget the lovely photos of rooms on the website!,"Two-night stay - never again. We were given Rm 601, and told it was down the corridor to the right. We finally found the room, after going down a corridor, up three steps, around a corner, down another corridor, down three steps, around another corner, down a full flight of stairs (while lugging suitcases and hand luggage), and around another corner. Tucked into a corner of a small corridor was the door to a tiny room. There was barely enough room to move from one side of the room to the other. Side tables placed so that you banged legs as you got in and out of bed. Ensuite so small that there was no room for toilet roll (which was placed on a shelf behind toilet). One suitcase had to be placed on floor in front of the door. Following morning Reception ""discovered"" that we had a small room and offered to move us much later that day. This was not feasible for us as we were going to be out all day (and not getting back until late at night) and we already had washing hanging around the room drying. To add insult to injury they made us pay for breakfasts each morning rather than include them as compensation.",1,2019,06,24
247,Great hotel,"Just returned from a lovely one night stay at the hotel. We arrived an hour before our check in time and they had our room ready for us. The room was lovely and quite a good size. The hotel is in an excellent location and is just a 2 min walk from the nearest station where u can get the DART. We had a few enquiries during our stay and we found the reception staff very friendly and helpful. We had dinner in the bar and it was very nice and the restaurant staff were also very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was served in the dining room and was very tasty with a good selection of cereals, pasteries and hot food. We would definitely stay here again. ",4,2019,06,23
247,ECO Award Winning Hotel,"This Hotel does not ""Rest on its Laurels"", and the continuous improvements and attention to detail continues from the Owner, Management and Staff. Following the recent upgrades to the Hotel, it offers great value in its location which has convenient access to Dart, Ballsbridge, Sandmount, and local beach. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner is catered for in a professional, varied manner, and the products are top class. Going back Years the Sandymount Hotel has provided Eco friendly technology including an Ecar charging station (before they were the current Buzz Word) LED outside floodlighting...varied Cistern flushes, and have now in their retrofit converted most lighting to LED. One advance I would like to see is the removal of the small toiletry bottles (Shampoo/Conditioner/Wash) to be replaced with fillable dispensers.....John and Crew take note!!! Décor is bright and well maintained, kept neat and tidy by an excellent friendly facilities staff. Rooms are spotless. Always a friendly welcome at the Sandmount Check in desk which is ruled over by the ""Queen of the Sandymount"" Beatrice. Rooms sizes and types vary but even the smallest has sufficient space for the traveller. Hotel also has a selection of Meeting rooms for in house conferences, and very close to the Aviva Conference area. Free parking and High Speed WiFi is free.",5,2019,06,23
247,"Good Food, Baffling Layout","The hotel restaurant is good size and churn out good food. The staff - both nights we've had Beata and Elida. They're lovely and efficient.

The hotel was made from two houses, so the layout is very confusing. The rooms are clean and simple.",4,2019,06,22
247,Not good enough. Overpriced and bad service,"For what it is, this hotel is really over priced. The food is okay but expensive. The room I had was also expensive but shabby and small. The reception areas are tired and uninspiring. The reception staff are poor. I waited 40 minutes for a taxi before being told it ""had been cancelled"". Code for forgotten.  So now I'm walking to an appointment and already late. I've just found out I'll be travelling to Dublin 2 or 3 times a month. I won't be staying here.",1,2019,06,21
247,Stay for Concert,"We stayed one night for a concert at the RDS.  The location was excellent, a short walk to and from the venue.  The room was lovely and spacious and had very comfortable beds.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,06,20
247,Leisure ,"Nice hotel, rooms basic but newly decorated and clean. Great atmosphere in the bar and very helpful staff. Stayed for a concert in the RDS which is a 10min walk and close to the Aviva Stadium. Bars and restaurants within walking distance and a short walk to the Dart train into town or 30min walk. All in all would recommend staying here and will be back.",4,2019,06,19
247,More Hostel than Hotel,Full payment taken on entry (never a good sign). When I got to my room it had a massive iron burn mark on carpet immediately inside door. Room was comfortable but very budget and nothing like the pictures. Lots of old winding corridors through houses to get to the room. I was charged 296euro which is an obscene amount for a room in a budget hotel. Booked two weeks in advance but it was a busy night in Dublin so beware of this charging policy - I wasn't happy when I got there and found out what my 300euro got me.... staff were embarrassed when I queried the price and had no answer for why I was charged so much. Disgrace!,1,2019,06,19
247,Great location,"Great location with onsite carpark and close to Dart if not driving. comfortable and clean rooms if a little stuffy could do with A/C or a fan
Nice Bar with great selection of drinks and great bar menu. Recomend the chicken wing ",4,2019,06,19
247,Disappointment,"
room 136, I believe it was, is a small box room, contains a double bed which is comfortable. However the room is not large enough to accommodate both the double bed and dressing table, making it next to impossible to reach the window. to draw curtains. In order to close curtain or open this ground floor, front facing window you need to crawl across or else jump over the bed....good luck with that ! Somewhere in the corridor there lies a swing door which bangs whenever someone passes through it....this happens too often to allow peaceful sleep. 

The room is more akin to the box room in ""Mrs Murphy's B and B......and at 215 Euro for a Wednesday night stay is way over priced, for what you get....a Thursday or Friday night stay will cost you a good deal more money...quite staggering ! I should say I reported my feelings to a very polite and helpful Manager Mate, upon check out....he apologized and promised to make amends on a future visit !",2,2019,06,19
247,Satisfactory,Enjoyed our stay . Room was a bit too warm. Was disappointed when we got back from concert that there was no food available.  We were not the only ones thought this. Found breakfast a struggle in trying to get waiters attention but overall very satisfied. Would return ,4,2019,06,19
247,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic location","From the moment of arrival, we were made to feel so welcome at this hotel. Modern, with all traditions of excellent customer service, its location (right beside Aviva and short walk from RDS) and parking make Sandymount the ideal place to stay in Dublin. Sadly our plans changed and we had to leave after our event so can’t comment on comfort of beds 😩",5,2019,06,19
247,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is lovely even though they was delay with check in off over 2hrs, the staff were soooo nice so overall very happy..location was great to the rds..it was slighty over priced even more so than the city centre ",4,2019,06,19
247,Fabulous place,Fabulous place with friendly helpful staff. Lovely rooms. Amazing breakfast. So ideal for concert in rds. Less than 10 min walk. Reception mya that I dealt with couldn't so any more for us. Nothing was a bother and she was as very reassuring. Pleasure to deal with. Get customer service. Definitely would say again. Thanks for a lovely stay ,5,2019,06,18
247,Pleasant surprise,"When we first arrived and saw the outside a part from the big bronzed statue It looked very ordinary and thought what was waiting for us inside.
What a pleasant surprise the inside is very tastefully decorated, the reception is a little on the small side if lots of people arrive at the same time but the staff are very friendly and helpful. bar and restaurant was near to each other but only the bar serve lunch and dinner as they do a lot of events. The food in the bar is excellent and the staff cannot do enough for you.
The rooms are clean tidy and our bathroom was on the small side but did the job there are tea and coffee in room and water which was handy, WiFi was good on the hole I will definitely come back as it is situated very well for concert goers.",5,2019,06,18
247,Long weekend With my wife,"Stayed at Sandymount for 3 nights as we were going to Bon Jovi at the Rds arena on the saturday.
Arrived late afternoon on Friday, was welcomed and the receptionist double checked with me my booking confirming breakfast for all days then clearly told us breakfast times and other useful hotel information.
Room: The room was very nice and comfortable with lovely bed and modern bathroom.
Evening meal in the one line bar and restaurant was amazing the one line burger was amazing and the bar had a great selection of drinks all served cheerfully by the barman who acknowledged us whenever we saw him in the bar or in passing.
The waiters and waitresses did a marvellous job without trying to rush you like some hotels do.
Breakfast: There was a good selection of fruit, pasteries, full English breakfasts with white and black pudding with also cereal and you must try the soda bread.
After the concert on Saturday night we got back to the hotel at around midnight and the hotel provides freshly baked pizza to guests for 13 euros and after a 20 minute wait a fresh pizza was served to us.
The hotel is perfectly located as it is a ten minute walk to the RDS ARENA and if you want to walk into Dublin centre you can do this in about 35 minutes or you can catch the bus but as the day was good we walked.
FInally I must comment on how the reception staff were the most helpful I have experienced as they gave us hotel made maps and were happy to draw on it so we know what routes to follow and what streets to look for,I even asked if they have a printer I could use to print off my return flight ticket as I had forgotten to do this and the receptionist said I could email them to their inbox and she printed them for me straight away.
The entire staff were friendly and willing to do anything for you without making you feel awkward and the receptionists day and night could not be more helpful.
I really recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit dublin and will be looking forward to staying with them again 10/10",5,2019,06,18
247,Bon Jovi Stay,"Hotel reception staff lovely,  room was very clean, modern but lacked any finishing touches which made it feel basic,  given that it was the most I had ever paid for a 2 night stay anywhere I was expecting it to be very nice.  Breakfast was a frustrating experience,  buffet style within a  small area of a relatively small dining room,  so many people queuing for food that had run out waiting to be replaced whilst what was on their plate went cold,  staff however were very busy and worked very hard,  the dining area is simply inadequate for the volume of guests.",4,2019,06,18
247,A Total Rip Off,The room was the smallest I have ever been in. The bathroom was ridiculously small - there was barely enough room to sit on the toilet as it was sandwiched really tightly in between the shower and the sink. There was hardly any soundproofing between us and the next room - we could quite clearly hear the guy in the next room showering. And then there's the cost - €359 for this room and that was without breakfast. Just because there was a concert on nearby.,1,2019,06,18
247,Another fantastic stay,"Lovely large room with excellent shower/bathroom.  Plenty of choice at breakfast and excellent food served in bar.  Great service experienced at all levels from check-in, cleaners, bar staff and waiting staff.",5,2019,06,18
247,Fleetwood mac trip,Amazing hotel. Very attentive friendly staff. Lovely surprise birthday card n expensive chocolates for one of the guests. The room was spacious for 3.  The decor very tasteful n we ended up in the restaurant twice due to the quality of the service n food.  It wAs a skip to the city centre n if needed taxis available on tap.  One of the best places I’ve stayed in Dublin. Highly recommend this hotel. Can’t wait to stay again. ,5,2019,06,17
247,My experience!,"Old hotel, some rooms renovated. My experience with 105 terrible(cool room without operation of heating. Next day change to 455, excellent.
Breakfast good, restaurant-bar  very good! 
Close to Aviva stadium where we had our conference.
Need for more ammenities like slippers.",3,2019,06,17
247,Bon Jovi,"We stayed here last night. I booked because it's only 10 minutes walk from the RDS and the DART station is 5 minutes walk away. Because the hotel is made up of several houses put together it's very narrow. Lift B is a bit of a schlep from Reception if your mobility is limited. Our room was a twin and it was big enough for 2 but some of the double rooms looked very small. Breakfast was lovely but because the hotel was full the queue was a mile long and there was only one toaster.
All the staff we met were lovely. 
We will be back but not when there's anything on in the Aviva or the RDS",4,2019,06,17
247,Good for Stadiums,"We chose this hotel because it was close by the RDS stadium where we were seeing Fleetwood Mac and it can be a nightmare to get a taxi after a big concert - so we wanted to be able to walk back.

The hotel itself is average. In some respects it ie very good. For example, the service is excellent as is the bar and restaurant within the hotel. You can get a great cup of coffee which is important to me!

However, the rooms are tired and generally the hotel is in need of modernisation and redecoration. The gym is inadequate - three cardio machines and some dumbbells (but no weight bench) that go up to just 10Kg!

So a mixed review. It was fine for the price but no more which is why I give it an average rating.",3,2019,06,17
247,Stayed in June 2019,"Hotel was nice but rooms could do with a spruce up: black out curtains/or curtains that actually fit the window area needed if your room is located front of the hotel as the hotel outside lights/lamps far too bright & room light all night, barely sleep. Very noisy outside road traffic/deliveries from 6am onwards. Bedroom wall lamps in dire need of changing, ripped & tatty, not what you expect for over €200 plus a night ex.breakfast.",3,2019,06,17
247,An off day???,"Being local I regularly call into the Sandymount Hotel for lunch.  Was there for Fathers day with my son and it resembled  a ""war zone"", a bit chaotic.  It took what appeared like an age to order the food and I felt sorry for the two attentive staff members running around, clearly doing their best to look after the customers against the odds., with the numbers. After ordering our food we settled with a drink  but the food took approx 40 mins to arrive (maybe a backlog in kitchen too), by which time our patience was gone.  The nice young man Naggis? was polite  and apologised and did his best  We ate quickly (can't remember if it was good or bad)  and left disappointed and annoyed .   I have to admit I have enjoyed many good lunches there, granted it was busy and it seems  to have been an off day.  Come on Sandymount Hotel you can do better!",2,2019,06,17
247,Weekend Trip,"Beautiful Location in a very nice Environment of sandymount. Easy to use the DART to enter the City centre. The Restaurant provides good Quality, the Rooms are clean, but the beds are quite poor. So the Sleep is not the best. 
",4,2019,06,17
247,"Clean, comfortable rooms.","We had a nice room, clean and comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful. Good location for RDS and Aviva stadiums. Close to Lansdowne station for the DART into the city. We had mixed experience of Line bar - one day a nice lunch, the next day we ate late afternoon and it was busy, service slower and food not as good. Bedroom doors all have heavy closures so loud, particularly a problem in the night - as with a lot of hotels the hotel is fine but the people staying there can be inconsiderate at night. Didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment.",4,2019,06,16
247,Very nice!,"Sandymount Hotel was great!  Clean, spacious room, comfortable beds, housekeeping was fantastic, delicious breakfast buffet, friendly staff.  The hotel is just a short walk from the Lansdowne Dart station. Highly recommended!",5,2019,06,16
247,One night in Dublin,A friendly hotel which was very busy. Long queue to checkin and then had to queen for pretty much everything as it was fully booked. A shuttle bus runs to the 3 arena and the staff are very helpful. Good breakfast ,4,2019,06,16
247,A bit overpriced....,"Lovely, clean & modern hotel but for the price of the room we were shocked at how expensive it was! On check in we discovered that breakfast wasn't even included! We were going to a concert in the rds so thats why we stayed here but i can honestly say i wouldnt be going back. On a plus the bar food is lovely however breakfast & the coffee was cold 🤔",4,2019,06,16
247,"Appalling! Noisy and uncomfortable rooms, incompetent staff, poor service all round","We stayed 4 nights in this horrible hotel. The curtains did not fit properly in the windows allowing the lights in the car park to shine into the room all night. The room was hot and stuffy, staff were incompetent and unfriendly and the there was an unacceptable amount of noise due to staff setting up and dismantling a marquis late at night, children running feral through the hotel and grounds until late at night and dreadful food and service in the hotel bar.",1,2019,06,14
247,"Nice, but it.s an business hotel.","We stay two nights for an holiday in ireland and we had very good hotels. This hotel was   
Also good but for us it was to business. We had a small en dark room. And the shower was broken. The food and drinks at the bar where good.",3,2019,06,14
247,My stay at sandymount hotel,The room was clean and quiet.  The staff was helpful and very gracious.  We picked this hotel because it afforded us a place outside of the bustle of downtown Dublin.  It turned out that this hotel was just a short walk to a train stop into the city.,4,2019,06,14
247,Lovely stay in a lovely hotel,"My cousin's and I stayed in a family room in the hotel this week as we were at a concert in the 3Arena.  The staff were very helpful and lovely at check in, and when we had any questions.  The hotel was spotless, and the room was perfect for what we needed.  

I will definitely stay in the Sandymount again!",5,2019,06,14
247,Business trip,"Just back from a three night business stay in the Sandymount Hotel. 
The room was spotless and had lots of tea and coffee making facilities.

Slept well and the room was very quiet even one night during an international match at the Aviva.",5,2019,06,12
247,Lovely Hotel right near the port,"Stay one night before getting very .. staff lovely friendly rooms clean and comfortable 
Food in bar was great and staff friendly .
Was told when booking where was nice to go local had a nice walk to seafront ",4,2019,06,12
247,Our stay,"Nice hotel, sadly our room overlooked the kitchen back door, not an issue normally but for the cost of the  room rate l would have better.
Why do l have to complete 200 characters, spoilt this experience.
Otherwise all good",4,2019,06,12
247,Best guest service at beautiful hotel!,"Warm greetings from the front desk at check in, and any other time throughout our stay.  Beatrice was the kindest personn - helping us get luggage stored, help/advice for the days activities, and directions to get to Brownes coffee shop just blocks away.  Great location, easy to get downtown on the DART.  
Room was very comfortable, spacious - had three beds for two people!",5,2019,06,11
247,Lovely hotel in great location,"We stayed 2 nights as we were going to a football match at the Aviva stadium. It couldn’t be any closer to the stadium and is situated in a nice quiet residential area. The staff are very warm and friendly, and the decor and cleanliness of the hotel was excellent. The breakfast which we purchased when we checked in (at a reduced rate) was very good. There was something for everyone in the buffet and the pastries were delicious! Our room was comfy and perfect for our needs. My son was impressed with the choice of TV channels as this isn’t a priority in most other hotels we’ve stayed in. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone attending a match or concert at the Aviva as it’s location is perfect.

Thanks to all the staff, and well done, Irene.",5,2019,06,10
247,Very good value compared to the inflated prices of too many other hotels...,"When all the other hotels in Dublin are looking for over €300 due to demand, The Sandymount is an ideal location. Friendly staff, clean and modern rooms, nice bar, great stay. Thanks to all the staff at the Sandymount Hotel for a lovely stay. ",4,2019,06,09
247,Super expensive,"As a frequent business traveller to Switzerland, the UK, Germany, Ireland, the USA and Canada I found the room very expensive for the quality of product and location. The room was pleasant and acceptable.",3,2019,06,08
247,Bathroom multiple defects - after more than 40 previous nights/stays this was the first real bad experience,Bathroom multiple defects - after more than 40 previous nights/stays this was the first real bad experience staying at Sandymount Hotel. It would have been great if the hotel would recognize my loyalty and offered good compensation,1,2019,06,08
247,Christening and 1st Birthday Party,"We recently had our Son’s Christening and 1st birthday party in the garden area of the hotel, fantastic location. 

The staff were amazing on the day and were extremely attentive, namely Octavio & Joao.",5,2019,06,07
247,Best city location for a family friendly event with delicious food!,"We had our son's 1st birthday / Christening celebration at the hotel. We booked the garden terrace area so all the children could happily play without disturbing other guests! From start to finish the whole experience with the staff was exceptional! Siobhán in Events met all our needs and requests through the booking process. The staff on Reception, Bea and the team, were extremely welcoming and helpful. And the dining staff were without a doubt the most polite and accommodating team I have come across in a long time!! My family and friends have not stopped complimenting the venue, staff and the really tasty BBQ spread. Thank you so much for making our day so wonderful! (We actually returned the next day to collect our car and were well looked after, once again). We will be back .... if you will have us ;-)",5,2019,06,07
247,First Time at Sandymount,"Great value in Dublin, very nice boutique hotel.  Single room was a bit on the small side, but still suitable for one individual.  Very helpful and knowledgeable staff, they were very accommodating to a last minute request for a change.                                                            ",4,2019,06,07
247,Amazing,"When we arrived we was welcomed and checked in by a very friendly and happy lady, the decor at reception and around it was beautiful. We got to our room via a lift to the 3rd floor (super handy because I am currently in a splint), the bedroom was so clean and fresh, it was very warm so we opened the window. We got a free shuttle to the 3arena by a lovely gent.
Once we were back from the show I noticed that my freeze pack for my diabetic injection had defreezed and I panicked as the room has no fridge, I spoke to a member of staff and they put it in the freezer and the injection pen in the fridge overnight, I found this amazing as I honestly expected them to say no.
We had the breakfast in the morning, a good variety of cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, fry up and fresh juices.
I really enjoyed myself and felt like I was at home and comfortable.",5,2019,06,06
247,Cozy hotel with a high standard,"It was a great time in a wonderful hotel.
It looked small outside but many rooms inside. Breakfast was good, many items to choce.
Nice and very clean room. No noise of other guest or from outside. Small edges next to the floors to sit,  stay, to enjoy a drink or to read a book.
Reception very friendly and competent.
Many flyers with maps and adventure in and around Dublin.",5,2019,06,06
247,Such a friendly and relaxing stay,"Been staying at Sandymount Hotel for some years and each year it gets better and better.  Great additional modern rooms, lovely friendly staff (and here you have THE Hotel Receptionist of the year for Dublin looking after you - Beatrice :-).  Although the hotel is not in the centre of the city, you are not far from it and if you are rugby fans - then the Aviva Stadium is a stones throw away.  Highly recommend Sandymount Hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2019,06,05
247,Sandymount Hotel,"I stayed here for the bank holiday, and on the site the bedrooms look lovely and spacious, like a nice hotel room normally looks like, however these bedrooms, although they look like standard 4 star classic bedrooms, are actually the executive rooms - the classic rooms are much, much smaller, like a room in a house with a small bathroom. It felt less like a hotel and more like we were staying in someone’s spare bedroom. I wouldn’t mind this but the price was far too high for such a low standard. €113 for a small room for 1 night with no breakfast included. ",2,2019,06,05
247,Quiet place to stay,"It is a quiet to stay in Dublin. Free parking is good for client driving a car. The room is tidy and clean. 

But, I am a bit disappointed that no refrigerator is provided. To be environmental, the water provided should not be contained in a glass bottle with hotel logo sticker on it. ",4,2019,06,05
247,"Nice hotel, accommodating staff & excellent breakfast",Location is little farther from where the hustle & bustle of touristy life is experienced but still very much accessible to transportation. Cab service was requested the night before & promptly available next day.,4,2019,06,03
247,5* service ,"Fantastic service from all the staff. The function room was set up for everyone arriving, food was gorgeous, great selection of sandwiches & cakes. Definitely a 5 star service & will be visiting again ",5,2019,06,03
247,Great Hotel,Great Hotel in a great location. Easy to get to and from town. Never had to wait more that 4 minutes for a taxi and any time of the day. Breakfast buffet has a great selection and food was great. Free and secure parking was huge bonus.,5,2019,06,03
247,Hugh Jackman's in town,What a fantastic hotel. We will be back sooner rather than later. The staff were amazing and the hotel was beautiful in a really nice part of Dublin city and still only a short walk to local amenities.,5,2019,06,03

247,Comfortable and quiet,"A quiet, cosy, very pleasant and relaxed hotel. The bed was very comfortable with good breakfast options. The hotel is located close to a DART station. Stayed here a couple of days to prepare for a meeting. There was no air conditioning in the room (which normally in Ireland is not a problem) but the room was facing south and was a bit warm around noon.",4,2019,06,02
247,Stellar stay,"I used trip advisor to weed through hotels in Dublin and after I decided on and booked with Sandymount the great 
experience began.  A week or ten days before our trip I received an email from the reservation desk making sure we were still planning on being there and even told them thanks for staying in touch. As the trip got closer and became reality it was nice to know they were ready for us and there would be no surprises when we got there. The only surprises we experienced were those of a pleasant nature. 
Everyday the stay took better care of us than anyone ever has. 
From the front desk who booked a train/bus tour for us that we wanted to go on, to the housekeeping staff who took care of us in our room for a week to the great breakfast staff who fed us every morning. 
Everyone was so friendly and so willing to make sure we had and did everything we wanted to do it was simply amazing. 
We definitely made a great decision to stay at Sandymount and would recommend it to anyone!
Thank you thank you thank you Sandymount!",5,2019,06,02
247,Great stay ,"Great hotel for a one night stay in Dublin. Would recommend a visit to the bar, Ivor is the best bar man I have met ever. Over all a lovely stay . A great hotel and great location, taxis were very hard to get on a Saturday night .",5,2019,06,01
247,Lovely stay,"Just back from a lovely stay ,the rooms were spotless ,food was excellent and we loved the garden.Very close to city center on the train .Thanks to all the staff for making our trip so enjoyable.We will be back",5,2019,06,01
247,Excellent place to be and easy access to downtown by Train,"Excellent place to be and easy access to go downtown by Train ( I recommend to take a Leap card to go around we bought it in the airport and it can be refilled at the train station or in many shops downtown) 
Excellent breakfast above the average and very good Food for dinner for a price aligned on restaurants( We could even order a pizza for a good price and have it brought in the room to the joy of our son) 
Check the prices depending on days booked you can have a better price ( try to be out of the weekend, prices  then competes with B&B prices and the comfort and service  is really higher )",5,2019,06,01
247,Sandymount resident.,As a local resident I frequently come to the Sandymount Hotel which is set in lovely gardens. I always receive a great welcome there. I regularly eat in the Bar. The staff are really friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. I very much appreciate having this family owned hotel in the area. I meet friends there too. The parking is very good and the free Wifi is excellent. In cold weather there is a lovely open fire in the lobby area.,5,2019,05,31
247,Excellent services as allways,"Attended from.belfast for a child's christing/first birthday party , service was excellent as was the food ! Extremely accomodating staff and a lovely hotel in general ! Beatrice on reception was delightful as allways , highly recommend hotel for any function or night away 😊",5,2019,05,31
247,Short break,"Arriving at reception, very helpful  
Only down side, well two actually 
Room was very small and had a single in it as well as a double 
As a result when had very little room to monuver  No view just a blank wall 
And also I was disappointed when I went downtown to reception In the morning to get a coffee I was charged 4 euros I'd of like to thought  out of courtesy that would of been given 
As i had no coffee left in my room ",3,2019,05,31
247,Nice & pleasant,"Really nice hotel with helpful staff and cute rooms. A dart stop is 5 minutes away, the neighborhood is quiet and nice for walking. They have kettles for tea and instant coffee in the rooms. Nothing negative to say about our stay! ",5,2019,05,31
247,Fantastic improvements,"Just back from a return visit to one of the best hotels in Dublin. Great improvements with the new extension. New beds and decor and the beds are so comfy. Great parking and wi-fi everywhere and free which is rare these days. The parking is brilliant for Dart, RDS, Aviva, Grand Canal and even the 3 Arena usa stroll away on a nice evening. The bar staff are most welcoming and the food is gorgeous and hard to get nicer anywhere else. 
The reception staff are so nice and helpful and even telephoning to make an enquiry the reservation staff are most helpful. The location is quiet yet you are 5 mins walk from anywhere you may want.
Definately will be back.",5,2019,05,31
247,Very good,"Clean hotel with a lot of rooms. recently done up. Rooms are very large so plenty of space. I would stay again. They have a nice restaurant, areas to sit and do work and lots of free car parking space. All in all, a good find.",5,2019,05,30
247,Short but lovely stay,"Stayed on the 26th of May for one night and found the Hotel a lovely, clean and friendly place. Breakfast was included and was plentiful with a mix of cooked and Continental so something for everybody.
Will stay here again whenever we are in Dublin.",5,2019,05,29
247,Enjoyable stay at the Sandymount,"A long weekend in Dublin staying in a Classic twin room (one double and one single bed), apparently in the new extension.  The room was quite small but had most of what we needed including a safe, which is essential, and was nicely decorated.  The shower room could have done with a shelf or two as there was nowhere to put stuff.  The shower enclosure had a transparent screen across approx. 2/3 of the area.  It could have done with a shower door in the other 1/3 to stop water escaping onto the floor.  There was no control to modify the heated towel rail which caused the room to be very hot and stuffy overnight.  A fan was provided on the last night to help sort out this issue.  The beds were comfy and the storage in the wardrobe and drawers adequate.  All noises in the surrounding area could be heard, presumably because the walls in the new extension are quite thin.  The bar in the hotel was lovely with good food served and a great outside area.  We only had breakfast on one morning as we prefer to eat freshly prepared breakfast rather than a buffet breakfast.  It was only alright.  If you want to eat breakfast out I would recommend the Orange Goat, which is about 5 mins away.  The reception staff were very helpful and friendly.  I would stay here again but would try an upgraded room, if available.",4,2019,05,29
247,Overnight Stay,"Lovely Quiet Location and yet accessible to Dart -Buses etc. with extensive free parking
Only a 30 minute stroll to Stephen's Green
Being an overnight stay we only used the dining room for Breakfast which was an excellent Buffet.",4,2019,05,29
247,Great service and comfortable,Good family owned hotel with friendly staff and comfortable rooms. There is no air conditioning though in the rooms and it gets a bit hot. Good friendly staff and good breakfast selection. Good location near the train and 702 airport express,4,2019,05,29
247,Let down by poor quality of sleep,"This hotel has much to offer- excellent location, great breakfast, free parking and friendly staff but it fails miserably in the most important requirement of any hotel room ie. quality of nights sleep! We were in a family room on ground floor and the poor quality of the mattress meant we got almost no sleep. Unfortunately we will not be returning unless this changes!",3,2019,05,28
247,Bad night sleep,"I have stayed here many times over the years and everything is generally super. On this occasion we had a very pleasant welcome by the reception staff. They assigned us room no 358. Unfortunately there was a 90th birthday going on in the function room that night and I assumed the disco would finish at 12 midnight. At 1.44pm I had to phone night porter and complain about the sing song that was still going on. It’s just NOT ON that a hotel will have a full complement of residents trying to sleep and allow  this kind of event to take place. I mentioned it to the duty manager the next morning and he was very apologetic and offered us an upgrade the next time we stayed which we accepted. In retrospect it was little compensation for such a pitiful nights skeep. 
He should have offered us a complimentary stay or a voucher towards another stay. ",4,2019,05,27
247,Another satisfactory stay in Sandymount,"Good communication in advance and welcome when we arrived. Room ok. Thought there was slightly heavy odour when we arrived, but left window open and it improved. There wasn't a stand for suitcase. Bathroom could do with a shelf. Had dinner in bar and it was very satisfactory. Liked the gardens. Price was higher than usual apparently due to events on the date",4,2019,05,27
247,"Great location, very clean but very warm","Location was great, staff friendly food was lovely but there was no air con rooms were very warm this was in May so I would hate to feel the heat in the summer. Disappointing as if there was air con I would have rated the hotel 5 out of 5 ",4,2019,05,27
247,Seven days in Dublin,Perfect stay; only the double bed (too small) and pillows (too flat) were not comfortable. The vreakfast was excellent and withour hired car we could visit several locaties. We fiunt the Dart a little expensive for only 3 stops.,4,2019,05,27
247,Lovely Spot,"My wife and I had an amazing weekend in the sandymount hotel! The hotel itself is very well kept and our room was modern and spacious. The staff were great - there was always someone on hand to answer our questions, or deliver whatever we needed to the room. And the location was perfect - we walked into town both days and stopped into some interesting pubs along the way. Looking forward to our next visit. ",5,2019,05,23
247,Magnus Storator,"My stay at this hotel really brightened up the dark January months. What a lovely warm welcome from Gerry and his family: Irish red hair; Irish warm hearts 

Looking forward to coming again - Such hospitality as yours would melt an iceberg!!",5,2019,05,23
247,Jackie Boland,"Fantastic hotel. We had a family reunion there for about 100 people. We could not have picked a better venue. The food,staff, service and value for money could not have been better. We will definitely be back there for future events",5,2019,05,23
247,Family Reunion,"We recently held an extended family reunion at the Sandymount and it was absolutely fantastic. 
The food was excellent, the stay were very attentive and it was a really relaxed atmosphere with a sense that we had the place to ourselves out in the garden area with our own private bar. There was approximately 60 of us and a number stayed at the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the comfort and proximity to the city.
I’d highly recommend the Sandymount Hotel and look forward to visiting again soon.",5,2019,05,23
247,Excellent for a weekend visit to Dublin,I flew into Dublin for a weekend trip to watch the Ireland vs France rugby match in March and chose the Sandymount Hotel due to is close proximity to the Aviva stadium (literally 2 minutes walk from the hotel) and the fact that it is 5 minutes in a taxi to the city centre. In addition to its excellent location the hotel has recently been refurbished and consequently the rooms and common areas are in excellent condition. The staff were exceedingly helpful and the bar area was a buzz with activity on match day. Altogether a very enjoyable stay and I will definitely stay there again next time I am staying in Dublin. ,5,2019,05,23
247,Beautiful hotel with lovely staff,"I stayed in the Sandymount Hotel with my wife when we were back in Dublin. Firstly, the location is fantastic and right beside the city centre. Our stay was such a pleasurable experience mainly because of their wonderful staff who were very attentive, helpful and friendly. My wife & I couldn’t recommend this lovely family run hotel any higher especially to anyone looking for a comfortable place that’s located right beside the city centre and the sea. A winning combination for us. Will definitely be back. ",5,2019,05,23
247,Ian James F,"I had a wonderful trip to Dublin in March with my partner. Our stay in the Sandymount hotel was perfect, from the incredibly friendly staff to our gorgeous room, we could not have asked for more. The food in the restaurant was out of this world. The hotel retains that family feel while Dublin city Centre is only a short journey away. Already planning our next trip!",5,2019,05,23
247,"Lovely hotel, right beside Aviva, and great bars nearby","We had a perfect time at the Sandymount Hotel. Staff so friendly and professional. Lots to see and do nearby. Plus a good bar! Or go wander the neighborhood for hidden spots to eat too!
We would definitely go back. Summer or winter would be cosy too.",5,2019,05,23
247,Great stay in the Sandymount,"We were in Dublin for a concert recently and booked in for a night. Hotel was lovely and clean, nice beds and a great breakfast.

Staff were very helpful and they gave us a recommendation for a nice restaurant nearby.

The bar in the hotel was nice to hang out in too and we were blessed with nice weather so had a few drinks in the outdoor seating area.",5,2019,05,23
247,Bad experience,"Although the location is fine,  the hotel is not. We had a dark room with no real window. Breakfast was not good with really bad coffee and eggs not well cooked . The personal was not well informed.   All in all not worth the money",2,2019,05,22
247,Ok stay at the Sandymount Hotel,"We liked the Sandymount for it's easy accessibility to the airport, the DART is just a 5 minute walk and 2 stops from the centre of it all.  The hotel had free parking, the reception and lobby area was nicely furnished, bar was reasonably priced, and while the breakfast was a little pricey it was good food with good service. The Hop on/Hop off bus also picks up everyday right in front of the hotel making it convenient if you're taking the Dublin tour.  We also liked that there were restaurants, cafes, and a Tesco grocery store within a 10 minute radius for us to access if we needed anything. 

The beds felt a little hard for my personal taste, but still a comfortable sleep, would've liked better pillows.  The maid servicing our room missed a few things like leaving extra toilet paper, providing clean cups, etc, so felt like a miss but was still fine. We were on the main floor with our room facing a tree that had a spotlight on it all night/every night.  There were curtains in the room, but kind of felt it unnecessary to have this light blaring through our curtains every night for a tree. 

Overall, it was an alirght stay at the Sandymount and might return again, but I might choose something else if we were to return to Dublin again though to have something to compare, but we felt it was priced ok for our length of stay as the city overall is quite pricey.  ",3,2019,05,22
247,60th Birthday,"Nothing short of perfect for me and my partner.. The staff are very courteous, the food well cooked and presented.. Our room 460 was of ample size and the room was clean and presented really well.. The location is spot on for transport into Dublin.. I recommend this hotel 100% and we'll return in due course.. Well done team.",5,2019,05,22
247,Great stay after a long week,"Great hotel, great location for getting to the port early in the morning. Bar has a good choice of food and drink. Rooms are very clean and high standard. Will look to stay here again on future visits",4,2019,05,22
247,Lovely hotel,"The hotel was very nice. All stuff was absolut Kind and lovely. Everything was Clean. Inly the Location could bei cliser to Downtown, nur its very quite there. We hat a short to Downtown, so ist was all right for us. There are solely good Bus lines also",5,2019,05,21
247,Lovely hotel in quiet neighbourhood,"We stayed at this hotel because it was close to where some family lives.  It was lovely and the restaurant is very good. We had all the family for dinner our last night in Dublin at the restaurant and there was a variety of food choices, all very tasty.  Hotel room (triple) was clean and just want we needed. ",4,2019,05,20
247,Amazing stay,"We had a lovely time during our stay at sandymount hotel. The hotel was set in a great location, 40 minute walk from the city centre (5 minute walk to train station) and very close to the coastal village of sandymount where there are independent shops beach trails and walks. The staff are very friendly and there to help with any enquiries and provide information on the area and the activities in Dublin. Fully reccomend to anyone who wants to explore Dublin! ",5,2019,05,19
247,beautiful and great neighborhood,LOVE this room and lovely bar.  Was a short walk through a lovely neighborhood to an area with two pubs we had dinner in one and drinks in another.  Lovely area!  Very comfortable!  A bit inconvenient to city centre as you have to find a bus or train but we can deal with that.,4,2019,05,19
247,Recent stay,"Hotel was decorated beautifully, restaurant was lovely, food great. 
Room was on the small side considering the price was quite high.
staff friendly and accomodating.
Shame the complimentary bus service didn't go a bit further into the city.
Great trip, really enjoyed the experience.",4,2019,05,17
247,Beautiful Hotel in pleasant suburb of Dublin.,"Attractive hotel of eight connected Victorian Houses, beautifully modernised inside. Very quiet location with ealy transport links to Dublin City centre and the Coast. Comfy bed, great TV selection, excellent Wi Fi, Lovely shower, lots of tea and coffee in the room, all immaculately clean. Very friendly and professional staff. Awesome buffet breakfast in large restaurant room, with top quality service; never had to queue for breakfast. Great bar and gardens. Excellent value compared with prices around O'Connell St. Buy a Visitor Leap card online, before you go, for unlimited travel on Luas, Bus, Train plus Airport connections; it will be posted to your home address. Find time to visit Glasnevin Cemetry. ",5,2019,05,15
247,"Nice hotel, friendly staff","Overall, the hotel was really nice.
When we arrived the receptionist was lovely and very helpful providing us with info on where to go for dinner/ what tours to do. 
The rooms are spacious and tidy. 
The restaurants have great food especially if you get the early bird dinner. 
The hotel is not centrally located to town, you need to get the “dart” (train) which is just down the road. 
Downside to the room - no air con, there is heating which we kept off the whole time but even still the rooms got extremely hot especially during the night so windows had to be kept open. Also no fridge in the room. 
Other than that, it was good value for money. ",4,2019,05,15
247,Night at Sandymount,"Spending one night on my own in Dublin, I was somewhat daunted by the prices charged by Dublin city centre hotels and was delighted to find a much more reasonable option in the 4 star Sandymount Hotel. A lovely lady on Reception welcomed me to the hotel and provided with information about the area and Dublin city sights. My room was very pretty, clean and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities and nice toiletries in the bathroom. It was very quiet and I slept extremely well in the cosy bed. My only issue was that I did find it a little difficult to get out of the shower, however, as the bath sides were very high.

I had a nice table at breakfast the next morning and picked up a newspaper to read from the breakfast reception desk.  There was a buffet breakfast with lovely thick rashers of bacon and delicious white pudding and brown bread. I particularly appreciated getting a pot of coffee rather than just a cup.

The hotel is handy for the DART and the Airport bus and is situated in a quiet, pleasant area.

247,"Squeeking floors, thin walls","Positives: food, staff, clean room and bathroom, coffee/tea in the room, location. Negatives: noisy - squeeking floors and beds, thin walls, large gap under the door - a lot of disturbace during sleep. ",3,2019,05,14
247,Perfect place,"Really nice place in very convenient location. Staff is really helpful, very friendly but still professional. Food is very good, rooms comfortable and clean.Definitely will come back there on my stay in Dublin!",5,2019,05,14
247,"Good value, nice hotel","This hotel was very good value for a midweek overnight. The room was comfortable, if a bit small . Bathroom was spotless,  with all the essentials. Breakfast was nice, and the early bird menu was fine, if a little predictable. Supplements applied to many dishes. The hake with chickpeas, had too little fish, swamped in a pile of spicy veg. Not what I was expecting. It’s a big sporting hotel, convenient to the Aviva Stadium, d lots of big screens to show the matches. Free parking is a big bonus for Dublin too, and it’s convenient for access to the city. ",4,2019,05,13
247,Review,"Perfect service, rooms were clean and perfectly cleaned everyday, food was very good and suitable for everyone especially I am thankful for gluten free food which was served to me, it's great to take umbrella in the reception ",4,2019,05,13
247,Would Definitely Stay Here Again and Again!,"This was our second time staying at the Sandymount Hotel.  It is situated in a nice quiet neighbourhood and has many amenities close by such as the DART, the Ocean, quaint little towns with lots of variety for dining and shopping.  It's clean and has everything you would need for your stay away from home.  The restaurant is top notch and there is even the option to order food right to your room.  They go above and beyond for anything you require.  We will definitely be back again and would highly recommend this hotel!!!  5 Stars all the way!  ",5,2019,05,11
247,Best family run hotel,We stayed here when visiting Dublin for a family gathering. This is our hotel of choice to stay in so long as the price is reasonable. The staff were very friendly & helpful. The room was spacious & spotless. The bed was very comfortable which is a very important to us. The location is excellent & the parking is free. No noise to disturb your nights sleep.  We will be back again later this summer.,5,2019,05,11
247,Efficient and friendly.,I was impressed by staff's efficiency throughout my stay. The room was clean and comfortable. The quality of the food was very good indeed. The hotel was ideally located for my visit on this occasion. ,4,2019,05,11
247,Sandymount Hotel - good value stay,"My wife and I stayed here for one night B&B. Overall the stay was very good.

The buffet breakfast was very nice with a good selection. Nice location and good value.",4,2019,05,10
247,Take That concert,"Very centrally located to the venue, very easy to find and very friendly helpful staff throughout my stay for the night. Got free shuttle bus to the venue which was a bonus. The walk back was very safe at night along the bank area. ",5,2019,05,08
247,Rugby Club Tour Hotel,"The Sandymount Hotel hosted The Moscow Dragons Rugby Club from Thursday from 2nd May till Sunday 5th. The whole Hotel were more than welcoming, the staff were top class. Breakfast was superb and all bar staff exceptional considering they were hosting over 50 people.
My next trip to Dublin will definitly include a stay at The Sandymount

247,Moscow Dragons RFC ,The best ever hotel for the Rugby Tour in Dublin. 200 meters to Aviva Stadium and Lansdowne Road DART station. Manager allowed the bar to stay open until 01:00AM during our staying. Food was great. We absolutely enjoyed every minute there!,5,2019,05,08
247,Nice and quiet,"Ok hotel. Ok area, but not in the core center. Ok price. What was nice was that this was quiet at night, so we could get a good sleep. It took us about 30 min to walk fast from city center to hotel. About 14 Euro for taxi to center. Dart (train) was about 4 euro and took us the three stops to the city center. 
In total - a fair experience.",4,2019,05,07
247,Relaxing,"We were due to have a family reunion in a different Hotel but not suitable.Family member suggested SH and we were not disappointed.
Comfortable seating and a delicious lunch.
Friendly and efficient staff. Stayed six hours!",4,2019,05,07
247,Few days in Dublin,"We stay in this hotel for one night, it was good.
Breakfast buffet was perfect. From the hotel we  could walk to the city. Dinner in the hotel was ok. The hotelroom was small but everything you need was there. ",5,2019,05,07
247,Rugby Tour to Dublin,"Excellent venue, within easy walk to City center, beach and transport routes. Great breakfast and all round food experience. The staff were very accommodating with our requests. I will return to Sandymount when travelling to Dublin. Only issue i had was the small shower in my room.",4,2019,05,07
247,The friendliest hotel with the quietest room!,"My wife and I spent 2 nights (Saturday and Sunday) at the Sandymount Hotel - our first visit.  All we can say is - wow!  The friendliest staff, the quietest room, the brilliant breakfasts, the fantastic accessible location, we could go on.

The reception desk is very friendly, efficient and accommodating.  We have to mention the excellent manageress who we dealt with us but all were equally friendly.

The room is modern, clean and everything you could ask for.  And did we mention the quietness!  Having spend much time in hotels in different countries over the years, this is, by far, the quietest room we can remember staying in.

The fresh food at breakfast was all one could ask for.  The service was excellent, they couldn't be more helpful.

The location is within 4 minutes walk to the Dublin DART line (light rail) - easy and fast access into Dublin centre or south to Dun Laoghaire, Bray and beyond or north to Howth and beyond...

All and all, a great place to stay in Dublin and we will be back!",5,2019,05,06
247,A very enjoyable stay,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Breakfast was excellent, staff were very helpful and friendly, only thing that I found annoying was being woken by people having to slam shut their bedroom doors.",4,2019,05,06
247,Maze,"Great hotel, nice rooms, clean, quiet, everything you would expect from a decent hotel including free WiFi.

We had the breakfast one morning, a little expensive in my opinion but was very good full English style buffet.

Probably not ideal for someone less abled i.e. wheelchair bound or limited mobility due to there being a lot of stairs and levels. It's also a total maze to try and navigate around it.

All in all I would recommend and would stay here again.
",5,2019,05,06
247,Dublin business trip,"Stayed several times, nice hotel nice friendly staff 
Can never get the discount deals!
Suitable for me for my business trips, close to my workplace and Dublin City only a shor5 ride on the dart

247,Sandymount review,"Good location near the Aviva stadium so busy on match days but generally a nice safe quiet area. 40min pleasant  walk into Dublin city center. Rail and bus routes nearby.
Rooms well sized, cleaned daily.
Food quality was good and had a daily special, a little more variation would have helped.
Staff very helpful and cheerful.",4,2019,05,01
247,Great location,Central to the train.  Central to Dublin. Village was quite nice as well.  The food is delicious.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  I would highly recommend them for a football stay or a great place to stay for a trip to Dublin.,5,2019,05,01
247,Really helpful staff,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights on a very busy international rugby weekend and even though the place was packed the staff were always good humoured and efficient.  We were particularly impressed with Ivor and Elida who each worked hard on alternate nights to ensure we were able to get a table in the bar for supper, complete with a freshly cooked meal, even though it was after the kitchen was due to have shut. Many thanks to you all, you do a great job!",5,2019,04,30
247,"Nice location, handy for the dart.",Lovely hotel with comfortable bedrooms. The bar and restaurant were good and the staff were very friendly. The breakfast quality was excellent and the hot options of the buffet were very fresh. The bathroom should be updated. We were in an executive room but the bathroom didn’t live up to expectations and the bath was tiny.,4,2019,04,30

247,A one night stay to attend a concert in NCH,Another pleasant visit to a hotel that we have visited on numerous occasions over the last 30 years. The menu in the bar has changed recently. The quality was excellent. I have a good appetite and can pack away the food. But this time I was beaten. The amount of food on the beefburger plate is simply too much! (we brought home the chips for lunch the next day!),4,2019,04,27
247,Work Stay,"Such a lovely hotel, staff excellent, location excellent as it is such a short journey to the hussle and bussle of Dublin city centre, facilities excellent for such a reasonable price. Would definitely return.

247,Another Lovely Stay,"I have been working on a long term project in Dublin and I always stay at the Sandymount Hotel. The amenities are first class and always comfortable. The food is quite good and you cannot beat the location in lovely Ballsbridge. But I have to say that it is the people I admire the most.

247,"Lovely staff, excellent location, great value for money",The hotel is in a great location - the Sandymount area is really nice (nice restaurants and bars around but not as hectic as city centre) whilst also being close enough to the city centre for activities there. The staff were so friendly and helpful - both at the front desk and answering a couple of queries via email before the visit. Would definitely return in the future. ,5,2019,04,23
247,Great Family Break,We had a fabulous family break at the Sandymount Hotel on Thursday 18th April.  Staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble.  A particular thank you to Beatrice who made us most welcome on our arrival.  ,5,2019,04,22
247,Short break ,"Stayed here Wednesday 17th to Friday 19th and what a stay it was! First time here Staff were so helpful and friendly! Ladies on reception were fantastic with answering questions about places to eat, we ate in the bar on our first night and food was fantastic only thing I would say is my friend had the pasta dish and said it was bland but over all enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back!

Hotel is also minutes away from the dart train and the dart is very cheap to use would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay ain Dublin! ",5,2019,04,21
247,Short break in Dublin,"Location to DART line was good. 
Hotel was comfortable and welcoming. 
Breakfast choice was good, but other fruit juices would be nice.

Met my needs in full. ",5,2019,04,21
247,Family trip,Very nice hotel and situated perfectly for our trip to the Aviva stadium especially when travelling with a 4year old. The executive situe was lovely and clean. Breakfast was really nice and a good selection ,4,2019,04,16
247,Fantastic hotel,"Superb hotel , great location and very helpful and polite staff . I would highly recommend the sandymount, the room was amazing, as well as the lobby and bar areas , great food and even a late night pizza service. Friendly staff all round ",5,2019,04,16
247,Great location,It was in a great area and so close to the Aviva stadium. Free parking and friendly staff on reception.  The room was a bit small but spotlessly clean. Good atmosphere in the bar as well. Would highly recommend this hotel. ,4,2019,04,16
247,Rugby weekend,"A very good hotel, we really enjoyed our short stay here.  The staff are excellent, especially those on reception, the rooms are very comfortable. The Irish breakfast is superb, buffet style it has a wide range of hot and cold items,  I really enjoyed the full hot breakfast, including my 1st white pudding, very tasty. An excellent place to stay for both the Aviva and RDS stadiums, public transport also very close. I'd recommend the short walk to Sandymount village, some nice places to eat. Fully recommended and i will definitely return.",4,2019,04,15
247,"Quality accommodation, food and service","Sandymount Hotel is located within minutes of dart station so accessible for city centre. The room I stayed in was immaculate, food was excellent and all staff were extremely courteous and helpful. There is ample secure free car parking at the hotel.",5,2019,04,15
247,Convenient and comfortable,"We enjoyed our two night stay at the Sandymount hotel and we would certainly use it again for our next visit to Dublin. The location of this hotel is excellent for the city if you like a nice walk. There is a good selection of restaurants and pubs on route to and from the city, especially through the Baggot street area. Although we did not use the breakfast or bar facilities they appeared to be spacious and well served. We had a room on the recently refurbished 4th floor at a time where there was a match at the nearby Aviva stadium. We expected it to be noisy and busy but it was surprisingly quiet. Our only issue we found was that i the room was very warm at times and that was with the heating off and window open. The parking and access was good.",4,2019,04,15
247,Best place in town,"Been there for 3 night. Outstanding service. Many thanks to Ioana, Beata, Octavio and Ernesto!! Good location and great food. Close to stadium and all attractions. Easy acces to city center. Rooms are ok, clean and it has a great breakfast .",5,2019,04,12
247,Great hotel,"Loved this hotel. First visit to Dublin. I was concerned we were so near the sport arena and there was a big charity match on there on our second night. But we didn’t hear a thing. The hotel is situated in an upmarket residential area very near the coast. The local village is a 10 minute stroll and has some good restaurants and bars. 
Dublin City is about a 20 minute walk or about 7 minutes on the train. 
Our room was lovely. Modern and clean. 
Breakfast was good, plenty of choice and the buffet was replenished frequently. 
The front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly. 
I can thoroughly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,04,12
247,Pricey but worth it,"Although the hotel is not the cheapest within the area and there is probably better, the Sandymount provides a sense of luxury at a reduced rate. While staying here i felt comfortable asking the members of staff for any help when needed and they were happy to assist. The room was clean and tidy although the lack of a fridge and working safe was disappointing.   One bonus of its location is how close the hotel is to the Aviva Stadium. If you are into football or Rugby, look to stay here. When we came, being so close to the DART (Train) station meant getting into the city centre was easy and for a couple of euros was very cheap.  Breakfast was nice and had plenty of variety although i am not sure it was worth 15 euros per person. Unfortunately we never had the chance to dine in the hotel restaurant but did have the chance to look at the menu, which also looked very nice. Overall i would stay here again as the whole hotel experience was extremely enjoyable and will be recommending to my friends and family.",4,2019,04,12
247,Great Staff but Hotel needs to be refurbished,"The staff is amazing the food as well. But the ugly and unsanitary carpeted floors everywhere are disgusting, next time I will stay at in another Hotel unless they refurbished and invest in this Hotel",3,2019,04,12
247,Good location only if you are going to Viva stadium. ,"Wasn’t very impressed with the hotel. Tiny room and heat was broke, they did supply a portable heater. Wish I would of stayed in town. Not a bad walk to train station. No airport shuttle. No early check in, not even one hour! Would not stay here again. ",3,2019,04,11
247,Super As Always ,"The comfort, attention to detail and personal service provided by the management and staff was exemplary, right from the check in with Beatrice. All requests were satisfied with a friendly, pleasant response making me feel valued as guest. The quality and range of food offered in the bar accompanied by friendly staff make the experience most enjoyable. Most definitely will return.",5,2019,04,09
247,Wonderful Stay,"We had a wonderful stay in the Sandymount Hotel for my daughter's confirmation. We ate both nights in the Line Out Bar, having a meal for the extended family on the Saturday night of our stay. We really enjoyed our stay, our room was very comfortable, staff were very pleasant and very helpful, the food was delicious, portions were huge(!). We would highly recommend a stay at the Sandymount Hotel. ",5,2019,04,09
247,One night stay,"Great location beside dart station. Easy to access city centre. Should have worn flat shoes though as it's a 20 minute walk from pearse street station to the Gaeity. I'll know for again! Lovely walk into Sandymount, followed by breakfast at Brownes",5,2019,04,08
247,Pleasant,"As a single female travelling alone I was disappointed to be in a ground floor room right next to an exit used by many to access the car park. I didn't feel particularly secure as this fire door was help open by a stone!
The carpet in the bedroom was filthy, stained and horrible.
Service in the bar was terrible, had to call staff every time I wanted them, never did they make eye contact easily.
Food could have been good but felt rushed.
I also didn't like being disturbed by housekeeping at 8.35am. A little early.
Location was very convenient as I was attending a conference in the Aviva.
Bed was comfortable.",3,2019,04,05
247,"Perfect location, perfect staff, perfect breakfast.... Perfect hotel!",Excellent location for the Aviva and also a lovely walking distance from Dublin city centre! Nearby restaurants and cafes worth a visit too! The staff are so helpful from arrival through to departure. ,5,2019,04,02
247,Not great.,"Arrived at the property , the man at the car park was extremely rude. When we attempted to make a reservation in the restaurant, the girl wasn't very helpful at all. Very disappointed with the size of the rooms at the price that we paid for them. Wont be recommending and wont be coming here again.",2,2019,04,02
247,Fab location and wonderful staff - let down by our room,"Stayed over the weekend for rugby at the Aviva.

The Positives

- The location is amazing...2 minute walk to the stadium and just beside the dart station. 

-The staff are just wonderful - we got a warm welcome at reception and the bar staff were really attentive. The ladies who were on duty at breakfast couldn't have done enough for us. 

- The communal areas of the  hotel are well kept and tastefully decorated.

- Having access to free parking in Dublin is a god-send

-Fabulous powerful shower.

-The breakfast was tasty - I really enjoyed the poached eggs.

The not so positives...

- The room, while immaculately clean, was tiny. I appreciate that it's an old building and there is likely to be variation between rooms - but we felt a little ripped off. 

- The beds were not particularly comfortable and the pillows were extremely flat/well used. The double rooms are a small double bed + a single. In my opinion not up to a 4* standard.

- The room was unbearably hot and lacked ventilation.

- The noise from the bar outside went on until 2-3am. Appreciate the hotel is aimed at rugby fans but I got very little sleep. It was hard to keep the window open in our stifling room. 

-No fridge in room / ice facilities. 

Perhaps we were just unlucky with our room allocation as what we stayed in did not reflect the pictures on the hotel's site. Also drinks were more expensive on the game day and the communal areas were absolutely rammed prior to the match which impacted on access to bars/food/clean toilets (which might annoy those who weren't attending). Not sure the hotel or rooms quite live up to the 4* standard but definitely a good 3* rugby hotel.",3,2019,04,02
247,good location,very good location and brilliant atmosphere during rugby days. the barbeque food is very good and well priced and the restaurant food was excellent. rooms were clean and very comfortable. would highly recommend to family and friends,4,2019,04,02
247,Stayed for Ireland Georgia in the Aviva stadium,Excellent hotel. Within a few yards of The Aviva stadium and Lansdowne Rd train station. Trains to Dublin city centre every 10 mins. Staff were excellent particularly the breakfast staff. No problem with check in or check out. Good buffet breakfast with good choice. Nice bar and alcohol not overpriced. I will definitely stay again.,5,2019,04,02
247,Delightful Stay,We spent 3 nights at The Sandymount Hotel and enjoyed ourselves. We availed of the DART close by and visited Malahide and Dublin. We also booked a tour of the Aviva Stadium and walked the towpath. The village is lovely too and the walk along the beach. The reception staff are terrific and the Line Out bar is very good value with excellent service. Breakfast was tasty with a variable selection of cereals and hot food. There are plenty of comfortable seats throughout the foyer and a lovely ambience. We are returning next week and we think the hotel will become a firm favourite. Thanks for a great break.,5,2019,04,01
247,Best hotel for rugby,We always try and stay here for rugby at the Aviva. Even if we can't we would always go here for pre match drinks and food. Super stash and friendly helpful staff. Excellent service at reception and bar. This time we ate at the bar late at night and food was still of a high stanfard,5,2019,04,01
247,Great Stay Overall," Stayed with friends while attending a concert in the 3Arena only a 20 min walk (Or 5 min in a taxi)  very central. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Food and drink was great well worth a try if you don't want to venture out of the hotel to look for spots.",5,2019,03,31
247,Excellent,Excellent stay!! I would recommend to friends and family. Great location with everything within walking distance. DART also a couple of minutes walk away. Very clean rooms and staff are very helpful!!,5,2019,03,31
247,The staff went,"The staff went out their way to accommodate us. We were attending a concert at the 3 arena and the hotel dropped us into the concert free of charge. 
Also we requested room service the following morning and a lovely gentleman waited on us. The breakfast was great too",4,2019,03,29
247,Comfy hotel in Dublin,"We stayed here 2 nights to visit the city, the hotel is really nice, super new, with friendly staff. The rooms are comfortable and clean, the bathroom is really nice and modern. 

The only downside, if you’re visiting the city, the position is not the best, a bit far from the center and from any bus stop, however it’s really close to the AVIVA Stadium. 
",4,2019,03,25
247,Lovely hotel but needs air conditioning!,"Second time staying in the sandymount hotel and unfortunately will be the last. Beautiful hotel... Lovely food.. great location if going to the Aviva or the 3 arena.. food and drink a bit pricey (but I suppose that's dublin!) The rooms are nice but quite small. The huge let down is the heat. No air conditioning and no fridge to put water in. Stayed there 3 years ago and was the exact same. The room got so hot I couldn't handle staying there again. However, very comfy bed and lovely rain shower.",3,2019,03,24
247,Short stay,"We are always happy to stay at the Sandymount .we are made to feel very welcome and feel very much at home when staying there .This visit ,Ann at reception was extremely helpful ,and surprised Denis with a birthday.card and chocolates . We look forward to our next visit .",5,2019,03,24
247,short work stay,"Room was very average. view depressing. it was a pity to see opposite wall in such a beautiful location in Dublin. there was no table in the room, had to use laptop in the lobby, was hard to do notes. 
Lift B smelled so bad that it was impossible to use. 
over all it was comfortable stay. brilliant location. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Great food in restaurant, not so fresh in breakfast. ",4,2019,03,22

Location is excellent within easy reach of public transport and within walking distance of the Aviva Stadium",5,2019,03,20
247,Average,"Friendly staff and free parking, but average room and breakfast. My room also had a bad food smell, as if you had cooked oily fried food with all the windows and doors closed.

Not sure if I'd go back, probably not for that price unless I really need to be close to Aviva stadium and there is no other option.",3,2019,03,19
247,Lovely hotel,"Lovely room very clean comfy beds and friendly service from staff at reception desk and bar , breakfast the next morning was an amazing buffet with loads to choose from , Great nights stay would definitely recommend",5,2019,03,19

247,Gentleman Dave,"I had a gorgeous stay in this hotel. From very friendly staff to delicious food. Attention to detail was paramount but I have to pay special attention to the courtesy driver Dave, he assisted my colleague and I with the professionalism of a true gentleman. The hotel should be extremely proud in having him as a valued member of staff. Thank you Dave, Kathy.",5,2019,03,16
247,Wonderful Stay at Sandymount,"Upon check-in, we knew the stay was going to be a good one. The staff was friendly, helpful, and really went the extra mile from the very start. The room was completely satisfactory and very clean. Good water pressure, hot water. The maid service is top notch, and they'll wait all day to clean the room if you hang the 'do not disturb' sign on the door.
The location was good for us. We were able to take the 20-25 minute walk to Temple Bar, Trinity College, and Grafton Street without a problem. It's right next to the Aviva Stadium, which is good if you're there for a game. Not so good if you try to come back to the hotel after a match, but that only held us up for about 15 minutes. We were also able to easily walk to the 3Arena. Speaking of which, this place serves some pretty tasty pizza 24-7. Very convenient if you're coming back to the hotel a little late at night.
The bar and restaurant staff are also friendly and helpful. They also know how to handle rowdy and drunk sports fans without being rude. Now that's a talent!
We will definitely stay in this hotel again. Very good value.",5,2019,03,16
247,Thank you Dave,"The hotel was perfect. The food was excellent. The friendliness of the staff was excellent but what stood out was the curtesy bus 🚌 driver DAVE who offered his assistance to a group of people who needed to get to a conference.. THANK You DAVE. You are a gentleman. 
Jane",5,2019,03,14
247,Sandymount Stay,"Stayed here for one night, we went to a concert in the 3arena this was a 25min walk from the hotel. Hotel lobby was lovely and staff member at check-in was very friendly. Our room was very average (small, lower floor dark with poor lighting)  even though you pay a fortune! Also looking forward to having a nice bath only to have a wet room, which I have at home. 

Wouldn't be put of staying here,
as I'm sure there is much nicer rooms, as for me I've been there going to go somewhere else next time.",3,2019,03,13
247,"Too busy to accept card,cash only!!!!","Refused card payment for drinks but took card no bother for accommodation and food! Insisted on cash at bar! Said this was hotel policy on busy days. No option but to return to room for remainder of stay, no atm on site",1,2019,03,13

247,25th Wedding Anniversary Celebration,"I booked the Sandymount hotel for my parents as a celebration of their 25th wedding anniversary and what a good decision I made! The hotel emailed before their stay to confirm the booking and in my response I told them about the wedding anniversary. I merely asked them if they could wish my parents a happy anniversary but they went above and beyond, writing a card and giving them some chocolates. The room was beautiful, the breakfast was stunning and the staff were extremely helpful and polite. Thank you for making their stay so wonderful, I look forward to booking with you again in the future!",5,2019,03,12
247,Great view,"The hotel is situated in a great part of Dublin right next to the Aviva Stadium, close to the Dart station and beside the river Dodder. £ minute walk to the Dart station which runs right into the heart of Dublin for 4.10 euro return. The food served for breakfast was well cooked and there was a great choice of cereals, fruit and full breakfast including sausages, bacon, scrambled egg etc. The rooms were quiet ans clean and the towels were changed daily if required. Our room was equipped with a hair dryer, iron and ironing board and a LG Smart TV with pre-installed free-view. The staff were very friendly and helpful and answered our questions regarding travel to and from the hotel to the city centre and even provided us with a timetable for the Dart. 
We have stayed at this hotel a number of times before and will definitely stay there again in the future.",5,2019,03,11
247,Lovely hotel,"Great location,very clean ,reasonably priced nice bar . Nice areas to sit down and have a quiet drink with lovely open fire. Room has everything the only thing I would say is the bed was very small which was a pity.",4,2019,03,11
247,Excellent hotel for weekend in Dublin,"We stayed here for two nights for a concert at the 3arena. The location of the hotel is great, a little outside the city centre but it was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The local area around the hotel seemed like a very pleasant neighbourhood. Right next the the Aviva Stadium and 5 mins walk from the train station to take you two or three stops into town. It was extremely easy to get around the city from here.  
Our triple room was spotlessly clean, spacious and comfortable. 
The bar and restaurant are beautifully furnished with a relaxed atmosphere. The breakfast was really good, lots of choice and quality produce. 
The staff were all lovely and helpful, the service was very professional.

247,Fantastic hotel for price,Gorgeous hotel. Stayed in a family room for 4 people was very spacious. Ask for extra towels as we only received 2 for 4 people. Price was extremely reasonable. Location small bit out from where we wanted to go but never paid more than total 18 euro for taxi. Staff were extremelt helpful and polite. Would 10/10 stay again!! ,5,2019,03,08
247,Home from home feel in the Capital,"Family overnight stay whilst attending a concert in the 3 Arena which was within walking distance. (Although there is a courtesy bus at the hotel) Lovely quiet location, with Sandymount Strand just a short walk away. Warm welcome on arrival and from all staff members throughout the hotel. Our family room was large, plenty big for 2 adults and 2 children. Delicious barfood before the concert (pizza great hit with the kids). Large selection of breads/fruit/juices and of course cooked breakfast in the morning. A really enjoyable stay, thanks to all!",5,2019,03,06
247,Never disappoints,Once again the Sandymount was great.  Good location which even though outside city centre has great transport links on its doorstep including a hotel shuttle bus.  5 mins walk to aviva stadium. Great food and beverage offerings means you never actually leave the hotel unless of course you want to.  15 min walk to beautiful sandymount village and the sea and 30min walk to the nightlife of leeson street.  We will be back.,5,2019,03,05
247,wonderful location,everything fine; location nearby train station; shuttle to hop on hop off sightseeing tour starts directly from hotel; free parking is very appreciated; stuff is very helpful and friendly; all in all it's a location we will choose whenever we're back in Dublin.,5,2019,03,05
247,Good Hotel,"Did the job for a one night stay. We had booked the hotel because we were going to the twenty one pilots concert in the 3arena, and the Sandymount was the best price we could find in Dublin, as well as being only 20 mins walk away. Would probably come back again.",3,2019,03,04
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Excellent hotel, great location, lovely rooms, good food, parking on site. Staff are friendly and overall will stay again in the Sandymount. 
Room décor was updated and modern, there is a little bit of navigation required to get to your room, but its an series of building so this can be expected, but very well sign posted internally to all rooms and lifts. 
this was my first stay for business and will stay again for sure.",5,2019,03,04
247,One night stay,It was a very pleasant stay where everything went to plan. The location suited me as I was going to a concert in the O3 arena. We walked to and from the event along a well lt safe pathway from the hotel. I have noted the hotel as a suitable location to do something similar again.,5,2019,03,03
247,Dublin weekend holiday,"Have nothing but good things to say about Sandymount hotel, and are likely to return as have fallen in love with the city of Dublin. Very quiet hotel, very professional and helpful staff. Superb breakfast. Great location, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted, such as the centre of the city. The room was a very good size, especially taking into account how central the hotel is.",5,2019,02,28
247,Fabulous hotel,"Fabulous hotel in a beautiful part of Dublin.  Close to the beach and the ferry, and all the local bars and resteraunts.  Wonderful staff from reception through to the bar staff. Food was excellent and very good value.  ",5,2019,02,28
247,1st Class,"From the moment we arrived at The Sandymount Hotel we were made to feel at home.The room was exceptional with everything you need.Great touch the coffee machine.The hotel itself is outstanding,recent refurbishment has the place looking great.I cannot fault this hotel or its facilities..First class hotel with first class staff.

247,Very helpful and accommodating staff,"Great location to begin. Right next to the Aviva stadium. The docks are within walking distance if you want a walk on the sand, or choose one of the closeby parks.
Lovely area, clean rooms. The staff were very helpful, answering many questions we had and providing us with maps and all the relevant information. We could even buy tickets for the hop on hop off bus from reception. Requested new towels after a late return from an evening out and they were delivered to the room within minutes.
Probably the most helpful staff I've ever experienced in a hotel. Highly recommend. ",5,2019,02,27
247,Bliss,"Lovely hotel in a decent location to get around the city. Right outside the stadium and only a 5-10 minute walk from the train station. The staff at this hotel were incredibly welcoming and helpful, nothing seemed too much to ask. The bed was so comfortable - best nights sleep in a long time and the hotels location makes for a peaceful nights sleep away from hustle and bustle. Would stay again if returning to Dublin. 

Top tip - 10 minute walk to Ballsbridge park where they have a small food market every Sunday. Not cheap but the Algerian guy selling chicken kofta wraps and falafel made me the most delicious lunch! ",5,2019,02,26
247,lovely stay at this hotel,"Lovely hotel, perfect location for 3 arena or aviva stadium, check in was quick staff were very friendly and helpful. We had food in the bar the beef burgers they were lovely, the food did take about 40 minutes to arrive but it was busy so understandable. Rooms were fab.",5,2019,02,26
247,First stop in Dublin,"My wife surprised me with a 40th birthday trip around Ireland. Our first night in Dublin, we would be staying at the Sandymount. I thought I had good directions to the hotel from the airport, but maybe not. Instead of the 20 min ride it took me a lot longer. I will say it’s tucked away in a residential area, which made it really hard to find. Once we parked we were met at the front desk with a friends smile. She was a great help in getting us to downtown Dublin. She recommend the DART. Our room was at the end of the hall and was a bit more updated than we initially thought. We had a parking lot view and two Queen sized ed’s. After a long night visiting sites in Dublin we made it back to our hotel room. My wife and I had a good night sleep and checked out. Upon our check out the front desk recommended a short walk to a small Tesco and shops. We did and picked up some goods for the ride to Cork. If you want a reasonable priced place away from the city but a short train ride to, I would recommend this place. Cheers",4,2019,02,25
247,Friendly and welcoming,"Stayed here for one night on February 23rd, even though it was only one night I know that the next time I visit dublin I will stay here again, friendly and clean environment, everyone from Beatrice at reception to Octavio the barman were 5 stars, I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. I look forward to my next stay!",5,2019,02,25
247,Great location,"Stayed during a trip to Dublin. Location is central. The staff are very friendly and we overall had a very nice stay. My son wants me to mention the breakfast....so the breakfast was excellent. Would I stay again...yes. We had a great stay even though there was a big Rugby game on at the Aviva and the place was very busy we had great stay. Comfortable beds, very comfortable.",5,2019,02,25
247,Excellent,"Great location near Aviva and Dart station. Very quiet surroundings. Beautifully appointed inside - some many lovely areas to relax. Food is great, staff very friendly and helpful. General feeling of comfort and relaxation ",5,2019,02,25
247,Excellent in every way but the bed was too small,"We really liked the location, right beside the Aviva stadium and central to the city. The price was very good. The hotel was spotless with lovely decor. But the bed was way too small and the mornings were quite noisy with cleaners coming and going. ",4,2019,02,25
247,Great place to stay,"Price, location, service all excellent.
Liked the building too, nice bar and plenty of space in the hotel area to sit and relax.
Should the need arise in the future for a Dublin visit, this hotel is top of the list of places to stay.",5,2019,02,24
247,Surpassed expectations ,Decided last minute to go to Dublin... Finding a hotel to accommodate a family of 2 adults and 4 kids is next to impossible.. Sandymount was the only one to do so without being extortionately priced. When I get a good deal like that I tend to be a bit dubious... I needn’t have been.. It was absolutely fabulous.. The room was spacious and clean. The food was lovely. Most of all the staff were amazing. I have 4 boisterous boys & the staff spoke to them all asking questions they were only too happy to answer and even gave them lollipops which of course they were delighted with... To be made feel at home with my gang is priceless.. Thank you so much!x,5,2019,02,24
247,Value for money,This was a mid-week trip and this hotel proved excellent value for money.  It's location within easy walking distance from  the Dart Station and Ballsbridge made it an ideal place to stay.  I have stayed in this hotel several times and would not hesitate to stay here again.  ,4,2019,02,22
247,Beautiful Hotel,"Hotel is really lovely, albeit a fair distance from the centre (if walking) . However, Landsdowne train station is a few minutes walk from the hotel - Tara station (near Temple Bar) is two stops away. We found the trains frequent and always on time!  Food at this hotel is also very good -  try the Seafood Chowder - absolutely gorgeous! Check in is at 3pm but they are happy for you to leave your bags whilst you go and explore. I will definitely be returning.",4,2019,02,19
247,Elegant hotel,"Staff at the hotel added a few touches from my Boyfriend's request for valentines weekend. Lovely prosecco, a box of chocolates, a personal note and lovehearts and rose petals in the shape of a heart sat on the bed. Clean and classy hotel.

2 minute walk to Aviva stadium and also round the corner from train station.  Very busy due to the rugby, with beer tents outside for the supporters.  Didn't have any trouble with noise or any problems getting to the bar in the hotel for a Guinness.

All the staff very pleasant and polite.  Walkable to Temple bar.  Took us 30 mins, or there is a bus to get there.

Would higly recommend.",5,2019,02,17
247,Really nice stay,"Super hotel, nice people and very quiet neighborhood. the room was clean, at the reception very helpful. the bed was really confortable, the bathroom had good pressure et very spacious. 10 min walk a long th eriver to get to restaurant and train to city center",5,2019,02,17
247,Best weekend away ever.,We went for a girly weekend away and had the best stay! It is completely silent at night which led to us having two of the best nights sleep we have ever had! Staff on front desk are super friendly and helpful. rooms are cosy and equipping with everything you’ll need. Would definitely recommend and return!,5,2019,02,14
247,A lovely D4 Gem .. with lovely staff !,"A group of friends were meeting up to have lunch and decided to try the Sandymount Hotel ( was the mount herbert)
The staff were lovely and very professional from the moment we arrived in. I’ve been there for drinks a few times after the Aviva as it’s just a stone’s throw away !!
We had a buffet style lunch as there were a lot of us but there was something for everybody 
Lovely salads choice of main course .. very tasty food 
Table was set and the waiters could not do enough for us 
Great deserts and coffee too !
Drinks were not crazy so all round a great visit but be warned ... 
The hotel is madness on games day !!
It’s a great location and not far from the city 
Only draw back is the car park is small and a bit cramped 
But We’re planning a visit again soon!",4,2019,02,13
247,Sandymount Hotel is magnificent,"Isobel and I have recently stayed twice in Sandymount Hotel when attending rugby international games in Aviva Stadium which is only 5 minutes away.  As previously, we found the hotel to be magnificent. It is clean, well maintained, comfortable and attractive.
The staff are so friendly, and helpful, making our stay like 'home from home'.  After the games when the hotel was extremely busy,   the situation was always handled with great efficiency by the hard-working Bar and restaurant staff.

The food is always excellent, making the hotel unbeatable in every sense.",5,2019,02,13
247,Really modern and nice,"My first impression when I went inside here was that the hotel must have been recently done up, the carpets looked new, walls freshly painted, got to my room and it was lovely, really modern and it looked lovely, again it must have been recently done up, the room was spacious enough and comfortable overall, I found the place to be spotless. Staff I interacted with were all very professional and friendly enough.

Would I stay here again? more than likely I will, yes",4,2019,02,13
247,Great place for a beer before the game,Called in here to meet with friends before the Ireland v England game. Easy access to the outside bar. Rugby on the Tv’s outside. Great atmosphere outside mingling with other fans. Excellent place to call prior to any match.,5,2019,02,13
247,New Discovery,Having stayed in many Dublin Hotels over the years the Sandymount was a pleasant discovery. Hotel is located near the Aviva in a quiet residential area. Staff very friendly and helpful. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel for a break in Dublin,4,2019,02,12
247,Brief visit to Dublin,Excellent hotel within easy reach of the DART when going to the city. Friendly staff and comfortable rooms. Free car parking at the hotel available. Hotel very busy at the international rugby weekends.,5,2019,02,12
247,"17 of us stayed here on the 8th & 9th Feb, travelling from England , Germany and Switzerland","Breakfast was great with a good selection .Some of our party ate  in the hotel restaurant and spoke very highly about the menu and actual food.

Staff very helpful and everything was provided and with out a problem. Overall a really pleasent experience and we will return in the future.",5,2019,02,11
247,Excellent place!,"Absolutely fantastic place. The staff are brilliant and the service is faultless. 
Rooms, bar area and restaurant is world class for the price you pay and the location is close to the train and bus routes although a taxi ride only takes 10 minutes and is around €12.
Rooms were very clean with brilliant showers etc. Kettle is provided and so is a safe and iron.
We were in a party of 17 people and everybody enjoyed it, we will 100% stay here again if we visit Dublin again.
 ",5,2019,02,10
247,Weekend away,"Rooms need soundproofing if close to bar or reception during rugby weekends, otherwise a very nice hotel with excellent friendly staff, was nice to see a real fire in the lounge area which was constantly  topped up with logs. If you just wanted coffee and croissant for breakfast , than was fine also",4,2019,02,05
247,Good hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the Sandymount hotel. The staff were early attentive and lovely and one of them actually organised for a member of staff to take us to a stop where we could easily get the Airlink bus back to the airport as there were no Dart trains at the time we had to leave on Sunday morning. We really appreciated this extra touch and made our journey so much easier.

We asked for a double room and was given a room that had both a double and single bed and felt that this made the room a lot smaller, apart from that it was clean and tidy. The only point that would have improved the room would have been a fridge.

We had breakfast included with our stay and the food provided was brilliant, well presented and a lot of choice. We would certainly stay here again if we visit Dublin",4,2019,02,01
247,Excellent Service,I enjoyed my two night stay. The room was spotless. The food was excellent. The staff were super friendly - when I returned to the hotel in the evening the reception staff greeted me even though I did not approach the front desk. ,5,2019,02,01
247,Wonderful,"Wonderful hotel thank you.  Staff at reception could not be more helpful.  I asked for a quiet room, and got one which was a home from home, so comfortable.  Breakfasts were lovely and breakfast staff could not do enough for me.  I dined in Line Out Bar on Saturday evening and food, service and staff were exemplary.  Check out was seemless.  Sandymount Hotel is very homely and friendly, not like most corporate style hotels.  Whilst in D4 you must stay here - a home from home.  Thank you everyone.",5,2019,01,31
247,"Very friendly, helpful staff.",We stayed here for a weekend  and we couldn't have stayed in a better hotel. It is very comfortable and warm. We would like to say a big thank you to the ladies at reception who  were a great help.  Great choice of food at breakfast.,5,2019,01,29
247,Great value for money!,"Great value for money, clean, friendly hotel. Good rate for 3 people including breakfast, location was excellent and handy to the RDS, food was good, rooms were comfortable, warm and we will definitely return. ",4,2019,01,29
247,Home from home,"I have become a pretty regular visitor to Dublin and the Sandymount Hotel, which is just a few minutes walk to Ballsbridge and Sandymount village.  Staff are friendly and professional who have mastered the knack of making one feel special and especially welcome.  From Iamina and Beatrice 'Bea' and all the welcoming team on arrival, to breakfast servers and bar staff - this is a fantastic team.  If you like quiet and comfortable bedrooms, super breakfast choices and delicious bar food, this is the perfect place to stay.  Hi to Octavio, Ivor and Elida, who can nearly tell me what I'm going to eat next!",5,2019,01,28
247,Over the moon,"I bought my parents a weekend in Dublin for their Christmas, to take at the end of January. They are just home and raving about the lovely staff.

247,weekend,Enjoyed a wonderful weekend at the Sandymount Hotel. this was my first visit back since the refurbishment has been completed. There is little to add to all the other excellent reviews which I endorse. I would just add that it was wonderful to meet staff who recognised us from our visits some years ago. the welcome from everyone was professional warm and friendly. We would like to thank all of them and Rose in particular for her helpfulness. we missed Beatrice as she was off duty but hope to return soon. Many Thanks for a great experience once again.,5,2019,01,23
247,Irish hospitality at its best,"We travelled to the Sandimount as part of a birthday suprise weekend for my wife, from the moment we arrived, to the time we left, the experience was out of this world, the staff were courteous, polite, and nothing was ever a problem,Our room was superb, bed sumptious, and lovely and warm in a cold irish winter. If your contemplating a trip to Dublin, The, Sandimount is  located close to the Aviva Stadium, and dublin centre is accessable easily via the dart rail service which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel and a short ride from Dublin centre.We will definately be returning ",5,2019,01,23
247,A decent hotel,A Good Hotel all round... The only minus was the size of the room.  It was small with an extra bed which seemed very crammed in.  A few extra toiletries would've been nice but no big deal. Very good staff. ,4,2019,01,22
247,Beautiful hotel!,"This hotel is a gem hidden in dublin. Staff are extremely friendly and very efficient, rooms are very clean and spacious.  The bar food menu is great with lots to choose from and we all enjoyed our food. Great breakfast also. ",5,2019,01,21

247,Fantastic Hotel - Great staff - great location,"I have returned again to this hotel as my last stay was very enjoyable.  Yet again could not fault the hotel.  It is a family run hotel and has a great feel to it as soon as you step inside.  Toni is an absolutely credit to the hotel and she could teach lessons in top customer service. An absolute pleasure as always and is genuine, positive and happy in her work.  Breakfast is great and I particularly like knowing where my food is from which is labelled throughout.  Nice to see lots of produce from Ireland.  The staff at breakfast are very friendly and attentive, especially both Jing and Luis.  Would never stay anywhere else in Dublin.  I love the short stroll to the beach to unwind and the small village of Sandymount is picturesque!   I will be back for sure and hope to see the same familiar faces.",5,2019,01,18
247,An unforgettable stay,"Extremely nice place, especially so lovely hotel staff, very friendly, polite and so helpful, simply said it’s my best hotel I’ve ever ever been visiting. All the best to Elide, Ivor, Beata and Fabio, Maja and Ann thank you for a chance meeting you all!! See you next time - it's my fav place to stop by in Dublin!! Thank you. ",5,2019,01,18
247,Travelling through Dublin,Not our first stay - and will not be our last! Sandymount has a well earned reputation. We hit a quite night - so food was good but not as brilliant as sometimes. But rooms are comfortable and clean - staff are great - location good - AND free car parking. In Dublin!!,5,2019,01,16
247,Excellent as always!,Once again  our teachers and students had a great experience  in the Sandymount during our stay for the Young  Scientist Exhibition. The rooms were spotless and the staff were as always friendly and accommodating. Will be back next year!,5,2019,01,16
247,Family New Year get together.,Lovely hotel in a wonderful position so close to transport into central Dublin. Staff couldn’t be more helpful and friendly. Lots of  lovely areas to just sit for a drink and chat. Will definitely visit again.,5,2019,01,13
247,Sandymount Hotel,"All staff, accommodation and food deserves full marks. I would highly recommend and I would return to hotel. 
Hotel has a lovely homely atmosphere. Both restaurant and bar menu on offer. 
Free  car parking available. Really enjoyed my stay.",5,2019,01,13
247,excellent hotel,Sandymount is a clean hotel with lots of amazing services was very quiet and peaceful on the nights we stayed from the 9th of January. Beds were well made and comfortable and food was excellent. The staff were nice and the hotel was very quiet and peaceful on the 9th of january,5,2019,01,11
247,Disgraceful - hotel overrun by noisy kids,"I stay regularly in the Sandymount Hotel, which is generally quiet and comfortable. I made the mistake of staying there on the night of 9 Jan, and found that the hotel was overrun with hundreds of schoolkids staying there to attend the Young Scientist event at the RDS. My evening was constantly disturbed by kids stampeding up and down the corridors, shouting, laughing, playing music loudly from phones, etc. I complained to the reception staff who seemed powerless. They couldn't get me an alternative room as the kids were block booked in every part of the hotel. The noise went on for hours, until close to 1am. Breakfast was a disaster - a line of 30 to 40 people (kids + teachers) snaking up the stairs waiting to get in, so I skipped the breakfast I'd paid for and checked out. I know that this was an exception but I would suggest to the hotel owners that if they wish to retain the business of their customers who stay regularly, they should refuse bookings from schools. Or put all such guests in one section of the hotel, and bring in extra staff to patrol the corridors.",1,2019,01,10
247,Timeless Elegance Doesn't Disappoint,"We have stayed at the Sandymount Hotel on a number of occasions and always found it a beautiful hotel. Located in a beautiful part of Dublin close to Sandymount Village and beside the Aviva Stadium it is an ideal location for a trip to Dublin and we were not disappointed this time either. The hotel has a timeless elegance with it and an ambience that larger hotels do not possess and the free parking for guests is a big plus. The fact that it is a family run concern also helps.Staff are very friendly and helpful and free newspapers are always available daily. A number of areas enable guests to relax in beautiful surroundings either reading or conversing without having to go to the bar area which is also very nice. The large fire in the drawing room is very homely and is always an enticement to sit and relax with a paper to catch up with the news of the day.Breakfast is excellent with a first class choice of menu and the breakfast area has a well attended service from more than helpful staff.The DART and bus services are a short walk away and a leisurely stroll down to Sandymount Village through Victorian and Edwardian Dublin is always pleasure where a number of nice shops and bars are located and an excellent fish and chip shop on the village green. Bus services into Dublin can also be availed of from here too.Our rooms were very nice, clean and tidy with satellite tv available and other services such as a hairdryer and Iron as standard.We really enjoyed staying here and hopefully it will not be too long before we return to enjoy this little jewel and its location.",5,2019,01,08
247,Good Location with free parking,"Good location near tram line with free parking. Friendly staff. Relaxed atmosphere, quiet neighbourhood. Spread across different buildings with lots of narrow hallways with steps & inclines but nothing serious",4,2019,01,08
247,Great staff,"My husband and I stayed here yesterday ,on arrival at 1 pm the receptionist ensured that we got our room early as we were attending les miserables afternoon performance , 
They told us that they would provide a free shuttle bus to the venue which was very welcoming as I have very bad vision, our room is very clean and the gold blend coffee and Barry's tea was great, the breakfast was lovely and all the staff very pleasant and helpful , we will diffently make a return visit , Thank you",4,2019,01,06
247,Excellent,We stayed in The Sandymount Hotel last night as we were heading to The Rugby in the RDS. The hotel was in walking distance. This hotel is fantastic in every way posssibe. We got chatting to the Bar man his name was Ivor he made amazing strawberry daiquiris also a really friendly member of staff he was. I would highly recommend this hotel,5,2019,01,06
247,Relaxed luxury at the hands of top class hotel professionals,"Check in  - Easy and quick, did not bat an eyelid at my arrival at 11am,
Room - so new and clean you could eat your dinner off the thick piled carpet. The room has thoughtful individual touches such as the artwork being local pictures rather than non-descript 'hotel art' - a little note on the tea and coffee tray encouraging you to to ask for fresh milk if needed or wanted.  Bed had expensive linen and was very comfortable with two different types of pillows one plump and firm the other soft and squishy (4 in total) on a king bed.
Requests - I asked for a second duvet which when it arrived was still in the packaging because the housekeeper was concerned that the heating was not working in my room or something was wrong that I wanted a second duvet.  When she was satisfied that I was ok but just preferred to have no heating on, windows open and two duvets she quickly opened up the brand new duvet and put a clean cover on.  They then insisted on re-making my bed, not just handing me the duvet.  I asked for fresh milk when coming back into hotel reception and they beat me back to my own room with a large jug of ice cold milk.
Breakfast - huge selection, cereals, porridge, smoothies, lots of loaves of different breads, rolls and pastries, cold meats and cheese and an extensive hot section with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, black pudding.  I am gluten intolerant so along with the fresh eggs, poached or fried that anyone can ask for, I asked for gluten free toast and two slices of well done bacon.  Again they did not blink and my order was brought out on a warmed plate by one of the cooks, not waiting staff to check all was to my liking.  It was. 
Dinner in the Line Out Bar - very very good.  Fresh ingredients, huge portions and an interesting and well balanced menu, served by friendly and clearly well trained staff.
There are some lovely areas to sit in, a little alcolve with a small library, two large sofas by an open fire or a large area with sofas in different shaped chairs.  The reception area is always manned and the staff are quick and responsive, probably because they have walkie talkies and as you are walking away whatever request you have made is dealt with immediately.  As I have mentioned in previous reviews I travel the world widely and this hotel is so well managed and presented that it ranks equal with world class top hotels.  I am not exaggerating to say that the responsiveness of the staff and the way they have been trained equals the standard of the staff in the Burg Al Arab in Dubai and that is saying something.  Thanks to everyone at the Sandymount, you all fully deserve this review.
We stayed in the classic rooms on the top floor. Local area is quiet and residential but with excellent links within 500m to take you into Dublin centre.  ",5,2019,01,06
247,Dublin short visit,"Had stayed here years ago but didn’t,t realize this until we arrived.  Excellent in every way and will look forward to staying again on future trips to Dublin whether for business or pleasure knowing that I will enjoy my stay.",5,2019,01,05
247,Bad experience,Room with very small bathroom. The bar staff little effective. Very expensive for the services we had. Friendly receptionists although they did not solve my problem. The cleanliness of the room and the hotel was very good.,2,2019,01,05
247,Details Missed,"Great service but not the room quality I would expect. Even after moving rooms, little details let the room down. Location well suited to watching sport but not ideal for city exploration.Probably best suited to a lads weekend.",3,2019,01,04
247,Great value for money,"Nicely renovated hotel. Great breakfast and very friendly staff! Only a few minor points, such as not being able to adjust the heater in the bathroom, which made it hard to keep the room cool at night. ",5,2019,01,03
247,Great Stay,"No problems, great stay! Relatively central location. Friendly and helpful staff,  could check out by 12noon which was great! Room was comfortable and clean with comfy beds! We felt really at home away from home",5,2019,01,02
247,Another great visit.,Another great stay. Fantastic location at a reasonable rate with brilliant staff. Rooms are recently refurbed and very comfortable. Location close to Sandymount restaurants and bars and the proximity of the DART and the Aviva make it a great place for a visit to Dublin,5,2019,01,01
247,Stayed 8 Th December and 27 and 28th December,I love this hotel. It is warm cozy and the Staff are exceptional.Special thank you to Beatrice ( Reception)and Beata ( Bar).My friends came with us as it was a special birthday and we went racing.Thank you,5,2018,12,30
247,Recent stay,We came to attend a concert and the Blackrock clinic. The receptionists were the 'old guard' who we know over the years. My wife needed to stay an extra night while I was delayed in Blackrock. No problem. ,4,2018,12,25
247,Christmas special,"Stayed one night very comfortable room, great breakfast and bar good was excellent too. Have stayed in this hotel quite a few times and would recommend it.. close to dart for city visits. Staff very helpful and friendly... ",5,2018,12,24
247,Wonderful Hotel!!,"We had a wonderful nights stay in a lovely new room. The bed was clean and super comfy! Fab shower and modern bathroom. The staff were wonderful, we arrived early from the airport and asked to store our luggage. They let us check into the room early, which was very welcome!! All the staff were friendly and helpful and the food in the bar was delicious. Can’t fault this place and will definitely be back!!",5,2018,12,24
247,Friendly Hotel,"The Staff were warm and friendly especially on arrival at the reception deck. The food was very good, I found the dining room staff to be courteous and efficient. The rooms were perfect, it was really clean and one had the sense that the hotel rooms had been refurbished and may I say done very well. All in all a very pleasant trip.  ",5,2018,12,20
247,Short Stay in Dublin,"Stayed in this hotel for a short weekend to visit old friends.   Choose it because it was near the center of town but not in the commercial zone.  Also it was near the DART line which made travel very easy.  The staff were wonderful and kind and took very good care of me, far exceeding the normal level of service.",5,2018,12,18
247,well Positioned,"We recently stayed the night here when we were attending a Leinster rugby game at the R D S,Very well situated to enjoy all the attractions Dublin has to offer, The bedroom was Compact!! but it served its purpose,enjoyed a few drinks at the bar which is very pleasant,",4,2018,12,18
247,Service Plus,"If the hotel is half as good as Beatrice on the front counter,  they cannot lose.  
We were more than impressed by the way she quickly set us up with a great deal, to go and see Riverdance with dinner included. She promptly swapped Pounds for Euros, booked us in for breakfast and so much more. That alone would cause me to come back here. ",5,2018,12,15
247,A super friendly hotel in a great location,We keep returning to the Sandymount because it is very good at everything they do.  From the cleanliness of the rooms to the great staff who are friendly and helpful.  Also the hotel is so well situated for everything we want to do.,4,2018,12,15
247,Great place to stay,"Just had yet another great few days stay here. The staff are welcoming and very friendly. The hotel is perfectly situated. Sandymount village is a short walk away as well as Ballsbridge. The dart station into Dublin is literally around the corner. So convenient for a day in Dublin city. The rooms are clean and bright. Food in the bar in the evening is good and if you want to go out there are loads of places within walking distance. We also feel safe walking out to a restaurant in the area at night in the dark. I would not do it in the city. Also, after a long day in a very noisy and busy city it is a joy to come back to peace and quiet. Have stayed here a few times already and will keep on returning. It is convenient for us either in the car or by train and dart.",5,2018,12,14
247,Always My Place To Stay in Dublin,"I just completed another 10 day stay in Dublin and I truly appreciate the warm welcome and hospitality from the folks at the Sandymount Hotel. All of the amenities are there, clean and comfortable rooms, superb location, excellent food,but for me it is always the incredible customer service they provide. They truly make me feel at home!  I highly recommend a stay at this lovely establishment.",5,2018,12,14
247,Very relaxed.,"Stayed here for 2 nights. It cost about €30 to get a taxi from the airport to the hotel and that included paying the 2 tolls to go under the City. The hotel reception staff were very friendly and efficient. The reception area, breakfast room, bar and corridor were all clean and well furnished. We had been given an executive sweet which was very spacious and comfortable. I'd explained to the Manager when booking that we were travelling to celebrate my Wife's birthday. On arrival there was a box of chocolates waiting with an accompanying letter. It is positioned a short walk from the train station. (About 5 mins) and cost us €4.10 each return into the City. Really easy to use and felt completely safe throughout. There are restaurants in easy walking distance as well as bar food offered at the hotel. All in all we had a lovely time and would definitely be happy to return to this hotel. Thank you.",5,2018,12,13
247,Saturday night in Dublin,"We staying in Sandymount Hotel Saturday evening just gone on a trip to Dublin to go see Les Mis in the Bord Gáis. On arrival the hotel looked lovely and very inviting. The carpark spaces were plentiful which is always great. The reception area was quite small but the staff were attentive and friendly so check in was quick. There was a beautiful Christmas gingerbread display and a fire lighting, beautiful. There was also a nice comfortable bar where we had a drink and watched a leinster rugby match.Our room was on the second floor and was a twin room. On entering the room, I felt there was a smell of stagment water or something similar. The twin single beds were very small but comfortable. The dress g tables and wardrobes were great. The downfall of the room along with the smell was the bathroom. It was a disability bathroom with a shower seat and therefore no bath. This was not a major problem except for the fact the seat would not fold up out of the way in the shower to allow for a regular shower. Disappointing but for 1 night only it wasn't worth getting fixed by staff.
Overall a lovely hotel in most aspects and great location but the hallways were very tight for space and twin room was not comfortable as I would have liked. However I would stay again due to the location and the bar.",3,2018,12,12
247,A Great Hotel to stay in Dublin,"Have regularly stayed here for work but first occasion with my spouse, it was no different on this occasion as a family break, the same staff friendleness, warmth and want to make the stay as pleasureable as possible evident to both of us.There are 2 wonderful characters that you encounter when entering the hotel, Beatrice and Anne, and they really set the tone for what follows during a stay here as we experienced ourselves just this weekend gone,Its great to acknowledge what we found to be such a fantastic service experience, as well as the hotyel's superb location. My wife's parting message was ""how soon can we come back again""?",5,2018,12,12
247,Concert Stay!,"Great hotel, lovely staff, rooms and nice little outdoor area to sit out. Luckily the weather was fantastic so could have drinks outside and enjoy it. Plenty of parking. Breakfast buffet absolutely amazing. Will stay again.",5,2018,12,12
247,Coming Home for Christmas ,"As a family we have stayed at the Sandymount Hotel. All I can say is thank you, the hotel is lovely the staff are outstanding, they cant do enough for you. The location is great, 20 mins you can walk to the city, 10mins to the ‘Village’ simple shops and a few bars, check out Mulligans Bar lovely place. We would really like to say thank you to Beatrice at reception, you couldn’t have done anything more for us, from advice on where to eat, where to go, how to get around, you are a true asset to the Hotel. If you are going to Dublin, save yourself time, just book the Sandymount Hotel and PLEASE say hello to Beatrice and prepare for a breakfast that will knock your socks off. Thank you very much to all the Staff.
",5,2018,12,11
247,Super Hotel,"Love this hotel, I stay regularly and always welcomed.

The new bedrooms are really nice. Bar food is great.

Some of the bar staff need to give the customer a little more attention.

The Christmas display is wonderful.",5,2018,12,10
247,Birthday treat.,"It was a milestone birthday for me so we thought we'd splash out and stay in Dublin as we were attending a concert in the 3 Arena and the Sandymount is perfectly located as it's just a short walk away (approx. 20 min).  We had dinner in the bar before attending the concert, excellent food at a great price.  We ordered room service for breakfast the next morning, cereal, a full Irish, tea and toast, it arrived on time as requested and was delicious.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  We would definitely recommend staying here, it's perfectly located for either the Aviva, 3 Arena or even the RDS.",5,2018,12,10
247,"Friendly, comfortable and enjoyable","This is a very charming and pleasant place to stay. Looked after very well and met our old friend Beatrice at reception who was so helpful and professional and courteous.
Can’t beat this hotel for great comfort and wonderful location",5,2018,12,10
247,"Fantastic staff, beautiful hotel","From the start fantastic hospitality from all staff especially Beatrice on reception, who kindly gave us lots of information on Dublins attractions and transport. To top the experience she upgraded our room and surprized us with a lovely bottle of prosecco due to it been my birthday. I would defiantly recommend this hotel to anyone, and cannot wait to return. 😀",5,2018,12,09
247,Very professional staff,"Great spot for staying. Clean, modern but foremost really incredibly kind staff. 

Close to city center but several restaurants and bars nearby. Hotel also have a good restaurant with a separate bar as well. ",5,2018,12,09
247,Dublin 4 hotel,A quick visit to the Sandymount hotel in Dublin 4 for a business meeting. Location is superb and prices are reasonable. Rooms are comfortable and staff are friendly. The rigidity of breakfast times left me embarrassed when guests called at 10.12 but wouldn’t be served. A lesson that won’t be forgotten and one that I had to apologize profusely to my colleagues for when they had to go a meeting on empty stomachs (other than a scone and a coffee in reception). ,4,2018,12,06
247,Weekend in Dublin,Excellent hotel great location hope to return.Staff were very helpful and informative . Hotel was very clean and comfortable. Location was convenient for train into the city centre only three stops .Lots to see and do in Dublin but if you want a quiet drink the hotel bar was great..Some great bars and music in the centre of Dublin also visited The Guinness Storehouse which is  brilliant and St Stephens park.,5,2018,12,05
247,"great hotel, great location","This was our 2nd stay at the hotel. The location is great, easy to get taxis if you don't fancy walking. Staff were excellent and rooms were very clean. Great choice of food in the bar although it can get busy in there.",5,2018,12,04
247,A home away from home,"We have stayed in the Sandymount Hotel numerous times and have always found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The rooms are bright, spacious and clean and the hotel is centrally located. Great atmosphere at match time and the hotel is beautiful at Christmas time.Would recommend the Sandymount Hotel",4,2018,12,03
247,"Nice, clean hotel",We stayed for two nights. Lovely clean room. Restaurant Line Out was good. Staff were lovely. Octavio was a true professional and understood my dietary needs. He went above and beyond to get it right. Breakfast was fabulous and well cooked with an ample selection. Only minor negative was that the doors didn’t offer much sound insulation from people walking past or other doors slamming.,4,2018,12,03
247,"Very warm, comfortable hotel","We stayed for 2 nights while visiting a friend.  The room was generous and comfortable. The staff was quite warm and helpful. It has a very easy ambience.  The real treat was breakfast.  At check in it was 10 euro and well worth it. We had dinner one night which was okay but nothing special.  We usually have dinner outside of the hotel so it was not a problem. The bar was a nice place to have a quiet Guinness or whatever. We chose the Sandymount for location, near to her, and price which was quite reasonable.  It is not downtown or right by tourist locations but cab or train can get you anywhere. If you want to be at the center of action, this probably isn't for you. However, it is a gem if you are looking for great hospitality at a reasonable price.",5,2018,11,29
247,Nice Stay,Would come back to this hotel again. Warm welcome at reception and room was very clean and bed was very comfortable. Not many hotels in Dublin have carparks so this is an extra bonus. Will recommend Sandymount Hotel anytime. Thank you for the wonderful experience.,5,2018,11,28
247,A superb hotel,"A fantastic location especially for rugby match in Aviva. The staff were courteous, efficient, friendly and attentive. We enjoyed a fantastic meal in the restaurant. The room was very comfortable but what was notable was how quiet the hotel was at night...by far the quietest I have ever experienced in a hotel and divine!",5,2018,11,27
247,Just right for my needs,"I was in Dublin from America for a match, so a hotel near the Aviva Stadium was of prime importance. There were two nearby and I chose the Sandymount. I lucked out.

The Sandymount is in a residential district of Dublin, roughly two blocks away from the Aviva. Perfect! It was surrounded by houses and schools, making this a relaxing and quiet hotel, not far from a lovely paved path that takes you to the local shops.

It is a family-run hotel, I understand, but do not mistake this for something small. It may have hundreds of rooms but friendliness and helpfulness of the staff made you feel like they were helping a member of the family.

Here's an example.
I arrived after an overnight flight, weary, exhausted, not knowing what to do until official check-in at 3PM.  The Fabulous Fabio showed me to the restaurant where breakfast was being served, so I could get some tea and my first full Irish of my trip.
By 9:30, Fabio had conjured the room that I had reserved, and helped me get there - a room on the same floor as reception, but far from the bar which could get loud. No steps! And close to a lift that would take me outside.

This is how my stay started, and what I could expect throughout. 
The food in the restaurant was everything I was looking for, even the Thai Chicken that I had on Thanksgiving. 
The room was very comfortable, obviously refurbished recently.

WiFi was understandably weak during the day, but just fine at night when I had to post my work online.

There was a huge party for the match on Saturday, but it was all over by 11PM. Magic!

It's a great choice for the Aviva. The RDS? not so much.

Since you are reading this review you will be OK to choose this hotel.",4,2018,11,27
247,Brilliant hotel,It was a great place to stay especially as I was attending the rugby at the Aviva stadium. It is really close to the stadium and it had a great atmosphere in the outside bar area. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. I will be back here again.,5,2018,11,27
247,Great hotel for the Aviva,"Lovely modern, clean and comfortable stay in a beautiful room. Great breakfast, nice bar/restaurant area plus excellent location for the Aviva and the rugby. Good value stay considering the rugby was on.",5,2018,11,27
247,Comfortable and warm.,"We were met by really friendly and helpful receptionist. That sets the tone, so important. She couldn't have been nicer. The room was warm and clean. We were a bit disappointed that the restaurant was closed but went out  for a lovely meal locally. The bed was comfy and the breakfast was good and staff frie dly and polite. Have booked our next stay.",4,2018,11,27
247,A experience,"A nice hotel,it is slightly expensive but the hotel is nice.Staff are always friendly, parking is available,the beds are comfy,carpets are a little worn but clean
Room got hot but it was average temperature after a small amount of altering temperature,I would stay again",4,2018,11,27
247,"great location, excellent staff","Stayed in the hotel many times over the last couple of years. The hotel has recently been refurbished.. 
Rooms - size and layout depends on the location/floor of the room. My favourite so far is room 461 (and other rooms on the same floor). Rooms are clean. Crispy white bed linen. Tea/coffee and a kettle, bottled water are  nice touches. Bathroom - snow white fluffy towels (I have never seen housekeeping using hand towels to clean, which seems to be disgusting standard in many Irish hotels!). Nice toiletries, I'm glad  the hotel didn't follow the trend of placing wall-mounted dispensers.
Food - very nice, I mainly eat breakfast there. Great choice, fresh. Coffee could be a bit stronger but it's a matter of taste.
Car park - again, great the hotel did not follow the trend of trying to squeeze a few more €€€ and charge for the car park.
Staff - definitely an asset. Polite, nice, helpful. Special mention -  Beatrice and her colleague whose name I can't remember now (I'm sorry! Dark-haired lady, possibly not Irish) at the reception. Both very attentive, professional, nice and helpful. 
I would definitely recommend the hotel.",4,2018,11,26
247,Overly expensive and not 4 star worthy,"2 of us stayed here in a classic double room for the rugby at the weekend, we stayed in room 122 (bottom floor)
Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist, quick check in and we went to find our room.

It was not easy to find, so many corridors and left to right to get to the room.

So we got to the room, looked ok at first glance but when I noticed cobwebs hanging off the wall close to the bed, a hole in the wall (patched up very badly as plaster had fell off and onto the floor) and white stains on the bed runner i was less than impressed!!!
I decided to check out the bathroom, the
bathroom smelt of damp, bathroom door couldnt lock as the lock was broken,when you would flush the toilet the bath would gurgle.

We were hungry so we went down to the restraunt but it wasn't opened (Friday night), we ate in a very very busy bar. 
We both had the pasta with mushroom and added chicken (that will cost you extra) portions were massive (couldn't finish it) it was nice but nothing amazing. Waiters and waitresses were very nice and helpful.

After our teas and food we went back to our room, it was late at this point and I decided to read a book but the 2 overhead reading lights would not work, I tried everything to get them working but it wasn't happening so I tried to sleep, people in the upstairs rooms kept us awake all night, you could hear absolutely everything, sounded like stampeding elephants all through friday night and saturday night.
 
Our stay 2 nights bed and breakfast cost 398euros that's without our evening meal in the bar!!

Far to expensive for the bad quality we received. 

Will most certainly not stay here again and wouldn't recommend. I've uploaded pictures.",2,2018,11,25
247,Fantastic stay!,"Recently visited for a rugby match, and it was brilliant. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly especially as one of our party was on crutches. Nothing was too much trouble. Definitely going back!",5,2018,11,25
247,Great Location & Excellent Value,"Convenient location near the Aviva stadium and 5 minutes from the Dart and a little more from Sandymount and Ballsbridge. Newly refurbished the hotel is fresh, clean and comfortable. Nice food in the bar - Dublin city center prices though. Room prices had crept up over the years but are now set at realistic rates. Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms clean, warm and comfortable. Would recommend staying in this hotel and will definitely stay again.",5,2018,11,23
247,A great affordable boutique hotel in suburban Dublin,"Lovely hotel that oozes charm and character. Cosy seating areas dotted around reception area. Friendly staff. Recently renovated and spotlessly clean. On-site parking. Great location for Aviva stadium, with shuttle buses available to stadium (and sometimes other venues if concerts on). Within walking distance of city centre (25-30mins) and a few minutes from Sandymount village (lovely village) and Ballsbridge. Executive rooms are nice and spacious with good coffee making facilities.",5,2018,11,22
247,Two great stays at the Sandymount Hotel and will definitely be back!,We stayed here twice recently. The first stay was for a number of work and social engagements including the Ireland Argentina game in the Aviva. Noticed a really warm and friendly atmosphere as soon as we arrived and we where looked after really well by Beatrice and the girls at reception. Great location and very good value for anyone looking to spend time in the south city centre. We'll be back!,5,2018,11,21
247,Good atmosphere,"Been at this hotel 3 times now. Very friendly and helpfull staff. Easy to travel there from airport, bus and dart. Good value for your money. Great being there on matchdays. They have barbeques or choice of pre match meals for 10 euro and big screens to catch matches.",5,2018,11,21
247,Stay over the Rugby Weekend,My daughter and I stayed here (our third visit) and we both love this hotel particularly for the friendliness of the staff - they always go out of their way if you need any help.  The overall atmosphere in the hotel is really good and the room and decor are as always impeccable and charming.,4,2018,11,21
247,Brian Maye,"An amazing staff that handle all with grace and a smile. Thank you, I travelled from New Zealand to watch Ireland V all blacks. The place was full. Staff could not have been more helpful on such a busy night. Thank you Sandymount and your amazing staff.",4,2018,11,20
247,Back again,"Great location, great breakfast First choice when visiting family or watching rugby in Dublin Plenty of parking recently refurbished roomsPleasant helpful staff handy for Sandymount and Baggott Street and only 1/2 hour walk to Grafton Street",5,2018,11,20
247,Location location location,"Fantastic as always,next door to the Aviva so perfect for the Rugby fan i am .Room was good only complaint was it was warm due to the mild weather .Evening meal and breakfast both lovely.All in all no complaints keep up the good work ",5,2018,11,20
247,Excellent Stay,"We had a great stay at the Sandymount.  They had an xxcellent breakfast, staff was superbly friendly and helpful and location could not be beat.  Will be back again soon.  Great spot to stay for Rugby, or just a business trip to Dublin.",5,2018,11,20
247,"Yet again, another great stay at the Sandymount Hotel.","Hotel in a great location, especially if you are attending a match at the Aviva Stadium. Hotel facilities are super, particularily on match day. Also, special mention for staff - so friendly & helpful. ",5,2018,11,20
247,Excellent Staff,"The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Nothing was too much hassle, check in and check out was a great experience and room service was friendly and timely. Overall a great hotel in a great location.",5,2018,11,18
247,My favourite hotel ever.,"Where do i start, i loved this place!
Location good, i wanted a hotel close enough to the Dublin centre but far enough away for it to be quiet and a home from home. The Dart is a 5 minute walk so easy to get into the centre.

I booked the executive suite which was just lovely, so clean and i had the best nights sleep in a long while in the super comfy bed. We also had a bottle of wine and a letter from the owner as it was my partners birthday - a lovely gesture.

Service great, Beatrice the receptionist was so helpful and knowledgeable on the area.

Breakfast was delicious and i found the flexible times great, we could have a lie in! 

I find it difficult to find a place that provides value for money, great service, gorgeous rooms etc but this just ticks all the boxes.

",5,2018,11,13
247,Visiting Dublin for a Fureys Concert,"Great location, great parking availability, but take care and don't go when the Aviva is in use, unless that's your destination.
Great staff, great breakfast. 
One small but, our room was starting to look a little tired with some minor problems with a light and power socket. Nothing distracting but there all the same.",4,2018,11,12
247,Sandymount Hotel is just perfect,The Sandymount Hotel is a perfect home from home.  The staff are very helpful and kind.  Breakfast was lovely. The hotel room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable.  The hotel was busy because of the Rugby but everything went very smoothly.,4,2018,11,12
247,Lovely hotel on a great location,we had tickets for the U2 concert and were looking for a hotel nearby.  It's a lovely hotel on a great location. 3arena was a 15 minute walk. Aviva stadium is around the corner. Staff very friendly. The food in the bar was very nice. The bathroom looked brand new. The only negative thing was the bed. Too short ! But overall a very good experience. ,5,2018,11,12
247,Visiting Dublin for U2 concert,"Perfect hotel, nice and clean. Just out from the main center bur very easy to reach it by Dart or walkingNice surroundings, especially the beach.The hotel is just 100 meter from Aviva Stadium. And in 15 minutes walking beside the canal you can arrive also to 3 Arena.God bless you too (U2) !",5,2018,11,12
247,Disappointing attitude...,Having paid close on 200 euros a night for an average room I did not expect to be enjoying a drink at the hotel bar drinking out of plastic! I appreciate the Rugby was on at the very nearby stadium but my wife and I were not at it; the game had already started and the bar was near empty. When the front desk and duty manager were challenged about the practice I received mildly insulting platitudes along with 'didn't you realise the rugby was on?'.  Frankly I cant remember seeing anything saying rugby supporters only when we booked. Dublin was as ever great fun...but wont be rushing back to this hotel.,3,2018,11,12
247,Cute,"This hotel is a very cute hotel. It’s old but remodel so it’s super quaint. They have a lot of different type rooms who’s is great. They have twin beds, triple and even quadruple. The service at front desk was amazing, they were very helpful and knowledgeable. 
The rooms were clean but only complain about the rooms was that the pillows were stiff and they didn’t give you enough towels.
It is not close for a walk to the city center, it’s doable but it’s a very long walk but what is good about it, you can walk 2 minutes to the dart station which will take you straight to downtown. 
Cute not very expensive hotel!",4,2018,11,10
247,"Lovely staff, small rooms","This hotel had very nice staff, the bar there was lovely. I was spending the day in the hotel room to get work done, the room service food was pretty poor and the room was very small, but the price was reasonable. Overall, it was a nice spot for the price relative to hotel costs in Dublin. Easy access to the city centre on DART or bus too.",3,2018,11,10
247,Fantastic hotel ,"I found this hotel by chance when I was searching online for a place to stay while attending a concert at the 3arena. I actually thought it was too far from the arena but booked it anyway. It’s only a 10-15 min walk across the bridge and is a fabulous peaceful walk. The hotel itself is really nice, clean, with friendly staff, gorgeous food and excellent service all around. I’ll never stay anywhere else again only here when attending concerts!! ",5,2018,11,10
247,Not the hotel I remember,Everything was great until we asked for a taxi to go to the bord gais theatre and were told the app was down by the very rude front of house manager .surely the phones still work?I have stayed in the sandymount hotel on many many occasions and this is the first time I've had less than exceptional service. I'm disappointed. ,4,2018,11,10
247,Excellent hotel in great location,I stayed here recently and was very impressed. All of the staff were so pleasant and helpful and there is a lovely atmosphere in the hotel. Excellent location and near the city centre. I look forward to staying here again in the near future!,5,2018,11,09
247,Lovely hotel,"Friendly staff, ideal location for city centre and Aviva Stadium. Breakfast is delicious as are the bar/ restaurant meals. Travelled with a mum on a disability scooter, easy car parking and lift access. Had a disabled access room with a walk in shower which was great, powerful hot showers. Smoking areas available at the front of the hotel and rear of the bar. Hop on/off bus stops outside of the hotel. Complimentary tea, coffee and water.",4,2018,11,08
247,Nice boutique hotel,"I stayed here earlier in the week for two nights while attending a work event nearby. 

The hotel is lovely inside and out - decor is chic and spacious. 

We arrived late and the staff who checked us in were friendly and asked us if we needed a map or had any questions about the area. 

My room (237) was quite difficult to find as the number range on the signs around the hotel stop at 236, however I eventually found it via a small sign near the staircase. I wasn't sure how far along to walk because of the first point raised above, so this could be a bit clearer. 

The room was really nice however extremely warm, even with the radiator off. The towel rail was on and unable to turn it off so this may have attributed to the heat - windows were opened which helped a tad. Maybe a fan in the room would be handy. The bathroom is very nice - toiletries included. Tea and coffee facilities including biscuits. My only negative on the room was that the bin under the desk was full of stuff from the previous occupant - including tonnes of dirty hankies and empty wrappers! 

Breakfast is a buffet which I liked both mornings. The food was hot, plentiful and service for tea and coffee from waiters was prompt. ",4,2018,11,08
247,"Nice hotel, nice people","I stayed for 7 nights, it’s a very nice hotel. First we were in a very small room but changed because the air conditioning didn’t worked so good.
Excellent service and food at the bar and breakfast very complete.
Front desk very kind and always happy to help.
It’s no so close to down town like I read but there is a train station walking distance.
Shower wasn’t so good when showering water changed from very hot to very cold.
It’s clean but some things weren’t  cleaned like papers on my desk and glasses on the bathroom.
Nice stay, definitely  repeat.",4,2018,11,08
247,Excellent value,"I have stayed in the Sandymount Hotel on a few occasions. The hotel is excellent value. The staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are lovely and spacious and very clean. The bar is really nice and the food is lovely. The hotel is very convenient to local transport and within easy reach of town, and the road leading to bray etc. very convenient if you are traveling by ferry. It is also on the doorstep to Sandymount strand a lovely beach to enjoy a walk on. There is ample car parking which is free to guests. ",5,2018,11,07
247,Good location,"Our room was new and very clean. The hotel is very handy for the Aviva, RDS and the 3 Arena.The DART is only 5 minutes walk, Sandymount village 10 minutes walk and in fact you could walk to Grafton Street in less than half an hour",3,2018,11,06
247,perfect hotel,"would recommend to anyone going to Dublin perfect hotel.buffet was brilliant all covered so much choice staff very lovely 24/7 reception , thank you very much will be back again if ever in Dublin :)   .",5,2018,11,06
247,Worth a visit,"We stayed here for a concert which was in the 3 arena and everything about the hotel was brilliant, rooms, food which was fab and worth the money and such a reasonable price hotel for Dublin. U can walk 2 the 3 arena which is about 20-25 mins,we walked back on a nice night ",5,2018,11,06
247,Jo Review,Staff friendly and helpful. Room cosy but comfy clean and fresh. Location ideal for quick access to city centre. Room rate reasonable. Free parking which is a big thing for Dublin hotels. Would book here again. ,5,2018,11,06
247,Nice Location. Simply Sandymount!,Stayed for one night when going to a concert at the 3 Arena back in November 2017. Property is located on a quiet street with the Aviva Stadium just a few steps away at the end of the road. Nice modern rooms. Lovely bar too with a good selection of beers on tap. There is good choice of local bars & restaurants within walking distance. Free onsite parking. Good breakfast.,5,2018,11,06
247,Fabulous Hotel,Excellent service and a beautiful hotel. We stayed under the Shoppers Special deal and it was wonderful value for money. Staff were really helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Would highly recommend ,5,2018,11,05
247,Peaceful break in Dublin.,"The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel is located in a quiet area. There were no late night parties in the hotel either which was great. It's only a 25 minute walk away from the 3arena. The food served in the hotel is good as well, including the help yourself breakfast buffet. I'm definitely going to stay here again for my next trip in Dublin. ",5,2018,11,05
247,A good place near Dublin center and near the sea side.,An excellent place near the Dublin center. A good value for a confortable room and a good sleep quality. The room is confortable The breakfast is excellent with a large variety of food. The staff is very friendly and competent. Maybe the bed would be larger.,4,2018,11,05
247,Sure 'twas grand ,"I chose this because it was convenient to the 3Arena (15min walk) within my budget. I would prefer if breakfast was included in the booking and not an extra. Speaking of extras, the bottle of Prosecco in my room was a nice little luxury worth splashing out a little bit extra for. The room was comfortable with ample tv and radio channels. I slept comfortably in the bed. The shower was divine - same power even at the hotter temperatures. I mentioned in the booking form online that I am coeliac but I still had to tell the staff in the morning. The waiter was very helpful though. I took a gamble with the lightly toasted gluten free bread because I didn't know where or how it was toasted. If it was in the same toaster as normal bread it could've been contaminated but I didn't get sick. Something to be wary of if I stay again. Overall I had a comfortable stay and the staff were friendly and helpful. I would describe the price as moderately high but worth it overall.   ",4,2018,11,04
247,Very enjoyable,Stayed in this hotel end of October. On arrival was greated with a roaring open fire.   Really enjoy the stay. Room was modern and clean.  Fantastic food in the bar. Would definitely stay here again. Great location. It's next door to the Aviva stadium. It's about a 10 min taxi to the 3 arena. ,4,2018,11,04
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Great place, genuine friendly staff ,super location, keenly priced ,good food.easy to locate safe and secure parking within easy reach of the o3 arena and city centre . I would definitely stay here again",5,2018,11,03
247,Excellent Place to Stay,"We spent a couple of nights at this hotel last month.  We enjoyed it!  The room has a queen size bed and a single bed.  The bathroom has a tub/shower combination and is quite clean.  The room is an adequate size for two people.  Might be a squeeze with any more.  The restaurants are excellent, one being the bar which has fantastic pub food.  The other is a larger room with several tables.  They have a buffet table that is excellent. The hotel is located just north of the city in the village of Sandy Mount.  It's more of a neighborhood of Dublin.  It is just on the other side of Aviva Stadium.  You can walk to it easily.  Take a walk into the village to Mulligan's Pub.  It's great!",5,2018,11,02
247,Professional and friendly ,"Booked this hotel for the Andrea Bocelli concert. 
Arrived early, prompt check in by the most helpful receptionist. Room was modern and spotless. Bed very comfy. Tea and coffee facilities. 
About 20 minute stroll to 3 arena. 
Breakfast next morning was buffet style which can usually be hit an miss but every item was freshly cooked by chef and was just fabulous. 
Loved our stay. Won't be the last time to stay in this beautiful building. ",5,2018,11,02
247,Excellent Stay,"Fantastic stay with really friendly, helpful staff, would highly recommend. Beautiful decor across the hotel and great outside areas. Attended a BBQ while here and the food, setting and atmosphere was amazing. Excellent breakfast and had a lovely lunch in the bar also. Really could not fault anything and looking forward to my next visit.",5,2018,11,01
247,First trip do dublin,"Pros:The hotel is pretty close to Dart (5min walk), which is ideal to use your leapcard.Calm and quiet neighborhood. The staff was 5* during the whole stay.Cons:The rooms don't have A/C.The breakfast should be have more diversity.If you bought your leapcard and you're planing to use it on your wayback to the airport, count with a 20min walking close to 3Arena, otherwise you'll need to take a Taxi or aircoach 702 (about 8€ pax).",4,2018,10,31
247,First day in Ireland,"Clean, neat & staff was very accommodating & friendly.  The rooms were very small but OK.  They do need new pillows!  The food was fresh & so nicely served.  The breakfasts were OUTSTANDING! The dinners were good but believe it or not, the portions were TOO LARGE...just do not like to see fooodgo to waste.",4,2018,10,31
247,Small room but fine,"Stayed in the sandymount as my usual 2 Dublin hotels were full.  It was fine but I wouldn’t choose it over my usual choices.
I walked as I like to when I can and I found the walk there a little dark down by the canal, I’m sure a nervous person wouldn’t like it.
Once there the hotel was fine, I’d maybe suggest quaint and like a local hotel. My room was small, basic but perfectly fine.  I was late so ordered in pizza but there is a restaurant.
Bathroom tiny but ok and clean, overall it was a nice stay but fairly basic and a touch tired in places, nice and friendly though. I would stay there again but as I have already said it wouldn’t be my first choice.",4,2018,10,30
247,Nice,A good location and a comfortable hotel overall with a nice bar / good bar menu.The bedrooms could do with a little freshning up though. Overall I'd be reasonably happy to stay here again at the right price!      ,4,2018,10,30
247,Vicki Power,"Beatrice was fabulous, very sweet and accommodating! We looked forward to our return visit when the customer service was excellent once again! I would highly recommend this hotel! Excellent in every respect.",5,2018,10,29
247,Cozy Stay,"My partner and I really enjoyed our stay here, the food at the bar was great and overall it was really a comfortable stay. The room was nice and warm and really cozy and clean. Will be staying here again!",5,2018,10,29
247,"So cosy, so comfortable","The Sandymount was a great hotel to stay in. It had everything I needed, was super comfortable, and the food was great. Despite being quite a large hotel, it felt cosy and warm, and I really enjoyed my stay. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to others!",5,2018,10,29
247,Great stay and location,"Stayed here for 2 nights for my boyfriends birthday, didnt mind staying 10 mins out of town because the price was abit better and this hotel is right next to the train station or about €14 in an uber. It was my boyfriends birthday so we were given a complimentary bottle of wine which was very kind. Dont have anything negative to say about this hotel, everything from the room, staff, and breakfast in the restuarant was great. ",5,2018,10,29
247,Very pleasant stay,"This hotel was very good value the room we had was clean and tidy ,the staff throughout the hotel were great nothing was too much trouble for them they were helpful and smiling,the breakfast in the hotel was good with a huge variety on offer.i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel",4,2018,10,28
247,Clean place + great breakfast,"I stayed there for 2 nights. The room was clean, however tiny and quite tired (defo required some renovation). Great (but quite simple) breakfast and very friendly staff. Well located - 30-40 walk from the city center or 10 min walk+5 min by train.",4,2018,10,27
247,Holiday,Enjoyed our stay at Sandymount Hotel.  Everyone friendly and the breakfast buffet was excellent. Room was clean and we slept with the windows partially open.  At times during the night it was noisy.  The window faced a courtyard and you could hear other people in their rooms loudly talking.  I guess that's the price you pay when the windows are open.,5,2018,10,26
247,Fabulous stay,"We were attending a concert in the 3 arena so we picked to stay here as it seemed like a convenient location with free parking. Check in was very easy and they accommodated us as we had arrived before check in time. The receptionists were lovely and very helpful with different tips. Rooms were comfortable and the shower was powerful. The towels were on a heated rail so it was fab to have hot towels when we came out of the shower. The train station was a 2 minute walk and the 3 arena was a 15 minute walk. When we came back after the concert, we had a few drinks before bed and were served by ivor and elida. Both provided great service and were very attentive. Ivor made us feel very comfortable and nothing was too much of an ask.",5,2018,10,26
247,Holiday,Take some time to catch up with a few friends in Dublin rooms are clean and presentable staff are friendly even now I got delayed five hours flight with Ryan air was easy  Close to the rugby stadium and trams and trains ,5,2018,10,24
247,Hotel Review,The beds were really  comfy and the shower was super powerful which was great. Breakfast was delicious and there was a great choice. Nice touches in the room such as fresh milk on request for tea/coffee and bottled water. The hotel was clean and modern and staff very helpful and friendly. Will definitely return. ,5,2018,10,23
247,Nice hotel,"Great location, free carpark, food from the bar was good and the cocktails as well with normal prices.rooms are clean and you get everything whst you need. Safe...iron...the bed was great.breakfast was super. Lots of choices and the staff are very friendly. ",5,2018,10,23
247,Beautiful hotel,"I liked this place: it was comfortable, clean, and modern without losing character. I will highly recommended it. The price for the stay was reasonable. The staff was very friendly, and smile easily. They were helpful and pleasant. I did not care for the food; not as good and expensive. It was expedient though.",5,2018,10,22
247,Excellent stay,"Great hotel, food was stunning and staff were great. Excellent location and easy to get to port for early ferry. I will stay here again. Great for couples or Business travelers. Bar had a great atmosphere.",5,2018,10,22
247,Disappointing. ,"I recently stayed in the Sandymount hotel Dublin and can honestly say I was slightly disappointed. When we arrived the hotel looked lovely and the communal areas were cosy and inviting. Our room was ready earlier than expected which was a bonus as we were just going to drop our bags off so instead we got the chance to change before heading back out. When we first got into the room I was immediately disappointed, online the rooms look big and spacious and bright. Our room was smaller than expected with one small window. The dressing table was full of flyers and the tea and coffee tray making it hard to get ready with very little space. The top drawer wouldn’t close properly due to the covering starting to lift. In the bathroom the shower was covered in rust on the rail and the toiletry holder. The walls are so thin that every morning we could hear the people above us singing and could make out every word. On our last night we ordered room service and the soup was lovely however the two different pasta dishes we ordered were bland and luke warm suggesting they had been sitting out for a while. There was no salt or pepper on our room service tray or in the room to season our meal. Overall I was really excited about staying here but wouldn’t rush back. ",3,2018,10,22
247,Excellent as always,Excellent.  The hotel is in a lovely area and very near a Dart.  The rooms are lovely and the food is great.  The staff are very welcoming.  It feels like home away from home.  I always love staying here.  There are lovely seating areas outside as well,5,2018,10,22
247,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel. Good room (they even give you a few biscuits with the tea service). Good breakfast. The only quibble which I would have was the constant loud hum from outside the room (like an air-conditioner unit), which made it difficult to sleep.",4,2018,10,21
247,"Great Hotel,great stay","Just visited Hotel for the recent Ireland v Wales game the location is perfect for Aviva Stadium and links to centre.All the staff we met were friendly and helpful comfortable rooms,lovely breakfast great variety,booked a meal in restaurant before the match great meal,nice atmosphere before and after game would definitely return to Sandymont.",4,2018,10,21
247,"Sandymount Hotel- quiet and conveniently located, very pretty surroundings.","The hotel was really well situated with access to train and navigable roads; important when you're not used to narrow Irish roads. It was also very close to the stadium. Parking was readily available and the staff at check-in were very friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast provided a lot of choice in comfortable surroundings. Hop-on, hop-off bus stopping directly at the door in the morning was a bonus.
Our room was a bit small on space however and the window opened directly onto parked cars, so it did not feel private.",4,2018,10,21
247,Convenient location in a beautiful neighborhood,"You could tell the hotel has had some updates.  My heating was out, but they brought me a space heater that worked out fine.  They were not able to accommodate an early check in which was frustrating because I had contacted the hotel beforehand that I'd be arriving on an early morning flight from the US. Otherwise the staff was friendly and helpful. ",4,2018,10,18
247,Great Hotel,"Love this hotel. My favourite hotel in Dublin. Excellent location, close to the Aviva, 3 Arena, RDS and very covenient for the Dart into city centre. Have visited many times, and the owners and staff always have a warm welcome. Food is excellent and reasonably priced for Dublin. Highly recommended",5,2018,10,17
247,Very comfortable ,We stayed here as were attending a wedding close by and the hotel kindly offered us and the groom a courtesy car to the venue which was very kind.It is perfectly situated for public transport the rooms are not big but beds are comfortable bathroom had excellent shower the staff are friendly and the bar has great vibe. Only down side was we were wakened at 6am with bins being wheeled about ! We would definitely stay here again. ,4,2018,10,16
247,Good value for this price range.,"Overall, a very accommodating hotel with lots to offer travelers.  Professional customer service at desk upon check-in. Great breakfast buffet and prompt service from the hostess. This hotel is also very convenient to the train station at Landsdown St.  We had dinner more than once in their spacious bar area because they offer lunch and dinner there. Each time the food was good, but the service was disappointing. Even getting just drinks seemed to be a challenge considering the amount of waiters they had. Once we were served our first drink and food, nobody checked back to see how it was going or if we needed anything else. I even had to walk up to the wait station to get a check because I could not get the attention of a waiter there.",4,2018,10,15
247,Great from start to finish,"First impressions entering from the carpark were not good as the hallways are narrow and it looks like a rabbit warren but as soon as we met the reception staff everything improved. The staff are wonderful, the rooms are stunning and the food was fab. Would definitely stay again",5,2018,10,15
247,Little bit of disappointment ,"Check in was great. Staff very welcoming and nice. Rooms cosy, quit and clean. Breakfast was tasty and great choise. Bathrooms..........aaarrrggghhhhh.. when you walk in looks very clean and beautiful.... but.. doors are broken.. Bathroom was literally leaking. It's not hygienic at all. Only one person took quick shower, other person left hotel with no shower. Pillows for bed could be better quality. For the money what I paid everything need to be up to standarts. ",3,2018,10,13
247,Bedrooms are a huge disappointment. Not good value for money.,"On arrival this hotel looks impressive. The reception, bar and restaurant area is really nice and staff were friendly. BUT our room was awful. It smelt bad - unsure if it was a sewage or damp smell but not pleasant to arrive to. It also looks nothing like the pictures on the website. It was so small! There is hardly room for one occupant to get ready in, never mind two. It was also extremely noisy. We were on the level just below reception and there was a constant stampede of footsteps from very early in the morning. There was also an exit to the car park right next to our room which banged continually all morning as well. We later realised it had been propped open with a brick. Overall the room was very disappointing and was not good value for money at all - we may have been less inclined to leave a negative review if we hadn’t paid a substantial amount of money for a 4 star hotel. Do not accept room 136 if you do decide to stay here.",2,2018,10,13
247,"Location, Hotel, Staff, Food, second to none.","Had a lovely 2 night stay at this Hotel.  We have no complaints what so ever, will be staying here again.Lovely staff, Excellent food, Lovely rooms. Spotlessly clean..Perfect location for RDS . Just a walk away from the town centre and Stephens Green.",5,2018,10,11
247,Poor service,"Poor service, staff communication was bad. Facilities were goid but missing some bacics such as a shower cap and body moisturiser. Could hear a lot of movement in upstairs room, noise insulation is very poor. ",2,2018,10,10
247,Lovely stay,"We enjoyed our stay in this lovely hotel. Room, bed and bathroom small but spotless. Perfect location for the match. We would book for autumn internationals but priced out of our league unfortunately. ",4,2018,10,10
247,visit,Easy access to center of Dubin. Busy with rugby match at weekend. Was not informed of this.Would have enjoyed a ticket to the local stadium. Had a problem with entry to hotel as roads were blocked by the police (Gardia),4,2018,10,10
247,vacation,Older hotel near the city. Train station a short walk away. Staff was very helpful. Room was clean and adequate. Safe in the room. Great buffet breakfast with lots of options. Would stay here again if we ever return,5,2018,10,09
247,Short Break,Enjoyed our stay from start to finish found staff friendly and the food in the restaurant was very good.The location was close to the DART which made travel into Dublin very easy. Look forward to our visit when we next travel to dublin,5,2018,10,08
247,Business trip,"I didn't get to experience all the hotel has to offer during my short stay but congratulate the owners for providing a very warm and helpful reception upon arrival, a quiet, comfortable, clean and well equipped bedroom. The breakfast buffet was all fresh and very well catered with fast service from the waiting staff.+ Very good value for such a great location- coffee could be stronger (a minor gripe!)",4,2018,10,08
247,"Clean, comfortable and central","We stayed for two nights at Sandymount Hotel and had a fantastic stay. The staff were very friendly, the rooms very clean and comfortable and the breakfast was fantastic. The hotel is so close to Lansdowne Road Station, you can get public transport into the city easy. You can also stroll into Sandymount Village for some great food and drink. Thank you for a great stay, we would easily recommend to family and friends. ",5,2018,10,05
247,Excellent hotel very good location and fantastic food.,This hotel surpassed my expectations.  We loved the breakfast and had dinner in the restaurant several nights. Definitely would book again. The staff are outstanding and do everything to please you. A great location. ,5,2018,10,05
247,Mom's Christmas gift to see cliff richard at 3 arena.,"Fully enjoyed stay in Dubin did all the tourist stuff. Hotel a little far out to walk to town centre, but the taxi was quick and easy (plus added to the experience). Hotel absolutely brilliant couldn't fault it. Those hanging baskets are amazing would have loved to have seen them in full bloom. Fair play to all at the Sandymount.",5,2018,10,03
247,Great hotel in Sandymount,"We stayed here one night while on a tour. The staff members are terrific, professional, and helpful. The neighborhood and local town area/beach are beautiful. The chef was amazing at accommodating my husband and son with their food allergies by working with them and provided a great meal/dessert.  Definitely recommend. ",5,2018,10,03
247,"Friendly, personal touch","The rooms are modern decor, spacious and very clean. The service was very professional and friendly. The staff made you feel very much at home. The food in the bar was prepared to the highest standard and very reasonable",5,2018,10,02
247,Quirky and comfortable,My wife and I truly enjoyed our stay at the Sandymount.  The layout of the hotel is a bit odd but it has a lot of charm and all of the amenities were very nice.  The distance to everything was very manageable either by cab or by Dart and the staff was always pleasant and helpful.,4,2018,10,02
247,Home from Home Experience,"On my business trips to Dublin, I choose to stay in this hotel on every occasion because the rooms are extremely clean, well equipped and warm.  The food is really good and the staff are friendly, professional and efficient.  I have recommended this hotel to my work colleagues as the corporate rate is competitive and the hotel is very close to transport links, etc.",5,2018,09,30
247,Comfortable stay,This is quite an old style hotel which gives it a bit of character. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good with all the usual stuff. The room and bathroom were quite small but had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and WiFi in our room was the best I’ve ever had in a hotel. It is very close to aviva stadium and about a 35 minute walk to Grafton Street.,4,2018,09,29
247,Cramped accommodations,"The room we stayed in on the ground floor was a triple in a room that was far too small for this.  Two of the bedside cabinets were turned sideways because they wouldn't have fitted otherwise and there was literally no space between the cabinets, walls and the bedsides.  The ensuite bathroom was tiny.  It had an over bath shower when the room was only really big enough to be a shower room.  The back of the door was damaged from being bashed on the toilet bowl because the room was so small.  I was very disappointed in the room.  The rest of the hotel is pleasant enough.",2,2018,09,29
247,Short stay,"My Husband and I stayed for just one night when visiting Dublin for a concert . 
The location is good, close to both the Aviva Stadium and 3 Arena . 
The staff were helpful and friendly . The breakfast was good with sufficient choice . 
The rooms were clean but small. Our safe didn’t work and there was an iron burn on the carpet. The bathroom was also very small. We found the bed uncomfortable and if you are over 6 ft like my husband expect cold feet as the beds are small doubles only 6 ft long . Although we enjoyed our stay, I would only rate this hotel 3 star",3,2018,09,28
247,Nice stay.,"Given larger room than booked which is always appreciated. Everything you could need, robes, slippers, dental kit, shaving kit, shower cap, face cloths, smart TV, tea and coffee. Couldn't ask for more. Very clean and well kept.",4,2018,09,28
247,Nice stay,Sandymount in Dublin Ireland was in a good location-right across from Aviva Stadium.  The hotel has been recently updated and very charming.    A few minor negatives-room on 4th floor quite warm.  We had to ask for fan to try and draw breeze from open window to sleep without roasting.  The bathroom design was modern and nice but space was a bit tight as it is in a lot of European hotels.  Several things to be redone-no hook in bathroom for clothing (they should put foldout one on pocket door) and the folding glass shower door was nice but not practical as it allowed water to leak badly on the floor.  Also NO outlet in bathroom and had to blow dry hair in room that was already hot!!  Staff was very helpful and friendly.,4,2018,09,26
247,Quiet alternative to downtown Dublin,"While airport transportation was not as easy or inexpensive as we’d hoped — bus from airport wouldn’t honor our recently purchased LEAP card — Sandymount was a good location for DART train to Dublin. Short, direct walk to station in nice neighborhood. Hotel room was clean and comfortable, breakfast plentiful, dinner very good, reception desk helpful. When we experienced the crush of travelers in Dublin city center, we were especially glad we chose Sandymount.",4,2018,09,25
247,Fabulous hotel in a delightful neighborhood!,This hotel is lovely and in a nice location. It is in a nice neighborhood with nice shops and restaurants. The hotel is a three minute walk from the train station.  The hotel restaurant is very good as well. ,5,2018,09,25
247,A Very Enjoyable Stay.,"We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed our visit. The reception staff were excellent throughout. Friendly and always ready with helpful advice. The hotel is well placed for access to the city centre and we enjoyed the buffet breakfast each day.
Our room was spacious and very comfortable.
Would definitely return when next in Dublin.",4,2018,09,25
247,Good Value for money,"This was a nice, clean hotel although the rooms were small and the bathrooms were tiny. It seems like very old construction, there is no cooling in the rooms, but I don't know if that is common-practice in Dublin. It is a little away from the main city as well. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Since it was a rainy day, they offered us umbrellas to take with us. The room was not Airconditioned, if you stay here ask for fan in your room.",3,2018,09,23
247,Large hotel well kept,"Large room, smaller bathroom, clean. Short walk to train into Dublin, frequent service. Buffet style breakfast excellent, good choice cooked and continental. Check-in staff friendly, good information and map.",4,2018,09,22
247,Extremely friendly staff,"Extremely friendly staff that went out of their way to accomadate every need. I wanted to watch early rugby morning rugby, they opened the bar just  for me  and brought me breakfast from the buffet. Special thanks to friendly barman Sòllon, always there with good chat and a smile",5,2018,09,21
247,I was very satisfied,"I fell in love with this hotel. Everything including rooms was spotless and staff makes their best to meet your requirements. Room was also spacious well furnished and bed soft. A perfect place for business trip, I spent here 3 nights and I was very satisfied.",5,2018,09,20
247,Great Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel. Staff attended to all our requests and provided good information. Rooms are not big, but clean and neat. The hotel is not located in the city centre, but a train station is 5 minutes walk, and the bus stop about 15 minutes walk from the hotel. Breakfast was great! We had dinner at the hotel, food was great with good service. Thanks Iona for great service, you are an asset to the hotel. 
",5,2018,09,20
247,Lovely Hotel! Would recommend 😊,"Well kept, quiet, friendly. Staff were excellent. Rooms a tad small but expected. Beds were comfortable and showers top notch water pressure. We loved the hotel bar; great vibe and excellent food and drink. Be sure to stay for breakfast..worth it.",5,2018,09,19
247,Executive rooms very small,Room & hotel was very clean but surprised how small the executive room was. With 2 suit cases in room we were walking into furniture etc. Only about 18inches from end of bed to the wall. Felt very cramped. Staff pleasant enough ...also unable to order any food between 11.30 & 12.30 during the day time.,3,2018,09,18
247,Pure Luxury With Amazing Service,"This Hotel had such a lovely vibe. We recently had a family occasion here and we were so well looked after by the wonderful staff. Especially Ivor, who made the Occassion extra special by catering to our every need. Everybody commented on the freindly service and the amazing food. We recently had the fortunate opportunity to stay here for two weeks.During this time the staff have made us feel so at home in the luxurious surroundings. We will highly recommend the hotel to all friends and family visiting Dublin.",5,2018,09,14
247,Great Hospitality,"Just completed a nice 3 night stay here.  The front desk staff were very friendly and always helpful.  The team at the Line Out Bar were particularly noteworthy.  Beata, Sollon, Paulo and Sri Sri were amazing - Friendly, Attentive and Gracious even while being stressed by 2 events and a full bar.  I very much appreciated their hospitality and intend to visit them again on my next visit.",5,2018,09,07
247,Excellent Hotel,"This is without doubt one of the finest hotels I've stayed in. I stay here on a regular basis. There Is always a warm welcome from the reception team who couldn't be more helpful. The rooms are spacious and kept to a very high standard. The bar staff are exceptional,they always make time for you and go over and above.The bar food is top class.The hotel has free WiFi and free guest parking.I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody.",5,2018,09,05
247,Amazing Hotel,"Have stayed here many time but recently I had a last minute business stay here 
From organizing at short notice to check in, the staff were very helpful.

The room rate was very competitive and the room itself was of a very high standard.
I’d highly recommend for business or pleasure as it’s very close to lansdowne rd, the Rds and ballsbridge.

One of my favorites ",5,2018,09,04
247,Nice older hotel,Our room was comfortable with two beds. Rather small but not a problem as little time was spent in the room.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with reservations and ordering taxis. Upon arrival the layout of the hotel can be confusing but after being lost a couple of times getting to our room we were able to manage. We spent three days at the hotel.  Ate breakfast in their restaurant which was very good.  Also had supper once in the bar which was also good. The hotel is located in a quiet area so as night there is considerable quietness and peace.,4,2018,09,03
247,"Stay every week, and feel very welcomed","I stay most weeks on business, and the feeling I have is of a family run hotel. The hotel has an unusual layout which can be confusing, but it adds to the feeling that you are staying somewhere more friendly. The reception staff always say hello, and the welcome is always warm.

The breakfast is very good, and a very wide selection. Again, the staff are very friendly and cannot do enough to ensure breakfast is a wonderful start to the day.

A minibus is available early in the morning to some nearby locations, which make it easy to connect with Dublin’s bus and tram system.

247,Great hotel in lovely area,"A friend and I spent one week at Sandymount hotel....we were very pleased with the service, with the overall helpfulness and friendlyness of staff. The hotel is situated in the calm community of Sandymount, just three stops from Dublin center on the DART line. The room was absolutely clean, and perfecty  fitted for our needs. We would definitely book there again!",4,2018,08,31
247,Bar Service,"Ivor and Fabio made our stay at this hotel at the bar tending to my wife and I. As American-Hispanic and Portguese speakers it was incredibly welcoming to find incredible service with people who made us feel even more accepted who spoke both Spanish and Portuguese . They were the utmost attentive and amazing people who provided incredible service. If my stay at this hotel was a sundae, they would be the icing and cherry and top.",5,2018,08,30
247,A grade hospitality,"Staying in Sandymount for work for the next few months and genuinely have to say the hotel/staff/facilities are everything I would expect from a family run business. My only critisism would be the choice of food and rotation of menu in the bar, however Sollon my waiter for the night has made up for that in terms of service and hospitality. A refreshing change from other corporate hotel trying to offer the same ambiance..",5,2018,08,30
247,Nice hotel stay,We enjoyed an overnight stay here as part of a tour around Ireland. We booked a standard room but as it was midweek we were allocated a generous sized family room. The parking was at the front of the hotel and reception staff were informative of the local area. Our room was beautifully decorated with a very comfortable bed. We walked 5 minutes down the road to catch a train into the centre of Dublin. 3 stops only but saved a 40 minute walk. Breakfast was set up early which worked well for us having to get to the ferry port for 7.30am. Wide choice of breakfast food available and good coffee. ,4,2018,08,30
247,Mrs mckerr,"Spent the night here on 7th August room was lovely everything was really clean, we had dinner that evening was really enjoyable staff and service was 1st class as was breakfast next morning. I would highly recommend this hotel.Next time hopefully we will stay longer.",4,2018,08,29
247,Sandymount Hotal,We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and it was a great place to stay in .The room was generously sized and very clean.Breakfast was very good.This brings me to the staff in this hotel.I have never witnessed such attentive staff .Staff in reception are wonderful and staff in dining room exceptional.All porter staff were very helpful.Location of hotel was great and we had easy access to city.I will be back.Thank You,5,2018,08,29
247,"If you’re tall, go elsewhere ","My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights as part of a tour group. Our room - 510 - looked nothing like the glossy, spacious pictures on the website.

The room was very small - 1 double bed and 1 single bed, bed side tables were turned sideways to make them fit in the room. I had no space to put my suitcase and had to place it on the window ledge.

My husband is 6’3” and had to sleep half sitting up as his feet overhung the small double bed.  The bathroom was very small, the door couldn’t open fully as the toilet was in the way, the shower is over a high bath and there is no shaving/magnifying mirror.

There was construction going on outside our room and renovation inside which made our room noisy and smelt of paint fumes. The walls are thin and you can hear all sorts of noises coming from the rooms around yours. Our room was located on the lower ground floor on the way to the car park and a long way from the bar and restaurant.

We asked for a more suitable room that we would be comfortable in but we were told the only rooms available were the same as the one we had.

Positives: breakfast was good with a variety of food available, wait staff were welcoming and organized. Hotel located close to Aviva Stadium. Room was clean.  Still, we wouldn’t stay here again nor would we recommend it to anyone.

247,Sandymount Hotel 3 nights,"Recently visited Dublin and stayed at the Sandymount Hotel in Ballsbridge, just about a 20 minute taxi ride from the airport. Although it was not in central Dublin, there is a train station just a short walk away that will get you into the city centre in about a 10 min. 

We didn’t get the chance to spend much time at the hotel. It was a short trip and we had tours booked. It was solely for having dinner and sleeping. It was a really nice stay, nonetheless and we were happy with it.

What I enjoyed about the stay? Let’s just talk about the aesthetics first. I loved the decor, the bright yellow and blue chairs and sofas and funky light fixtures and the abundance of seating areas gave the place a relaxed, light and hip vibe.

Second, Sandymount Hotel has a very friendly, helpful and very diverse staff, which was also wonderful to see. Staff seemed to be from across the globe - Spain, Portugal, Mauritius and I believe, Japan and were just lovely people. It was awesome! 

And lastly, the food at both the restaurant and bar were also tasty.

Overall, the friendly service and the efficiency with which we were served was wonderful and made for an enjoyable stay. 

I wish we had more time to explore the hotel itself and the quaint village of Sandymount, again just about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and with a little beach area, and shops.

I would suggest is to make sure if you want two beds in your room, you check to make sure that’s what you’re getting. We mistakenly interrupted “Executive Double” to mean two double beds but it meant one. The hotel was super accommodating and helped us to rectify that situation (it was a last minute trip, so we were rushed and didn’t pay attention to the details carefully, totally our fault!)

Oh, I would also suggest checking out the local village - we only spent about 15 mins and had to turn around but it seemed like it would be lovely for a coffee and a stroll near the water. We even saw swans! 

We did have to take a taxi back to the hotel from Heuston Station after our tours so keep that in mind as well. 

",4,2018,08,27
247,Amazing friendly Service,Ivor and Fabio from the bar have both made my visit to dublin even better ..  they are amazing fun friendly smiley guys they made me feel so welcomed! Thank you both hopefully see you guys soon !! x :),5,2018,08,26
247,Best services in town,"Lee and Sallon provided exceptional service. Im an Irish man, an if my glass is nearly empty,i want to be offered another one. Not have to ask. Theses guys are a main stay for any hospitality business looking to be successful . Great service. 5star.",5,2018,08,26
247,Reliable as ever!,Have stayed here on many occasions during business trips to Dublin. Hotel never disappoints from the moment you reserve the room to check out. Friendliness and helpfulness of the staff is really evident. Great location if working in and around Dublin 4 with onsite free parking. Lovely selection of bar food available at reasonable price. Noticed on last two visits that room safe was locked on arrival ( presumably in error) but would be very handy if available. ,5,2018,08,26
247,Great staff!,"Nice comfortable clean hotel! The beds were comfortable! The location was superb as it was very close to The RDS! The staff create a helpful, warm atmosphere especially a waiter called Sóllon who couldn’t do enough for us! Always so attentive and friendly! Thanks for a great stay! ",4,2018,08,25
247,A good place to stay...,"Although essentially this was a  business trip, I stayed here with my wife as were moving on afterwards, so, this is not my usual business stop over. Its in a great location, quiet & calm with plenty of restaurants within walking distance. The hotel was comfortable, our room was acceptable  and they offer a tasty, plentiful & good value breakfast. I havent eaten here in the evening, but, the food I saw being served looked good. All the staff were helpfull and pleasent. Not far from the city, its a nice place to retire to after a day in Dublin, but, dont expect a great view from the room!",4,2018,08,24
247,Excellent Stay,Myself and my mum stayed for one night for a concert which happened to be a birthday present for her. When booking the room I let the hotel know that it was her birthday and they really pulled out the stops. They gave us a room upgrade and some complimentary goodies for the room. They also provided us with a free shuttle bus to the concert. I have to say a special thank you to the receptionist Beatrice for being especially lovely to us both.,5,2018,08,22
247,Mr lowthian,"Me and my colleagues stayed at the Sandymount for three weeks and the service was impeccable. This stretched from the moment we checked in, through to breakfast, evening meal to the Lineout Bar. Beata and Elida were the face we liked to see most at the bar; both constantly smiling and perfect service, just what you needed after a hard days work. Not a moment would they keep you waiting. 
5 stars from us! Can’t wait to come back again!",5,2018,08,21
247,A poor view,"We stayed three nights during the Dublin horse show. We had a room downstairs. The bathrooms are tiny... I didn’t realise they could cram so much in a small space. We were disappointed to have a view of scaffolding and the room is very gloomy.
I had no idea there was a courtesy bus until the second day but was told I had to book the day before. So I booked for the following morning then be told it doesn’t run Saturday and Sunday!  The restaurant is average at best..Generally this Hotel Is overpriced even for Ballsbridge",3,2018,08,19
247,Bad customer experience : Bedroom 602 !,"I started my holidays in Ireland on 25th of july...A bedroom for two nights in sandymount hotel...but I have been given the bedroom 602 !...Stairs 15 steps...no lift, no help with 2 20kgs cases, bathroom window opening on bins backyard, room window on the car park...at 7 o clock big noise from the bins...small bed …: my holidays started badly...and this stay at sandymount, I am afraid to say that it will be not a good souvenir !!! Go away from this room 602...Business men coming for one night, without luggage have been given agood room...but me I was a french tourist !!!!",2,2018,08,19
247,Really nice hotel at a reasonable price,"We were going to a concert in Dublin and looking for a hotel but, being summer, everything was ridiculously expensive. The Sandymount Hotel was very reasonable so we decided to give it a go and it was a revelation. 
The check-in team couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. We asked for a quiet room and they certainly delivered. It was a bit of a trek from reception but was probably the quietest hotel room we've ever stayed in. The room itself was a nice size, really clean and nicely decorated. 
In the evening we returned to the hotel and went to the bar. Again the bar staff were really friendly and helpful and it was a really pleasant experience. Breakfast the following morning was excellent. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel as a base for anyone either exploring Dublin or just on a weekend getaway.",5,2018,08,17
247,Sandymount hotel,"The hotel itself is good. Clean rooms, and good location.  What makes this place special is the staff.  From the front desk team upon check in to the wait staff at the restaurant, all were fantastic.  Igor at the restaurant was amazing. Super personable and provided excellent service. Thank you to the Sandymount staff for your great service.",4,2018,08,11
247,RDS stay at Sandymount Dublin ,"Loved our stay at the Sandymount and a valuable addition was the curtousy bus, thanks with our very friendly driver Dave. Hotel is very clean and we had an amazing meal in whittys restaurant. The hotel is very convenient for RDS showground and arriva stadium, and there’s a dart station 200 yds from the hotel",5,2018,08,11
247,Such a sad experience,"I stayed here having been recommended it, the first night I let it go that I kept being woken by the staff who’s office was next to me, I ignored all the linen that was piled up
on the floor down the corridor and outside my room. By the 2nd night I could take no more of the staff standing outside my room chatting, chatting from their office and all the linen piled up outside my room. I had had little sleep, then the builders at 7am started knocking with a grinder right outside my room. I had constantly politely asked for decaf tea in my room due to allergies and even by the third day they still coilmot get it right.  Twice I was reduced to tears the second by the manager who whilst in the bar just ignored me )I didn’t know he was the manager£ who couldn’t even be to acknowledge me to serve me a drink from the bar after the restaurant did it get me a drink despite my polite requests,   To make up for all the issues have a free drink on me says the manager with me in floods of tears by the way I had been treated. I could write s book on all the things that happened but I’m
Not sure you’ll all have the time to read it!  If you do stay there be prepared to be ignored, be prepared to have any allergies that you have ignored and be prepared for the staff to feel it’s quite acceptable to reduce you to tears as they have no people dkills and no idea how to try and fix things will an happy customer. The rooms were clean apart from the cleaners did not remove any dirty cups or glasses for two days.  

Sadly I didn’t take any pictures of the linen mounds in the corridors and outside my room which were  a constant hazard",1,2018,08,10
247,Visiting Dublin,"What a wonderful experience. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was spacious, clean and had everything you would ever need for an overnight stay from toiletries, complimentary water, iron and ironing board,bath robes and slippers. 
The dart was 5 minutes away and the city centre only 4 stops in. Parking was available at the hotel  We had breakfast which was both continental and cooked varieties for 11.75 served in a beautifully decorated dining room.
We will certainly return to this delightful hitel",5,2018,08,08
247,"Not good value, but good location for travelling around","Great location for Aviva Stadium, the DART trains north or south, and yet a quiet location close to the River Dodder. Check in was good, nice public areas. Our room 531 was at the end of a corridor; outside major building work meant a scaffolding immediately outside the window, and starting c07.00 on Friday the noise was unacceptable. Hotel was full, however, when I raised this at reception I was not offered any alternative, nor concessions; work didn’t take place at the weekend.
The room was small, the bath towels are really hand towels, way too small. I was paying what I considered a high average amount for our three nights, and the room was not good value. On a very efficient check out, I was not asked “how was your stay” nor any questions; I was ready with the above comments. So not a lot of apparent interest in guests’ enjoyment? 
Overall, many plusses but far more negatives and poor value.",3,2018,08,06
247,Beware,"We stayed here on a two night break while attending a concert in the nearby RDS. Hotel was fine,location brilliant but the room we were given was dreadful-dark,tiny,and a dingy window with view of scaffolding and building works.The noise from this refurbishment was very disturbing.The bathroom was a!so minute.We were very disappointed with our stay in this hotel,especially as it was an  expensive rate  -very bad value for money!",2,2018,08,06
247,Sandymount hotel is the place to stay in Dublin,"I have been staying at Sandymount hotel at least 2 nights a week for the last 5 years and I could not imagine myself staying anywhere else. Family, friends & business colleagues have stayed there on my recommendation and still rave about the place in particular the friendliness of staff ,quitenesss at night, service, free parking, value for money and location. 
PC",5,2018,08,03
247,Comfortable and hospitable,"Sandymount hotel was lovely, in a lovely area with superb staff. The dart train was very convenient and most cost effective. 
Only concerns: rooms aren't very soundproof so got disturbed a few times with neighbors banging their doors at night, curtains dont block the light fully (should use longer curtains), and a mini fridge would've been quite usefull.",4,2018,08,03
247,Imelda,"My husband and I stayed last night in the lovely sandymount Hotel . We had a fabulous room, decor gorgeous. Had dinner in the Bar, it was excellent, the staff were great , efficient and friendly . Beatrice in reception is definitely one of the most efficient, friendly and informative person I have ever come across in hotels . She instantly makes you feel welcome. I look forward to my next visit to the Sandymount",5,2018,08,01
247,Pleasant and Peaceful,"Made a trip to Dublin recently for the first time with family and booked for a night's stay at Sandymount prior to leaving on a coach tour. The hotel itself is located in a quiet part of town. The room we stayed in was comfortable and spacious with good decor. Clean and tidy with white linens which contributed to a general relaxed and airy feeling. The bathroom was also clean and well-maintained.

The staff at reception were very courteous, friendly, patient and helpful when it came to any questions or requests we had and there were no issues with anything we enquired about. The hotel's bar was also quite good with a good selection of meals and beverages. Breakfast was also a good experience, with a good choice available.

Overall, we had a very good experience at Sandymount and would definitely consider staying here again.",4,2018,08,01
247,Nice hotel,"Great place to stay, we had a room with three beds, free bottled water and free breakfast buffet in the morning.  Would definitely stay there again.  Can get confusing finding your room because there are so many wings, but still a great place",4,2018,07,31
247,If you fancy staying in a care home...,"… then this is the place for you. It’s a bewildering and depressing maze of 170 rooms squeezed into 8 houses that just needs to be demolished. 

Seriously can’t think of anything positive to say about this place other than the lovely ladies on reception. The rooms are pokey and dark; the beds are knackered and squeaky and to top it all off the rooms aren’t clean. The throw on the bed had all kinds of stains on it. 

For £150 a night, I was expecting a lot more and this place fails to deliver. It's a travelodge experience at Hilton prices. You definitely want to avoid this place! I really struggle to see why the reviews are so positive. Location is also a bit out of the way unless you’re seeing something at the stadium. 
",2,2018,07,31
247,"Good hotel, still a work in progress","This is very quiet hotel deep in the suburbs, although right next to the Aviva stadium, and very far from any public transportation. I had checked in late and the room I was given was so hot I couldn't breathe, but there were giant windows we could open. Unfortunately the room faced the beautiful front yard where people could sit on benches and chat all night, so I had to sleep in a stifling room for the first night. The bar and restaurant were very good places for dinner and breakfast and the staff was very friendly and professional. 

Please note, the bathrooms are very small, and the bathroom sink is half the normal size. A family with small children may need more than one room to have space.",4,2018,07,30
247,Nice!,Hotel was not  convenient to public transportation. I stayed there to connect with a YMT tour group and my friend coming from another location. Hotel was nice and quiet.  Food was good. Staff was friendly.,4,2018,07,28
247,"Perfect service, moderate rooms","Our first room with two beds was at 1 pm not ready for us. Bad first impression. As we arrived later in the evening the room was so hot that we couldn’t breath. We couldn’t find an air conditioner and we couldn’t open the windows very much so that fresh air could come into the small room. The receptionist was very kind and organized a fan. Then we recognized that the tv was out of order. We got a voucher for breakfast as an compensation. As we wake up early in the morning we recognized that there was a construction work going on on the other side of our room. It was decent from the Service that we got another room for the second day. It was much nicer, bigger and the furniture was more modern. The windows could be opened and the tv worked. Thank you 🙏🏻 ",3,2018,07,28
247,"Great stay, great bar, great hotel","I stayed for a day and a half and spent a good bit of time at the bar watching the World Cup.  Beat a, Elida, Peter and Joanne were great bartenders and the service was great! The hotel itself was very nice and the front desk staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends and family!",5,2018,07,27
247,"Excellent wait staff, friendly and warm","We so enjoyed staying at a hotel who really cared about their customers. The wait staff in the dining room were excellent and the front desk was so friendly and caring! Also, enjoyed the yummy bonbons displayed for our convenience to satisfy a sweet tooth anytime. YUM!",5,2018,07,22
247,"Great locat, great staff","Our family rented eight rooms for a family gathering for a long weekend at the end of June. We had a lot of adjustments of days/rooms prior to our bash, all of which were accommodated by the staff at the hotel with a smile. Also, at the last minute we arranged a party in the BBQ area which was wonderful due to the space provided, the food and the very helpful staff. Siobhan Eagan did a great job. 
Location is great, just a 5minute walk to the Dart, a rail system with a 10 minute ride to Dublin city. Trains every 10 to 15 minutes. Taxis are available 24hours a day. 
The building is old world charm, very comfortable and quiet. No city noises. Billy Joel was in concert at the adjacent Aviva Stadium but no sound heard in our room.
The breakfast, “full Irish” is a treat. Best rashers, sausages, black/white pudding etc etc. 
We’ll be back for sure. ",5,2018,07,21
247,"Hotel is certainly good, but sleep quality wasn't...","I had high expectations owing to the reviews for this hotel, and the appearance of the lobby, decor etc. along with the welcome we received by the reception team was certainly promising. Beatrice checked us in and she was wonderfully friendly; she carried out the admin., offered to store our cases until the room was ready as we arrived just before lunchtime; and provided us with local and city maps and some suggestions where to go prior to the concert we were attending. 
We went for a walk and returned later to the room. The room certainly appeared more than adequate. It ended up being a double with an additional single at the front of the hotel - but this ended up being both a blessing and a curse...
We had some lunch in the bar prior to going to the concert. Service was again great and we thoroughly enjoyed our food/drinks. 
We then went to the Paul Simon concert and returned to our room. This was where things started to turn... The double bed feels like a bit of an impostor... it's the smallest double I've ever been in. I'm 6ft 5 and it just wasn't comfortable for me and my wife to share. In the end, i went to the single (which may have been the blessing in disguise of the room). But shortly hereafter, people were congregating outside the front of the hotel drinking/smoking at the tables / waiting on lifts/taxis. The noise of them was still present at 1.30 am... Increasingly frustrated i eventually got over to sleep but again was woken at about 6.30 am by others outside the hotel.   :( 
With not much sleep, we ventured down for breakfast which was adequate. 
Unfortunately the reception team upon checkout wasn't just as professional and friendly as Beatrice. They didn't ask how our stay was or give us an opportunity to voice our experience... it was more a 'take your money and go' departure in comparison to our welcome. 
In saying that, I'm all for giving places the benefit of the doubt and ultimately have booked again in a couple of months time. I hope the noise etc. was just an unfortunate one-off and maybe the bed situation will have improved. We shall wait and see...",3,2018,07,20
247,Wonderful balance ,"Pre arranged by travel agent and without knowledge of the area. Attending with 13 others on business. Easy cab ride from airport. Removed from the direct business of downtown in a quaint neighborhood but with very easy access to rail. Room very clean, 2 doubles very spacious, front of hotel. Only slightly loud with a departing group in the late evening, otherwise extremely quiet. Great full, expansive buffet with even gluten free options. Front reception staff, knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. Very reasonable priced. Highly recommend for your Dublin stay.",5,2018,07,20
247,OK Hotel,"I had high expectations from a 4* hotel and the welcome was promising. Staff were friendly and offered to store our cases until the room was ready as we arrived just before lunchtime. Local and city maps were available and some suggestions about what to do and where to go. There was a bit of a sell on the Hop on Hop off city tour bus but as we had already bought 3 day passes this wasn’t required. 
When we returned later the room was a bit disappointing. Whilst all facilities were available as expected, the room itself was a little small and dark as it was effectively downstairs. There is some building work going on which started around 8am with the use of a telehandler to lift items up to a higher level. This was noisy and disturbing as the machine had a reverse alarm which was quite a penetrating sound. Also, the view from our window was obstructed by building materials. 
Breakfast was OK, but only that. As is sometimes the case with hotels that serve buffet style breakfast from warming trays, the food was warm rather than hot. We stayed 2 nights but on the second morning we decided to eat breakfast in the city despite it being included in the rate. 
All in all, not what I expected. All this same feedback was left last week along with name, address and email. I’ve not heard anything from the hotel to his point. 
Views from the window are attached. ",3,2018,07,19
247,Concert night,We love this hotel. Despite the building work going on there is still a great welcome here. We were late back from the concert and the only downside was that there was no residents bar. We managed to get a pizza (?reheat) and drinks. Just a small thing but we did pay so much for the room I feel a residents bar would work? Great breakfast.,4,2018,07,19
247,My stay in Dublin,"I highly recommend this hotel. It’s very comfortable, clean, nice bathroom, bed is comfortable and the front desk employees, specially Beatriz and Matthew were extremely helpful, and very friendly.

It’s located in a very nice quite area walking distance to nice restaurants and the stadium. Breakfast was really amazing. A buffet type with everything. Just delicious.

The hotel is elegant and the price is just right.

",5,2018,07,17
247,Good location for a great price!,"The hotel is located a little bit outside of Dublin downtown (about 3 km from Grafton street, one of Dublin's famous shopping areas). The one bed room is very nice with clean sheets and blankets. Breakfast is good, but the same while I was there for 14 days. However, getting to the room is quite a challenge as there are too many rooms with small and mazy walkways. Staffs are friendly and helpful.",4,2018,07,16
247,Amazing breakfast and staff,"Stayed here for a long weekend last December. Staff were very friendly and very helpful, but getting to the room via the mazy corridors was a bit of a mission! The rooms were nice enough but slightly unclean in places - nothing terrible though.

Breakfast was brilliant - hot and high quality food.",4,2018,07,13
247,Fantastic Christening Venue,"We had our little girls christening in Whittys restaurant at the Sandymount Hotel last weekend and couldn't recommend the hotel highly enough for this type of an occasion. The food was amazing and plentiful, the garden area was an ideal play area for the kids and staff were unbelievable. I especially have to mention Luis, Junior and Siobhan who went out of their way to make sure everyone was looked after on the day. We'll definitely be back again for the next family celebration!",5,2018,07,12
247,Excellent out of the way hotel,"This hotel is really pretty nice.  It is a couple of miles from downtown Dublin which gets you away from the city sounds and crowds.  I would suggest getting the taxi app ""My Taxi"".  The UBER app works, but is limited to only taxi's that use UBER.  Individual ride sharing isn't allowed.",4,2018,07,10
247,Great for concert goers,"Stayed at The Sandymount over the weekend of the Billy Joel concert - it was literally a 2 minute walk away so ultra convenient but would be recommended for anyone visiting Dublin as it’s really near the Dart station to get into the City. 

Rooms were clean and comfortable - particularly the Beds. Nice touch to put bottles of water in there along with generous supplies of Tea (or Barry’s as it’s now known!) and Coffee. 

Reception staff could not have been more helpful giving us hints of places to eat Brunch on Sunday. Sandymount Village is a short walk away and you can see the sea! Some nice cafes there. 

Highly recommended. ",5,2018,07,07
247,Never disappoints,"Came here again for new year and my husbands 50th birthday. We were originally here in June last year and we so impressed, we came back. Again a great visit. As you can imagine new year was freezing but the room was so warm we had to open a window. Breakfast was lovely, the staff great and the room very clean. Sandymount is a lovely village, and I will not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2018,07,06
247,First time visit ,"This was my first time staying in this Dublin hotel as that I usually stay in ballsbridge given the fact that when I am looking for someplace here is booked up with rugby fans given proximity to Aviva Stadium 

First thing to note was building works going on it is slightly intrusive but you are warned when making a booking I did not find it yo bad as it is on my on during normal work hours 

Service was excellent from quick check in to the staff in bar etc

Food was also very good a wide selection of dishes from steaks to burgers to pizza, pasta arc  all very reasonably priced for Dublin and that was the same with drinks also

All in all a very enjoyable stay and will hopefully be back ",5,2018,07,06
247,Nice restaurant,"The best part about the hotel was the restaurant - excellent food and drink, and a lovely little balcony. The rest of the hotel is on the high end of average. The layout of the hotel is incredibly confusing and a bit frustrating. But the room was nice, clean, updated. Location isn’t great, but driving around isn’t too terrible at the right times of day.",3,2018,07,04
247,Mr,"This hotel is a jewel in Dublin' s crown, I've stayed there for work over the past 6 months and I can't fault it. The food and service is amazing and all the staff are very friendly, love the place. There's a beautiful walk along the river Dodder into the city and the beach is only a 5 minute walk away. It's a paradise for cyclists as you're on the coast road within minutes. I shall be back.",5,2018,07,04
247,Good choice,"This hotel is very very close to Lansdowne Road, so check if there is a match on before booking.  However, there wasn't one on when we were there, and is situated in a quiet area.  The DART is 5 minutes walk from the station with central Dubin 3 stops away.  The room is furnished to high standards.  When we said that we had to get an early ferry to Holyhead, we were able to get a continental breakfast set up for us before breakfast started to be served.  The ferry was 20 minutes by car from here, making this a good choice for ferry passengers. We would stay here again",5,2018,07,04
247,Fantastic hotel,"I have just returned from a two night stay in the Sandymount Hotel and I could not recommend this hotel enough. The hotel is lovely and clean, breakfast was beautiful and the room that we were allocated was immaculate and completely soundproof. I normally find in hotels that you hear other guests walking up and down the corridor to their rooms, but we didn't hear any noise from either the corridor or the other rooms. The bar is lovely and we were blessed with beautiful weather while we were there so took full advantage of the lovely outdoor seating areas. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to others and look forward to returning in the future.",5,2018,06,30
247,Excellent,"Been going there since it was the Mount Herbert in the 90's - since then it's been transformed from a good, solid budget establishment into a fine hotel, worthy of 4 stars but at closer to 3 star prices by Dublin standards. Free parking, excellent wi-fi, very helpful and friendly staff, good restaurant and bar.",5,2018,06,27
247,Week away wedding anniversary ,"Lovely place, staff really friendly and very helpful.

Just the right amount of distance from Dublin City to relax.

We will be returning, for another visit.

Breakfast was plentiful and bar food was good and value for money. ",5,2018,06,25
247,Friendly welcome,"Lovely hotel. Very convenient to the aviva, 02 and croke Park. Friendly welcoming staff. I would highly recommend this hotel. Very convenient to the Dart system. I drove to Dublin and found it very easy to locate.",5,2018,06,24
247,"Brilliant Location, lovely hotel","Stayed here because of it's proximity to the Aviva Stadium for the Billy Joel concert. Lovely reception staff - in fact everybody we met (with the exception of a stressed out bar man after the concert - but that's probably understandable) was really nice and attentive. Rooms weren't huge, but were spotless and very well appointed. We were on the ground floor, well away from the bar and outside seating area so I didn't hear any noise at all at night. Outside bar and BBQ was the perfect option on the way to the gig, and we went down here for a couple of hours before setting off for the Aviva. Breakfast lovely and plenty of it. Overall a terrific spot - ideal if you're heading for the Aviva, but still smashing if you want a nice hotel in a quieter part of Dublin. It is a little out of the way from the city centre , but we spotted a Dart rail station up around the corner from it. One very odd thing was we had family drop in for a drink after the gig and the reception wouldn't ring a taxi for them nor give them a number of a local taxi. I thought this was a little odd - the excuse was something about being in a residential area. I didn't think this made much sense - but, not enough to take any rating off of the Hotel itself - it's a little gem.",5,2018,06,24
247,Ideal for Aviva stadium. ,"We chose this hotel as we’d tickets for Billy Joel at the Aviva. Having booked months in advance, we were therefore a wee bit disappointed to be allocated a basement room with a view of the car park. There are much nicer rooms than this. That said, we hardly spent any time in our room, so it wasn’t a deal breaker. The bathroom was small, but functional and spotless, with a decent over bath shower. Breakfast was super, buffet style, but very fresh and everything was topped up regularly. Excellent value too, and loved the fresh flowers on every table. The hotel has some beautiful gardens and outdoor areas, and we had burgers from the BBQ on the Saturday afternoon before the concert, these were superb. We were again a bit disappointed when we came back to the hotel on the afternoon of the concert to find that all the bars had been converted to ‘cash only’ with drinks being served in plastic glasses. Understand that the hotel has to take advantage of its location to sell drinks to the concert audience, but felt that that took precedence over their residents. Again, when we returned to the hotel after the concert, the place was heaving, and we just headed to bed rather than having another drink. Overall, a pleasant stay and perfect location for our needs. ",4,2018,06,24
247,Find a better option...,"Although there was nothing inherently wrong with the physical property (no air conditioning, so wouldn't want to stay in July/August, I imagine), the customer service was mediocre at best. There were three of us in the room and only 2 towels provided so I called for extras. Waited 1 1/2 hours and decided they were never coming. Called the front desk to ask if there might be AC that I missed (primarily to cover the doors slamming in the hallways) and was offered a fan which I initially declined. Called back about 45 minutes later as we decided the fan might help with the noise and talked with a man at the desk who couldn't have been less interested in helping. Told me he 'didn't know if he's have time to deliver a fan'. When I expressed my concern over the no-towel situation and overall apathy, suddenly towels and fans appeared, along with more bath products. 
While I appreciate the effort, as a frequent traveler, I get tired of having to push the issue with businesses who are charging a great deal of money for basically a bed and a bathroom. We also had a less than enthusiastic check-in experience. Wouldn't recommend this facility to others.",2,2018,06,23
247,Shame about the builders,"The hotel was undergoing extensive building work during our visit (June 2018). We had a room at the rear of the hotel, where the building work is underway. Noisy at 0700hrs with diggers and other equipment. So could not open widows, also usual dirt associated with same. We looked out onto a building site and across to the block being worked on. If you choose to stay then get a room at the front. I doubt the work will be complete very soon. Apart from that it was okay.  Staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was good with the usual selection. We could walk into Dublin Centre in about 30 minutes.  There is a hop on hop off City tour  bus which calls at the hotel at around 0930hrs and tickets are available at reception.  We did not bother as they are quite expensive and we were happy to walk. Lansdowne road ground is only ten minutes walk away. Also the DART railway station is the same and allows you to catch a train the Dublin if you wish.",4,2018,06,20
247,Business travel to Dublin,"I have been using the Sandymount Hotel over the last few years on a regular basis. The hotel is situated in a great area with good access to anywhere in Dublin. The hotel itself is really well maintained with upgrades happening to rooms and public areas regularly ensuring it is always a pleasant place to arrive at. The bar and Restaurant are very good and the staff, particularly reception, could not be nicer and always offer a friendly welcoming greeting.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin on business or pleasure",5,2018,06,19
247,Nice hotel!,We stayed at this hotel 3 nights on our recent trip to Ireland. The rooms were clean and the food was good. The staff was very accommodating. Several options for transportation into the city. Beautiful walking trail nearby. I would stay there again.,4,2018,06,19
247,Fantastic Stay,"I’ve stayed at The Sandymount on many occasions and always had a wonderful stay. If you’re looking for a ‘home away from home’ this the ideal place. It’s situated close to the leafy village of Sandymount and the upmarket Ballsbridge. Lansdowne Road DART Station is just a few minutes walk away (located next to the impressive Aviva Stadium) so the centre of Dublin can be reached quickly.

The staff on reception are always helpful and friendly. A special mention (and thanks) must go to Beatrice who always goes the extra mile to welcome guests and make them feel at home.

Rooms are impeccable, the bar has a great array of ales, and the choice and quality of food at breakfast is delicious.  A fantastic, boutique, family-run hotel.
",5,2018,06,18
247,Only a stop over,"Only stopped over for one night as passing through. Tried to walk into some key areas for food (breakfast), and very little to speak of. Ended up eating at hotel. Which was ok.

Had a 4 month old with us. The room we had was by a lift and on the ground floor. Very very noisy. No air conditioning either, so felt like a sauna. 

Yeah just wasn’t very impressed for a 4 star hotel.

",3,2018,06,17
247,3 Arena ,"Stayed here for one night. We were going to a concert in the 3 Arena. The location for the arena is ok we got a taxi up which dropped us at the bridge opposite the arena for €10 but I think that was just luck with the taxi driver we got but coming home there was no taxi to be got so we walked half way back to the hotel using Google map then got a taxi who charged us more. So as a hotel for the 3 arena I wouldn't be booking it again as I don't think it's in ""walking distance"" as described.
My only downfall with the actual hotel is the lack of parking and the hotel bar. The bar was unfriendly and there was no residence bar so as we were late arriving back after the concert our stay at the bar was short. ",3,2018,06,14
247,Good Business/Tourist Hotel,"The hotel is well placed in a nice area of the city close to the RDS and Aviva stadium and very close to Sandymount Village which has a number of restaurants and pubs. The hotel is also very near to Landsdowne Road DART station which makes travel easy into the City and further out into the countryside. Parking was also good at the hotel.

My wife and I stayed here for four nights with 3 other couples all booked in executive king rooms. The rooms were a good size with a reasonable ensuite and had been recently upgraded. However, it was disappointing that the room was nothing like as high class as the photos shown on the hotel website, the upgrade being very dull and fairly basic. That said the hotel did offer us a discount which we accepted and with this we were happy with the rooms.

Breakfast in the hotel was excellent. It was a buffet with a very good range of hot and cold dishes and staff during breakfast were excellent in attending to all needs.

The bar in the hotel was the only disappointment for me being a rather noisy sports bar. While this served food, in my view the hotel would be better served by a different type of bar or restaurant where clients could enjoy a nicer and more relaxed drink or meal.",4,2018,06,12
247,Waitress Beata is a darling.,"I visited the hotel with a friend for a dinner in the bar. We wanted to sit in the sun in the garden where they did not serve food. Waitress Beata has kindly served us there, nevertheless, and did everything, to have made our evening a really enjoyable one. And the food was good, too. We are looking forward to coming back again.

Janko Dolinsek, Dublin",5,2018,06,10
247,Nice Hotel,"The Sandymount Hotel is in a nice quiet Dublin Suburban Neighborhood. The check-in process was rather easy. The front desk attendants gave directions to a couple of eateries, which were a 10 minute walk away. Most stores were already closed as we arrived after 6:00. 

The hotel offers buffet breakfast, which is cheaper if you pay in advance. 

The only issue found, was that the room we were placed in initially was not one listed on the website, very stuffy & small. There was construction occurring, so our window which didn’t open was covered in construction debris, with a view of scaffolding. 

However, once we explained to the front desk staff that we booked the room, based on website images, they quickly offered a tour of 2 other rooms, which were much more comfortable. 

The room was clean, neat, and cool being on the ground floor, which was perfect as many hotels do not have central air in Ireland. 

One thing I really liked, was that despite our do not disturb sign on the door handle, the cleaning staff, left fresh bath linen & accessories outside or door. 

The hotel staff arranged for day tour attractions as well. 

There’s a train station about a 10 minute walk away, that does directly into downtown Dublin. 

Overall I’d highly recommend this hotel. ",4,2018,06,08
247,Fantastic city break,"Just spent a fabulous 3 days at the sandymount .hotel is only a couple of minutes from city centre , right next to landsdowne road stadium and the dart station.room was beautiful , all ammenities you would expect with a very comfortable  bed.the breakfast was amazing and we also ate at the bar one night and had a few drinks before venturing into Dublin city centre and the food was great and bar prices no dearer than in the city.We like to support the hotel we are staying in and the staff made it a pleasant stay.girls on reception were very helpful when we needed advice and all in all it was a great stay.looking forward to going back very soon.",5,2018,06,07
247,Review,Stayed sandymount hotel last night. Staff so friendly and welcoming. Room very clean and new bathroom. Bed very comfortable. I had a hospital appointment and the receptionist offered to have the courtesy bus bring us to the hospital. We had a great stay and the hotel is just round the corner from the dart station. So I hope to stay in the hotel soon again.,4,2018,06,07
247,Nice Location for Sports Event,"This is a nice, older hotel  It is very clean and the staff are very nice and friendly.  They will explain directions to you if you need them.  There is an elevator if needed.  The hotel is extremely close to a sports stadium if your attending an event there. The rooms are a little small, but there was a double bed plus a single for a child or two friends traveling together.  Shampoos and soaps in the small bathroom for your convince.  That also serve breakfast at an additional cost, but we did not try the breakfast.",4,2018,06,04
247,Warm and Friendly,"This was a very nice location to start our trip through southern Ireland. The staff is friendly and helpful, willing to answer all sorts of questions.  Our ""twin"" room had a queen sized bed and a twin.  Wifi was free, easy to access, and sustainable. (In many hotels, you can get on, but then have to deal with the continuous spooling. Not here.)  

Breakfast was included, and it turned out to be very nicely done.  This hotel is close to the main stadium, which means it's also close to pubs and restaurants.  I would definitely return to Sandymount!",5,2018,06,04
247,nice hotel,This hotel was a nice hotel very clean with comfortable beds and friendly and very helpful staff. The breakfast was also good. They have courtesy vans outside the hotel but do not pick up or take you to the airport which is a $40. taxi ride. They said we could use the train but with luggage you could not do the walk to the train.  So we had to get a cab to and from the airport.  The hotel is also 30/35 min. to Dublin not close to anything  and we walked a 15 min. walk to the little village of Sandymount.  it was a cute place and we had dinner at Pete's pub. at the suggestion of the recepction desk and they were right it was good. but a walk from the hotel..  We did use the Hop on Hop off bus and it picks you up there but doesn't drop you off there so we had to take the train and walk back 10 min. to the hotel. If you have any trouble with walking this is not the hotel for you. ,4,2018,06,04
247,Saty at sandymount Hotel,OUTSTANDING!!! Our stay at the Sandymount Hotel was wonderful.  The accommodations were first rate and the price was well within our budget.  The staff went out of their way to make our stat as pleasant as possible.  Sonja and the front desk staff were great.  They helps with directions and booking of tours and any need that we expressed.  I highly recommend the Hotel.,5,2018,05,31
247,thank you,"Feels like a home although exceptional hotel - thank you Beatrice and Gretta. I will be staying again when travelling to Dublin for work 

Reception staff not only helpful to me but I could see very helpful to all guests here for work and tourists

Thank you",5,2018,05,30
247,Well located,"Stayed here in early May for a group meal and a meeting the next morning.  Have not stayed here for a year or two and significant renovation work has been undertaken in that time.  
Checkin was efficient,  polite and quick - I hate slow check ins and impolite staff. 
Room was clean and recently decorated as was the bathroom ( a tad small). The meal that night was nice and probably as good as any small restaurant in the Ballsbridge area. Breakfast is a great affair with loads of choice and extremely unhurried. The meeting room was bright, airy and functional with plenty of privacy.  Checkout process was again simple and polite with the offer of arranging a taxi.",4,2018,05,28
247,Stayed during our trip to Dublin ,We stayed at Sandymount during our recent Holiday in Ireland. Despite it being an older Hotel it is well maintained. Our room had all the necessities. The hotel is in a great area. The bar tender was great and helpfull the morning wait staff at breakfast were spot on. Well done. ,4,2018,05,26
247,Nice quiet hotel,"The hotel was tiny but well organized . Corridor was tight so that only one person dragging her luggage can pass at any time . 
Everything worked well from checking in to checking out . Room was tiny but functional.bed was comfortable and the sheets clean and smelled nice . 
They even gave us a socket  adopter because I left mine at home . 
Breakfast was good . Choices were tasty .
The location of the hotel was in a quiet clean district .",3,2018,05,25
247,Good location for exploring Dublin,"The staff are very friendly and attentive and the hotel itself is nice.  Breakfast was excellent. Our only complaint was that given it's relatively remote location from the city centre we expected a quiet stay.  Unfortunately, our room overlooked the back service area and beyond that the garden attached to the bar so we had noise from early morning staff arriving for work breakfast preparation and late night singing from the bar guests that were outside smoking.  It probably is just fine when the weather is cold and windows are closed, but given the warmer weather and lack of air circulation in the room we had windows open.  Our view may have been less than many because we paid almost 600 EUR for two nights which was definitely NOT a value for this property.",4,2018,05,25
247,Excellent Hotel,Stayed here for two nights on a go away tour. Very nice hotel and staff seemed to look for things they could help you do or find. Excellent place and staff. Friendly and cozy bar/lounge area with great service.,5,2018,05,23
247,Great area in Dublin,"Nice hotel in a lovely section of Dublin. Room was quiet and comfortable, staff was friendly and helpful. Within walking distance of Aviva stadium, close bus and tram service for city center. Restaurants, pubs, grocery store all within walking distance as well.",5,2018,05,19
247,Absolutely unbelievable ,"I don’t know where to start really. Probably the luckiest finds I’ve ever had the privilege of discovering.

Had 2 nights here as I was attending an exhibition at the Royal Dublin Society. I wanted something close by, and nowhere near the hustle and bustle of downtown Dublin.

It’s a beautiful old building on a quiet residential street, absolutely steeped with character. Everything about this place is taste, class and individuality. 

The rooms are of a good size and either look out over the well tended gardens or the front of the house. 

There is a drawing room where tea is served whilst you enjoy the artwork adorning the walls. The smell of fresh orchids adds to the charm.

There is a dining room that serves the most agreeable, full Irish breakfast and the staff, be it the owner who cannot do enough for you or the house keepers or receptionists are of the highest caliber

There is no provision for evening meals, but the beautiful village of Sandymount with its pubs, upmarket restaurants and green is a 15 Minute walk away.

Absolutely top notch. Thank you John and your team. I cannot wait to return",5,2018,05,16
247,Fantastic hotel and lovely staff,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights over the May Day bank holiday.
On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by Beatrice, and she was great. Check in was quick, and we were not only given information about the hotel but how to get into the centre of Dublin, and details about the hop on hop off bus, that departs from the hotel in the mornings. ( if we didn't want to catch it at the specified time from the hotel, we were told that there was a possibility of a lift to the nearest stop)
We were given a room upgrade, because it was my husbands birthday, so that was a lovely touch!
The room was well decorated and spacious, we found the bed comfy, as both nights we slept well. 
The hotel offers free wifi, and we had no problem accessing this in our room.
Breakfast, was a hot and cold buffet breakfast, and this was more than adequate. Lots of choice, everything from cereal, to bacon, eggs and toast.
Getting into to Dublin, is quite a walk, 20 minutes plus. There is a dart station within 2/3 mins walk, and this is a couple of stops away from Dublin centre.
If you want a more relaxed and less hectic atmosphere, then the village of Sandymount, is a short walking distance away. Here there are a couple of pubs, and a few choices of places to eat. All the places we visited in Sandymount village were friendly and welcoming, the food was great everywhere, but I must mention that Pete's was exceptionally good.
We would not hesitate to return to the Sandymount hotel, it is close enough to the centre of Dublin, but also a place to relax away from the hustle and bustle.",5,2018,05,16
247,Lovely Stay,"Stayed for 1 night when up to see a concert in the 3Arena. Lovely hotel, reasonably priced and in an excellent location, close to the concert and only a 10 minute taxi to the city centre. Nice bar and food was tasty also. Would definitely stay again.",4,2018,05,12
247,Wonderful stay once again!,"Once again i went back to my beloved Sandymount Hotel in Dublin Ireland. And as usual it’s really “home away from home” as it is described so rightly!! Can’t thank enough the incredible staff: Ann, Beatrice, Belem, Sanja, Olga, Iamina, Valentina, Tanya and so on. May all the staff whose name is not mentioned forgive me, they are all so wonderful I should publish the whole organigramme!!! They all of them made me feel totally privileged.
And it would take too much time to praise the niceness and confort of my room, the incredible food cooked by the chefs. What to say more ? Oh yes: Will come back soon.
So many thanks to all of you.

247,Another perfect stay.,We stayed for two nights recently and once again it was a most enjoyable stay. From the moment we arrived we were warmly greeted by Beatrice and Rose who went above and beyond to make sure we had a very comfortable stay. The staff are warm and welcoming including Valentina whom we met on reception.The newly refurbished rooms are tastefully decorated and a good nights sleep is assured in this well run quiet hotel. We look forward to returning soon.,5,2018,05,11

247,Great hotel near to Sandymount and downton Dublin,"Family run interconnected houses.  Just about 3 blocks from tube from downtown dublin.  Very clean, very friendly.  An umbrella was offered to us for the day one raining day.  Cab fare from airport was about 25 euros-we had the driver fo through the tunnel-shorter but there is a toll which was included in the fare.  Catch bus or cab across the street from the place where cabs left off passengers. Nice stroll from hotel to the Sandymount town and beach,  We got best available direct rate of 116 euros and discount breafast for 11.95 euros each.  VAT is 9%.  We stayed 2 nights, 2 breakfasts and with VAT bill was $234.90",5,2018,05,09
247,"Nice, quiet neighborhood.",We stayed here for two nights on a group bus trip.  The staff members had everything ready and were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay.  The hotel is near a big stadium.  A couple of bistros are within walking distance.  There is a DART station nearby that will take you downtown.  You can grab a taxi to & from the airport.  There is a bar and restaurant---both are very good.  We had special service from Luis and Ernesto.  There are laptops near the lobby where you can get your e-mail and access the internet.  A very nice hotel.,5,2018,05,04
247,"Great Hotel, Great Location","We have been staying in the Sandymount Hotel for a couple of years now and it never disappoints! It is in a brilliant location, right beside the Aviva Stadium and only around the corner from Ballsbridge! We just love it here, the rooms are great and the beds very comfy! The staff are all lovely and we love the bar and the bar food is excellent. Breakfast is fabulous! They have a great car park so you can just leave the car and are within walking distance of the city centre or right beside the DART station if needed. We would highly recommend this hotel and we will be back again very soon! It is an ideal place to stay in Dublin. Thank you to all the staff - we look forward to every visit back to the hotel!!",5,2018,05,04
247,Good stay for Shows,"Good Hotel, Close to RDS, restaurant a bit small for amount of people staying. Sunday wAs packed and nothing close to go. Would stay again but prefer Herbert’s Hotel as it’s close to good few restaurants. Again depends on the visit, as Beauty show is hard work all you need good food and good bed. All was perfect. ",5,2018,05,04
247,Clean and friendly hotel near the beach BUT,"... unannounced very noisy construction work starting at 8.00. For us this is a fact that would have affected our choice of hotel - so we were pretty dissapointed that the hotel did not tell about it in advance. Makes you feel they are not open and truthfull. Therefore cannot really recommend the hotel especially if thinking about taking early bird offers and paying in advance. Also the free wifi connection is cut off all the time. 
Nice neighbourhood - the Sandymount village was lovely - but at 10 minutes walk. DART connection - but you have to walk quite a bit both ends combined to get to the centre when using it. I would not stay here again for the price we payed.",3,2018,04,30
247,Trip advisor recommendation that went well,"The staff was very helpful. Clean and quiet rooms. Ours had two twins and a full bed. I saw a one bed room in passing and it was pretty small. That may be standard European sizing. 

On site restaurant had a great breakfast. Complimentary bottled water. 

The only down side for us was that it wasn’t close to what we wanted to do (15-20 min taxi ride). For a never been here before choice, this was a good one. ",4,2018,04,29
247,My favourite place to stay in Dublin,"I’m a regular business traveler to Dublin and have tried many hotels in the area, but Sandymount Hotel is definitely my favourite! Recently renovated, quite rooms, comfortable beds & good food. It’s the friendly staff though that really make it stand out. The old saying that “The Customer Is Always Right “ is still followed here.  Thanks Beatrice & Iamina for all the friendly service !",5,2018,04,24
247,Surely would come back! Lovely! Stunning!,"The room was very comfortable, wide, excellent bed, good TV, bath tub, staff was amazing, food was fantastic! There's nothing I would change in that hotel! One of the best I've ever been to! Felt like home.",5,2018,04,24
247,Perfect little stay,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 1 night for his birthday as a little celebration. 
On arrival we found a parking space very easily and were very impressed with the view of the Aviva stadium at the bottom of the road!
The staff were continually lovely during our stay and were very helpful when I asked for directions and what public transport to get.
The hotel itself was very very clean, the room was rather spacious & we actually got a room with a double bed and single bed.
Beds were very comfortable & had a great nights sleep with no noise disturbances which I thought was fantastic as I've had problems with that recently in hotels.
We had breakfast the next morning which was great and very worth the money. Staff at breakfast were also very pleasant and helpful. 
To conclude, it was a fantastic night stay & would happily stay again for a longer time :)",5,2018,04,23
247,Fabulous stay at Sandymount hotel,"Stayed at the Sandymount last Thursday and Friday with a friend from Canada and it was delightful. So easy to access from the dart at Lansdowne and then a short walk along the Dodder which was beautiful to this stylish, boutique feel hotel. The foyer and seating areas are modern and elegant with beautiful decor and the room was airy, modern and so comfortable and so clean. Every amenity available and freshly stocked with coffee, water etc. Ate and drank at the hotel on one evening and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. The hotel staff were so friendly and the customer service was superb. A big thank you to Beatrice who just couldn't have been nicer or more helpful and even suggested that we dine one evening in Sandymount village as we were looking for something local and she gave us fabulous suggestions and directions. Nothing was too much trouble. Amazing staff and I shall definitely be back this year as I plan to visit Dublin with my mother. I shall be remommending to everyone I know to stay as I am from the North and it's so accessible to the dart and two stops to Pearse st as well as leafy Ballsbridge and pretty Sandymount village.  One thing that could be improved is quality of shampoo etc in room but its minor and staff in bar can be a little slow to serve etc but then it was a very busy hotel that few days we stayed. Small gripes but overall standard high and wonderful stay",5,2018,04,23
247,A really welcoming hotel,"I stayed in the Sandymount Hotel from 13-15 April with a group of friends. All the staff met throughout the hotel, we found very welcoming and friendly. The rooms are small but really clean. This weekend was not a rugby weekend so the hotel was quiet and very easy to park our car. The receptionists couldn’t do enough for us, the bar staff were lovely very friendly and a lovely banter. We had walks on the beach a short walk away and the village of Sandymount is a little gem with lovely restaurants etc. In the past my husband and I have stayed here for rugby matches and the hotel is always busy with a great atmosphere. ",5,2018,04,23
247,Hotel stay on 18 and 19 April,Seven of us stayed in Sandymount Dublin from start to finish a truly enjoyable experience staff so helpful friendly we had evening meals in restaurant excellent quality and value. Staff remembered us from.one evening to the next. Breakfast excellent choices Very central location near Dart and Aviva. We had lovely walks on the beach. Rooms bathrooms very clean tea making facilities. We will be back to stay in Sandymount again.,5,2018,04,22
247,Location is fantastic,"I was back in Dublin for a week and selected this hotel for location.  It could not have been better: it is walking distance to the city if you're so inclined, but also a short stroll to the DART which is my preferred means of transport in Dublin.  I really enjoyed my stay.  The room was lovely and light, and a fantastic bathroom but the bed could have been a little longer.  I'm 178 cm which is tall, but not that tall!  I  have to say I found the chairs in the bar simply weren't that comfortable  - surprising in a hotel of this size.  I also recommend you don't take the scrambled eggs at breakfast, dreadful.  Perhaps I'd just been lucky with the quality at my previous stay but these tasted like powdered egg to me.  Oh, and I got caught twice when cabs were ordered that would only take cash.  Hopelessly inconvenient - make sure reception request a cab that will take credit card if you need to pay by credit card.",4,2018,04,22
247,Perfect location,"Had a great stay while in Dublin! Short walk to the train station and then short ride into town. We also explored the surrounding neighborhood,  great plafes to eat, nice qiuet location.

I would recommend for any type of travel.",4,2018,04,18
247,Amazing hotel!,"I recently stayed at Sandymount for a trip to Dublin with my 2 friends!
The receptionists were SO friendly, offered lots of local advice on arrival and even managed to find us a room to get us checked in early! The city sightseeing bus stops at the hotel at 9:30am to give you a lift into the centre if you don't fancy the walk!
Room was beautiful, clean and spacious!
Definitely recommend :)",5,2018,04,15
247,Nice hotel but too much noise transfers into the room,"Booked here a mid week stay with the other half. The location is nice and safe. It is right beside the Aviva stadium. The hotel offers a free shuttle to areas in Dublin which is a great service. I found the double bed very uncomfortable for 2 people. I could hear people in the rooms around me and in the morning I could here everybody that walked up and down the corridor, which was brutal for me. Noise seemed to transfer easily into the room. Room was clean and staff where friendly. On another note, outside my window on a ledge was littered with a lot of cigarette butts which was disgusting.",3,2018,04,10
247,Construction Zone,"Just wrapped up a 3 night stay at the Sandymount on our trip to Dublin and had to tolerate ongoing work from 7 am to 7 pm very day. Called the front desk the first morning when we were awoke to the sound of scaffolding, laborers, and heavy diesel machinery and was told a “manager would take care of it” and never heard back from the hotel team. My wife and I were in town to see Dublin for the first time and upgraded our hotel specifically to stay at Sandymount based on the wonderful reviews we had read before booking. Unfortunately, the lack of warning of the ongoing refresh and lack of response from the front desk team sullied our opinion of this property. We were in a room on the first floor literally within feet of the workers (interior and exterior work is being performed) current projects so every morning they could be overheard. They also propped the door open so the hallway for the first floor was the same temperature as the outside temperature. 
Thankfully we get up early to get out and see the sites but if you are seeking tranquility and the ability to sleep in after a night out pub crawling, this is not your place. Perhaps if you are there on business this would be no problem as the room was decent and the location is not bad for getting in and out of the city center. I didn’t take more pics of the construction because I anticipated a response from the Sandymount management team, alas the one photo is the hallway in which our room was located. The plastic runner is from the construction team. I am not seeking compensation from this hotel, but only want to warn any travelers contemplating a stay here in the next few months.",2,2018,04,08
247,Great place to book!,"Got in early to Dublin and the hotel made sure we were checked in early and were very friendly!! There is nothing like flying all night to a new place and having a clean room and a friendly face greeting you!! It meant alot!
The room was clean and supplied with everything a weary traveler would require👍
Was a little shocked when I grabbed a towel from the rack and realized it was warm from the towel warmer👍
Highly recommend staying if you ever get the chance if you find yourself Dublin Ireland!
Thank you Sandymount hotel!",5,2018,04,07
247,Wonderful Hotel,"Rooms are spacious and quiet , staff is efficient and friendly, if you asked for an early cab it was waiting for you at the correct time.  The hidden gem is the restaurant located in the hotel.  Best food of my entire trip!  Located near Ballsbridge , former home off Marianne Faithfull !",5,2018,04,05
247,Nice Location,Excellent location for Aviva Stadium. Excellent all round esp the nice housekeeping manager who quickly fixed my electronic door. Good value breakfast but does go quickly if you are late riser. Will defo use again. ,5,2018,04,04
247,Daren,"Excellent location for visit to Aviva Stadium, great atmosphere on Match day with Hotel marquee set up as a bar. Some rooms are a long walk from reception. Staff very helpful and friendly. Rooms recently refurbished to a good standard.",3,2018,04,04
247,Go When No Construction,"I was there on a weekday, and perhaps no construction on a week-end but itt started before 8am and finished around 6pm. Granted, most people would be out of the room during the day and it was not annoying in the public areas but God help anyone in a back room who wanted to rest during the day!! ii was told it would be one for another 6 weeks.",4,2018,04,03
247,Helpful Crew and fine rooms,"I made a special request to the crew: not to tell my sister why there was 3 beds in our room, she didn't know our younger sister was travelling with me to see her. They were great and the surprise was really really great! The room was big and confortable, only the view was not so great, but it didn't matter for us. For sure I will look for Sandymount hotel for accomodation in Dublin the next time I visit.",4,2018,04,03
247,Perfect location to explore Dublin,"This hotel is right beside the Aviva stadium with close access to the dart to take you to the centre of Dublin. 
The recent renovations are beautifully done and our hotel room was fresh, clean and spacious. 
The staff were really helpful and made sure we have travel arrangements in place for our stay. 
We will definitely be back to stay in this hotel. 
The only downside was the relatively small breakfast choice the next morning.",5,2018,04,03
247,Great nights sleep,"Family of 5 on a trip to Aviva and an overnight treat, I was not expecting such a great nights sleep, noiseless environment, great bed, powerful shower, smashing breakfast, and good value, what more could you ask for.",5,2018,04,03
247,My stay in Sandymount Hotel,"Lovely hotel, location is perfect.   The staff were very helpful and friendly service brilliant and the food delicious.  I could only stay one night but hope to return soon for a longer visit. This hotel is located next to Aviva Stadium. ",5,2018,04,03
247,Fantastic Room,"Great location, close to the lovely Sandyford village and of course the Aviva Stadium. The hotel is deceptively large but room are a good size and quiet. Great buffet breakfast. Staff are lovely helpful and friendly ",5,2018,04,02
247,"Dealt with hundreds of thirsty, hungry rugby fans without breaking a sweat","We descended, by arrangement, here on Easter Sunday. We were welcomed and catered for brilliantly even to the extent of providing safe keeping for our bags due to the security department at the Aviva Stadium refusing to allow bags inside.

Great BBQ with gigantic burgers.",4,2018,04,02
247,"Ok hotel, not the best location","Clean room (view from window not that exciting). If you are staying in Dublin for more than one day I would stay in a hotel with a more central location. Dart station is a couple of minutes walk away.
Didn’t try the restaurant.",3,2018,04,02
247,Imelda moloney,"I stayed in the Sandymount Hotel, in Dublin recently with friends and family . We have stayed several times, keep coming back . The rooms are lovely , comfortable, the foods is lovely . The staff are helpful and friendly, especially Beatrice in reception , she is so welcoming, made us feel at home . ",5,2018,04,02
247,Great hotel! ,"Hotel looks really nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was also of great value. The room was good and the bed was comfortable. The only thing was that the shower was in the bathtub and Not separate and the showerhead could use A good decalcify cleaning rub. ",4,2018,04,02
247,"Comfortable, friendly hotel","We stayed at this hotel for five nights on a city break. A taxi costs about €30 from the airport.  I was so pleased we picked it because the location was perfect for us.  It's easy to get into Dublin centre either by walking or the very quick and efficient Dart railway.  Two stops from Landsdowne road and you're near the National Gallery etc.  We took the Dart to Howth a small fishing town, it took about 30 mins and was worth a look round.  You can also walk along the esplanade at Sandymount, there's a long sandy beach there.
We were given a spacious room in a quiet part of the hotel, as requested, so we slept well.  It was comfortable and clean with everything we needed.  They did supply bottled water as well as tea, coffee etc.
There was a good choice at breakfast which was a hot and cold buffet.  We ate one meal here in the evening and the food was good and reasonably priced.
The staff were friendly, efficient and helpful.
There are lots of pubs and restaurants nearby in Ballsbridge and Sandymount which are in easy walking distance from the hotel.  The quality of the food was excellent everywhere we went including the pubs.  Guiness tastes much better in Dublin than it does anywhere else!
I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone who is coming to Dublin, it offers a good mix being set in a quiet residential area close to the sea but within easy reach of Dublin city centre.",4,2018,04,01
247,Lovely stay,Excellent hospitality in all aspects of the hotel.  Staff allow you to feel welcome  and accommodated.  I arrived early before booking in time. The staff were prepared to give me a room there and then . I felt that my custome was appreciated. ,4,2018,03,31
247,Comfort & Welcoming Staff,Great nights sleep in a comfortable bed. Staff very friendly and helpful. Location was perfect. Room was small but cosy. Had food in the bar on 2 nights. Pricey but in line with Dublin food & beverage prices,5,2018,03,31
247,A Great Place to Stay,"I discovered this hotel only recently and I always stay here when I go to Dublin.  It is walking distance to the city centre, has good parking and is a top class hotel for comfort and good food.  The staff are very friendly, very efficient and nothing is too much trouble.  Would thoroughly recommend it.",5,2018,03,29
247,Dublin overnight,"An excellent hotel, with very friendly and helpful service, great location and good, recently refurbished rooms, and reasonably good value too.  The lady at reception, Beatrice, was particularly considerate.",5,2018,03,28
247,Poor room,Myself and my partner stayed at sandymount for two nights and was disappointed overall as this does not feel at all like a four star hotel! Our first room has no working taps the staff did not apologise once and just simply moved us to the room next door. I did not feel that the executive room was what it said it was and I feel that I could've got a better deal somewhere else.,2,2018,03,25
247,Clean Modern Rooms in a great location for the city,Nice hotel with modern clean rooms. Hotel has free parking and is located next to a dart station. Price was great for the room considering how close the hotel is to the Aviva and the city. Would happily stay there again.,5,2018,03,25
247,Perfect rugby weekend,"Booked two rooms for me and my husband, and my parents for the weekend of the Ireland v Scotland Rugby Six Nations match. Asked if they could be near each other - they were next door! Communal areas and rooms were very clean and decorated to a good standard. Breakfast was varied and plentiful. We ate Saturday dinner in the hotel restaurant which was delicious. Hotel, restaurant and bar staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. Brilliant location for Aviva stadium and real rugby club feel on match day. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,03,25
247,good value,Very good value in a very expensive market place.Bathroom very small .  Beds were comfortable. WiFi weak in the rooms.  Evening meal and breakfast were both good. Handy location and free car parking a bonus.,4,2018,03,25
247,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel in a quiet and characteristic neighbourhood. Kind and professional staff. Good breakfast overall but there are also other choices around for an Irish breakfast. DART is 5 minutes away, 2-3 stops from city centre.",5,2018,03,20
247,Ireland Tour,"We stayed at this hotel for one night with a tour group.  The room was spacious and clean.  The rooms were very well insulated as we didn't hear anything in the hallway, doors closing, people talking.  It is a beautiful building and full of history.  The breakfast had a lot of items on it and it all was delicious.  You are seated at tables with silverware and china, sugar bowls and cream pitchers.  This hotel feels like it is a 5-star hotel!",5,2018,03,19
247,Decent hotel good staff,"The executive room was not executive in my view, it also several things wrong that I pointed out to reception, they were very helpful on reception but the rest of the staff being mainly foreign had trouble understanding my requirements, don't think it was value for the price,ive stayed in better",3,2018,03,19
247,Great location!! ,"We stayed here because we were at 3 arena for a concert. 
The staff were really helpful and friendly and even arranged their shuttle bus to take us to the arena... which was brilliant. You could walk back but we got a taxi which was only €8. 
The dart is only up the road which we got to the city, only a few stops... really handy and easy. 
The breakfast was tasty. 
All and all a really lovely stay!!! ",5,2018,03,18
247,Old hotel friendly staff,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 days for $455 including breakfast.
Hotel rooms are old, elevator doesn't get to all rooms and sometimes you need to go up stairs with your suitcase.
Room was clean but bad smell didn't leave the room for the entire stay.
Breakfast was good, no fresh vegetables, but still wide selection even for vegetarians like me.
Kitchen closed early evening, so after 9 pm you will have to go out to look for food or order from outside.
Location could be a problem due to traffic in the morning and evening.
Fitness room extremely small.
Only reason I rated 3 and not 2 is because the staff was so nice and helpful. ",3,2018,03,17
247,Brilliant.,"I would highly recommend this hotel, the staff are great & helpful. I stayed here with my daughter, but did not notice that i left my radio behind, i rand the hotel and a  big Thank You to Rose in housekeeping i got my radio in the post. The staff are very honest  i cant rate this hotel enough so i will book in to The Sandymount again the next time i visit Dublin. The hotel has very clean & breakfast is all you can eat. Beautiful Hotel well worth staying here.",5,2018,03,16
247,Excellent Hotel,Excellent service. All staff extremely helpful and pleasant. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Had afternoon tea with prosecco and this was served in beautiful surroundings and to an excellent standard ,5,2018,03,14
247,Rugby trip,"Friendly, warm family run hotel centrally located to explore Dublin.Notable for helpfulness and friendliness of all staff. Very close to the rugby stadium, convenient for pre and post match celebrations ('tho we lost!)",5,2018,03,14
247,Ideal location,Arrived early to get one of the 100 parking spaces for rugby match didn't  book  in till after match room was spacious double  twin with  breakfast included.price for 1 night was expensive at 296euro but it was only 3 mins walk to stadium so probably  worth it for the match.overall I would recommend hotel to friends. ,4,2018,03,13
247,excellent staff,"Everything is excellent, excellent staff, good location, delicious breakfast. The rooms look smaller than in the photo. Works pizza service, at any time of the day, good parking, very polite staff. With pleasure I recommend to others customer",4,2018,03,13
247,Great location and value,Sandymount has been our port of call for our bi-annual rugby weekend and has steadily improved over the years. With a party of 14 it must be unusual to have all of them say how much they enjoyed it. Good stuff.,5,2018,03,13
247,Overnight stay,We were at an event in UCD and needed somewhere to stay in the area. This hotel was perfect with a nice friendly vibe. The bar food was very nice and the service was excellent even though it was busy. The breakfast was good (apart from the coffee). Overall vg.,4,2018,03,12
247,Great hotel & location but a little expensive,"Sandymount is our preferred hotel when we come to visit Dublin. It’s easy to drive to, free car-parking and is minutes from a Dart stations to take you into the city. It’s an old hotel and they do a good job keeping it fresh and the communal areas are lovely. Food in the line out bar is okay. Rooms are cleaned nicely each day. Decent showers and all the expected facilities.

Our only 2 gripes were the price and the wifi. If the price of the room per night included breakfast we would have been much happier. We felt an additional €14 for breakfast each morning considering what we’d already paid was steep. The WiFi was very poor. I turned the WiFi off on my phone as it was so slow and we could use our laptop without getting frustrated. ",4,2018,03,10
247,Spot on,"Stayed here for 2 nights, our room was spotlessly clean,lovely comfortable bed, breakfast had a great variety to choose from and the staff very efficient and friendly, would definitely go back if i was in Dublin again . ",5,2018,03,08
247,Sandymount Hotel - best customer service ever.,"We were due to stay originally on Thursday but due to a huge snow storm that hit Ireland we were stranded at our Airport.  Called the hotel and we got through to the nicest Irish lady who could not have done enough to help, Toni.  She changed our dates to the Friday as we were told we would be able to fly, but alas we were then again told we could not depart.  Desperately rang the hotel the second time to change our arrival date and spoke with Toni once again.  As before she really could not do enough to help us, rebooked us for another date - no stress just a calm and helpful voice at the end of the line when everything else was so uneasy and hectic.  I have no doubt the hotel was under serious pressure but she was so understanding.  We even had a giggle at one point and it really lifted myself and my wife's spirits.  We arrived on Sunday and we loved the hotel.  But above all the customer care we received was second to none.  It has been a very long time since I encountered such sincerity.  Well done Sandymount Hotel, she really is a keeper!  Unfortunately I did not meet her in person but I did call yesterday to thank her personally.  I look forward to visiting Dublin again (minus the snow storm) and I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to one and all.  Irish hospitality you just cannot buy anywhere else.",5,2018,03,07
247,A great hotel,"This is a great hotel in a very nice area. 
Stayed here for a week. A quiet area and has great paths for walking. 
Close to bus station and the train. So its easy to get into the city centre. 
Rooms are very nice, clean and they have a restaurant. Breakfast was good comparing to other hotels. The staff was very professional in every department that i was in contact with. Very helpful indeed and i would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and others. 
",4,2018,03,04
247,Unexpected but cozy mini vacation,"My flight was canceled due to blizzards and I was sent here by Aer Lingus until the next flight to Barcelona.  Despite the unprecedentedly brutal weather, I had a super great time.  All the staff was friendly, many different languages were spoken, and many were very attractive as well, both genders.  Carlos, Ernesto and Mate practically take the shirts off their backs to make you feel at home.  And Rose, Valentina, Ana and especially Sanja are all giggles and smiles and make one feel like a VIP and very desirable.  The food was the best I've had in any hotel ever, unbelievably affordable, and the drinks are poured with a real punch.  This is a family owned hotel and feels like it, and I made good friends here.",5,2018,03,03
247,One night stay,"Stayed at Sandymount for one night where I joined our travel group. Reception was friendly and passed on a message to me from our Tour Director as I arrived late afternoon. My room was via a narrow hallway. Good sized clean room with colonial looking furnishings & good sized modern bathroom. Was able to sleep well after a nice meal of grilled salmon at the hotel bistro. Buffet brekky was good with a lot of choices from cold to hot dishes. 

Hotel is a fair way away from Dublin city centre and the airport. There is a train station at Stadium but I did not get a chance to check it out. My room had a strange sewage like smell and I do not know where it was coming from.

I would stay somewhere central in Dublin in my next visit.",3,2018,03,03
247,Very nice staff,"Great location, good transport links, great breakfast with plenty of choice, very police staff. Comfortable room, nice and warm on the freezing cold days. Bathroom a bit small but perfect for our visit. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,02,27
247,Rugby weekend,"X2 lovely rooms 218 & 219, very quiet had to turn heating down as very warm but not an issue. Arrived on the 22nd until 26th and as you can imagine it got busy as it was rugby weekend. Breakfast - plenty of choice & plentyful. This hotel is so convenient for the Aviva Stadium and the Dart train. We used the Dart everyday and got off at Tara St which was central enabling us to walk around central Dublin. Be aware that on rugby weekends that none residents also migrate to The Sandymount due to its closness to the stadium. The only slight problem we had was that we wanted an evening meal after the game but were told initally there were no tables available as we had not booked , if we had been informed on our arrival that we needed to book for the Saturday we would have done so but fortunately 1 of dining room managers did indeed squeeze us in, so Thank You very much accommodating us . On the whole a lovely hotel out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre which is only a few stops away on the Dart train and convenient to The Aviva.",4,2018,02,27
247,Another amazing stay,"We stayed here from 23rd to 25th February.  We had an executive room which was lovely and roomy and warm and comfy bed.  Only thing we found was it took a long time before hot water arrived in the taps but once it did we had fab powerful showers. Heating in the ensuite was poor and it was very cold once out of the shower but the bedroom itself was lovely and warm.
Food is fantastic here.  Breakfast was really high quality, dinner amazing, steaks juicy and tender, good portions. Desserts fantastic.  PIZZA BEST EVER EATEN and we are not really pizza lovers but would have it here again and again.. staff always friendly & helpful and a wonderful supply of yummy bon bons at reception always nice :-)
Thanks for a fab stay and having such a lovely warm friendly hotel.",4,2018,02,26
247,Nice hotel until we looked under the bed,"We found a pair of mens underwear under the bed which made us question the cleanliness of the entire room. Apart from that we were happy with the hotel. Comfy bed, nice seating areas around the place. Wood fire. Nice breakfast selection. ",3,2018,02,26
247,Leisure Break,Great location for city and port of Dublin. Staff were very friendly and helpful. We requested a quiet room and got the same. Bar staff were very efficient and nothing was too much trouble. Receptionist was knowledgeable and offered helpful and practical advice. Bar food was good and served till 9.30pm on our night. Our room was spacious and comfortable. Car parking was easily accessible on site. No parking charges were a bonus!,5,2018,02,25
247,Tour of Ireland,"This hotel was located in a very nice area, near public transportation, very clean, staff was excellent. Bar was an easy place to get a nice dinner and drink. Felt safe in the area for walking around.  Locals were kind and helpful.",5,2018,02,23
247,Highly Recommend,"I highly recommend The Sandymount Hotel. We enjoyed every minute of our stay. Excellent staff and attention to detail. Great location and facilities. Quite hotel, had a great nights sleep. I would certainly stay again. ",5,2018,02,22
247,Lovely hotel in a great location,"My husband and I booked a weekend stay, from the check in  to the staff in the bar and restaurant  we would have no hesitation in recommending the sandy mount hotel. We will definitely be back lovely hotel to stay in.",5,2018,02,21
247,"Lovely hotel, good location ","Recently stayed in the hotel for an overnight stay at the weekend. Location was excellent for accessing the city centre by the Dart with the dart station around the corner. The hotel is fabulously decorated, modern and cosy with an immaculate room again really nicely decorated with excellent complementary toiletries, luxurious fluffy bathrobe and complementary slippers. 
We stayed in the hotel for drinks at night and were served by a lovely barman, David who was very friendly and couldn’t do enough for us along with his colleague Bobby. 
Breakfast had a wonderful varied selection of food and was delicious. 
Overall we had a very enjoyable stay in the hotel and would recommend it. ",4,2018,02,20
247,Beautiful modern Hotel,"The staff were friendly. We had been upgraded due to it being my partners birthday. Reception staff booked a taxi for us in the evening. The bar is bright and modern and friendly staff. The room was also modern, clean and bright with all the accessories you may need. Late night pizza order was great. Breakfast was great and a staff couldn't have been more helpful. Plenty of info if your looking for something to do. Great location also and plenty of parking",5,2018,02,20
247,"Quality, Value, Location - Hard to beat!","Perhaps the friendliest and most obliging hotel staff in Dublin.  Great location, free parking for guests, very well maintained.  Bar food is very good.  Bedrooms and bathrooms are very clean and very well maintained.  If you are there on business perhaps pay the extra for an executive bedroom as the normal bedrooms do not have great desk space to work at.  The business meeting rooms themselves are very good.  Great location to explore the city from.  ",4,2018,02,18
247,Excellent hotel,My wife and I stayed on Saturday night after the rugby nice clean hotel. Our room was small and the bathroom was small but that reflects on the room we choose. We booked this hotel as it had carpark and was a stone throw from the Aviva. When we arrived the man at entrance said carpark was full so we had to park on a side street about 0.5 miles away. There was tea and coffee but no biscuits and it had 2 bottles of water. The bed was a double but it looked like a single. Overall good experience and will go back soon.,4,2018,02,14
247,Night away,"The room was lovely! Very clean and a good size we were both very happy with it! The reception staff were so friendly and were more than helpful.

However I found the breakfast very disappointing! I advised the waitress I was coeliac and needed gluten free she told me she could get gluten free toast and to eat from the buffet but didn't offer any other food. I proceeded to say that due to the possibility of cross contamination I couldn't eat from the buffet. She didn't offer any alternative! So I ended up having only gluten free toast.

I'm very unhappy with this service as I had called in advance and was advised that they could accommodate me.

 After this I am sorry to say that I will not stay again.

I would like to reiterate that the reception staff were brilliant it was the waiting team on Saturday morning and their lack of care that has resulted in this. 
",1,2018,02,12
247,The hotel is nice and friendly. The staff were helpful but I feel like in relation to the travel disappointment. I feel,The hotel is nice and friendly. The staff were helpful but I feel like in relation to the travel disappointment as the staff could of none more and then brushed it off when we were waiting for the bus from the hotel. Also while eating our food there was a drunk man walking around and he fell were everyone could see him.,3,2018,02,12
247,Awful,"I am currently staying in the Sandymount hotel for one night. I booked this hotel as is it in a great location as we were going to the aviva, when we arrived the road to the hotel was blocked off by the garda. I rang the hotel and the receptionist told me if I showed proof of booking the garda would let me in which did not happen. I had to park in a private Car park 20 minutes away from the hotel. We missed the first 20 minutes of the match because of this. After the match we had to wait for the road to reopen before we could get to the hotel. There was then a sign on the gate saying 'car park full'. We eventually got parking after a long wait. I do not think it is acceptable that a hotel should offer parking for customer on their website if they cannot accommodate it. We paid quite a lot to stay close to the Aviva and to have somewhere we would not have to worry about our car and this hotel did not accommodate our needs as we thought it would. One very unhappy customer.",1,2018,02,10
247,Lovely Hotel,"The room was very nice and clean. The hotel is in a great location, not far from city centre. We drove down so we’re able to park at the hotel which was handy. It is a bit expensive for one night but it’s the best value I seen compared to other hotels in Dublin.  ",5,2018,02,09
247,Lovely comfortable family run hotel,"From the helpful person who took our booking to the warm welcome at all points of our stay we felt comfortable and that nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast is reasonable, the room very well appointed and quiet ( The bed a bit hard for me but that's nothing new) and staff friendly. It's in a lovely area with easy walks to sandymount village and beach and ballsbridge. 
Our granddaughter who accompanied us thought that it was wonderful. I think she liked the fact that staff spoke to her a have her a lolly! ",5,2018,02,09
247,Great Hotel,"Excellent room very clean ad tidy, Shower extremely nice and powerful. And great customer service.
Very close to the station - the only negative thing i would say is that because we were on the first floor everyone above us were making so much noise in the morning i woke up quite a few times.",5,2018,02,08
247,Excellent service,"Most of the facilities of a big chain hotel, but with the added bonus of being a family run business; the Sandymount is notable for genuinely helpful and friendly staff. Everything we asked for arrived in an instant and with a smile. There are only bar meals but the quality is good - and as we had been rushing about at the races all weekend that was all we wanted. ",5,2018,02,07
247,Surprise trip to Dublin,"A wonderful hotel in a stunning location ideal if you want to be out of the hustle and bustle but with Dublin City centre easily accessible. Sandymount village is a short stroll away with a nice choice of pubs and restaurants. The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful and I’d like to special thank you to Beatrice for helping out with the surprise for my husbands birthday celebration. Beatrice also gave us a room upgrade to a suit which was stunning, one of the best rooms I’ve ever stopped in. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. Unfortunately we didn’t get round to trying the bar out but it looked very inviting with very stylish decor. Hopefully we’ll get chance on our next visit. ",5,2018,02,06
247,Ciaran,Very good .Staff excellent .Location great.Very close to Ballsbridge where pubs and restaurants are excellent and saves the need to go into city centre.Also close to Dart services and close to Bray and Greystones.,5,2018,02,06
247,Laid back in Dublin,"Had a lovely Saturday and Sunday night at the Sandymount.  Ideally placed if you want to be slight away form the hubbub of the city but only 10 minutes into town on the Dart or by taxi.  Friendly attentive staff, super breakfast buffet, comfy beds and well appointed.",5,2018,02,06
247,No 1 in Dublin for value,Very friendly and helpful staff(Beatrice) upon arrival. Comfortable. Room. I could not get the heat turned off but this was immediately remedied upon bringing it to the attention of staff. Friendly and efficient bar staff . Add in the location and an excellent breakfast and you will not get many better hotels in dublin,5,2018,02,06
247,Excellent,"Recently stayed at this wonderful hotel. Room was lovely, food great and the staff were amazing. We were late for breakfast one morning and they went out of their way to have breakfast made up for us and delivered up to our room. Just what the doctor ordered. Would highly recommend this hotel. Great location also!! ",5,2018,02,05
247,Lovely hotel ,Spent the Sat night of the Dublin racing festival here with a group of friends will definitely be back next year lovely hotel with very friendly atmosphere staff and food exceptionally good special thanks to Lee and Bobby in the bar who made a great night for us with there helpfulness and nothing is a problem attitude thanks guys,5,2018,02,04
247,50th Birthday Celebration,"What a little gem in a fantastic location.  On arrival we received a very warm welcome from Beatrice who very kindly gave us a room upgrade to a large suite on the 3rd floor along with a bottle of red wine and a box of Thornton chocolates to help celebrate my husbands 50th birthday (unfortunately we didn't get chance to drink the wine but what a lovely gesture).  I had arranged for three other couples to join us as a surprise and Beatrice went above and beyond to make sure all the plans went without a hitch.  The facilities in the hotel were fantastic and our room and all communal areas were spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was delicious with lots of choice and it was very relaxing knowing breakfast was served until 10:30 on a weekend.  Sandymount is a lovely quiet residential area extremely close to the Aviva stadium, this I particularly liked as it was far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Dublin centre but close enough to have a nice stroll in.  It definitely gives you a more authentic Irish feel but i wouldn't recommend it if you want to be in thick of it and Temple Bar is your idea of fun.  We were a group of eight and we all said we would like to return to hotel again in the future.",5,2018,02,04
247,My stay at the Sandymount Hotel,Wonderful stay from start to finish. The room was spotless and the staff were very attentive. I would have no hesitation in recommending the Sandymount Hotel. Great location with public transport on your doorstep and a scrumptious variety of foods for  breakfast. Once again thank you for a lovely stay and I will be  back soon.,5,2018,02,04
247,Working respite,"Any time we have work to complete we stay at the Sandymount. Nice relaxing atmosphere with excellent service, good food and friendly staff. Hope to stay sometime for a pleasure trip. Would definitely recommend the Sandymount to family and friends.",5,2018,02,02
247,Short stay,Short but extremely enjoyable stay. Staff extremely helpful as expected as I have stayed previously. Since my previous stay the docor and the food has gone up another level. The lovely Sandymount village a short walk away with nice watering holes. Overall a great stay.,5,2018,01,31
247,not sure what ou mean,"Excellent staff, very friendly and accommodating, Rooms very clean,.Restaurant service and food are very good.  Sandymount is somewhat out of the way but shuttle and taxi service work well. Several sitting areas are very comfortable and pleasant.. Close to AVIVA stadium for sports enthusuasts.",5,2018,01,31
247,Comfortable homely hotel,"Enjoyed my stay here at the Sandymount, walking distance to the RDS where I was working for the weekend I stayed, comfortable rooms, good breakfast, they also have a mini book swap library which came in handy",5,2018,01,31
247,Hockey weekend,"friendly staff and great location. Close to the DART which made getting around east.  Parking at the hotel was a real plus compared to other city centre hotels. I'm sure there must be a real buzz on a rugby weekend. Price was good but then there was no game on at the time.

",5,2018,01,30
247,Certainly NOT a 4 star hotel,Being very generous with 4 stars. No WiFi in the room they gave us. Not even a bottle of water in the room which you would expect from a hotel claiming to be 4 star. Tried to double charge me also. And the bath is basically a glorified sink that you can barely srand in. Overall just an average experience. Would not recommend ,3,2018,01,30
247,An Irish gem in the middle of old Dublin,"Sandymount was a comfortable and well serviced stay during a flying visit to Dublin. For both business and pleasure the hotel was well serviced, with top notch staff.
Access to Dublin was possible by walking, affordable taxi and public transport .
The Sandymount village a source of great cuisine choices and quaint architecture.",4,2018,01,29
247,No better place in Dublin for the price,"I have been staying at Sandymount since 1970.  It was smaller then, with a different name, but with the same family owning it.  The same friendly, clean, comfortable, quiet atmosphere that i experienced as a university student continues today.  There is no better place in Dublin for the price. We always stay here",5,2018,01,27
247,Nice hotel ....,"Nice hotel, quirky, food excellent, bar nice but no residents bar the night I stayed there. Room was small and as it’s an old hotel was quite noisy from people walking the floors and using showers in other rooms. Not sure if it’s a place to go for a nice restful nights sleep. Great location for Dublin city.

247,Sandymount Stay,"Very friendly and professional staff who helped me when I was sick during my stay. Their assistance made my stay a lot more enjoyable than it otherwise would've been.

247,Welcome Sight,"The Sandymount Hotel is located about an hours walk from the hustle and noise of downtown Dublin near the Aviva Stadium and offers a quiet sanctuary for the weary traveler.  The desk staff were friendly and helpful allowing me to store my luggage while my room was readied.     The room was clean and well appointed and had an in-room safe.  The Wifi signal was strong and consistent throughout.  I can’t comment on price because it was booked as part of a package but it did include an excellent hot breakfast buffet.  There are a number of pubs, restaurants, and a grocer near by and the Lansdowne railway station is just around the corner.  The neighbourhood felt quite safe and I enjoyed a relaxing walk along the canal after my flight.",3,2018,01,22
247,Lovely hotel,Spent three nights at the sandy mount in the superior suite which was lovely Room was clean and spacious The bed was huge and lovely and comfortable Has breakfast and an evening meal there food was delicious ,5,2018,01,22
247,Great Overnighter,We only stayed one night but we had the afternoon tea special overnight stay. Highly recommended. The staff were most helpful and courteous at all times. We will return as the hotel is located close to sea walks and Dart station.,5,2018,01,22

Walking is about 40 min. good hotel for city break . food quality ok . downside for some people is that hotel don't have resident bar. good sleeping quality and hotel perfect for family with kids",4,2018,01,22
247,Sandy Mount Dublin,"The Sandy Mount Hotel is one of the finest hotels in Dublin. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is just a 5 minute walk from the Dart line, so access to the city centre is so easy and a 10 min walk to the beach. The hotel is immaculately looked after and the choice of food at the bar is fantastic. Just relax and enjoy. ",5,2018,01,22
247,Comfortable hotel - rooms on the small side,"Stayed here recently for one night with work. Very friendly receptionist welcomed me and the room was very clean and modern looking. No air conditioning - no problem in January but come the summer i would not like that. The room was on the small side for the amount of furniture in it and the bathroom/shower area was really very small. But it worked okay. 
Food was on the expensive side but was really very good. 
Breakfast was also good although they weren't very good at replenishing the food. 
I'd stay here again (and in fact am doing so again next week).",3,2018,01,19
247,Great Weekend Away!!! :),"Myself and my Partner travelled to Dublin Friday Morning for my 30th Birthday Weekend! Hotel is fantastic, could not fault at all !!

Staff could not have been more friendly or helpful, advising of local attractions and transport links. Hotel was spotless throughout and the room was great value and very comfortable.  ",5,2018,01,17
247,Great experience at Sandymount Hotel,Was very pleasantly surprised at how nice this hotel is for the price and considering it is in D4 area.. The room and ensuite were modern and very comfortable and clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It is the perfect location if attending the Aviva stadium as it is only a very short walk.,5,2018,01,16
247,Great value hotel,"Stayed in for 1 night, great value - only negative would be that if you are more than 6ft 2inch the bed sizes are small! Breakfast was definitely worth it and the only other point to note is that heating controls are not given in the room.",3,2018,01,16
247,Great stay with easy access to city centre and Dublin beaches and coast.,"We had a great stay in early Jan 2018. Staff are really friendly and helpful and make you feel at home. Hotel is very clean with modern homely touches throughout and new carpets, furniture, etc. following a recent revamp. Free and east parking. Great location, quiet, 5 mins from beach and Dart and Sandymount village and Ballsbridge. Nice cliental. Overall, great value. Would highly recommend for an inexpensive relaxing stay in Dublin.

247,''Lovely cosy homely hotel'',"First time staying at the Sandymount and found the staff friendly, the open fire was welcoming, hotel very clean,breakfast was excellent ,rooms were clean and comfortable,good locatation for RDS and Aviva. Will definitely stay there again.",4,2018,01,15
247,Nye sesh,"Me and my girlfriend decided to stay here over the new year festivities, we arrived early and we was allowed to leave our bags whilst we went out exploring, when we returned we was given our key and sent off to find our room, I think completing a mirror maze is easier than navigating around these identical corridors 🗺 after hours of navigation and a mouth like an old dap we arrived at our room 🙌 the room itself was very compact but cosy, had all the essentials like a tv with the discovery channel to fulfil all your gold rush and tanked needs, nothing like coming home after a few frothy beverages to watch fish tanks on roids 🐟💉 the hotel is also located very close to the dart rail, which is pretty handy really cause you can get into town with little hassle, you get the best of both worlds really, it’s close enough to the centre but also to a quiet beach, I know you’re probably thinking a beach in Dublin 🏖 I was as surprised as you, until you find it, and realise it’s not a beach but a bug infested industrial swimming pool, I think it might of been where the Spider-Man was born 🕷 still it makes for a good photo, 
all in all I’d stay here again just to have another line out burger! Aka a Cow between two buns! 🍞🐄 🍞
Peace out ✌️",5,2018,01,14
247,Almost perfect,"I really liked the stay. Food is really good, service is OK and the rooms are really nice. I would recommend this place to everybody who is looking for an accommodation, especially near the Aviva stadium. ",4,2018,01,13
247,'Lucky Hotel',"Once again the students,parents and teachers and students of Kinsale Community School had a wonderful time in this hotel during the BT Young Scientist Exhibition.

Well done to all involved",5,2018,01,13
247,Overnight Stay in Sandymount Hotel ,From the moment I arrived the staff were friendly. The hotel has been revamped since I was last there and it is really nice. Beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. Breakfast was a bit on the cold side but other than that all was fine. ,4,2018,01,12
247,"Quiet Road, great mattresses, very clean","A lovely chic hotel with a calm air. The staff couldn't be nicer.
It's only a few minutes walk to the Dart light rail into the centre of Dublin, though on a Bank Holiday Monday there were taxis lined up outside.",5,2018,01,10
247,"Great location, very helpful and trustworthy staff","I stayed at the Sandymount Hotel for 2 nights and found it to be a great location, just 2 stops from central Dublin and a short walk to Sandymount and Balls ridge. The hotel was spotless, staff very friendly and free parking was a bonus.

On returning home from the hotel I discovered that I had left jewelry behind. I enquired about this the next day and the jewelry was promptly posted to be. Thank you to the staff at Sandymount Hotel for their honesty. I would definitely return and would recommend to others.",5,2018,01,09
247,Superb weekend away,Ideal location.. Right next to Aviva Stadium and a lovely walk into Grafton Street... Rooms are fab! Staff very helpful and friendly.. Very clean hotel! Good food also! Massive thumbs up! Definitely recommend! ,5,2018,01,09
247,Great hotel with friendly staff and close to Dublin centre by DART,Excellent hotel with lovely clean rooms and easy access to the centre of Dublin by DART (Only 2 Stops away). Great for families or couples. We didn't have food there this time as we went out for dinner but from previous experience the breakfasts were excellent too.,5,2018,01,07
247,Fantastic Hotel,"We parked in the hotel's parking lot and entered the hotel in the front.  It looked like a classy hotel and we weren't sure we could afford to stay.  My sister-in-law and I were greeted warmly and discovered a moderately priced room.  It was roomy, clean, and had breakfast included.  It's a beautiful hotel.  We were pleased with our stay.",5,2018,01,06
247,Sandymount Hotel,"The location was fantastic being close to Sandymount, Ballsbridge and Dart station.
The rooms were very clean and cleaned first thing in the morning.The food for breakfast and evening meals was excellent. The staff were very helpful and nice. We will definitely be back.",5,2018,01,05
247,Good location..Great Staff,"Loads of parking, staff were very helpful. Hotel was very clean and food was nice certain meals were over priced. If going to a game in Aviva can't get a better location! Very near dart and great pubs in ballsbridge",4,2018,01,04
247,GREAT PLACE,Great place to stay - lovely hotel in a quiet area with really good transport links close by to get to the city and further afield. Lots of choices for breakfast. Staff were very friendly. Big bonus was the secure car parking facilities and being able to leave the car for the day even though we had checked out. ,5,2018,01,04
247,Excellent Stay,"I have stayed here with my partner a couple of times and every time the rooms are so clean and comfortable, staff is so friendly & helpful and it’s very good value for money. Also it’s so close to the Aviva & RDS grounds and not too far away from the city centre. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends & family. ",5,2018,01,03
247,Very happy!,"Location of the hotel is excellent - we travelled to Dalkey / Dun Laoghaire on the Dart and it was easily accessible from the hotel. We did not eat at the hotel, as we had a room only basis. We had an executive suite purely to have a bit more space and it did. I requested a quiet room, and again, this was  done - we slept well!",5,2018,01,02
247,City break,Good location to city centre. Excellent breakfast. Friendly staff in both reception and restaurants. Room had good facilities but could have been warmer.  Car parking facilities adequate. Would return.  ,5,2018,01,01

Very central, fab hotel very homely. 
We stayed at the Sandymount for the Horse Show and for Lepordstown races and for early morning hockey match, it has always been excellent
Mary",5,2018,01,01
247,Fabulous Mini Break,A big thanks to all the staff at the Sandymount Hotel.  I usually stay over on business most weeks during the year but I brought my family along on Friday 29th December for a short Christmas get away.  A great welcome was extended to my kids which was super.  The connecting rooms were ideal and we are still guessing the kilos of sugar in that magnificent Christmas Village display!   Well done and thanks again.,5,2017,12,30
247,International football,"Excellent as always .My only issue is the vast difference in price between our stay on Monday November 13, 2017 and Tuesday November 14 the latter being the date of an International football event in the Aviva Stadium. I feel the event hike in price is unfair especially for regular guests. We choose this hotel for its proximity to the stadium. ",4,2017,12,30
247,Average All Round,"I stayed here for a week recently. Everything was average on the whole, apart from the welcome, which was brusque and unfriendly when I arrived about 22:00 after a long day of travel.

The room was small, cramped by the addition of a single bed, which rendered the wardrobe almost inaccessible. The outlook was into a small courtyard bounded on all four sides by other rooms, so keeping the curtains closed all the time was the only solution if any privacy was required. 

Service was again kind of average, no particularly friendly encounters with staff.

With a vast choice of hotels in Dublin, there was nothing stand-out about my stay and nothing that made me feel I'd like to return again. By the same token there was nothing offensive or inconvenient about the experience, hence the average rating.",3,2017,12,29
247,A gem of a hotel,"Stayed here with young family. Sizable clean and comfortable room, and very helpful staff - the place felt family-run, but professionally so. Good value for the location and star-rating. Has obvious appeal for rugby fans but definitely suitable for families too. ",5,2017,12,29
247,Excellent place to stay,"Very comfortable hotel with friendly staff. Location is brilliant, close to Dart and has own free parking. Very quiet area. Sandymount Village not far away and has some very nice places to eat. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2017,12,25
247,Love this place!,I recently stayed here for 17 days while moving to Ireland for work. The hotel is a fantastic value and extremely comfortable. It's just 2 short stops on the Dart to the City Center which makes it close to everything without the noise of the city. The staff is super friendly and Beatrice at Reception is an absolute gem. She really made our stay. ,5,2017,12,25
247,Another great stay,"Excellent location.
All staff extremely friendly and helpful. Reception staff gave us good information about how to get around and where to visit both locally and further afield.
Ate in the restaurant and the bar and both were great. It was a rugby weekend and the atmosphere in the hotel was buzzing. ",5,2017,12,23
247,Beautiful hotel with lovely warm staff,"Myself and my partner stayed in the Sandymount Hotel for 3 nights. What a lovely hotel with an incredibly homely feel about the place. All the staff are lovely, courteous, and well trained. The breakfast was spot on with lots of options available. We had a full Irish one morning, porridge and fruit the next morning, whilst reading the complimentary newspapers. Rooms are spacious, and beds are very comfy. Location is ideal with the village a walk away, and the Dart within a minute walk. Can’t compliment this hotel enough. We will definitely come back and it’s get the full 5 stars from us. Well done all involved at the Sandymount Hotel",5,2017,12,22
247,Overnight stay,"We started here recently just for a quick overnight as we were attending a Christmas party nearby. Hotel has lovely character with nice seating spaces in  the public areas. The bedroom we had was quite small but modern, spotlessly clean and had everything we needed.
The breakfast was excellent, lots of fruit and pastries. Would definitely stay again.",5,2017,12,21
247,Felt very much at home as usual,"Great welcome. Very comfortable stay. Friendly and helpful staff. Excellent breakfast buffet with great selection. 
Very well located and free parking. The recent modernisation and refurbishment has been a great success",5,2017,12,21
247,Wonderful,The nicest and friendliest Hotel in the whole world!! And I have traveled the world during 15 years for my job. Impossible for me to fly to Dublin and not to stay in the Sandymount Hotel. It’s home to me ,5,2017,12,20
247,Average,Clean hotel and friendly staff. Just didn’t sleep well. Breakfast was lovely. Also booked a taxi for 7 o’clock which didn’t arrive until 20 past 7. May not be hotels fault but should have made sure it was on time ,3,2017,12,19
247,Not 4 star quality,"I am just back from a night stay in the hotel. Did not have a great experience. When we arrived my partner went for a shower but the shower tray over filled due to the drain being blocked and had soaked my partners clothes that were on floor beside the shower, i called reception and they sent a guy with a plunger and moo to our room, he removed the filter which was so full of stuff i would imagine it hasnt seen the light of day since being put in the hotel. Got an apology from the porter who had come fix it, in fairness he was very nice but no one offered us to have my partners clothes taken care of.
Went away from the hotel for a few hours and on return to my room my key card was not working so i went to reception told the man at the desk my card wasnt letting me in, he just looked up at me no “hello” “sorry” nothing just “what room number”, took the card typed on his computer handed me the card and said it should work now. Found this so rude, he clearly did not want to be there anyways thats for sure. 
Over all found my experience with this hotel a let down as after paying 4 star prices and expecting 4 star service from a 4 star hotel that is not near what we experienced here. Would only recommend staying if going to the aviva as it is a great location for that and that only.  ",3,2017,12,19
247,Will Always be my place to stay in Dublin,"Just completed a 3 week stay at the Sandymount Hotel and I continue to enjoy this experience.  The hotel has it all, the amenities many and comfortable.  The food at the bar and of course, the breakfast, is amazing.  The hotel is close to all of the sites in Dublin that one would want to see.  The Aviva Stadium is nearby the hotel provides special events there on site during match day.  What really makes this experience complete is the amazing staff.  They truly make you feel at home.  I highly recommend this hotel for your Dublin adventure.",5,2017,12,19
247,Wouldnt say a 4 star experience,"When arrived at hotel my partner went for a shower which was blocked and over filled and went all over his clothes on the bathroom floor, i know these things happen in a hotel iv worked in hotels over the years but reception sent a guy with a plunger and mop and that was it, no offer to take care of my partners wet clothes or anything. Later that night i returned from a show and my room key card wouldnt work, i went to reception and i didnt get a “hello” “sorry” nothing only he took it asked my room number, handed it back and said “it should work now” found it rude especially for a place that is a 4star hotel. ",2,2017,12,19
247,Great hotel for visiting Dublin,"We stayed at the Sandymount Hotel this summer on our visit to Ireland and it was an excellent choice. The room was large as well as clean and modern. We had a full size bed as well as a single bed along with a large bathroom and a table with two chairs. It was also nice for international travel because some of the outlets had USB charges which allowed us to charge multiple things without having to use our U.S. converters. The hotel also had great location, it was a short, probably five minute, walk from the DART station which allowed us get to the city center quickly. We usually got off at Tara road, but there were other convenient stops as well. We were also able to walk into the city, which took about 30 minutes. There was a cute village about a ten to fifteen minute walk in the other direction which had an excellent little cafe with the tastiest scones as well as a Tesco. Another five minutes from the village you could visit the beach, which was beautiful and is definitely a must see if you are staying at the hotel. The hotel did not have an ice machine, but the bar at the restaurant was more than willing to offer ice for free. We visited in July so it was a bit hot without air conditioning, but the hotel was in a quiet area so we just opened the windows at night. Overall it was an excellent experience, but be aware that if you book the hotel through a third party site you will not be given the complimentary breakfast with your stay. ",5,2017,12,18
247,Business at exciting location,Very excellent hotel nearbey the very impressive Aviva stadium. The Hotel had relexaing atmosphere and good choice of food and drinks. Surrounding area had much choices for walking and alternatives for dinner and also nice pubs,5,2017,12,18
247,Nice hotel - not amazing,"Room wasnt set up for three people as previously requested, could hear everything in the corridors outside the room & no residents bar , far from a bad hotel but i did expect more from it to be honest ",4,2017,12,18
247,Christmas party night out,Always a good choice and my go to place to stay when I need to stay in Dublin. Reasonable rates and a great location close to everything. Staff are friendly and rooms are modern and clean. I would highly recommend this hotel,5,2017,12,18
247,Many thanks,"Whilst my previous stays have already been excellent, due to a taxi problem I needed help in getting my luggage returned, the staff could not have been more supportive and helpful over the duration of the problem",5,2017,12,18
247,Fantastic Staff throughout,"I travel a great deal and my chck-in experience at The Sandymount was one of the warmest, most helpful I have had. This carried on throughout in the bar, breakfast team and on my day of check-oy, I needed to leave before 7am.  The team couldn't do enough for me and basically let me have my breakfast half an hour early!   Makes a huge difference and I have already recommended and will continue to do so.   A very well presented hotel  too, room was immaculate.",4,2017,12,18
247,Nice Hotel,Good hotel. The fittness room could be better. Good food and location. the area is well suited for running in the morning compared to downtown Dublin. There is a local village close by that has a selection of ok restaurants,4,2017,12,18
247,Very Pleasant.,"Stayed here with friends for two nights to watch rugby at the Aviva Stadium. We couldn't have been better placed as it was literally a five minute stroll away. It is also a very easy flat walk to the little beach at Sandymount Village. Nice clean rooms, ours had a single and a double bed so was possibly larger than some but it was perfectly adequate with nearly all one could need. The only thing missing which ruined my early morning cup of tea was some bottled water. The tap water gave the tea a dreadful tang and I couldn't drink it as I wanted to during the night because of the taste. We bought a two litre bottle of water so the second night I was much happier and my early morning cup of tea was lovely. The shower room was a little small but nice and modern and the shower itself was very good. We had a garden room which was nice and quiet which we were very pleased about as there were loads of Christmas celebrations going on. 
The full Irish breakfasts were delicious and the eggs, to order, were cooked to perfection. Lots of cereals and nice porridge with the usual mixed fruit and pastries. I would have given it five stars but for the water.",4,2017,12,17
247,small room. overpriced,good location. large car park. room small and rather poorly furnished. one tiny window. much too hot on first night but then turned radiator off. wierd hotel layout with hallways and staircases all over the place. staff were friendly enough.,2,2017,12,17
247,Best hotel in Dublin,"We always stay in Sandymount Hotel when we visit Dublin. Location is excellent being very near Dart Station, free parking is provided ,staff are friendly and welcoming and we would especially like to thank Beatrice on reception and Edel in reservations for always looking after us so well.",5,2017,12,16
247,Pleasant Hotel - great staff,"Stayed here for the week for a work during a work event.

The hotel is clean, tidy and the staff more than helpful.    The interior is nicely laid out with a bar, restaurant and lots of places to go and relax.  The real fire is a great touch.

Nothing was too much trouble for the staff...",5,2017,12,15

247,"Lovely place, awsome staff, delicious food! ","Have been staying in Sandymount hotel for the last four months due to work commitments in Dublin. Hotel is lovely, staff is extremely nice and friendly, rooms are good size and clean, bar food is delicious and good price for Dublin. Love the Christmas decorations! Totally would recommend. ",5,2017,12,12
247,Concert stay,Lovely hotel in a very quiet location. Stayed here with my mother when we went to Andre Rieu in the 3 arena. Good value for our 1 night stay which included breakfast and dinner. Extremely comfy beds guarantee a good night's sleep,5,2017,12,12
247,Great location...,"Friendly and convenient for city trip to Dublin. 7 mins from Lansdowne Road DART station. Plenty of car parking.
Breakfast was extensive. Friendly and helpful staff. Would be great for Rugby Sux Nations games.",5,2017,12,12
247,Sandymount Hotel,My wife & I stayed one night to attend an event at the 3 Arena. It was a most pleasant stay & convenient to the venue. The breakfast was varied & excellent. The bar food after the event was as delicious as it was welcome.,5,2017,12,12
247,A place to stay,"Comfortable accomodation, clean and really quiet. Relaxing place and comfort. This is one of the best accomodation available. Staff is nice and helps everytime. If you need something ask to the staff for sure they will suggest you a solution.",5,2017,12,12
247,Recent Stay,".Recent stay in Sandymount Hotel, great location, friendly staff, and comfortable rooms. However found breakfast to be of very poor quality... tinned mushrooms..?? Deep fried black pudding ...?? Not the most appealing. I would stay here again but would not avail of a breakfast of this standard for €11.95..!",4,2017,12,12
247,A night away in Dublin,"Great location, very friendly staff. Breakfast had a good variety of foods on offer. Only downside lack of sleep due to been located on the 1st floor and the reception area on the 2nd floor you could hear all the activity.",4,2017,12,11
247,lovely quiet and peaceful hotel full of charm,"this was our first visit to the Sandymount Hotel, and please god it wont be our only one, the hotel is full of charm and is so quiet and peaceful, our room was warm, comfortable, and clean, we ate in the bar, and i have to say, the mixed pepper soup was amazing, the burgers are a meal in themselves, breakfast was buffet, not my cuppa tea, but with the amount of breakfasts being served when we were there, it`s understandable, we also love the fast that they offer fresh milk instead of that horrible uht dribble, nice touch :) thank you for an enjoyable stay on 09/12/2017 room 553",5,2017,12,10
247,Good for an overnight stay,"Stayed here as part of a Travalgar tour.  Very friendly service. But rooms and bathrooms are small. If you plan to only sleep in the room it should meet your needs. Hotel is a little dated and the open areas need some upgrade. I found the hotel far from tourist attractions. At least 40 minutes walk to Trinity College and more than an hour to St. Patrick's Cathederal. Both days we took taxis back and found it expensive. Breakfast is a very average affair and not topped up enough, always something lacking. Only water was detox water and we needed to take medicine. But all and all hotel has homely feel and would just not book because of location.",3,2017,12,10
247,Christmas Shopping Stay,Stayed in the Sandymount hotel for our Christmas trip to Dublin. Hotel was very warm & cosy with a very festive theme. Especially loved the open fire & the gingerbread Christmas display. Staff were very friendly & helpful especially Beatrice & Valentina on the front desk. I would  highly recommend this hotel & we will definitely be back.,5,2017,12,10
247,Recent stay,"Very comfortable hotel. Warm rooms .nice small bathrooms. Close to the lovely village of sandy mount which has a great Italian restaurant called Mario’s. Close to the dart station and lansdowne road.also close to the rds
",5,2017,12,09
247,Good location for good money,"The location was excellent, just a few minutes walking from the Dart station and close to several bus lines, including the Aircoach one, which was handy to get to the airport on time.

Unfortunately we couldn't stay longer than a night, but I'd definitely choose it again for a following visit.",5,2017,12,06
247,Nice hotel in great location for Aviva stadium,"Spent a night here as I had to go to an event at the Aviva Stadium, which is just a couple of hundred metres from the hotel. It's a very nice hotel, friendly staff. Room was comfortable, modern and clean. 
The hotel is a 10 minute walk away from a village area (which I think was Sandymount itself) which had shops, cafe's, bars etc, and a couple of minutes walk further on to the seafront. ",5,2017,12,05
247,A Below Average Stay,"We chose this hotel as we were in Dublin on business for 3 weekends.
Rooms : The rooms or of a well finished standard. Beds are comfortable & there has been a recent refurbishment so I cannot fault them.
Location: A good 40 mins walk to Temple Bar etc but the Dart is only a few mins walk from the hotel and will take you into town quickly.
Value: The hotel is highly overpriced as is the majority of hotels in Dublin. At an average £150 sterling per night without breakfast its costly.
Staff: Unfortunately staff where not of a very high standard. Often the staff the were not from Ireland found it difficult to understand me ( in Irish) hence alot of repeating was required.
Food: The hotel really let's itself down here. My wife & I are both vegan & food was totally non existent. The first weekend we spent I  the hotel I went to the bar to ask for food. I was told no food was being served as there was a football match on in the stadium and only burgers and hotdogs were available outside! Shocking.
In the morning at breakfast it was a struggle to get the staff to get almond milk or maple syrup or anything like that.
On our second weekend once again I visited the restaurant at lunch. I asked the server could I have a veg stir fry or chips or anything. She went into the kitchen, came back out and said chef says NO.
I resorted to eating food from a bag I had stored in my car just incase. I reported this to the reception. The manager approached me and apologised but I had already eaten at this stage. Again shocking.
Also after our first visit where we paid cash on departure we found the hotel also debited our card for the full amount too. We waited a full month for them to refund it. 
As stated we had initially booked 3 weekends but the 3rd weekend we cancelled and stayed in The Ballsbridge Hotel. We had just had enough of this hotel.
Outward appearance is great but it really does fall short.
I wouldn't recommend this hotel nor would I return. ",2,2017,12,05
247,Most enjoyable Stay,"My sister and I stayed last weekend at the Sandymount Hotel for our annual Christmas shopping trip to Dublin ,We have stayed many times in this hotel  and as always it was such a lovely experience from the moment we arrived we were made feel so welcome by the staff at reception and indeed by the bar staff and the staff at breakfast ,Our room was perfect very quiet ,very clean
comfy beds and perfect temperature. Breakfast was excellent with such a huge selection of hot and cold food.. Free parking was a great advantage as we had driven up from the country.,Being located so close to the Dart station it meant we didn't need 
to use car during our stay . We would have no hesitation in recommending the 
Sandymount Hotel ,",5,2017,12,05
247,Friendly helpful staff and good local pubs and restaurants in Sandymount Village.,"Very friendly staff  and a comfortable room makes for a decent place to stay for a business trip to Dublin.
The local area has plenty of good pubs and restaurants but transport into the City Centre via the Dart rail service is also a few minutes walk away.",4,2017,12,05
247,Quiet stay in Dublin 4,A lovely hotel with the city on your doorstep is how I’d describe the Sandymount hotel formerly known as The Mount Herbert Hotel. Value for money is excellent as city hotels go . I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and I will return in future. One minor issue with me was as Irish hotels go I thought the room was small and the bathroom smaller. However don’t let that put you off I’ve stayed in smaller hotels all over Europe. Lastly the hotel is in a beautiful suburban residential neighbourhood in Dublin 4 it’s quiet and very peaceful and is easily accessible to all the major landmarks . You will enjoy stay should you choose to stay here. ,4,2017,12,03
247,Sandy mount Hotel,"Great hotel would highly recommend it, rooms were very warm and clean, the food was of the highest standards. The staff where very helpful and polite, plenty of room too park your van or car and great location ",5,2017,12,03
247,It's home from Home,"I've stayed here 2 nights a week for the past 2 yrs. Its gone through a transformation  in the 2 yrs. The owners have spent a considerable amount of money updating the hotel. It's warm and cosy, and the staff are incredibly friendly. They have recently converted a room into a small fitness area. If this was double / triple the size it would be better but it's better than nothing.",4,2017,11,30
247,Great experience!,"Myself and my partner were looking for a hotel to stay in Dublin for 1 night for a concert, we wanted somewhere nice and more modern, we saw the pictures for The SandyMount Hotel and we were very impressed and booked straight away, we were greeted warmly upon arrival and were in or rooms within minutes, the rooms were all immaculate and very nice.

The staff were all extremely helpful and kind, the breakfast the next morning was fab too, we had no issues and thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",5,2017,11,30
247,Wonderful  experience,"Friendly welcome and advice on how to get into Dublin centre.  Excellent room - clean, warm, modern, very well appointed.  We dined in the bar where the lemon and thyme chicken was so delicious I chose it both nights we stayed.  There were a number of cosy seating areas for relaxing after dinner. Breakfast was buffet style offering a good choice.  Thanks in particular to Beatrice for making sure the visit exceeded our expectations.",5,2017,11,29
247,Best hotel in Dublin,"We love the Sandymount! It’s our favorite hotel in Dublin, we couldn’t recommend it enough. We stay here any time we stay in Dublin, From the moment you step foot in the door the staff are so friendly and helpful, the rooms are modern, clean and very comfortable, and the food in the the line out bar is lovely. The hotel is great and 5min walk from the dart station which means you can park up and get the dart into town.

Thank you sandymount hotel 
We will be back x",5,2017,11,29
247,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed here one night in November for a business trip. It was easy to reach from the airport. The hotel is very beautiful on the inside, it's got a traditional and country-style feel about it. I read on a sign in the lift that it was Dublin's oldest family-run hotel.
Reception was very friendly and helpful. The room and bathroom were nice, the bed comfortable. It was a bit cold though, I couldn't see an aircon to adjust the temperature and the radiator didn't come on until the morning. 
The bathroom was clean except for the back of the toilet, where it is mounted to the wall. Considering the standard of the hotel, I would have expected this to be cleaner.
There was a great range of toiletries available in the bathroom. 
I didn't use the shower nor did I have breakfast at the hotel, so I can't comment on that. 
I had a bite from the bar the night before when I arrived, it was ok, nothing outstanding. 
They do have a driver operating a shuttle bus into the city centre, it is free I understood.
Overall a very pleasant stay, I would stay here again.",4,2017,11,29
247,Best Hotel in Dublin ,I use the Sandymount Hotel regularly. I find the standard of accommodation first class. Reception staff are the friendliest and most helpful I have found anywhere in the cities I travel to.  Free coffee at reception in the morning is a fantastic add on. I cannot fault the hotel in any way. The location is great for access to the city centre and perfect for tourist or business travellers. Keep up the great work!,5,2017,11,29
247,Alf,"I have stayed here many times and it’s a fabulous hotel to stay in, so central to everywhere. Perfect location for city centre as the dart line is 5 min away. The reception was bright and welcoming and the staff are so helpful. There is a beach within walking distance.",5,2017,11,29
247,No words can describe our stay only it was dreadful,It was a terrible .filthy toilet freezing cold rooms room was not up to standard for an executive suite.constsnt noise outside our room shouting and banging doors all night long no sleep at all should be given a full refund for what we had to endure in your hotel on Saturday 25th of November 2017 as it was a special occasion and turned out to be disappointed and disastrous.,3,2017,11,29
247,Very good hotel,This is a very good hotel even the day after a busy rugby occasion. Good food in the bar and an excellent breakfast. Only comment would be that we found the two lifts confusing for the location of our room and we had to carry our cases up and down staircases ,4,2017,11,28
247,"High standard hotel, great staff and restaurant","I work with a Project Management consultancy and our team (7 people) have been staying in the Sandymount Hotel 3/4 days per week since July 2017 (now November). Our team travel weekly from Northern Ireland, Newcastle, Manchester and London in the UK. We couldn’t recommended The Sandymount highly enough based on the high quality of service, facilities and restaurant.  

When we arrive at the Sandymount each week, we are always welcomed with a warm smile and greeting from Beatrice and the Reception Team. They’ve always gone that extra step to ensure we have everything we need and are always on hand to give advice regarding travel, gyms, food, and tourist attractions.  

The restaurant at the Sandymount has continued to produce top quality food at great prices. They have always catered for our team’s dietary and nutritional requirements including creating bespoke Gluten Free and Vegetarian meal options. The bar and restaurant staff have always been incredible friendly, and knowledgeable in relation to their menu.  

The hotel rooms are very clean, range in size and are fitted out with high standard furniture.

The hotel is located in quiet and friendly suburban area of Dublin next door to the Aviva Stadium. It’s a 5min walk to the Lansdowne Road train station which will bring you into the centre of Dublin within 10min. There is free and secure parking at the hotel. 

The Sandymount Hotel feels like home away from home and that’s a tribute to the friendliness of the staff, great food and facilities available (did I mention the log burning open fire in reception)! So if you’re planning on visiting Dublin for business or personally reasons, I would strongly recommend staying at The Sandymount Hotel.",5,2017,11,28
247,Disappointing Service,"We were having a couple of drinks in the bar and watching a match on TV. The bar was busy but certainly nowhere near full. I went up to order a hot whiskey, amongst other drinks, and was refused because “it would take too much time”. Now a hot whiskey is not a fancy cocktail that takes ages to make. Furthermore, this is Ireland, where it is a common drink in the cold weather. First time I’ve ever heard of a bar refuse to make this",2,2017,11,28
247,It was like staying with friends,"Handy location. So near the city centre and beside both Ballsbridge and Sandymount for restaurants and shopping. 15 mins walk from a healthy seafront walk along Joyce'strand.
Staff are very helpful and genuinely friendly. They go that extra mile...",5,2017,11,28
247,Review of hotel stay,"This was a family vacation. Overall, our stay was very good.  I think the front desk staff was friendly, but they certainly did not go above and beyond in any way,  The service was very basic. The were very transactional and down to business.  There was no friendly conversation or additional assistance.  We got exactly what we asked for but no sense that they went ""out of their way"" to find out if we wanted any extras.  ",4,2017,11,27
247,S.virtue,"Great hotel , Have been using this hotel this last few months , staff very friendly , couldn’t do enough for you .rooms are well maintained and clean .  Food is first class in  the restaurant and the same goes for the breakfasts.  Definitely recommend . ",5,2017,11,27
247,Excellent Hotel for the 3 Arena,"Excellent Hotel
Free Parking
Warm,Comfortable Room
Very Reasonably Priced
Location is within walking distance of the 3 Arena (15-20 min)
Really Friendly Staff
Highly Recommend
I will definitely stay again",5,2017,11,27
247,Sandymount,This is a fine hotel well located but a bit more attention to detail in the bedrooms would help. The towels in particular are not up to standard. Staff are excellent at reception and in the bar. We have stayed here previously and have always enjoyed the hotel.,4,2017,11,27
247,poor stay,"old dated place, its ok for meeting for a drink but not to stay. lacking the art of hospitality, food is very expensive for what it is and breakfast is a ripoff. room and bathroom are very basic. stairs and corridors, not recommended for family or relaxing holiday. internet is very very poor, it kept turning on and off. Not a four star for sure, 3 stars maybe with the price of 5.",2,2017,11,26
247,Value for money,"Clean room but small. In a quiet area, very close to the dart, Aviva stadium and the 3arena. Quiet difficult to get a taxi from. The free car park was a bonus. The room was comfortable. The staff were nice but not over helpful",3,2017,11,26
247,Awful,"See TripAdvisor review- place has spent loads of money buying fancy decor etc and totally neglected basic things like cleanliness and maintaining standards. Broken power socket, TV not tuned in, sink that didn't drain, Scruffy dog-eared hotel advertising on desk and chewing gum stuck to the outer windowsill. Disgusting and a rip off at ~£100 a night. Bathroom made up fancy but doesn't even have a paper holder just sits on sink edge. ",1,2017,11,26
247,Nice rooms but terrible food,"Restraunt food was shockingly bad for the price you’re paying..tastes awful. Shower was dirty, hadn’t been cleaned properly, used shower gel from last guest still in shower, shower floor black with dirt. ",3,2017,11,25
247,dissapointing," Great location and lovely staff but some of the rooms are not worth the high price. Its great when you get a good room but its luck of the draw as some of the rooms are depressing, small, stuffy. Restaurant and bar OK and food average. Bad smell of drains in room,  radiator turned off but room temperature too hot, the bathroom clean and new but the shower door fell off twice, very noisy in the corridor late at night.
",1,2017,11,25
247,Disappointing,"Arrived late off boat to stay one night before continuing my journey.

Welcome was fine from the reception staff pleasent and polite. 

Got to room, firstly poor design flaw is that the slot to put the card in to turn the light on and the main light switches are next to the bathroom door (across the room) so immediately in pitch black groping around trying to find the switch, eventually got my phone out and used a flashlight.

Design of the room is very trendy and modern and the shower room is very high-end looking however attention to detail is lacking for instance there is no toilet roll holder, the paper just sits on the edge of the sink!? Found this really funny for a 4star hotel.

The bedroom is nicely made up, although I find out straight away that 50% of the TV channels aren't tuned in properly and are fuzzy so give up on TV. I went to plug in my iPad charger next to the bed and discover the power socket is loose off the wall?! 

It's late so I use another socket and go to bed. One of the pillowcases is old and bobbly from being washed too much so I swap it over and go to sleep. 

In the morning I start to notice other little things, the kettle is full of old water still, the hotel notices on the desk are really very bent, dog-eared and tatty and then as I draw the curtains to leave there's a chewed up piece of gum on the outermost windowsill- just what you want to see first thing in the morning! 

Needless to say I mentioned some of this at checkout and was offered a complimentary breakfast which was buffet style good choice etc. Also the staff have all been pleasent.

However this hotel seems to have spent a lot on making the design trendy and modern and totally forgotten the small things and really need to look at sorting the basics out- cleanliness and upkeep!

For the 4star rating and costing me nearly £100 got one night (just for the room no breakfast rate) I won't be coming back and I'll make sure to not recommend it to friends and family is poor value for money. To be honest I feel a bit ripped off for paying as much as I did.",1,2017,11,24
247,November 2017,Sandymount Hotel is in a nice quiet city area but still well located to many amenities. Staff very friendly and welcoming. Good safe car parking. Room very well fitted out and comfortable. Nice area to go walking. ,5,2017,11,23
247,Excellent as always,3rd time staying here and this was just as good as before. We were upgraded to an executive room. Food was lovely and the staff were friendly. Will definitely come back. Only a 5 minute walk from the dart into the city. Great value for city centre hotel ,5,2017,11,22
247,Best Dublin hotel,"Overall great value for money. Staff wonderful, nothing too much trouble. I would personally not even consider any other hotel in Dublin. Food in bar excellent again with very good and quick service. Fun atmosphere.",5,2017,11,22
247,Another great weekend at the Sandymount,Had a great  Rugby weekend in Dublin. The Sandymount is in a great location for the Aviva Stadium and the Dart into central Dublin or further. Furthermore you are only a short walk to Sandymount village.,4,2017,11,21
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Friendly staff, clean modern rooms, close to Dart railway for city centre, quiet location, very good restaurant, next door to Aviva stadium, can be busy on rugby international days, 30 minute walk to city centre",4,2017,11,21
247,Many thanks,"Dear all,

many thanks to all of you for your assistance during our visit of Dublin. We really appreciated your guidance and advice espacially in regards to the ""hop on hop off bus"".

Best regards,
Rabea",4,2017,11,21
247,Unbeatable location for the rugby,For those lucky enough to have tickets for Ireland's rugby internationals and events at the Aviva this has to be the number one location - no more than a five minute walk to thy stadium. A little too far from Dublin's centre (40 minute walk or for speed a couple of stops on the Dart) but you can't have everything! As with everyone we met on our mini break the staff were very friendly and helpful.,4,2017,11,21
247,Sandymount Hotel - fab,"I stayed in the Sandymount hotel for a night back in October , shame it wasnt a longer stay .  It's one of the finest hotels i have had the pleasure to stay in. couldnt fault a thing.  the staff were at the top of their game, so helpful and pleaseant and it all seemed natural. the room was immaculate and designed to a very high standard. the breakfast was second to none.  couldnt recommend it any higher.  too many hotels in Ireland are letting standards drop across the board - the Sandymount  Hotel could teach them a thing or two",5,2017,11,21
247,Great location,"This was a great location for us, the staff were very attentive and looked after us. The hotel was clean and it was quiet for us. The breakfast was very good and fresh.
For our stay, it was the room that was the let down, the bed being small for us and some of the fixtures in the bathroom not as they should be. We'd still go back for the location and a nice pint!",4,2017,11,20
247,"Good value, quiet rooms and ideal location","Lovely, clean basic rooms, convenient to restaurants and not too far from City Centre - stayed here each time we need a hotel in Dublin. Always guaranteed a good night's sleep - rooms are always quiet.",5,2017,11,20
247,feedback,"Hotel service is excellent, very prompt and friendly, from reception to restaurant and room service. Food is great. Location makes it too crowded when there are games at the stadium therefore not good for business visits. Room was a bit small.",3,2017,11,20
247,Family stay,"Very nice well maintained hotel, great location, nice bar and food. However the classic room that I booked was extremely small plus as it was in the older section of the hotel you could hear the guests voices from the rooms directly around you.",5,2017,11,20
247,Perfect hotel for Aviva Stadium,"Stayed here while in Dublin to watch Ireland -v- Fiji at Aviva Stadium.  Can't believe how close we were to the Stadium.  It was perfect literally a minute or two walk and you are there.  Reception staff were friendly and check-in were effortless.  The rooms are quite modern and was really cosy which was welcome on a cold day.  Not a massive room but very comfortable.  Bathrooms modern and clean (only negative was the toilet brush holder looked a bit grim) and bathroom glasses weren't very clean but everything else was spotless.  Bed was a bit hard and creaky but again very clean.  I even pulled the bedside cabinet out as I had dropped something down the back and skirting board was spotless.

Hotel was very busy due to rugby and bar was bunged but we got a lovely comfy seat away from the hustle and bustle and it was very relaxed.  We were able to watch the outside beer tent/barbecue.

Breakfast was gorgeous, great choice and even my boiled eggs were perfect which isn't always the case in a buffet.  Staff in the restaurant were very friendly and cleared tables/topped up coffee quickly.  It was lovely that all the staff working about the restaurant wished us a nice day as we passed.  Definitely 5 Star staff.

Would definitely recommend this hotel especially if going to the Aviva although if staying for longer would prefer a more comfy bed!",4,2017,11,19
247,Gorgeous hotel,Great hotel in a brilliant location for Aviva Stadium and short walk to 3arena. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is clean and modern but also cosy. I would definitely stay again. Bar is fab and breakfast was great with loads of choice.,5,2017,11,19
247,Friendly staff and nice room,During my stay at the Sandymount I have only experienced a very helpfull staff that arranged everything I requested in a most hospitable way. Especially the way how support was arranged during my departure in the middle of the night.,4,2017,11,19
247,Friendly staff and well located,Warm welcome with helpful staff at front desk (Spanish lady in particular). Room quite (facing the back side/parking) and spacious with all what I needed. Acceptable breakfast and good food at restaurant.,4,2017,11,19
247,Great Dublin Hotel!,I came to Dublin for a conference at the RDS - this hotel was a quick 12 minute walk to the RDS and a 5 Minute Walk to the DART train.  The hotel is lovely and there are cafes and the seaside just 10 minutes walk away.  The staff are superb and the rooms are comfortable.

Sandymount is ideal for rugby in Aviva Stadium.  We have been using Sandymount for some time and we will certainly continue to do so.
The hotel is clean and kept in good decorative repair, and on the Saturday of our stay, which was extremely busy the staff calmly coped beautifully in every way.  Owner John is himself a very friendly man who makes you feel welcome, and his staff, some of whom have been with him for quite a time, were very efficient throughout our stay. ",5,2017,11,14

It is my first choice for any visit to Dublin and am very disappointed if there is no availability when I need it. The rooms are fantastic, I have stayed in many throughout the years and throughout the renovations process. The food is wonderful and the staff and service are unrivalled in my opinion. The location is ideal for all occasions of visiting Dublin.

247,Excellent ,We stayed here in June for a concert. Everything from staff to food to the room was brilliant. Couldn't fault a single thing. Location is perfect if you're heading to the Aviva. Not a far distance to city center (5 mins in a taxi). We enjoyed it so much we booked it again for November and looking forward to it. ,5,2017,10,29
247,We felt at home...,"We spend a very pleasant 3 nights at The Sandymount Hotel where we felt very much at home. The Sandymount is unique in that it provides many of the benefits of a large hotel while not compromising on personal service. The reception staff in particular were exceptional. Ann, who took charge of our booking, and Beatrice and colleagues who greeted us on arrival with friendliness and warmth set the tone for the rest of our stay.
The hotel is situated in a quiet location with easy access to the city centre. It has the added bonus of being within a 5 minute stroll of the charming village of Sandymount with its shops and restaurants. 
It is also the opportunity to take a walk upon the famous Sandymount Strand of James Joyce's Ulysses. 
",5,2017,10,29
247,Perfect hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for 1 night, we were attending a concert in the 3arena.

We were close to the Aviva stadium also, the hotel offers a free shuttle bus which brought us up to the arena for the concert so handy! The Sandymount is located very close to a nice village  Ringsend where the bars were busy with music, we enjoyed ate stay and will be back ",4,2017,10,28
247,Dublin Sandymount Hotel,This hotel had everything you could want.  We had an executive room which was spacious and comfortable.  The price was very reasonable.  The staff were actually fun.  We were next to Aviva Stadium and a short walk from the Dart station.  ,5,2017,10,27
247,Great hotel - highly recommend!,"Super cute, and VERY clean and new.  Easy walk into downtown.  I stayed here for a long business trip (14 nights) and couldn't be happier that I chose Sandymount!  Would definitely stay here again if I come back again for work. ",5,2017,10,27
247,A little Jem beside the Aviva,A welcoming place to stay in quiet surroundings. Staff are courteous and warm. The location is set in a quiet residential area within walking distance of many attractions and the Aviva stadium is on the doorstep.,4,2017,10,26
247,Very enjoyable break,"Staff can make or break your hotel stay, so for this hotel you need not worry the staff were great.The room very comfortable and so clean. Food lovely great choice.No complaints cannot wait for our next visit.",5,2017,10,26
247,Disappointing on too many points,"We did a lot of research in trying to find a place to stay in Dublin and were really looking forward to our stay at Sandymount. The hotel has a great location and is in a beautiful, leafy part of Dublin. It has a DART station in close proximity which is really handy in getting to the centre.
Sadly, we felt let down on many points during our stay. 
Our first disappointment was with the room, it was small and dark with a third bed despite only requiring a double. The single bed took up a lot of space in an already tight room! 
The safe was locked and we couldn’t access it and a window handle was broken off entirely. These issues were rectified quickly but it was a little frustrating that they hadn’t been addressed before our stay.
We were on the basement level and we had hardly any natural light in the room which made it feel really gloomy.
The towels and bedding felt very starchy which was really not very nice! 
We had an issue with our room not being made up but the receptionist was very apologetic and offered us a free breakfast which we appreciated. Glad that we hadn’t paid for the breakfast however! It was standard buffet style but in our opinion not worth the money. 
Great location but unfortunately let down by issues with the room.",2,2017,10,26
247,Family run with great service and standards,"Really felt and loved the friendly family run aspect of this hotel.
Standard and finish on the bedrooms and bathrooms was very good, little bit smaller, but everything well accounted for..
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend 😀",5,2017,10,25
247,Nice authentic hotel...,"Nice room, though ours was not so much spaceaous but they have some bigger ones as well. Clean, strong wi-fi, delicious breakfast.
Location is a bit far from city center.
Free parking is available in case you are by car as we were.",4,2017,10,25
247,Girls weekend,"Myself n my sister's enjoyed are stay with you, a well deserved break. We really enjoyed the friendly staff and it was central for shopping. Will have to plan are next break away very soon. I will keep us out for offers.
",5,2017,10,24
247,Our stay at Sandymount Hotel,The hotel itself is very well put together and feels modern and clean. The staff were very friendly and super helpful. Very close to the DART which is helpful for getting in and out of the city centre. We did struggle with the size of our room however. We were on the bottom floor of the hotel and our room was very small and rather dark. It was manageable for a night but we wouldn't have wanted to stay any longer.,4,2017,10,24
247,Weekend break,"Staff friendly. Nice food with good selection. Room not huge, but bed was comfy, with nice clean bathroom. Room had tea/coffee and room safe. Hotel in quiet location not far from dart station right next to Aviva. We felt hotel offered good value as well as free parking. Would stay again.",4,2017,10,24
247,Excellent hotel and Great place to stay,"We were in Dublin for a long weekend and we have chosen the Sandymount because of the good reputation in several rating sites. We were not disappointed. Friendly staff, Nice room and excellent restaurant made our long weekend a joyful event. Should we visit Dublin again in the near future, we Sure will choose the Sandymount again.",4,2017,10,23
247,Disappointing.,Disappointing experience. Hotel lacked atmosphere and bar staff not very engaging with customers. Rooms are quite small but cant fault the rest of the hotel facilities. Breakfast was very good and hotel was very clean.,2,2017,10,23
247,Best Hotel Stay on our trip to Europe,"Of the 7 places we stayed in Europe the SandyMount Hotel was the best !!! The staff, food , and rooms were all excellent. The staff recommended sight seeing tours , and assisted in arranging transportation . ",5,2017,10,23
247,An Enjoyable Stay,"I stayed at the Sandymount with my partner for 3 nights and enjoyed my stay immensely.

Our flight arrived at 9am, quite a bit before standard check in at 3pm, but the staff allowed us to drop off our bags. They also provided us with a map for Dublin and Sandymount Village with directions for the local buses and DART station.

After exploring central Dublin for a few hours, we returned to the hotel to check in. The room was not as small as I had expected to find, after reading other reviews. Size wise, it was on par with many hotels I've stayed in across Europe. The room was well equipped and included a hairdryer, safe, iron & ironing board and a kettle with a generous supply of tea and coffee. It was also, most importantly, spotlessly clean. 

The Breakfast selection was varied and included all the components for a full Irish (sausage, bacon, eggs, beans, black and white pudding!) as well as Continental breakfast options (pasties, yogurts, jams & compotes). The earlier you go the quieter it tended to be. Tea and coffee was provided by waiter service, which is fine, however during busy services it was a bit difficult to attract their attention. Maybe self-service hot drinks could be provided? 

The hotel itself, while not centrally located, is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest DART station at Lansdowne Road. It only takes roughly 7 minutes to reach Pearse station and costs €3.95 for a return ticket. From the airport, we took the airlink coach towards Killiney (703) and took it to the Ballsbridge Hotel stop, where it's a 15-20 minute walk to the Sandymount Hotel. Alternatively, you can take the 702 to Ballsbridge Hotel also. A single cost us €8 each and you can buy returns for €13. 

If in Dublin again, I would definitely consider another stay at the Sandymount. Dublin hotel prices can be very expensive (I've heard they're the second most expensive in Europe), however I found the Sandymount to be of good value for Dublin!",5,2017,10,23
247,"Quiet Location, Clean Hotel, Friendly Staff","It's a good location away from the center of the city.  If you are keen on walking, this is a hotel for you.  Walking distance to it is about 20-25 minutes.  However, there are pubs and stores nearby in Sandymount and Ballsbridge.  It's clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Free WiFi as well!",4,2017,10,23
247,"The convenience to Dart, Aviva Stadium, bus route etc is super","Myself & my sister stayed in the Sandymount Hotel, for 3 nights recently. We were celebrating her 70th birthday.  On arrival to the room, there was a nice bottle of wine awaiting us - nice start to the weekend. Staff at reception were so friendly & helpful, especially Beatrice that was not only professional, but also lovely to be able to interact with an Irish person. I have been living in Sweden, for 29 yrs, and it is always a treat to meet Irish staff. Not often the case these days, in Ireland. She found time to chat, and be personal, despite the quite hetic pace of guests coming & going, non stop. 
 
During our stay, the tropical storm Ophelia hit Dublin.  At the time we didnt know what to expect, but we could see that the staff, were taking extra procausions in preparation - which makes us feel secure. Moving guests from top floor to ground floor, taking down flags, removing lose objects outdoors etc. 
 
So we weathered the storm by looking out the big windows, feeling perfectly safe indoors, along with the burning open fire in the beautiful old fireplace. An very Irish feeling of comfort. Not to be found in Sweden. 
 
The breakfasts were just wonderful - everything available to the tummy´s delight. We even had some meals in the bar, and they too were delicious. 
 
Having a shuttle service to drop us to the airport coach in Ballsbridge was just great. Why pay 30 euros for a taxi to the airport, when the coach service for 8 euros is excellent. 
 
In my opinon the best attraction of this hotel is having the sea so close by. In just 10 mins away, the Sandymount beach can be found, and it is just mindblowing, to walk along the sand or the path for miles & miles. 
 
There is a cute little village closeby too. (Sandymount). Some wonderful restaurants. 
 
The convenience to Dart, Aviva Stadium,  etc is super.
 
We will be back, giving all these reasons,  and more. The package deal price we were given was just ""super value"". Thanks you Sandymount & Beatrice.

247,A good hotel to stay in Dublin 4,"As long term guest in Sandymount hotel (9 months) i can highly recommend receptionist Sanja Mijalkovic.

247,An excellent hotel,"I have been staying in Dublin for about 30 years and this is the best hotel I have stayed in. Everything was excellent.

247,"Nice hotel, friendly staff.","Though the hotel is a little bit out, it's easyily accessible via the dart. It's right next to the Aviva stadium. Our room was lovely and the receptionist was super friendly and welcoming. 
We were stuck in Dublin a second night due to the storm and decided to stay here again as we enjoyed the first night.
We got dinner in the hotel which we would have skipped if we knew we were going to be rushed out of there. There was one waitress that was not very friendly or helpful. Besides that everything was very nice.",4,2017,10,18

247,Love Sandymount Hotel!!,"On a recent visits to Dublin I decided to spend the night in Sandymount. I found this hotel online and was so pleased with it I would surely recommend it / stay there again on my next trip.
Despite being a hotel it has a cosy feel to it that sometimes is lost with standard hotel chains. Great hospitality, beautiful rooms nicely decorated, besides having all mod and cons. As I had a rental car their private car park was definitely a plus for me. It is also very close to the DART train that takes one into Dublin (both Sandymount and Lansdowne Rd station will do) at the Aviva stadium.
Tops for me, well done!",5,2017,10,14
247,Short stay in Dublin,"A great place to stay for a few days in Dublin that is out of the main center, but still very accessible to the center by bus, train or own vehicle. Had a very good buffet breakfast.
Quiet residential area, although close to rugby/ Football stadium, so wouldn't be so quiet then, but instead a handy place to stay.",5,2017,10,13
247,As delightful as always,"Congratulations to The Sandymount for winning Europe’s Leading Green Hotel 2017.   Brilliant accolade and so well deserved.  They have made many changes to upgrade the hotel throughout and it works so well.  

A great team make this hotel a great place to stay if you are visiting Dublin.   Not in the city centre but with the AVIVA within 5 minutes walk and the Dart train to take you to the city centre - it is a perfect spot.  

Can't wait to return again next year. :-)",5,2017,10,12
247,Great hotel great location,We have a very enjoyable stay at this hotel and are booked to stay again early next year. Rooms clean and everything you need on hand. Easy to get to. Very quiet. Easy access to the city as well. Would recommend it ,4,2017,10,12
247,"Great place to stay, just outside the city but still easy access to City Centre","We stayed here twice during our visit to Ireland.  Staff were always friendly and helpful.
Our first room was a good size, double bed and a single in the room, our second room was at the front of the hotel, a larger room again with 2 beds it was much brighter but the bathroom was tiny!!
Buffet breakfast each morning was handy, we had dinner at the bar one night too which wasn't too bad.
There are some local shops / cafes in walking distance, and the train is a few mins walk away too, making access to the city very easy - don't bother with the hop on / hop off bus, it was slow and a waste of money.
Car parking on site also very handy for when we had a rental car.
We'd definitely stay here again!",4,2017,10,12
247,A great stay by any standard!,"The staff was courteous and helpful, the room was clean and comfortable, and the service at the bar, restaurant, and room was fantastic!

247,Mukava palvelu ja uusittu huone - Nice staff and newly renowated room,"Matkustimme lokakuun alussa Dubliniin ja majoituimme Sandymount Hotellissa kolme päivää.

Olimme autolla liikkeellä joten hotellin sijainti kaupungin laidalla sekä ilmainen pysäköintialue miellyttivät. 

Henkilökunta oli mukavaa ja huomioivat reilun vuoden ikäistä poikaamme ihanasti. 

Huone oli tilava ja hiljattain remontoitu, tosin käytävän äänet kantautuivat sisään. 
Aamiainen oli runsas ja syötävää löytyi myös pojallemme, tuoreita vihanneksia olisimme tosin toivoneet.

We travelled to Dublin at the beginning of the october and stayed at the Sandymount Hotel for three days.

We were traveling by car, so location at the edge of the city and free parking area pleased us.

Staff was really nice and paid many attentions to our one year old son.

Room was roomy and newly renowated, unfortunately noises from corridor heard clearly to room.
Breakfast was good and there was plenty to eat for our son also, but we were looking for fresh vegetables.",4,2017,10,10
247,Very comfortable end to our trip,"We'd been travelling for over 2 weeks in a couple of other countries and staying in good Airbnb accommodation so this was a bit of luxury before our long flight back to Australia.
Courteous staff (who let us into our room early), great food in the bar and only a short walk to the DART.
We stayed in a family room (115) at the rear of the building and it was very quiet.
Highly recommended.",4,2017,10,10
247,Fantastic Stay,"Fabulous hotel, the room was stunning, exceptionally clean and had great space. The staff were extremely friendly and the breakfast was fantastic, the girl on reception at check in was very welcoming, the hotel is also in a great location ",5,2017,10,10
247,Great hotel if you're there for a sporting event at Aviva Stadium.  Otherwise a terrible location.,"Positives: Clean, great staff, good location if you're going to Aviva Stadium.
Negatives: Not a good location at all if you are in Dublin to see other sites than the stadium.  
Getting there from the airport involves a 30 minute bus ride plus a 10 minute walk.  Not great if it's raining.  We got lost on the walk which for us turned into 20 minutes dragging suitcases.  A nice man redirected us to the hotel.
It's also quite a hike to the sites downtown...Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, O'Connell Street etc.  We walked downtown from the hotel but had to get a taxi back.  Too far to walk at night after walking all day.
Positive: Pizza in the pub/restaurant was the best pizza I have ever eaten in my life!",4,2017,10,10
247,2 night stay,Convenient to Aviva Stadium and Landsdown Road Dart station for easy access to Dublin city centre. Also Dart runs along coast from Howth to Bray. Food is excellent and goid breakfast. Rooms great as well.,5,2017,10,10
247,had an issue with the a few hotel staff....................................,"Lovely looking hotel, very clean, room are very nice... had a staff member threaten not to let us stay in the hotel for laughing and chatting out the front of the hotel in a marquee provided for by the hotel for drinking outside... it was match night in the aviva and the whole area was in party mode... but the hotel was like it was bingo night.. 😪😪😪",3,2017,10,09
247,Business Trip to Aviva,I arrived as stated with hotel and my room was ready. Excellent facilities and very clean. I was attending the Ire game at the aviva so I literally checked in and went to the aviva. Once this was finished I returned to hotel and I was hungry and realized when I looked at book in room that room service was over quite early. Otherwise I cannot complain about he hotel or staff all friendly and quick to serve you. ,5,2017,10,09
247,A pleasant stay,Our stay was a stopover for an early ferry the following morning. Bar food very nice. Staff throughout the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We took the train in to Dublin which was the best option and very easy.  ,4,2017,10,09
247,Great place!,"This hotel was are best stay! We left it as our last stop and spent 2 nights here. We loved it, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. The location was not hard to find and getting into the city was super easy, the dash (train) is a 5 minute walk, located right next to the aviva stadium, the train takes less than 10min to reach the city. It was less than 4 euros per person for a round trip (so don’t lose your ticket). The airport was not far either we had a car rental (hotel has private parking lot on premises) in it took us about 20 min because of traffic on a Saturday. Overall, you can’t go wrong staying here, staff is very nice and helpful, the rooms are spacious and clean. The food at the bar was really good and they have pizza delivery to your room for after hours. ",5,2017,10,09
247,Excellent,"Great Hotel, very clean and the restaurant is spectacular!
I have some alergies so it's usually hard for me to find something in a restaurant. But the restaurant in the Hotel was incredible! Best I've eaten in years!",5,2017,10,09
247,Overnight stay ,"The Hotel was lovely. A little pricey for my liking,  staff were lovely and friendly  and helpful they couldn't help us enough,Rooms were lovely  and clean only let down was the breakfast  total disappointment .",4,2017,10,08
247,Sandy,Loved the hotel and staff.  Food just ok and a little pricier than I expected.  Irish breakfast needs a lot of work to come up to expectations of what I would want and have received at most places I have stayed in Ireland.  This was my 4th visit in two years.  For reference have someone go to Aspect hotel in Limerick as they have the best Irish breakfast I have had.  Their scones are to die for.,4,2017,10,07
247,Great location,"I've been to the hotel on two occasions and have recommended it to family. Great location right by the Aviva stadium - walking distance to the 3arena and Bord Gais theatre too. Right next to the DART (three stops to the city centre). Clean, modern decor, lovely breakfast. Parking. Just check whether there's a match on at the Aviva - It can get very busy, so that might affect your travel arrangements.",5,2017,10,06
247,Pluses and Minuses,"Positives include very helpful and attentive staff, excellent food in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner, and very clean. Also close to a nice walk along the River Dodder. Minuses for us - very small rooms not very well designed to put your stuff anywhere (ie closet filled with safe, ironing board, iron, pillows, blankets), walls very thin and thus noisy, location not convenient to city center without using cab or transport. Even the town center with a few shops is a 15 minute walk.",3,2017,10,04
247,grannies 80th surprise party,"great crack friendly staff attention to detail fresh local irish produce 
great value for money good central location dart & buses within 2 mins walking distance 
highly recommend whether business pleasure or other the sandymount is the place to stay
all staff from reception to bar to breakfast to housekeepimg were excellent",5,2017,10,04
247,Thank you for a lovely experience!,Wonderful attentive service and friendly staff. Loved that Sandymount is family owned and operated. We were astounded that the housekeeper found clothing we left in the room and mailed it back to us (in NY)...NO CHARGE!!! Still can't believe I have my favorite slacks back!!,5,2017,10,03
247,Title,"The hotel is excellent, perfect location for RDS and easy access to public transport. Staff are very helpful and provide lots of information on the locality and sites to see. I shall return when the occasion arises.",5,2017,10,03
247,WOW! Fantastic Hotel! Ideally Situated!,"This was our first trip to Dublin and I booked it to celebrate my partners birthday! I let the hotel we may be arriving early and they did everything possible to accommodate us.  When we arrived we had a bottle of wine waiting for us and some choccies and the room was lovely. We had a great weekend, and the staff were very  helpful with every request even bringing fresh milk to our room so we could have a nice cup of tea in the mornings.  The hotel is very well situated, only 15 minute taxi drive into Dublin. There are also two lovely little villages close by, the village of Ballsbridge which had a very good Indian called The Jewel in the Crown. There are a few other nice eateries around. Also the village of Sandymount has a few nice eateries and is located close to the beach, so you can go for a nice morning stroll.  All in all this hotel has lots to offer. As well as its own restaurant and bar. There is also car parking on site.  When we go back to Dublin we will most definitely booking in here again! :) First Class!",5,2017,10,02
247,Great Reunion - highly recommended for events,"Just enjoyed a reunion here over the weekend, and have to say the cooperation, service and efficiency was outstanding.  From discussions beforehand, to helping with the smooth running of the evening, good food, and organising taxis, the staff were friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  If you have an event, and you're looking for a smart and comfortable Dublin Hotel, I would recommend Sandymount Hotel to anyone.",5,2017,10,02
247,Overnight stay at sandymount hotel,"Rooms are not soundproof, could hear everything upstairs !!! People. Snoring and walking around all night, got very little sleep... Food and service was good. Room was clean and comfortable and hotel is in a nice location.",3,2017,10,02
247,Comfy and cosy,Quiet and peaceful location in near proximity of the city center. You can feel the atmosphere of the old buildings furnished with modern amenities. Stay at the end of the corridor was most convenient as was traveling in business and valued good sleep.,4,2017,10,02
247,convienence to Ballsbridge area,I chose this hotel to be near the Ballsbridge area as we were meeting my son that evening. We booked a triple room that was clean and spacious. It was quiet during the night. There is free parking at the hotel for guests.  We were able to walk to the restaurant in Ballsbridge and walk back to hotel after a drink in the pub. The next morning we walked to Roly's for breakfast. The staff at reception were very helpful when I had car difficulties and they gave me a map to get to nearest petrol station.,4,2017,10,01
247,Aviva Stadium/Dublin Hotel,The location of the hotel was great. It was by Aviva stadium and not too far from downtown. You could take the train or have a short cab ride to get most places. The hotel room was a decent size. It was clean and neat. The staff was helpful in calling cabs and telling us tourist attractions that we should go visit. They helped us use the computer to book some of them. The only problem we had was the person at the front desk made a big deal of when we wanted to check out an hour later. They said they really needed the room and were very insistent that we had to check out on time. We asked later and another staff member said it was no problem at all.,4,2017,09,30
247,"Friendly staff, super hotel with comfort in a great location","The hotel is very friendly with well appointed, clean and comfortable rooms. Breakfast is generous with lots of choice.Located close to the rail station and nearby restaurants and bars in Ballsbridge just a short walk away.",5,2017,09,29
247,Sandymount at Aviva Stadium,"This hotel proved to be an excellent choice. The room was large and well equipped and extremely clean. The staff here was very friendly, knowledgable and helpful. Sandymount is conveniently located, very close to DART. ",5,2017,09,29
247,First time staying in Dublin,Nice room with large updated bath. Large hotel so potentially crowded when there are games at the stadium. Good location for getting to know neighborhoods outside of the city center but a bit of a cab ride if you want to be downtown. The food was very good. ,4,2017,09,28
247,Posh property in Dublin -- would definitely return!,"The lovely, family-owned Sandymount Hotel, just a quick drive or train ride on the DART from Dublin’s City Center, was the perfect place to rest our heads during the first two nights of our trip. Weary from traveling overnight, we arrived at the Sandymount bright and early, expecting to drop our bags and head into town, but lucky for us, our room was ready hours early! We were able to squeeze in a quick nap (much-needed!) prior to exploring Dublin. We stayed in a super comfortable executive room and enjoyed our stay at this gem of a hotel. My favorite part about staying at the Sandymount was exploring the surrounding neighborhood — the property is located in one of Dublin’s posh little residential towns, so we had a blast wandering the streets and admiring the unique architecture of homes in the area. Thanks for an amazing stay!",5,2017,09,28
247,good stay in Dublin,We have had a good experience in Dublin and in this hotel.  The only things I didn't like  were The Wi-fi signal that was very poor in our room and the elevator A that has been out of service for two days.,4,2017,09,28
247,UK holiday,"Close to trains and hop on hop off bus stop.
Ten minute walk to Sandymount Village.
Approximately 30 pounds to get a cab from airport to the hotel.
Would be good if the hotel did a shuttle bus service.",4,2017,09,28
247,Fabulous Hotel,"We booked three nights at the Sandymount during a touring holiday of Ireland. It was proving difficult to find a good quality hotel close to the city centre with parking, for a reasonable price - and this one appeared to tick all the boxes. Very happy to report that it lived up to all expectations. Our triple room was a great size, with quality bed linen and towels, room and bathroom modern and spotlessly clean, and the price included full breakfast. The bar area was very nice, with plenty of comfy sofas in lots of little cosy corners, and the friendly and helpful staff made for a very friendly, warm and relaxed atmosphere throughout the entire hotel. 

The hotel is a short walk from the Aviva Stadium so would make it a perfect choice for anyone attending an event, yet it is tucked away in a quiet street. There are several restaurants nearby and the hotel serves meals and bar snacks also. Getting into the city centre is extremely quick and easy - there is a DART station a 5-10 minute walk away and this takes you directly into the city (a 5-10 minute journey).

I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again; in fact it would be the first one on my list for next time!",5,2017,09,28
247,Return trip - excellent hotel,"Returned back to The Sandymount Hotel for short visit and once again was not disappointed.  Will only ever stay here when in Dublin.  The fact you feel like you are in Ireland instead of staying in hotels where you could be anywhere in the world is what I like best - and believe me I have stayed in many many hotels for work.  From the time I make my initial enquiry to the time I order my first pint of Guinness in the lovely homely bar nothing is too much trouble.  Toni in reservations department gets the mix of being extremely efficient yet extremely friendly just perfect!  She makes every effort to ensure I am made feel like I am not just one of many many guests she must deal with on a daily basis and it is always a pleasure to speak with her.  The food in hotel is really super and is far superior to any 'hotel food' I have eaten.  My only slight issue would be some of the bar staff seemed a bit disinterested and would be lovely if they engaged a bit more with guests but again this is a minor training issue to get to 4 star standard and will not deter me from staying again.  My room was excellent and the shower was very powerful and very clean, a great night sleep was had.  I look forward to my return!",4,2017,09,27
247,Great place to stay!,Great place to stay for the Irish Greyhound Derby at Shelbourne Park. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Food at Line Out Bar was great. Perfect location for those visiting Aviva Stadium or Shelbourne Park.,5,2017,09,27
247,The great staff made the difference for our stay in this comfortable and beautiful old hotel.,Small hotel near the Aviva Stadium. Airbus made for an easy transfer from the airport. Front desk staff were extremely helpful with finding our way around Dublin. The Sandymount is a convenient place from which to explore Dublin on the Hop On Hop Off Bus. The hotel staff even offered to drive us to the nearest bus stop. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was terrific even including freshly made fruit smoothies.,4,2017,09,27
247,Small room,"Hotel is nice, friendly staff, but the room was a let down, (it's clean with nice decor) BUT tiny room and a double bed. Draws from dressing table barley open because the bed is in the way. For a five day stay I would prefer something where you can walk around the bed. ",3,2017,09,27
247,Lovely hotel,"We had a lovely time staying in the hotel, the staff were friendly and the food was excellent. Clean room but I would have liked to have some biscuits with our coffee in a room. Very good location within a walking distance to the train station and the Sandymount Village.",4,2017,09,27
247,GREAT HOTEL GREAT LOCATION,We stayed 2 nights room was big and spotless. A small point-at £190 per night a small bottle of water would be a great touch. However Breakfast great and reception staff fantastic and friendly. Free parking and 5 min walk to get train into city centre or to get hop on and hop off bus tour. Would stay here again. Thanks,5,2017,09,26
247,Strange Layout But Good Room,"The hallways were cut up, with stairs up and down, and strange turns for no apparent reason.  They sent my son and his wife up and down elevator and multiple stairs for him to arrive Bach where we started half a floor up.

The rooms were nice, and the bed was not bad.  The location was away from the noise of the city but close to the busses.

The breakfast was tasty.  It had NO vending machines so we had to go to the bar for water and ice.",4,2017,09,26
247,Clean and Modern Room,Clean but hallways were narrow and the hotel was chopped up with random stairs that couldn't be avoided even when using the elevator. This was difficult to manage with multiple suitcases. The room was modern and the shelves were helpful. They called a taxi for us and checkout was easy.,4,2017,09,26
247,delightful dublin welcome,Great location walking distance from RDS and Sandymount village and beach. easily accessible by public transport. Staff very professional yet friendly and warm. Great food. Room spacious and clean. Free parking,5,2017,09,25
247,Enjoyable and convenient,"A lovely hotel and very conveniently located near good transport links. Was disappointed to hear apart from Pizzas no food would be available after 9.30pm but was lucky to make it back out in time. Food was good but came out on a wooden serving board, why can't we have out food on a plate? ",4,2017,09,25
247,Unsafe and unprofessional,"On arrival, no reservation could be found for us so it took a while to sort that out. On the 3rd day, someone entered our room while we were in bed. The front desk gave a room key to a newly arrived client even if we hadn’t checked out and were only due to leave the next day. 
Very embarrassing and unsettling. And what if it had happened while we were absent and they stole our belongings? We couldn't use the room safe to safeguard the critical things because it was locked and even if we requested from the front desk that someone come to unlock it, no one ever came. I wrote an email about this but never got a response. 
Unsafe and unprofessional.",1,2017,09,25
247,Lovely Hotel,"Hotel is verymodern, extremely clean.  We  stayed in a classic double room. Bed very comfortable, Complimentary toiletries, tea and coffee making facilities and hairdryer all supplied.  Although the hotel was very busy there was no noise disturbance.  Staff were extremely polite and friendly.  We were on half board basis. Breakfast was very good with a good selection to cover all tastes from a full cooked breakfast, cereals, pastries etc.  Has a lovely outside beer garden.  Bar food is also available and prices are good.  It is right next to the Aviva stadium and I would imagine if a game is on the bar would get very busy.  Its 12 euro up to Temple Bar in a taxi where there are a good selection of bars and restaurants to choose from. I would recommend this hotel and will visit it again on my next return to Dublin.",4,2017,09,25
247,Clean and Efficient,"Nice room, Nice staff, Good location.
Lots of well heeled American coach party guests when we stayed.
Only negative is that it is slightly soul-less.
We had an issue with the room (bathroom leak) which was dealt with quickly and efficiently (they moved our room).
Overall very good.",4,2017,09,25
247,exccellent stay,"This september we stayed at Sandymount Hotel a second time. We felt at home and everybody made our stay a special one! Accomodation was very good, breakfast and food in the Line Out Bar was excellent. Friendly and helpfull staff everywhere.",5,2017,09,24
247,a quiet hotel,"Located outside the city centre, this cosy hotel provides excellent quality of sleep. It is important because Dublin is a jolly city. My work was in the Dublin Convention Centre, far away from the hotel (35 min by feet). However, when I found the DART train nearby arriving every 15 minutes in both direction with 5 minutes to the city centre, I found the location of the hotel convenient. Instead the city centre, a sea shore is in 15 minutes by feet with great possibility for jogging and even birdwatching.
A service was good. When small problem took place with the plumbery in the room, I was moved to the other room in one hour. A breakfast was also good with a presence of healthy food as well as traditional black and white puddings.       ",4,2017,09,24
247,Great hotel,Property is in a grat location. Very close to the dark. Great for parking. Lovely breakfast and room service. Have stayed here many times and have never had any complaints. Good hotel and value for money. ,5,2017,09,24
247,Go ahead vacations,Found the room not appropriate for an older couple. Small bathroom single beds and small. Found was great for breakfast. Somewhat confusing to navigate hotel. Grounds well taken care of and staff pleasant. ,3,2017,09,24
247,Underated Hotel,Stay here for two days to go to a concert and have a look round Ireland. The hotel is defintly underated as it has everything you need and the staff do more then extra. One member of the hotel staff ( The hotel driver) Dave was brilliant if you wanted him to drop you off just down the road he would do it and tell you places to go and recommend places. He defintly made my stay there easier. The hotel food and drinks were defiantly nice and had a wide range I would recommend getting yourself s full Irish. The hotel is in a good location it's safe and very clean. One last thing go Guinness factory on the tour bus and on the way get your free pint at the Vat Bar. 😀,5,2017,09,24
247,fly drive,"this was our last stay in Ireland and we were a bit disappointed with the room ,but the hotel itself is nice.
the travelling to the city centre is good.
the rooms are too small there is nowhere to put a few suitcases and reach for the save",3,2017,09,24
247,Great Service,Great location to activities.  The only issue was how small the room was. There was hardly any room to move inside the room.  The restroom was newly renovated and was the best feature of the room.  Other then that.  Great hotel! !,5,2017,09,23
247,Great hotel,"What a superb hotel. The welcome on arrival was lovely, we were immediately made to feel at home. The room we were allocated was extremely comfortable and well equipped. Breakfast was good with a fine selection of hot and cold food. The location for Lansdowne Road (Aviva Stadium) is brilliant and the Dart station is within 2 minutes walk; great for a trip into central Dublin.",5,2017,09,23
247,Good Location!cl,"Clean, friendly staff, good service! Always very helpfull.
Only 5 Minutes till Train-Station and to Sandymount Downtown.
We enjoy the stay hier in the Sandymount Hotel and when we come back, so we want to stay also here!",4,2017,09,23
247,Fantastic Experience!!,"Stayed at the Sandymount Hotel in August for 4 days, wonderful Hotel.  The staff very friendly and helpful.  Beatrice was great helped my sister and I with everything. Thank you for an Awesome time in Dublin!  Room was very comfortable! We slept late first morning, so thought we missed breakfast.  Went to the Bar upstairs and had the very best French Toast. Also, the Soups there are fantastic.  Great Chef!!!!! When we come to Dublin again,  We will stay at the Sandymount Hotel!!  Also nice walk to the Beach!",5,2017,09,22
247,Superb Hotel and location,"We had a family stay here at the beginning of September to celebrate my husband's birthday. The Reception team were so friendly, welcoming and helpful and on arrival in our room sent half bottle of wine!!  We took 3 rooms which were bright, spacious and very comfortable.  Walking distance to Lansdowne Road and the delightful Sandymount village with lovely pubs and restaurants. Ample free parking also a bonus so close to the City.",5,2017,09,22
247,Sandymount a winner,Great location and friendly and efficient service. Really good breakfast. Can walk into the City or take the train from nearby station. Room was generous clean and comfortable. The delightful Sandymount Village with shops and pub is only a 5 minute walk.,5,2017,09,21
247,Boutique style City hotel in City village!,"A really fab hotel, very slick but also homely feel. Really comfortable beds and a great room overall. Had a great stay and would definitely return. The location is amazing- walking distance to Aviva, Sandymount village and you're so close to town but you feel like your in a boutique hotel in a quaint village!",5,2017,09,20
247,A wonderful find in a great location.,This was a great hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed the facilities and the staff could not do enough for us. Highly recommended. The quality of food was excellent and the rooms were extremely comfortable. We would stay here again without hesitation.,5,2017,09,19
247,Very Pleasant,The Sandymount Hotel is in a quiet residential area but not too long a walk to the DART which zips you into city center. It is one of the quietest hotels I have been in for a long time and that's a treat after a long day of sightseeing. Front reception are extremely helpful with directions and other inquiries. Really appreciated them. Room was ample size and impeccably clean as was the entire hotel. Daily breakfast offered a nice selection of hot and cold options. Two evenings we ate in the pub and it was fantastic. We were very pleased with the whole experience and highly recommend the Sandymount.,5,2017,09,19
247,Excellent,"Contacted us direct to save money by booking direct with them as we stayed there last year.  No charge for last year when friends had to cancel last minute.  they sent me my phone charger back as I left it plugged in.  Food , bar and rooms all of high standard and staff too.",5,2017,09,19
247,Great hotel,"amazing location, near to train station. room was big and beds are highly comfortable. food was delicious, service slightly slow.hotel is maintained well clean. there are many options for complementary breakfast. do visit.",5,2017,09,19
247,Three nights in Dublin,"A great hotel for a short break, it's outside the city centre so the surrounding area is a bit quieter.  There are good public transport links nearby and it's handy for one of the city tour open-topped bus routes. Also great hotel car parking to abandon your own vehicle in for the duration of your stay.",4,2017,09,18
247,"Great Service, Not So Great Location","Stayed here for six nights - bed was comfortable, shower was fine, and the mirror didn't fog which was neat.  The service was great and the employees were very nice.  Anytime I had a question someone was able to help me out with no issues.  The hotel even had a BBQ for the soccer match that was being held at the stadium down the street.  Unfortunately, the hotel is in a residential area, so that stadium is the only thing close.  If you are ever attending an event at Aviva Stadium, this is the hotel for you.  If you are trying to see Dublin, probably not.  While the hotel is close to a DART station, the DART in Dublin is pretty bad, and you are either in for a 15-20 minute walk wherever you want to go, or you will have to hail a taxi.  The hotel also has a 3pm check-in time, which seems very late.  Overall, it was a fine hotel, but its distance from the city would keep me from staying there again.",4,2017,09,18
247,Another Great Visit,"Recently spent a week at the Sandymount Hotel in Dublin where we were welcomed like family by Beatrice and Rose.  The location is incredibly convenient to major roads and to the Dart and many fine restaurants are within walking distance.  Additionally, the food service in the hotel - both in the restaurant and in the bar - have improved dramatically and are worth a visit on their own. When I'm in Dublin in the future, I won't hesitate to return to the Sandymount where they go out of their way to make you feel special.",5,2017,09,18
247,Overnight stay,"Hotel in a good position for the ferry to UK and parking was easy. Food in bar of a high standard service a little slow but it was busy. Room very comfortable, clean and quiet. Staff helpful & friendly",4,2017,09,16
247,Bike tour,"Hotel was ideal for location with secure parking. Close to the train system which can take you to the main center in 5mins. Close to the port. For all rugby fans ideal place for the stadium. Didn't have the chance to experience the breakfast as it was an early check out, but complimentary coffee was well received.",5,2017,09,13
247,HIGHLY RECOMMEND," On our arrival we were greated by the the lovely Beatrice who welcomed us  back - she is definitely the JEWEL OF THE SANDYMOUNT  .  helpful , courteous and professional at all times   We felt like coming home !!  Our room was modern with excellent facilities   breakfast was a delight with attentive service  .  We would also like to say a special thank you also to Iamina who was looking after our reservation .. We would highly reccommend the Sandymount Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin - situated in a lovely area .   We would like to recommend Beatrice for Employee of the year  ""Warmth beyond the smile ""   . Looking forward to our return visit in December . ",5,2017,09,12
247,Excellent hotel to stay in Dublin,"The service of the hotel was perfect. Clear communication with hotel staff before arrival, so late arrival wasn't a problem. Room was clean and ok for this price categorie. The location of the hotel is realy close to the stadium but also the way to Dublin downtown is also short.",5,2017,09,12
247,Disappointing,"No residents Bar after 2330, had to go into town to get a drink after this time, otherwise the Hotel was fine. Very disappointing to have to do this as we would have been more than happy to stay where we were.",3,2017,09,12
247,BBQ DELIGHT,"Catching up with some friends for the weekend we decided to have a BBQ so we could mingle, I had seen it advertised, so we decided to give it a try, thankfully the weather held up and we had a great night, the garden had under gone a make over, it looked fab with all the lovely flowers, it was nice to be able to relax in the garden in the city after a busy day, the food was delicious. we meet a young lady with a passion for food Roisin who is off to collage to qualify, best of luck Roisin...We will be back...",5,2017,09,10
247,Gloomy room,"The hotel is well situated, near to the stadium and fairly handy for the Dublin docks if you are traveling to or from Dublin on the ferry - BUT... Avoid room 101 on the lower ground floor - its right next to the lift and is very gloomy.",2,2017,09,10
247,Nice relaxed stay,"I was not sure about this hotel initially as I arrived during a busy time when a large group was checking. However, I was proven wrong! This is a nice, friendly hotel which is well located within walking distance to the DART and Bus or even the city if you are a bit more ambitious. The rooms are a bit small and there is no A/C but the staff were accommodating and helpful and brought us a fan. We were also welcomed with a bottle of wine and a nice welcome note from the management as it was a special occasion for us. I would stay here again. It is reasonably priced and the staff are helpful.",4,2017,09,09
247,Wonderful hotel near the rugby stadium,"My wife and I spent our last night in Ireland at the Sandymount Hotel.  The hotel was very comfortable, had a nice bar and was only about thirty minutes to the airport.  From the hotel, we easily walked to the very pleasant and quaint Sandymount village.  We booked through Booking.com and the prices were very reasonable.",4,2017,09,09
247,Anniversary break,"Spotless room, beautiful surroundings and a warm welcome on arrival, very close to town & DART. Great value for money  & excellent selection of food & services available. Have re-booked for another stay in November! ",5,2017,09,09
247,Pre-post tour stay ,"My sister and I stayed at this hotel for a few days before our scheduled YMT tour of Ireland. 
Reception was great, (Beatrice); staff extremely courteous & helpful; our room was delightful- comfy beds; Food in bar and restaurant great; location slightly out of mainstream town perfect for quiet relaxation and sleep, (jet lag); Very easy access to taxi or transport to town or airport. Can be arranged by reception. Loved our stay! Plan on staying again, and have recommended a stay with friends going on their tour!",5,2017,09,09
247,Sandymount Hotel,"I really mean that nothing was too much to ask of the staff at this hotel . They  were efficient but genuinely caring with a client in distress over the loss of a passport and  most accommodating when ferry times meant earlier than usual breakfast was required.  Good breakfast and plenty of choices from an imaginative nenu at other meals.  Accommodation is tasteful,clean and comfortable.  Quiet location all the time Ivwas there and its not over far from the city centre. Would recommend with confidence.",5,2017,09,08
247,Best hotel ever,"Stay  in many different hotels quite a lot . But I have never come across any hotel like the sandy mount hotel. It is top class in every way. The staff could not do enough for us they were so friendly. Every corner in the bar the restraunt  the bedrooms  corridors all over were spotless clean. Food was to die for. I will definitely  be returning in the near future
",5,2017,09,07
247,TD,"Very good hotel and great breakfast. Hotel is not only very convenient to the trains, but is clean comfortable and has friendly and helpful staff. We also had a good sleep. This was our second stay and we intend to stay again.",5,2017,09,07
247,"Fundamentally sound hotel, experienced ruined by unacceptable behaviour.","Really noises behaviour by other guests on this occasion. This is in contrast to past stays at the same premises. 
Roadworks on the normal access to the hotel from Landsowne Road were very diruptive; perhaps the hotel can provide details of roadworks with reservation confirmations. ",3,2017,09,07
247,Great stay!,"Spent 3 days here while exploring Dublin. It's convenient to the Dart and to local busses. Our gal at the desk Belen, recommended the hop on hop off bus which gave us the ""lay of the land"" and got us downtown but in a roundabout way. The bar was a comfy stop for a snack and a last Guinness after a full day and like the rest of the staff the bartender was a friendly sort!  Beds were comfortable room was nice and bath was clean! Breakfast was a buffet of yummy stuff! No complaints!",5,2017,09,06
247,Great Hotel,"Lovely family run hotel.Excellent location,situated between Sandymount and Balls bridge .Just 10 minutes from City Center on the Dart.Love the garden at the back of the hotel.Plenty of car parking spaces.Staff are very helpful and friendly.Food is excellent.Room are spotlessly clean . Can't wait to return.",5,2017,09,06
247,5 Star Reunion ,"Returned to the Sandymount Hotel 30+ years after working there when it was known as The Mount Herbert Hotel (then owned then by George and Rosaleen - who were like family to us). On my return I was met by John (their son) who manages the hotel.

Myself and 35-40 ex-colleagues had a fantastic 2 night stay! The hospitality was second to none... every need was catered for. We couldn't have asked for more...

The rooms were spotless, modern and comfortable.

The food (finger food, BBQ & breakfast) was excellent. Great variety!

The staff went above and beyond the call of duty, especially Beatrice at the front desk who was always so cheerful and helpful.

Brought back great memories of when I used go work there - I hope we provided as great a service then as they do now.",5,2017,09,06
247,Dinner before Ireland game at Aviva ,"I was attending the Ireland football match and had 2 special needs gentlemen with me and another carer, you can imagine how busy it was with little room to sit and find a quiet area. We were about to leave when a member of staff called Rose found us a place to sit and helped arrange food and drink for the lads. Rose was extremely helpful and made the lads visit a more enjoyable outing, even with the result not going our way.Thank you Rose and the rest of the staff team.",5,2017,09,06
247,Overnight Stay,Stayed in the hotel for one night as I was going to the 3 arena for a concert. The hotel is located right beside the Aviva Stadium if you are going to a match and only 15 minutes walk along the river to the 3 arena so it's in a great location. When we arrived it was a nice friendly welcome from reception and easy check in. The room was very nice big clean room could not complain about it. The only negative if even it is a negative is because the hotel is old houses converted to a hotel maybe the rooms are a bit noisy and hall way a bit narrow but otherwise I have no complaints and would gladly stay again in the hotel. ,5,2017,09,05
247,Friendly and Helpful Staff,"When we arrived we noticed the safe in our room was locked. We called the front desk and they said they'd send someone along to open the safe. About 10 minutes later the woman we checked in with at  the front desk and two porters came. She mentioned the safe could not be unlocked but instead offered to upgrade our room to the Executive Suite with the help of the porters, and gave us a 5 Euro credit to the bar. We gratefully accepted. The Executive Suite was slightly larger than our previous room, with a couch, larger closet space, and additional toiletry amenities, all of which were much appreciated. We spent the 5 Euro credit on dinner at the bar, which was a fantastic meal. 

The rooms themselves (both the Double room and the Executive Suite) were average in terms of style and comfort. 

Overall a very positive stay at the Sandymount.  

",4,2017,09,05
247,"Great hotel, noise lets it down ","We initially visited this hotel in August 2016 and had a lovely stay which is why we returned. The hotel is well located with the DART station a 5 minute walk and some lovely pubs/restaurants a short 10 minute walk away. The city centre is just a few stops on the DART with a return ticket costing around 4 euros. 

The hotel is very modern and clean with very friendly staff. A big let down was the noise from other room doors shutting. We did notice with our own door that it needed a bit of effort to ensure the latch caught which explains why other doors could be heard shutting heavily, this would not be an issue if the noise hadn't started so early, I was awoken at around 6.30am each morning by this sort of noise which continued certainly until we got up at around 8.30/9am. 

If it was not for this noise factor, I would give the hotel a rating of 4-4.5 out of 5 however the noise really did let the hotel down on this occasion. ",3,2017,09,05
247,comfortable and peaceful hotel,"lovely hotel very comfortable and clean bedrooms, food in the bar was good. right beside Aviva stadium and railway station so quick travel to city. staff all very friendly and helpful   
entrance to hotel is a bit confusing there are 3 don't use first that's the exit with barrier the next seems to be a drop off as you can't turn left towards main door so it's 3rd time lucky with the last one that takes you to the car park at rear of building 
would stay here again if visiting Dublin",5,2017,09,05
247,Family trip ,"Would highly recommend this hotel whether it be a family or business trip this hotel is the place to stay .it is in an ideal location right beside Aviva  stadium ,the 3arena and the RDS.it is also within walking distance of the city center.The staff here are very friendly and will cater to your every need .the rooms are spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable and modern .we have been coming to this family run hotel for years and wouldn't stay anywhere in Dublin .",5,2017,09,03
247,"Good Hotel,not well located","It is little far form the city centre. Staff was correct, and the room clean and wide.
the hotel has been refurbished, but it has a lot of aisles, is a little complicated to get the room
i would repeat",4,2017,09,02
247,Well deserved 4* award,"The upgrading of this hotel to 4* is well deserved, while still retaining that familiar friendly & welcoming atmosphere. I sampled the new menu in the bar and the food we received was just delicious and the service outstanding. The decor is so elegant and relaxing.",5,2017,08,31
247,Excellent hotel in fantastic location,"We enjoyed our stay at your hotel, we only experienced a glass of wine as we were meeting friends in sandymount, the bar was very inviting and the food looked delicious, wish we had staying for dinner with yourselves after an experience in a popular restaurant that wasn't too good.",5,2017,08,31
247,"Good Hotel, great service",I had a convinient business stay at this family owned hotel. Even though I booked via a plattform I was warmly welcomed. Rooms are very clean and over the standard I experienced in Dublin so far. Most surprisingly the hotel offers a shuttle service to East Point Business Park. The driver Dave took me every morning to my work location which is really helpful especially on a busy Dublin morning when Taxis are rare.,4,2017,08,31
247,Close to transport and plenty of parking.,"This is a great place to base yourself for a few days in Dublin as one can leave the car and access the city easily via the train network or an inexpensive taxi ride. The rooms are spacious, clean and nicely furbished with all the expected facilities associated with one of the larger hotels in Dublin. There is a decent bar area perfect for that nightcap, and/or evening starter and, if you don't fancy a trip into town, there are a number of quality  bars and restaurants within a 10 minute walk. 
The only small irritation was dragging the suitcase along a maze of corridors and tiny lifts.",4,2017,08,30
247,Brilliant!!,"Mum, 2 adult daughters and 12 yr old granddaughter visited Dublin for family & sightseeing staying at this hotel in a family room for 5 nights  and was very pleased with all of the hotel services and very friendly staff. We ate at the hotel on 2 nights and they were very obliging with the variety of choices us females had. The breakfasts were massive with a large selection of hot and cold choices. Very filling. Overall would highly recommend this hotel as, although outside of town centre because the Dart train service is a few minutes walk away, it's somewhere that you can relax after the hustle and bustle of city life.",5,2017,08,30
247,Super Sunday!,Great experience from the check-in to right through to check out particularly as the staff were very friendly. The room was gorgeous and had absolutely everything you could possibly need! I would highly recommend. ,5,2017,08,30
247,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay,"Booked as we were heading to a football match in the Aviva stadium as the location is second to none. Close to the dart station and a short walk to the Aviva. Perfect. 

Despite the hotel being really busy, check in was friendly and efficient and staff were great with our toddler daughter. Room was spacious and clean, wifi and facilities were great. Lovely garden to sit and have a drink in, with lots of room for our child to play in. 

The hotel organised a barbecue, which was an added bonus! No need to go anywhere for lunch, giving us more time to relax. Perfect. 

After the match, despite the crowds, there was no overly excessive noise. In fact all theee of us had a great sleep with the windows open all night. 

Breakfast was very tasty, fresh with lots of choice and again staff were very friendly. 

We would not hesitate to book again if attending the Aviva or indeed for a short break for family due to location by the dart station, only a short journey into the city centre. We hope to stay again",5,2017,08,29
247,"Irish Visit, Drink Guinness. Perfect","A family visit with my American relatives.  This was their first visit to Ireland so I wanted it to be special.  We went to an Irish pub and on a tour of the city with an open top bus.  We purchased the pass from the hotel reception.  A perfect start as the hotel was so close to the centre of Dublin.
The Sandymount Hotel had free parking on site.  The staff were very genuine and friendly and extremely helpful.  We paid for breakfast on arrival--it was a great selection buffet.  Well worth the price.
There is a bar and restaurant on site which is a bit pricey, but they served very good meals throughout the day.",5,2017,08,29
247,Lovely stay but marred by noise of one group,"Have stayed before and liked it but recent refurbishment has greatly improved. Rooms are lovely, location with parking is excellent. Staff are warm and helpful. Room was at front. From 6am on our last morning, a group of touring middle-aged motorcyclists were chatting loudly and revving up for 30 mins at the front. I asked staff to ask them to be quiet but they declined saying that they were about to leave. If booking again I would check if this group was staying. Staff should have gone out to them in my view. ",4,2017,08,29
247,Should have been better,"I'm not sure if I'm being mean giving 3 stars but there were glaring issues that should have been resolved. We booked two double rooms and got two twins. Not a problem but not what we booked. The room was nice and clean, well decorated with comfy beds and really big. Staff were all really friendly and helpful and there were options for all sorts of things like fresh milk for the tea in the rooms (thank goodness) and late night pizza delivery. The bathroom had no extractor fan and there was a huge damp patch on the ceiling. The next morning my clothes that I had left out in the room felt damp too. I'm of an age where it is a little awkward to climb into a bath for my shower, especially when there is huge glass screen in the way and I'm trying to climb out of the sloping end. There was a view out onto a courtyard, and although they had made an effort to make it look vaguely appealing it was where they kept the rubbish bins. Lastly- thank god it was our kids in the room above so we could tell them to stop wandering round. The floors transmitted all sorts of thuds and creaks really easily. However, once settled it was a super quiet hotel. There was a bedside light that we couldn't turn off and flickered dimly all night. The breakfast was quite expensive but varied and nice. Plenty of parking when we were there which was a bonus. ",3,2017,08,28
247,Fantastic barbecue in Whittys Restaurant ,"I attended a family barbecue at the hotel, in Whitty's Restaurant. Had not been before but very impressed with the venue and service. Good looking hotel very near the Aviva Stadium with plenty of parking. Our family took over Whitty's for the afternoon and evening. Lovely new patio area with plenty of tables and grass area for kids to play safely. Barbecue was excellent with beautifully cooked burgers, sausages and nice salads on the side. Serving staff were very friendly and ensured wine was topped up and also would get anything else you needed. 
Would highly recommend for any event. ",4,2017,08,28
247,Just really friendly & good,First time visitor for 2 nights - wasn't sure what was inside from the outside as it doesn't look like a traditional hotel from the outside.  really warm genuine welcome and friendly knowledgeable staff that give a damn.  Excellent attention to detail in the rooms and food was excellent.  Has the family run feel but very professional.  Definitely will return.  ,5,2017,08,28
247,Excellent stay,My daughter and I stayed at the hotel and had an excellent experience. The room was very clean and spacious. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was lovely. It was my first time in Ireland and would definitely recommend this hotel. ,5,2017,08,27
247,A lovely hotel in a great location. The staff were with friendly staff,The beds were comfortable and nearby restaurants in easy reach. The staff were very friendly and had good knowledge of the local area. They were able to advise us how to get to the UDC which was very important as we were there to watch the women's 2017 world cup rugby,5,2017,08,26
247,Great Hotel,"Location good, close to public traffic - but also a nice walk into the city center (if you like walking)
Big room. Food in the restaurant was excellent
And last but not least: Very friendly and always helpful staff. 
",5,2017,08,26
247,extended my stay,I was extending my stay with a tour group and I thought the price was high especially for no air conditioning but they did furnish a fan which helped a lot.  the room was pleasant and clean and the service was excellent.,5,2017,08,25
247,Dublin with kids in August,"The hotel is located in a nice and peaceful area. The rooms were tidy and modern although with a carpet. The room had a bath with a shower without a handle and this turned out to be quite tricky when trying to wash our small children. I would take this into consideration if travelling with younger kids. Also, I would recommend taking a travel potty along. Otherwise the hotel was child friendly and we enjoyed our stay. We tried the food in the bar and it was good, also for kids. The staff were helpful and friendly.",4,2017,08,25
247,Very good hotel,"Wonderful location, the internal restaurant was very good. The rooms are ok and the staff is so helpfull for every kind of request. There a lot of hall where you can relax reading a book instead of spend this time in own room",4,2017,08,24
247,Sandymount Hotel Review,"My husband and I came to Ireland for our honeymoon and we started off our trip in Dublin at the Sandymount Hotel. Hotel was in good location, close to the Dart and Air Coach stops. Friendly staff and rooms were clean. There was no air conditiining or ceiling fan in the room so it was hot, but the staff brought us a fan which we appreciated. It was a little confusing to get to our room. Our room Was in the 500s, so we assumed it would be on the 5th floor but it was really on the third floor. Food in the restaurant was good but we wished there was better times for breakfast. Overall it was a good hotel for the price and location. ",3,2017,08,23
247,Great city break,"First impression of friendly, helpful and generous service continued throughout.
Great location, spotless all over and busy but quiet at all times..
Free on site parking and handy for travel to inner city",5,2017,08,21
247,Dublin,Its a nice hotel and nearby the city. We walked for 30-40 minutes to be in the city. Its a quiet place and a nice room to stay. Breakfast is also good. Whe had a nice stay in this hotel. Also good for familys with children,4,2017,08,21
247,Aste Aug. 2017,"Please see comments to general management.
The noise of the doors during the night should be avoided.
The staff is very helpful and friendly.
The location and the connections with the public transportation system is fine.

We enjoyed Dublin
",4,2017,08,21
247,"Comfortable hotel, delicious food","I stayed here for one night with my mum before we caught the ferry from Dublin Port early the next morning. Our twin room was slightly small but it was very clean and had all facilities we needed, including complimentary tea and coffee. As we were leaving early the next day, we didn't have time for breakfast but we had dinner in the hotel bar. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. All staff were very welcoming and friendly. There is free parking for guests, which is a plus, and the car park is very big. The only small drawbacks are the corridors beside the rooms are tiny and there should be better signs for the stairs/lift to get to your rooms. Despite being directed to the stairs and lift by the receptionist, they are a little hard to find! All in all, a pleasant stay and I would be happy to stay in Sandymount Hotel again.",4,2017,08,20
247,Recommended!,We had a lovely stay. Staff were very helpful when we needed a cot for our baby. Hotel room was clean and quiet. We had everything we needed including an iron which came in handy. We found a cheap price via booking.com which gave us good value for money. ,5,2017,08,20
247,Our favourite hotel in Dublin,As always our stay in this lovely hotel was most enjoyable.Rooms are modern and comfortable with everything needed for a relaxing break. Staff are friendly and super efficient.We want to give a special mention to Beatrice on reception whose warm welcome is especially appreciated-she goes beyond the call of duty to ensure our stay is the best possible.,5,2017,08,19
247,Homely stay,Overall the ambience is great. Staff very pleasant and property very clean and homely. Great selection of food both lunch and evening although the breakfast from bin marie was fairly cold...rooms could have been a bit more sound proof...would not put me off coming back...great location also...thanks,5,2017,08,19
247,Good Family run hotel.,"Good clean hotel ,with excellent breakfast and easy access to transport  choices for Dublin and beyond.
Our executive double room was good but some rooms seemed in strange places.
Liked the quiet surrounding area",4,2017,08,19
247,Enjoyable stay,"We were well served.  The room was clean and adequately furnished.  The bathroom was obviously recently modernised.  The only issue was that the side of the bath was rather high, which makes it slightly difficult for the elderley such as us. Staff were helpful and friendly",4,2017,08,19
247,Lovely Hotel in a lovely quiet part of Dublin.,"WE stayed here over 22 years ago when our children were young. It was very convenient for the Dart railway system. Easy to get into central Dublin. & minutes at the most to the train station. We revisited on the 21st July this year for 4 days and although the name has changed and it has had a major overhall i can report it is still a lovely hotel. The food was fabulous, the staff in this family run hotel were lovely. We had a very minor inconvenience with our key card , but were left a bottle of wine for the inconvenience. So kind.Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,19
247,Just so helpful,"Recently renovated and looking well, it's also well kept. But for me it's the helpful and really accommodating staff. Thanks to Beatrice & Sanja for looking after me, genuinely polite and helpful - a true home away from home.",5,2017,08,19
247,Staying in Sandymount for business purposes,"Everything is good in the hotel. 
The restaurant and the service.
The location was very convenient for me.
I experienced one problem that in my room I was able to hear any noise from a room or a corridor from above ",4,2017,08,18
247,Excellent stay,Short stay passing through on way home to U.K. Excellent location for short trip back to Dublin port. As a big rugby fan loved the location next to the Aviva Stadium and the history on display in the bar. Very good quality food at a reasonable price and the staff were more than helpful. Overall very happy and would recommend ,5,2017,08,17
247,Very nice Place to stay in Dublin,"Can recommend this Hotel in every respect. The Room was big and the Beds very comfortable. The breakfast offers a wide Range for every taste. The staff is very friendly, respectfull and helpfull. Trank you to all to make our Trip to Dublin such a Great experience <3",5,2017,08,17
247,very good,Very enjoyable stay in the hotel with friendly staff and excellent location for the RDS and Aviva stadium' Will definitely be back. City centre not to far away and can be reached with short taxi ride or a walk on a good day,4,2017,08,17
247,Very comfortable 👍,Really enjoyed our stay here . We have stayed here for the 3 last years while attending the Dublin horse show . The food is delightful 👍 . Our family room was very comfortable. The staff are very nice . ,5,2017,08,16
247,High Class,"This is the hotel for me it has everything we look for in a place to stay the staff are excellent the food is great a good nights sleep and the hotel is spotlessly clean plus our car is safe in the free car park 
The only negative that we have with this hotel is that like all hotels in Dublin the prices can be a bit high at times it would be nice to maby have a loyalty card or some kind of discount fro regulars who stay there often ",5,2017,08,16
247,Gem of a hotel!,"Sandymount Hotel is my home away from home. It's a gem in the centre of south Dublin. You can walk to the city centre in 25 mins. It's really well priced for its location and standard of rooms. 
The staff are amazing. Beatrice is incredibly pleasant, helpful and good-humoured. The rest of the staff are the same. I often check in late at night and Remus and Johnny are very accommodating. 
Sandymount is simply a gem in the middle of south Dublin city!",5,2017,08,16
247,Tour Hotel,"The hotel itself was nice. The room that my daughter and I shared was small. We didn't spend much time in our room as we spent most of the day touring Dublin. The bathroom was very small and cramped. No air conditioning in the room, I did ask for a fan and it was brought up very quickly. I kept the window open at all times. The hallways are very tight as well. Our day in Dublin it was pouring rain and they had many leaks in the ceiling in and around reception. The staff was very friendly and happy to help. The food was good and plentiful for breakfast and dinner. I just can't give it 5 stars because of the cramped room and microscopic bathroom. Hotel was situated very near a train station and we used it to get into Dublin. Restaurants nearby for a different food choice. ",4,2017,08,16
247,A super hotel in a perfect location!,I booked this hotel at the last minute and we were blown away by it! The whole hotel is refurbished and rooms were spacious and immaculately clean! We ate in the bar and the food and service were second to none! The breakfast the next morning was beautiful also. Staff very friendly and helpful!,5,2017,08,16
247,Stay during RDS Dublin Horse Show,The hotel is in a great location for the RDS. my only problem was the heat in the bedrooms and the double bed was far too small. However the staff were very accommodating and I will definitely book to stay again,3,2017,08,16
247,Weekend Visits,"As already indicated I book The Sandymount Hotel at all times based on past experiences in relation to value, staff ,food, room suitability and now your new decoration.
I have always have been treated with courtesy by frontline staff ,bar and restauarant staff serving first class food and drink",5,2017,08,16
247,Hotel gone corporate,"having stayed at this hotel on 3 other occasions for the horse show, I had recommended the hotel to friends.  6 of us checked in, looking forward to Irish hospitality, good food in great surroundings.  The location of the hotel is ideal for the RDS as it is a 10 minute walk.  Petes restaurant in Sandymount village is worth a visit.  The food in the hotel is average, but you must book a table as when we were there, the restaurant was not open on the Saturday night. I did ask if we should book,  but was told there is no need as they stay open later for the horse show.  We turned up at the restaurant to find it closed and was offered a table in the lobby or outside to eat.  It was not a warm evening.  I saw lots of trays of food being delivered to rooms. although where you would eat is a bit of a mystery unless you are happy to balance tray on your knees while in bed.  breakfast is good.  Some of the staff do not appear to want to be working there.  Rooms are cosy, we booked a twin and had a single and double bed, so this may be why. Yes location is brilliant, but I will not be returning here as the hotel seems to have gone corporate and has lost it's charm.  it is such a shame.",2,2017,08,16
247,4night stay,"Stayed for Dublin horse show

247,Superb staff and food,"The staff at the hotel are extremely helpful and friendly - nothing was too much bother.  The rooms are small, but have everything you need and are very clean.  The bar food was tasty and the service couldn't be faulted.",5,2017,08,15
247,Dublin Horse Show,"Just had the most wonderful stay in Sandymount hotel during the Dublin Horse Show. A clearly busy time for the hotel, but this did not effect the hotels natural calm and tranquil atmosphere at all. The restaurant was busy, in fact full each night, but the food was great. Same said for breakfast, which was just fantastic. Rooms were quiet, very well equiped and extremely clean. A big thank you to Beatrice at reception for her welcome and help with breakfast vouchers our first morning and for the fruit and goodies in our room. Our daughter particularly liked the crisps..",5,2017,08,14
247,Great hotel & location for show week.,This was the second time I've stayed here. A very comfortable and relaxed hotel. Good food in the bar even during busy show week. Rooms are great. Quiet at night and rooms not over heated so you can get a good nights sleep. Have booked already for 2018!,5,2017,08,14
247,Great Central Location ,It's not the first time that I've stayed at this hotel. The location is great for all aspects of Dublin but we were going to the RDS for the Dublin Horse Show. The added benefit for us was the car parking which the hotel kindly allowed us to use even in the day we checked out until the evening when we left. We stayed in a triple room which was quite roomy and decorated beautifully. My only criticism was the small and I mean small bathroom. The staff are very friendly and accommodating all in all an excellent place to stay. ,4,2017,08,14
247,Stay at Sandymount Hotel during Dublin Horse Show Week,"Hotel very nice, good breakfast, close to RDS only downfall room very small for three adults sharing.
However this would not put me off staying again as its very close to the Horse Show and local pubs etc. ",4,2017,08,14
247,RDS VISIT,Tiny bathroom. No bath...only a shower. Pillows like rocks. Torn carpet. Very disappointing for the money. Bar uninspiring. Entire place tired and cramped. Would not recommend it at all. However it was a great location for Rds,2,2017,08,14
247,"Great location, great hotel- service poor","Stayed here during their peak period and paid in excess for the pleasure. Strangely they did not employ extra staff to cope with the increased volume of customers! Extremely frustrating when we couldn't get a table to have dinner on our first night and told to wait 30 mins before ordering room service (that's after been hung up on by one of their ""friendly"" bar staff. Then there was no room service menu in the room. 

The hotel is in a Great location but they need to seriously looking at their staffing and service",3,2017,08,14
247,Comfortable clean quiet conveniently located hotel,"Great hotel. Very comfortable. Quick walk to train station and a stop for the airport coach. Beatrice in reception was particularly helpful and kind, even letting us use her phone to make a call. Highly recommended. ",4,2017,08,13
247,"Stay at Sandymount Hotel, Dublin, Ireland","Located in a quiet neighborhood, a very comfortable and spacious room, kind and helpful staff members at front desk, wonderful breakfast, waking distance to public transportation (DART). Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,13
247,Nice friendly hotel,"Very well located hotel which offers great value for money considering the prime location close to Ballsbridge and the Aviva Stadium. The hotel was originally a conversion of three adjoining Georgian houses, which lends itself to the layout of accommodation being a bit unorthodox with corridors and stairways being rather random in their lay out. That aside the hotel offers a fine guest experience at a very fair price which more than makes up for the unusual character of the property. ",4,2017,08,13
247,Location,"Excellent location adjacent to Aviva Stadium, 10 minutes walk to RDS. Hotel easily accessible by car. Surrounding area quiet and safe.  Courteous, helpful and friendly staff. Looked for an early check in and was very pleased when same was accommodated.  Breakfast was lovely and plenty of choice.  A little disappointed with dinner, had steak which was rather tough, would have expected a more tender steak for the price charged. Overall a very pleasant stay at the hotel, wiLlandudno be back again. ",4,2017,08,13
247,Convenience & Comfort,Location gives access to many Dublin entertainment venues. Accommodation is very good. Evening Menu choice could be more varied. Comfortable rooms and friendly staff. A bit pricey though we stayed at high season.,4,2017,08,12
247,Fabulous hotel,Fabulous hotel. Couldn't ask for better location as was staying here to attend the dublin horse show. The hotel was very kind to mind our bags until check in and even minded the bags after we checking out. The hotel had a courtesy bus to bring us to the rds,5,2017,08,12
247,Brilliant place for a city break in Dublin,"We found the hotel staff very friendly; the room light, comfortable and beautifully clean; the breakfast delicious and the location ideal for us as it was a short walk to the Dart station with regular trains into the city centre. We had brought our car for use later in our holiday so the car parking facility made life much easier for us.",5,2017,08,11
247,Great short stay,"We stayed at the SandyMount on our last night after a week in Ireland. I had picked it due to price, and as we had stayed in Ballsbridge previously which is nearby I knew that it would be a nice area. What I hadn't realised was that it was withing excellent proximity to the port, which was perfect for us as we had an early ferry to catch in the morning. The staff were immediately very helpful, we arrived early but they let us into our room and gave us details of how to get into Dublin, they were really friendly and lovely with our daughter who was a bit shy. We had a lovely stay at the sandymount, albeit short, however I would definitely return next time I am visiting Dublin. ",5,2017,08,11
247,"My Father had a profound influence on me, he was a lunatic.","A hotel hidden away in a leafy wealthy Dublin suburb,  but yet very central at the same time, great access to the Dart railway line, that will take you to central Dublin in minutes. This hotel has a lot of old world charm, splendid accommodation, a great restaurant, and also great bar food, large secluded  gardens with seating, to while away a sunny afternoon with maybe several refreshments of your choice. secure car parking F.O.C and a lovely part of Dublin. Derek a true Dub.",5,2017,08,10
247,Lovely Hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the Sandymount Hotel. The Rooms are very modern, spotless and cozy. Breakfast Buffet was very nice too. Staff very, friendly and helpful.
Only 2 stops with the train to the city centre and sandymount centre with shops and restaurants a 10 minute walk away.",5,2017,08,09
247,Great location guarantees bookings not merited by quality of service,"Great location, nice decor, terrible cleanliness, sloppy housekeeping. This hotel has the potential to be so much better. Not sure how they can claim its star rating especially as the advertised swimming pool is actually down the road in a school??",1,2017,08,08
247,Football Match stay,"Only real thing in the Hotels favour is its proximity to the Aviva, this is one of the worst Hotels ive stayed in just felt that there was no atmosphere and everything was a total hassle for the staff. 
I travel a lot on Business throughout the year and the Hotel is terrible value for money especially when it is so dated.",1,2017,08,08
247,"Clean, good rates, and quiet, .... would book it again.","We stayed here in July 2017 and found it to be a nice hotel.  Rates were affordable and rooms were clean.  Staff is friendly.  However, be careful if Aviva stadium has an event as the hotel is very close to it and I've heard it can get busy in that area.  We ate at the pub and found the food very good.  The hotel is located away from city center, although, easily reachable by taxi, train, or bus line.  There are local pubs/restaurant within walking distances towards Sandymount center.  Do not buy the Cityscape hop on hop off bus tickets at the front lobby desk.  We waited almost 30-45 mins at each bus stop while all the other bus lines came by every 10 to 15 minutes.  We finally gave up on them after the 3rd stop and used a cab.",4,2017,08,07
247,Location Location Location,"Very friendly check-in service, clean and comfortable rooms and very quiet, even though we stayed on a match night. For access to the Aviva Stadium, this hotel is ideal. We have stayed in much nicer places for this price, but it's clear you definitely pay for location, especially as the price gets hiked up on a match night. Ballsbridge was a lovely area within walking distance.",4,2017,08,07
247,Very good stay,A very friendly staff and a very good breakfast with a lot of choice. It's also 20 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes walk from the trainstation and stop of the hop on and off bus. So I can recommend this hotel!,4,2017,08,07
247,Decent Pub Lunch,"I met a client here for a pub lunch. I had the chilli burrito and he had the burger. Both of them were tasty and the service was prompt and reasonably pleasant.
The food was nothing fancy but it was good value for a pub lunch in one of Dublin's most expensive suburbs.",4,2017,08,06
247,Extremely enjoyable stay,Highly recommended this hotel. Has a home from home feeling. Spotless and staff are naturally friendly and helpful. Food very good. Location amazing. We stayed because we were attending the man utd match in the aviva. The staff were able to manage a large crowd In their stride.,5,2017,08,06
247,Aviva stadium ,"We booked this hotel as we where attending a match in the Aviva staduim which sandy mount says is a 5 min walk its actually less 😁. 
I booked the hotel on bookings and before we paid i contacted the hotel and explain we where going to be travelling up and staying the friday night and wouldnt be getting there til later on in the evening and that we would be attending a match the saturday and would it be ok to leave the car there after check out, the girl who i was in contact with had no problem with this.

The room was clean, newly refurbished i think or it was just kept in good condition over time. Beds where comfortable. Reception staff upon check in & out where friendly. We had a few drinks in the bar that night and staff were lovely. 

Theres pubs (recommend Slatterys pub) grocery shops and cafes about 10 min walk away from hotel or 6€ in taxi (download my taxi app-so handy).

Day of match there was pop up tents outside the hotel on hotel grounds doing drinks and bbq for people for the match.  such a good idea!!  we also got to see the football teams driving in by being here.( they also have a tent for people going to the match to check in there bags)",5,2017,08,05
247,Lovely hotel!,"Lovely hotel, delicious food in the restaurant and reasonably priced! Great location beside Aviva stadium as we were attending the man Utd match. Loved the beer garden! Rooms spacious n nicely decorated. ",4,2017,08,05
247,Great Stay,"Stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon. Hotel is spacious, conveniently located, has a great hot breakfast buffet, staff are friendly and eager to help and even has perks like a business center with printers for any last minute itinerary printing or changes. We were even surprised to find a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine in our room when we checked in with a note congratulating us on our recent marriage. The Sandymount has set the bar high for hotels on the rest of our European vacation.",5,2017,08,04
247,Nice hotel,"We stayed recently in Sandymount hotel with my husband. Very nice,spacious, modern, clean bedrooms! Bathroom was also very nice. We were attending to  concert in 3Arena, which was 30 mins walk, the hotel is at great location. 
I left my purse in the security box, I only realised on the next day. Thanks to Tania the duty manager of the hotel I got it back by post. Thanks again for that!! ",5,2017,08,04
247,Fantastic stay!,"My Husband and I stayed at the Sandymount Hotel for one night in July.  We were in Dublin for the U2 concert at Croke Park and it was also my Husband's Birthday.  I booked the hotel direct, it was really easy and we booked a classic room and late check-out.  We chose this hotel based on the great reviews and the fact that it was near the coast which my Husband was really keen to visit - we were not disappointed with our choice!!  We travelled by taxi from the airport to the hotel, the journey took around 15-20 minutes and cost 25 euros.

A few days before we travelled, I contacted the hotel to confirm our reservation and to ask if there was anything they could recommend in the immediate area of the hotel that I could arrange for my Husband to do on the Sunday as we were seeing U2 on the Saturday evening.  I got a very fast and very friendly response from Iamina who also provided me with website links to the recommended places so that I could get more information.  Fab!

On arrival we were impressed, first impressions were really great!  The hotel looks really impressive and the reception area was spotless with beautiful flower arrangements everywhere.  The receptionist was super-friendly and she gave us loads of information about the area and as we were travelling to Croke Park, she told us where to find the Dart station (about a 2 minute walk) and how many stops we needed to get near to the stadium.  She also advised us that we had been upgraded to an executive suite, which was just so lovely.  The room was large and had a king bed and a single, a lovely bathroom, a desk, wardrobe and dressing table.  Nice toiletries were provided along with robes, tea and coffee making facilities, a hairdryer etc.  There was also a bottle of wine and some chocolates for my husband which again was so lovely.  The room was absolutely spotless too (and I have a hygiene OCD!).

As it was fairly early we decided to find the Line Out bar and have some food and a drink before we set out for Croke Park.  The bar looked great, plenty of room inside with a little decked area outside.  We chose our drinks, they have a great range of beers and ales and some nice wines and food.  The food menu was good with a great mix of main dishes, burgers, wings and ribs etc.  I ordered a chicken burger and my husband ordered chicken wings. The food came out quickly but unfortunately my order was wrong.  The staff couldn't have been more apologetic and handled the situation really professionally.  Twice they offered us complimentary drinks to make up for the mistake, but we refused as they dealt with everything so beautifully we didn't feel it was necessary.  The food was really good - too many wings for my husband though!  When we arrived back from the concert at around 11.40pm, the receptionist told us the bar was open until 1am and served pizza after 10pm until closing, so we sat at the bar, had a pepperoni pizza and a couple of drinks - it wasn't overly busy but the atmosphere was so relaxed and everyone was so friendly that we didn't want to leave when it closed and could happily have sat there until dawn!  Breakfast is served in the restaurant.  Again it was spotless and there was an amazing choice of food - cereals, fruits, juices, lovely bread, jams, porridge, scrambled eggs, bacon, white and black pudding, sausages, mushrooms, tomatoes, hash browns etc.  Tea and coffee was served at the table and it was genuinely one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had (and I've had a few!).

After breakfast my husband wanted to go to the beach for a birthday stroll, it took around 15 minutes to reach the coast, the beach was lovely but the tide came in really quickly so take care!  We walked back along the front admiring the lovely houses then decided to go into the city centre for some window shopping and a drink.  The Dart journey was very quick from the station near the hotel, about 5 minutes and using the Dart is really easy and so convenient.  It was our second time in Dublin but we wandered around Trinity College and Grafton Street before hitting Temple bar for a drink.  We when walked back and took the Dart back to the hotel to check out and the receptionist called us a taxi to take us back to the airport.

We absolutely loved our stay at Sandymount Hotel and i'm so grateful that they went out of their way to make my Husband's Birthday special despite us only being able to stay for one night.  I'm sure we will be visiting Dublin again in the future and would 100% stay here again.  Thank you to all at the Sandymount for a fantastic stay.",5,2017,08,04

247,Excellent hotel in a lovely location,"I can thoroughly recommend this hotel.  It is in a lovely location within walking distance to town, Ballsbridge and the lovely beach at  Sandymount.  The staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble.  If you are looking for a lovely hotel in Dublin this is definitely the one to choose.",5,2017,08,01
247,"Outstanding Hotel, staff and value","Stayed at the Sandymount again for the quarter final, had not been for a few years. We got the Sunday night special deal for two from there web site.
Outstanding value, B & B, 3 course evening meal, free car park, €5 bar voucher all for €139 for two. How to they do it ???
First of all, staff are very friendly, polite, professional, pleasant and very helpful. Hotel and rooms spotless and immaculate, with all you need,I have never seen a card in the room before, saying, if you would like fresh milk with the complimentary tea/coffee, please phone, well done, great touch.  Breakfast is very good.
Now lets talk about the 3 course evening meal in the bar, anything off the menu (additional payment for steak ), We met family at the hotel and we all had the meal, and could not get over the choice, quality, standard, presentation, potion size and service. It was second to none. One of the best meals ever. Nothing is too much trouble.
 This hotel is 5 mins on the Dart from the city centre, cost €4 return, very safe, quite, easy to drive too, plenty of free parking. I have stayed in Dublin many times and never had such a good deal. 
Do Not Stay anywhere else, it is outstanding",5,2017,08,01
247,Great staff,"All in all a very pleasant hotel with extremely helpful staff. Clean comfortable rooms, nicely decorated. Good pub. Nice breakfast buffet and some quite good food at the restaurant. Very convenient for a wedding at Star of the Sea in the village.",4,2017,07,31
247,Great hotel good location,"I found the hotel clean, comfortable and ideally located just outside the city centre. I would recommend it, I had one issue of room doors closing and the noise but this has been taken on board by the management and I hope my next stay will be even better. ",5,2017,07,30
247,Good place to stay,"Good place to stay, not too far from the city center. 
Modern hotel. Clean.Value for money.
Have not tried the restaurant, only breakfast.
Would return if I ever come back to Dublin.
Close to the rugby stadium so may be crowded if a game is on, check the match program",4,2017,07,30
247,First taste of Ireland!,"Lovely hotel, really friendly chatty staff make you feel welcome.  The room was clean, had everything you need and the bed was comfortable.  If you'd like half a wilder beast order the rack of ribs from the restaurant....just take a doggy bag, huge, messy and delicious!!",5,2017,07,29
247,Great location ... extortionate prices,"Lovely hotel, very nice staff and comfortable well appointed rooms in a great location... but Dublin you've to get a grip on the prices.... this is no reflection on the hotel . It's lovely and well appointed but the price was just too much ",4,2017,07,28
247,"Nice Hotel, I would stay here again.","Stayed here for a business trip. Very nice hotel with friendly staff. Good location for access into the city centre and elsewhere. The only negative comments I have, which are very minor, are around the quality of the TV in the room - poor picture and few channels (less than freeview) - and the curtains, which let in quite a bit of light around the edges early in the morning, which meant I woke up earlier than I would have hoped. ",4,2017,07,28
247,Quick Holiday break in Dublin,"We love Dublin for cultural reasons and wanted a midsummer break at short notice. This friendly family-run  hotel is central, and is convenient for transport on the DART and LUAS - the LEAP Visitors card is a cheap and useful transport card to get you about town and to visit charming seaside towns like Malahide and Greystones. It's worth considering  for leisure and business reasons.",5,2017,07,27
247,A sunny day in Ballsbridge-,"Excellent location, great parking. Breakfast very good and convenient. Quiet, clean room given central location. 
Slight issues checking-in, but willing to believe this is not typical. Very nice to see such good renovation of old town-houses. ",4,2017,07,26
247,Randwick Petersham loved our stay,"A perfect destination for our team. Staff very helpful and friendly and hotel is well appointed - rooms clean, lounges very comfortable and relaxing, an excellent bar and dining facilities. Free computer room and strong wifi. Conveniently located to the DART and Sandymount Village and eateries in Ballsbridge. Highly recommended and would stay here again.",5,2017,07,25
247,"Replacement towels are stored on the floor ""Substandard Accommodations""","The ""clean"" towels are stored on top of blue plastic on the floor of the hallway.  These ""clean"" towels are exposed to people's shoes, dust and other pollutants.  The shower doors are half-way closed, allowing water to spill on the bathroom floor.  Room was dark and dank.  A substandard hotel at best.  Depending who is on duty results in pleasant or unpleasant communication to generate the requested results.  My request for shampoo led to the maid busting into my room after knocking only once (I was naked) to prove to me that she had put shampoo in the bathroom.
One good point is that it is in close proximity to the city.",2,2017,07,25
247,my favourite hotel in Dublin,stayed as a tour guide with my group of tourists here several times... always happy to come back... the most helpful staff... great food... and a wonderful quiet location but close enough to the City... at the canal with a nice walking way,5,2017,07,25

Didn't eat at the hotel but looked very nice.",4,2017,07,24

247,Great location ,"Stayed here for one night and was totally impressed. The hotel was large and spacious with plenty of free parking. On arrival we were greeted by friendly staff and this continued throughout our stay. The rooms were spacious with free safe, wifi, hairdryer, iron, tv, tea/coffee facilities and plenty of toiletries. We ate from the bar menu and it's was delicious. Breakfast was self service with loads of choice, even for non meat eaters. The hotel is just 5 mins walk to aviva stadium and train station, which took us into city centre in 10 mins.
Overall a great friendly hotel in a fabulous location and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,07,24
247,"Average hotel, good staff.","Had a 2 night stay, really close to AVIVA this hotel is geared up for visiting sports fans. The Dart is close and provides great transport into centre and around Dublin. Breakfast was amazing. 
Bad points where the bed was quite uncomfortable and not great for a romantic getaway! Room wasn't what I'd hoped for and found the hotel expensive when actually it was very Premier Inn like so value for money not great and actually at Premier Inn the beds are much more comfortable! 
Hotel is clean, staff are great but wouldn't pay the money. ",3,2017,07,23
247,Sandymount,A smallish hotel in a pleasant area with friendly staff.  The rooms and food were of good quality and the area quiet.  Nearby is Sandymount village with shops and pubs and a little further on is a beach which provided a pleasant evening walk.  ,4,2017,07,22
247,Out of the hustle und bustle but very central,The Sandymount Hotel is a good choice. Located in Sandymount quarter it is easy to reach the center of Dublin by the DART train. At the end of an Ireland trip it is very easy to drive to the airport within 15 minutes.,4,2017,07,22
247,Good times,"We stayed in the Sandymount for the Sunday night of the longitude festival. First impression, really lovely decor but not so lovely that you are afraid to put down your glass or touch anything. There was a really relaxed feel in the hotel. People were just sitting around, chilling in various locations (there are chairs and sofas around every corner...so nice). 

The people on check in were lovely but special praise goes to Beatrice. She went above and beyond. About 10 mins after booking us a taxi to longitude another couple made a similar request and she suggested that they approach us and share, saving us both money. I thought it was a lovely touch. She was there again in the morning when we were checking out and made time to ask how we got on the night before. Silly maybe but we both agreed that Beatrice's kindness added to the great buzz of the weekend. 

 The beer garden is really lovely. While we didn't get to eat at the hotel (other than late night pizza) but I think you could honestly go to the Sandymount and not leave the grounds. At one point I thought we would just forget Longitude and stay in the garden :) 

We were driving so with regards to public transport, I am not sure what the options are like but given that the hotel is co-located with the Aviva Stadium, I assume they are good.

Last but not least, a shout out to the two gentlemen on reception who were there to greet us on our return from longitude in a perhaps 'little under the weather state' wanting food and more alcohol. I am sure you wanted to murder us but pizza and cokes were a far better option. :) 

I would highly recommend the location. Only thing, if you are a little claustrophobic, the corridors and lift are tight but other than that, you are good to go.",5,2017,07,21
247,Regularly stay here on business - best in area,"I stay in this hotel very regularly on business and cannot fault it at all. It is very homely, staff are very pleasant and the bar food is top quality.
Rooms are very comfortable, clean and modern and there is a great car park on site with plenty of room.
I've tried various other hotels in the area - cheaper and more expensive and this is the best. Prices are very, very reasonable. I would highly recommend this, not just for business but for family breaks or short weekends.
Staying away from home is not so much of a chore in this spot!",5,2017,07,21
247,Summer Trip to Dublin,The Sandymount Hotel was such a pleasure to stay in. I will certainly recommend it to others & hope there will be a vacancy next time I am in Dublin. It is walking distance from Bord Gais theatre and 3 Arena . It is also perfect location for travelling on to South Dublin coastal towns or further on to Bray or Greystones. Co. Wicklow.. ,5,2017,07,20

247,A nice stay,The hotel offers a lot of services. It's not difficult to get to the centre by bus or by train. It's also interesting to take a ride along the sea shore at Sandymount. The rooms are comfortable and there is a big choice of food for breakfast.,4,2017,07,18
247,Pleasant overnight stay!,"A very pleasant stay at the Sandymount. A little bit out of the city by foot but only 10/15 minutes drive so luckily we hired a car for our stay. The room was however a little warm and lacked air conditioning, not many British hotels have air-con though so that is the only negative thing I have to say. The staff were all friendly and the hotel in general was very plush. The morning buffet breakfast was very tasty indeed. Piping hot and often a very good selection of everything. Would stay at this hotel again in future.",4,2017,07,17
247,Great stay,"Thank you for a lovely stay, room was perfect and reception staff were extremely helpful and informative.

The next morning checking out, staff were again lovely and got the shuttle bus turn round to come back me and then left me to the aircoach stop which was very much appreciated, bus driver was very friendly also, highly recommend this affordable, clean, nicely located hotel.",5,2017,07,17

247,Sandymount Hotel,"The hotel is well located, close to he village of Sandymount but with easy access to Dublin City centre via the Dart.

",4,2017,07,16
247,2 days away,"The overall experience was great ..the service friendly and attentive, food excellent. As I was a solo traveler I felt quite comfortable staying here. The  location of the hotel was close to the railway good

 and Dave the shuttlebus driver was great!",4,2017,07,16
247,Lovely place,Great hotel. Looks very well i loved the sofas and big mirrors. Food was 4/5 quite tasty and the Guinness was perfect. Rooms were lovely and cosy. The shower was great. Some small little things like loose shower fittings and one of the bedside lights not functioning are keeping this hotel from getting 4 stars. Other then that it deserves them! ,5,2017,07,15
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Very nice but a bit out of the way. Short walk to the Irish Sea and to the village - a change from the city.
Short walk to the train to the downtown area. Clean, nice breakfast, and lovely garden and flowers.",4,2017,07,15
247,Family vacation,"The rooms are small but clean and very efficient. The water pressure is great. The patio and restaurant and bar Are lovely. Our breakfast was not included in our room price, but the breakfast buffet was fantastic and worth the price, €11 per person. Five minutes walk to a dart station which brings youafter three stops to temple bar or Trinity College.",5,2017,07,14
247,Friendly,"The staff was incredible, they were helpful and courteous every step of the way. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Very quiet and in a great location (15-20 minute ride to city center). Thank you again",5,2017,07,14
247,Great location free parking,Great hotel for Dublin Ferry. Reasonably priced for Dublin. Near centre of Dublin and only 15 mins drive to ferry. Lots of parking on site and free. Rooms are recently refurbished so good and clean. Really nice neighbourhood with nice pub in walking distance as well!,4,2017,07,14
247,Goo stop-over place before ferry crossing,"Really well situated hotel if you want to ferry catch, or just dip into the delights of a Dublin visit, or visit the AVIVA Stadium which is literally next door to the hotel!

Ample off-road parking, pleasant staff and certainly the amenities were well staffed and provided good food and beverages.

Breakfast was well presented and good in quality, with nice, smiley staff - which is really important to us in a morning!

Refurbished rooms were all very acceptably appointed. We experienced a little night time sleep disturbance from outside noisy people - but as a city centre venue there was nothing out of the ordinary in our opinion.",4,2017,07,13
247,"Great Location, staff need to perk up","Hotel is in a great location and has had a good refurbishment, so no issues there.  Perfectly adequate but could be so much better with a bit of staff training/motivation to create a more welcoming and helpful environment. ",3,2017,07,13
247,Very happy to recommend,Our room was clean and very well stocked with complimentary toiletries. The hotel itself is really nice and the location is excellent. The hotel is about a 30 minute stroll to Grafton street and there's a DART station really close to the hotel also. There are nice bars and restaurants quite close to the hotel also. All in all a really pleasant stay.,5,2017,07,12
247,Never fails to surprise and delight!,"Quick update on past reviews and again following the major refurbishment the Sandmount Hotel continues to grow in popularity. Line Out Bar has undergone major renovations and its efficiency and use of space has improved along with excellent décor. Food is still the same....and as tasty as ever! Accommodation and rooms faultless and comfortable. The Dublin area is suffering a shortage of accommodation at the moment so rates have been hiked. Still good value here at the Sandymount, and overall the friendliness and efficiency of staff and management is they jewel in their crown. Good to see Beatrice as Friendly and Glamorous as ever.....No need ever for changes there!",5,2017,07,11
247,Surprisingly good location,"This renovated hotel seems a little far from the center of Dublin, but the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) is a short walk away and the city center is easily reached, as are the coastal towns to the south. The rooms were very nice and they serve a good breakfast. There is an elevator that goes to the ground floor for luggage and easier access.",4,2017,07,11
247,Christopher made this hotel stay the best for us,"Usually I talk about the hotel, but this time I want to talk about the people at this hotel.  My husband and I were walking around Dublin and like most men he thought he could get us back to the hotel.  In the end, we were lost.  He asked a woman in a crosswalk if she knew where the hotel was.  Meanwhile, a boy walked up to me looking like he needed to tell me something.  I said, ""Tell me.""  He said, ""I work there - do you want me to walk you?""  Heck yea!  We walked and talked and you know I never asked his name.  But he told me how he rides a bus 1 hour and then walks approx. .5 miles to the hotel.  he would work til 10p that night and be due back at 6a in the morning for our breakfast!

We made it safe and sound to the hotel.  We were in such a rush to get to dinner (our tour bus was leaving) we told the boy thanks and ran to the bus.  That night I told my husband that I wanted to take that boy home with us!  He was so kind and such a cutie-pie and we both really appreciated his willingness to help us.

Knowing we couldn't just take a child home with us - we decided instead to find him and give him some money.  We went to the restaurant and the waitress in the lounge was so helpful and found him for us.  When he came out I just hugged his neck and thanked him again.  I told him we wanted to give him some money for helping us and he said, ""are you sure??""  YES I was.  We gave him the money, chatted for a minute, hugged him again and left.

The Sandymount Hotel was fine, but this boy made our trip.  As it is family operated I called the manager and told him what happened and let him know that even OUTSIDE the hotel his employees are looking out for their guests. I urged him to find Christopher and thank him as well.  He said he would and I hope he did!",5,2017,07,10
247,Very pretty yard,Enjoyed access to sandymount village. Even though it was further from city center staff was most helpful with transportation. The front exposure well manicured and was somewhat misleading as to the actual interiors,3,2017,07,10
247,Faultless hotel in perfect location.,Perfect hotel experience and great location to combine a beach/seaside holiday with a city break. You can have a peaceful walk by the river or along the Strand or travel into Dublin's centre via the Dart railway. Only takes a few minutes and is cheap.,5,2017,07,08
247,Wonderful hotel,"We have stayed several times over many years and we're delighted to enjoy the refurbished surroundings! We had a fabulous room, spotlessly clean, with great towelling robes and slippers.
Staff at reception, in particular Beatrice, were so welcoming and accommodating. Beatrice even offered that the Manager would drop us to our dinner booking in Marios, Sandymount. It was such a lovely evening that we actually walked there (very close by!)
The area is very tranquil and so close the the DART station for trips to the city. We will definitely be back!
",5,2017,07,07
247,Great neighborhood,"The absolutely best part about this hotel is the neighborhood. It is in such a quiet area and it feels very safe. Although it would be a good walk to the city center, it is very short walk to the DART station and you can be at the city center in 5 minutes once you get on the DART. The only downside to this hotel is the layout. While it is beautiful, it can be pretty confusing to get around. Additionally, this hotel does not have air conditioning which was pretty rough on the days we visited because it was pretty hot those days.",4,2017,07,05
247,Very Comfortable Stay,"My husband and I visited this past June for our honeymoon and have nothing but great things to say. The location is great because it's not quite in the heart of Dublin so it's a lot quieter than some of the hotels in Dublin. You may want to check what's going on at the Aviva Stadium ahead of time though, as I'm sure the area is a lot busier/louder when there are football matches going on. The room was very clean, comfortable and updated with a very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. We decided to include breakfast in our room reservation which was a good idea because the buffet was very extensive and there never seemed to be a time too busy to stay there and have a nice big breakfast. The front desk staff was very helpful. We decided to do a hop-on, hop-off tour bus which they sold passes for. The grounds are beautiful inside and out. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in a nice, reasonably-priced hotel in Dublin.",5,2017,07,05
247,Great Hotel,After many many visits to this hotel over the years it is still such a pleasure to return.  A warm welcome awaits you and with all the refurbishments now complete the hotel is looking in great condition.  I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Sandymount Hotel for a stay when visiting Dublin's fair city.,5,2017,07,05
247,"Some rooms are small, dark and stuffy.","Dreadful twin room allocated. In fairness staff begrudgingly moved us to a beautiful well appointed spacious room. Food good in bar. Definitely not a suitable hotel for anyone disabled, too many stairs complicated routes to rooms. Easy to get to city on train. Have stayed many cheaper nicer places in Dublin.",3,2017,07,05
247,Nice,A great place to stay. The staff are extremely friendly. The location is excellent . I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a stay in Dublin. Im running out of things to say.,5,2017,07,03
247,Very nice and quiet hotel,"Very near to centre from Dublin. 
Our room  (with 1 double bed and 2 single beds) has have a reasonable size.
The bathroom altough.
The breakfest was great and teh Service service really good.
Our stay in the Hotel was perfekt.",5,2017,07,03
247,Great location & Friendly staff,"The location of this hotel is just fantastic. Within walking distance of the Aviva stadium, the Dart station and the village of Sandymount. From arriving to Leaving we were looked after very well. The room was very comfortable as was the bed. The facilities in the room were excellent and in the hotel generally. The breakfast was a well laid self-service buffet with hot full irish option. The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful.",5,2017,07,01
247,good,Hotel was great for Aviva but stains on carpet in room was not great and no blinds or curtains in bathroom was off putting you were getting out of bath/shower right beside window so people outside could see a person not nice for the person on shower,4,2017,06,28
247,Would visit again.,The location was good for getting into town and as we were travelling as a group with cars the able parking was ideal. Both the train or a site seeing bus are within easy walking distance of the hotel.,5,2017,06,27
247,An enjoyable stay,Room was comfortable as was the bed.  Good facilities in the room and in the hotel generally.  Breakfast had a good self-service variety of options.  Staff throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful to a fault.,5,2017,06,27
247,Great Hotel,"It was my first time staying at this hotel. With it's proximity to the Aviva Stadium (virtually under the stand) and RDS, the Sandymount offers an excellent location and value for money. The Lansdowne road DART station is just around the corner making the city centre just minutes away. It also has a secure carpark. Will be my first port of call when staying in Dublin from now on.",4,2017,06,26
247,Nice Hotel in a great location,The hotel is comfortable and clean throughout. The staff are very friendly and helping. Onsite parking is free. The rooms are very well presented and the stay here represented excellent value. Location wise it's perfect - literally across the street from the Aviva Stadium. Less than 10 minute walk to Ballsbridge and a quick taxi hop into town. ,4,2017,06,26
247,Comfortable Dublin,"Good location for city and ferry. The rooms were comfortable. The bar food was good and the breakfast had a great variety and the staff were very pleasant. Nice clean modern bathrooms. Rooms smaller, but for our short stay it was great. It was nice to have free parking.",4,2017,06,25
247,Great Hotel!!!,"Easy walk into Dublin Centre with great food, drink and best of all, very friendly and helpful staff. Parking was easy, and it's an short walk to the Sandymount neighborhood with some very cute shops.",5,2017,06,25
247,Excellent,"Real value for money. Tea and coffee making facility in all rooms and a safe,iron and hairdryer. Bar is good as is the restaurant. We had a very tasty irish breakfast for around 13 euros. Rooms are clean with housekeeping service everyday. Staff are very helpful and welcoming. We will definitley stay here again.",5,2017,06,25
247,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, further out than we thought but worth it. Just very warm in the room at night. Breakfast was delicious, plenty of choice. Quiet location, great choice of beers at the bar, start all very friendly ",4,2017,06,24
247,Value for Money,"The hotel looks great. Facade, gardens. Gardener was friendly :).  Interiors were immaculate. Room size was appropriate. Service was very good. Value for money really. So overall my boyfriend and I and our friends were satisfied with our stay. Will definitely not hesitate to recommend this hotel or come back in future. ",4,2017,06,24
247,GOOD OVERNIGHT STAY,"Stayed at this hotel as it was very close to Dublin port.
Check in and check out was excellent by very friendly staff.
Room was nicely decorated, clean and comfortable.
Some staff in the restaurant seemed slow and inexperienced but were friendly and we got there in the end so not a problem.  Dinner was good, and so was breakfast.
Ideal place to stay for a night or two.",4,2017,06,24
247,Best for Everything,"Great location, lovely hotel with the best staff ever. Great parking, free wi-fi. Great breakfasts, excellent bar food. Cannot be beaten for care and attention from staff in all areas at all times. Love this Hotel",5,2017,06,23
247,A very good overall choice,Sandymount Hotel is situated in a quite area at of Dublin near Aviva Stadium. It is a very good location within two stops from the center of Dublin using the DART. The hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly and helpfull. I would definatelly recomend this hotel.,4,2017,06,21
247,Very good location,"Very good location for concerts will certainly stay again for that purpose. Staff where helpful , we moved rooms the second night and second room was so much nicer , would definitely request that room on a return visit ",4,2017,06,20
247,The Good Bad and ugly,"There are both positives and negatives to my stay. The four stars awarded are for the location which is perfect the rooms that modern spotless and very comfortable and the lovely beer garden, right beside the Aviva stadium this hotel should be the spot to stay in BUT 
You might as well be one of  the thousands of patrons on match day everybody and anybody arrive at the hotel bar and toilets it doesn't matter that you paid €395 for the night you have to get your beer in a plastic cup until it runs out que for the toilet or go back to your room. I was told I had to put my credit card on the system in case we needed to pay for meals and drinks but when I got to the bar they said cash only. Back down to the room, nobody seems to be in charge and some of the staff looked lost untrained and overwhelmed oviously in just to serve the crowds of non resident's. I am sure it is a great place to stay when there are no events on but don't charge 4 star prices for 1 star service, let your customers know what happens on event days so they can decide if there happy to pay for it. I noticed a large number of German guest shocked at the way the quite 4 star hotel looked more like a 1 star bed and breakfast change. There is no advantage in paying nearly €395 on an event day as all you get is parking. I would like to finish with a positive the Staff had left a half bottle of wine for my wife's birthday I think they ment anniversary  as it was our 23rd so thanks for the gift but not for the crowded bar with plastic cups and running out of drinks and the restaraunt delays and no seating for hotel paying guests ",4,2017,06,20
247,room an service,"Room was very clear, everthing insinde what I need, bed was comfortable, bud it was very dark.
Service at any time was very good, people where every time frendly and helpful, especally the breakfast was very good,  thank you.                                ",4,2017,06,20
247,nice and clean but noisy,"Very good location, room was very clean- to a high standard. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. The only downside was the fact that  it was quite noisy, we could hear (quite loudly) people talking in rooms next to us and on corridor. ",3,2017,06,20
247,A great stay!,A lovely quiet hotel with the personal touch of an independent hotel! Staff were all friendly and very helpful. So close to the Avila Stadium and walking distance to the 3Arena! Will definitely be back!,5,2017,06,19
247,Great place - questionable service,"I truly enjoyed the Sandymount Hotel, great place; they invested a lot in the renovation. Service and responsiveness of the staff needs to be worked on, Had a few issues (pigeon noise during the night, bad TV signal, safe unaccessable) that have not been fixed during a five night stay.",3,2017,06,19
247,Opinion of hotel,I had a good experience this time around the room was a little bigger than the 1time. For us very convenient location. We will be staying again . the restaurant has good food and very friendly service. The facility for computer's and printing excellent the atmosphere of hotel  is calm and easy going and efficient at the same time ,4,2017,06,18
247,Stop off on the way to the aviva ,"I guess they do what they can to take advantage of the close proximity to the Aviva. Bar service as expected, but I expected my food to be good......Pasta Carbonara was disappointing, pasta sad, sauce watery.....should have got a hot dog out front......could smell the BBQ in the restaurant anyway so really shouldn't have ventured inside ",2,2017,06,17
247,Most Underrated Hotel Ever,"Stayed for one night last Wednesday for a concert. It was my first time visiting Dublin so I wanted to make sure the location was right when booking. Sandymount is perfectly located about 15 minutes (On foot) from the 3Arena, 30 minutes to the city centre and just 5 minutes from the Aviva stadium. The area surrounding the hotel is quiet and very pleasant.

The hotel itself offered a lovely standard room which was clean, comfortable and modern whilst the restaurants in the hotel can offer a large array of fantastic food and selection of drinks. The staff were all incredibly helpful and happy and did their job perfectly, making us relaxed in our stay. If I were to return to Dublin, I certainly would not consider staying anywhere else other than Sandymount.",5,2017,06,17
247,Lovely hotel & Great customer service!,"I stayed in this lovely hotel for two nights and had a fantastic time! The hotel is a five minute walk to the train station which is only two stops away from the City centre. The local village is beautiful and contains many nice cafes and restaurants. The hotel itself has been recently refurbished and is very modern inside. We only had one meal during our stay however it was delicious! Staff were excellent in particular a charming smiley young man Hugh who helped us with our bags and gave us directions to the local amenities. The room was comfortable, location excellent, away from the noisy city yet very close, and staff were very accommodating. We will definitely be staying again !",5,2017,06,16
247,to recommend,"- best service, nice staff
- the rooms are small but cleany and very comfortable
- the location is very good, nearly to the stadium and a few minutes to the city centre with DART
- all in all it was great
",5,2017,06,15
247,"Sandymount, always a pleasure","When in Dublin we always choose Sandymount. This hotel is lovely inside and out. The rooms are spacious and clean, the athmosphere is excellent and the remodelling of these beautiful old buildings has been done very well. The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is always good. We'll be back.",5,2017,06,14
247,Delightful Hotel Next to Aviva Stadium,"Great hotel which I visited at very busy time., Staff were friendly , extremely helpful and dealt with pressures with consummate ease . Rooms were extremely comfortable and well furnished.Bathrooms in particular had an excellent range of toiletries",5,2017,06,14
247,A night in Dublin,"After a very warm wellcome from the reception desk, we found our room clean and cosy furnished. Room itself was a little bit small, but for one night, this was acceptable for us. Bathroom was brandnew and very clean. The hotel itself is situated conveniently close to bus and railway station as well as to the Aviva Stadium. We are sure to book again Sandymount Hotel on our next trip to Dublin.
D+R, Switzerland",5,2017,06,13
247,Lovely setting for a lovely lunch,"My wife, wee boy and myself stopped off here for lunch. The staff are friendly and were brilliant in helping us get some food prepared for our son's lunch.
I had the brioche and bacon with maple syrup. It was the best bacon that I have ever tasted! You have got to try it when you come here!

We sat in a  corner at a window in the Line Out Bar. It was nice and quiet, but not too quiet. 
If we are looking for a hotel on the south-side of the city, we may look at this one. It has a nice feel to it, warm friendly staff.",4,2017,06,13
247,very busy on ball game nights,"Rooms are on the smaller side, especially for American travelers (queen bed if I remember correctly).  But the rooms were clean with decent bathrooms. It's a very long hotel with quite narrow and many branching hallways.
Breakfast buffet was always good, tour group dinner was poor one night, excellent a week later.  Staff was cordial and always ready to assist, whether at the front desk, restaurant, or room staff.  Both Saturday nights we were there had a ball game at Aviva Stadium less than 2 blocks away.  Lively evenings with hotel run burger and beer booths in their lot catering to the stadium crowd.",4,2017,06,11
247,excellent hotel,"The food was very delicious. Excellent Hotel with excellent services. It has good location, next to one train stop. Bar is nice. Staff was helpful. Room was very small but had a nice big window. My room was wonderfully quiet.",5,2017,06,11
247,Excellent,"Sandymount hotel is a lovely family run hotel. We have stayed here on several occasions. The hotel has good car parking facilities and is conveniently located to the Dart.  The village of Sandymount is a very pleasant stroll away. Staff are very friendly, professional and helpful.  The hotel is very clean and the rooms have excellent facilities.  The breakfasts are lovely - plenty to eat, and the meals served in the Line Out Bar are delicious. We will certainly stay in Sandymount Hotel when we next visit Dublin.",5,2017,06,11
247,Visit in June 2017,"Good location, fine service, breakfast with many dishes and a very good coffee, quiet, clean and well equipped room. Only dissapointment: the room was placed in the basement with a close view to parked cars",4,2017,06,11
247,totally satisfied,"Just returned from our stay in Dublin. Wonderful city and a lovely accomodation. We were very satisfied. Everybody in the hotel was very polite and friendly and if we needed help, we got it. We had a large room and a new bathroom, which was very clean. The Line Out Bar was nice and dinner was very good.",4,2017,06,10
247,Would go back anytime,"This hotel is in a perfect spot - just 3 DART stops from Temple Bar, but outside of the city enough to be an oasis of quiet and calm. Loved the setup and our room, it was small, but perfect. Everything was in great shape, clean and the staff was wonderful and most helpful at all times. Sandymount and Ballsbridge are two wonderful parts of Dublin and there are plenty of restaurants and pubs within 10-15 minutes walking distance of this hotel.",5,2017,06,10
247,Charming!,"You may get a bit confused at first trying to find your room; up down across ... but once you get into it - it's a part of the charm. I stayed in the executive suite - rather large well functioning room. 
The breakfast buffet has a good choice of well prepared food. Excellent service! ",4,2017,06,10
247,Staying at athe Sandymount,"As I have already said,  the special 19th century feel of a Dublin townhouse is really gone.  Just another hotel.  Bar is nice.  Staff helpful.  Room was very small but had a nice big window.  Decorations kind of bizarre.  So much grey.",3,2017,06,09
247,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Excellent hotel - quiet room, friendly staff","First time to stay here and I will definitely be back. I normally stay right in the city centre for work but this hotel is only 10 mins drive away and worth it! 

Stayed in room 206 and it was wonderfully quiet...had a full ten hours uninterrupted sleep (which I needed!). Ordered dinner via room service and it came within ten minutes which is great for a hotel that's so large. Same with breakfast in the morning....and only €3 tray charge which again is worth it. 

Check in staff were helpful and friendly and so were staff who delivered food to the room. 

Room was average size and very clean. Great shower! Comfortable bed and plenty of pillows. 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR BUSINESS TRAVELLERS!",5,2017,06,09
247,A lovely and uneventful stay,"This hotel did not look anything special from the outside but it was huge from the inside. 
It is  excellently run offering anything a traveler might need.The rooms are big enough, very well maintained. The beds are super comfortable. I have seen very spacious rooms next to the lifts.
The girls at the receptions were wonderful answering all my question about where to go and what was worth seeing. They also personally took care of our luggage. Even the cleaning lady was very helpful and friendly.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is outside the city centre in a lovely neighbourhood/village. The train and bus services are near but disabled people might have to use mainly taxis.",5,2017,06,09
247,Up for the Match,"Brilliant location for the Aviva Stadium. Great staff. All very .friendly and helpful. Nice, chilled and relaxed atmosphere in the Bar. We had a late lunch in the restaurant which was lovely and good value. Again the restaurant staff were terrific. I would highly recommend the Sandymount Hotel.",5,2017,06,07
247,Perfect ,"My daughter had booked a trip for her dad and I for my 50th ,in order to book a hotel for our stay she entered 2 things  friendliness of the staff and Cleanliness. up popped the Sandymount Hotel 
This Hotel is everything it promised and everything she asked for ...We had a wonderful stay.All staff were friendly, in particular Beatrice who meet us on our first day with a lovely free upgrade as someone had in formed them that it was my 50th ( still no idea who)
Our room was lovely clean fresh and  bright, to say the bed was comfy  would be a understatement my husband and i slept so sound we surprised ourselves by getting a solid 9hrs !!! Both nights !!!! This hotel is a mere train ride away from the heart of Dublin..Perfect !! ",5,2017,06,07
247,A real gem of a hotel.,"The only negative part of this review is that I never heard of this hotel before I booked it which was a real shame as I have missed out on so many Great stays..I will Definitely be booking again.
The whole process was seemless and a really great selling point is the free customer parking offered which is a rarity in Dublin especially yards from Aviva stadium...Upon arriving onsite we were greated by a lovely well mannered receptionist who had a great sense of humour, she is an asset in her role. The reception is lovely and when we got to our room I was blown away with the great comfortable size and decor...It was a really relaxing room with a comfortable bed which the room let you know you were staying away but you have the home comforts. I can't wait to book again. The only call out is I went to the Bar for a drink at 21:00 and they were serving in plastic cups which was off putting so we walked to a different bar to get a drink in a glass...I'm aware there was a football match earlier in the day in the Aviva. But this would not stop me from booking again....The next time I can't wait to try the food as it looked and smelled delicious.",5,2017,06,07
247,Great Hotel and Location,"We stayed for 5 nights in Sandymount and it was really nice. Quiet, great quality, nice breakfast. Only the restaurant food was not more than ""ok"".

The staff was really helpful, especially when we needed assistance getting a rental car. ",5,2017,06,07
247,Excellent stay,"Loved staying here, beautiful environment that was comfortable and clean. Excellent staff who went that extra mile.  The restaurant food was good value and delicious.  The area was really good and handy for the Dart.",5,2017,06,05
247,"Friendly, well maintained and reasonably priced hotel","Very reasonable prices for Dublin considering location close to DART rail, local amenities and pleasant 20 minute canal side walk to the regenerated Docklands area. Well appointed and nicely maintained hotel with individual character - not a bland corporate box. Friendly and helpful staff.",4,2017,06,05
247,Nice hotel with friendly staff,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  Rooms were clean.  Staff was friendly.  Easy to walk to buses, Dart, or into city.  Though the walk was about 30 mins to get to Trinity college.  There is also a walking path we used to get up to a few dinner spots.",4,2017,06,03
247,Helps put the pleasure into a leisure trip.,"A very positive experience. Good first impressions and a Goldilocks location;not too far from the centre, not too near, in fact just right. The reception staff were amazing. They were extremely helpful to a couple who have never been to Dublin before, connected us with both the tour bus companies and the nearby 'village'. The parking was a bonus, safe and worry free. The breakfast deal is great value for money and the breakfast room is well presented and the staff polite and friendly with great service skills.",4,2017,06,02
247,Great hotel in a nice area of Dublin,"I have used the hotel on numerous occasions when I need stay in Dublin.  Although this  is a 3 star hotel it definitely feels more like 4 star,  It is right beside the Aviva Stadium and only 3 minutes walk to the train which is very handy for getting about.  Id have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and I have done to my colleagues who are now frequenting the hotel.  Toni in reservations is brilliant and nothing is ever too much trouble.  Very friendly and efficient and somehow manages to remember me every time!  The bar is recently renovated and its a great place to sit and relax.  I haven't yet stayed for match weekends but I have heard from other guests its the place to be!  Oh and book direct and you will get the best rate, always worth a call / email rather than using travel sites something I have now learned.",4,2017,06,02
247,Excellent facility.,We family and I had been traveling through Europe for a six week vacation. A friend suggested we stay here based on their previous stay. They told us about the close proximity to public transportation and how helpful the staff was. We did not regret it. ,5,2017,06,02
247,Great Location,"Excellent stay for one night to attend an event at RDS arena. Less than 10 mins drive away. Hotel has everything needed, only the corridors are a bit small so 2 people may not pass through at the same time everywhere. Good food at hotel restaurant, room was clean and wifi signal strong enough for work.",5,2017,06,02
247,Great first night in Ireland!,We started our tour of Ireland in Dublin and stayed at the Sandymount.  The staff at reception were very helpful and gave us good directions to Dublin where we visited the Guinness Storehouse. We were able to walk to the DART and took a train into Dublin and we didn't get lost!  We enjoyed a nice group dinner that night and a full Irish breakfast in the morning which were both delicious.

Check restaurant not booked for private functions.
Location excellent especially for Aviva Stadium events.
Staff extremely friendly and helpful.",5,2017,05,31

247,Great Weekend stay,"Once again Sandymount Hotel has surpassed itself! My daughter and I stayed this last weekend as we were going to the rugby. We had a wonderful time as before at the Sandymount.  Everything was super - the bedroom, facilities, the food (scrumptious) and the staff were one and all very friendly and so efficient.   Must make a special mention to Michele (waiter in the Lineout Bar) who was such a personable and courteous young man.  It was my daughter's first visit and she will certainly want to stay here with her family in the future (as will I).  Well done one and all (shame about the rugby!).",5,2017,05,30
247,Comfortable as ever,"Regularly stay in this hotel while on business in the Ballsbridge area. Have noticed that it has become more difficult to secure a room at short notice which is testimony to how busy this hotel is. Staff from front of house to bar/wait staff are always friendly & helpful. Room was modern with tea/coffee facilities, quality bathroom. Despite how busy the hotel is there is never a problem with late night noise which is important particularly for large numbers of business travellers who frequent the place. My first choice when seeking accommodation in D4 area..... just book in time!",4,2017,05,29

Our request for a quiet room was met, despite it being a busy rugby weekend, we heard no noise from our room. 
We had a large room, with a comfortable bed and many convenient facilities, such as an ironing board, safe, tea and coffee making facilities. 
The bar and restaurant were also very pleasant, good breakfast and dinner. 
Helpful staff. 
Very close to Sandymount village where you can find small pubs,restaurants,convenience stores etc...
The price was fine for the first two nights,the third night was pricey as this was clearly a very busy bank holiday weekend in Dublin. All in all a very enjoyable stay.",5,2017,05,29
247,feel good hotel,"good location , very polite staff and good food as well in the hotel restaurant. The hotel is a good choice if you want to stay near Galway ( by taxi 10 minutes to town centre, approx. 10 € ) Disadvantage are the poorly soundproofed rooms.",4,2017,05,29
247,Weekend away ,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Superb customer service and we are leaving fully satisfied. If only the staff could have done something about the rain...although we were immediately provided with a huge umbrella. I suppose the the rest is in the lap of the gods. Fully recommended.

A five minute walk from the dart train station into Dublin centre(7euros return). A ten minute drive from the port.

247,PIty about Noise,Room was very noisy and could hear every movement above you which was unfortunate when you have people arriving late in to the room talking loudly and every footstep heard in our room below. Certainly check you are not in a lower ground room when booking. EVentually Complaint made to management who dealt with the problem. ACess to room also difficult with stairs both up and down having to be accesses with suitcases so no lift. ROom itself was clean and comfortable and staff friendly.,3,2017,05,24

247,"Affordable, quiet and classy","The hotel is located very near the Lansdowne Road DART train station and from there you can reach Dublin city center in a 10 minutes ride to Tara street station. It's located in a residential area, so it's very quite and being away from the city center, quite affordable. Rooms seems to be newly renovated and the beds are very comfortable. I had trouble adjusting the heating, but it wasn't annoying. The breakfast was a nice experience, modest in choices but quite good. All in all, I was very satisfied.",5,2017,05,23
247,Perfect for business,"A relaxed place, great if you are fed up with giant, standardized hotels and prefere something more human. Silent and well equipped room, good breakfast. DART train station to downtown at a very few minutes walk.",4,2017,05,22

Next time I got an occasion to visit Dublin , I'll choose Sandymount notwithstanding I have information on other hotels surrounded either in the center .

247,Recommendable hotel,"Good location, the hotel is easy to reach.
The staff offer an excellent service. The rooms are modern, well equipped and just big enough. Partially the rooms are a bit noisy (sloping doors, thin walls). International TV programs are also missing. The Internet access is fast and stable. The selection of the breakfast buffet is good and the food is tasty.",4,2017,05,22
247,Smart hotel. Breakfast pricey for what was available.,"This was a two night stay whilst visiting relative in Dublin. The room was really quiet although there was a very quiet generator in the background. The room was kept very clean and well stocked with tea coffee milk etc. The shower was lovely, very clean and modern. The only criticism I have is that when I paid 12 euros for breakfast, the tea and coffee were really weak. The coffee was instant and the waitresses brought it round to me, I couldn't have a pot to myself. The bacon was really dry and not tasty at all and there was a tv blaring on the wall which was quite distasteful. The receptionists were foreign and so there was a slight language barrier. I thought the price for the room was a little bit extortionate although for the area the hotel is in I guess it's the going rate.",3,2017,05,21
247,Friendly and helpful staff,"A great place to stay. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive to our needs. Good location since it is near Dart train station, a couple of minutes away from the city centre. Rooms were very clean and spacious. Highly recommended.",5,2017,05,21

247,Enjoyable time,"The attention in the dining room is excellent. The team worked round the tables constantly checking if anything was required. Best of all each staff member could do all jobs so no waiting for your own server.
Delicious food and smallish menu which I always appreciate.",4,2017,05,18
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Nice place, friendly staff, clean rooms, good restaurant and sitting room, a neighborhood type atmosphere, but a bit out of the way if you are looking to cruise the City Center. A 10-$@15 Euro taxi ride each way to the City Center. ",4,2017,05,18
247,Good Hotel,Sandymount Hotel was our starting and ending point of our trip on the wild atlantic way. It was very good. Breakfast was tasty and the Bar is a very good place to get Dinner and a Pint of Guiness. The rooms were clean and the bed very good.,4,2017,05,17
247,Dublin weekend,Excellent hotel from which to travel into Dublin city. Quiet location and 10 min walk to Sandymount village and beach or 5 min walk to train (2 stops) into the city or to the Aviva Stadium. Sandymount village has good selection of restaurants and coffee shops,5,2017,05,17
247,Beautiful Hotel some slight niggles,"Hotel is just lovely, such a nice location only 2 minutes walk to the train station.  We walked into Stephens Green and it was a nice leisurely 30 minutes.  Rooms were bright and airy.  Corridors are small and can be a bit confusing however it is lots of terraced houses now broken into one big hotel which I personally love and it makes it stand out from all the hotel square boxed hotels with no charm.  We paid a fair price and the nice girl on the phone offered us a complementary breakfast for booking direct.  So might be worth a call or drop them an email to see what they can offer.  Breakfast was nice although I would like to have a bit more local foods and just a few extra touches to finish it off, I think if I had paid €14 I would have been slightly disappointed.   My main gripe was reception, the girls just had no interest and on check out one had a very stern look and was almost angry when dealing with us.  It has stuck in my memory which is unfortunate as I loved everything else about the hotel.  I spoke with the owner on my last morning which was a nice touch.  Will definitely return and hope to see much happier reception desk on my next visit.  Oh and the pints of Guinness in the new bar were DEVINE!!!!",4,2017,05,16
247,"Friendly, helpful hotel","Well placed to get into Dublin, with staff who went that extra mile. Full of advice & recommendations, they checked out taxis & routes for us. Very well staffed.
Excellent breakfast , with very varied choice.",5,2017,05,16
247,Weekend Away,"Good location in SE Dublin, right next to Lansdowne Road/Aviva Stadium if you're viewing the sports, or a 20 min walk to the 3 Arena for concerts (Take That with All Saints are brilliant BTW!).
Very comfortable and clean hotel with modern rooms and good facilities.  Buffet breakfast was plentiful, we didn't use the bar or other meals as we were out and about in this great city.  Reception very helpful with travel info, and free left luggage facility.
Transport is easy from the local (3 min walk) Dart (that's the metro) station.  4 Euro return price to Dublin centre just 10 mins away.  You can walk to the centre - Temple Bar area, in around 40 mins if you're feeling energetic.",4,2017,05,16
247,Sandymount Hotel visit,I had email problems and the safe did not work even when I reported it. They could not resolve the problem. The food and drink was acceptable. The room service food was a limited choice. The reception desk and main bar service was very good.,3,2017,05,15
247,A return to Dublin,We stayed here some years ago & on returning to Dublin for a 2nd visit we had no hesitation in choosing this hotel as we'd had such a good experience the last time. The hotel has clearly been refurbished and had a name change since our previous visit but the warmth and friendliness of the staff was the same as before.,5,2017,05,15
247,Another stay,The usual good quality available in this Hotel continues to be available to guests. This time an issue arose with some birds heard in the attic above the room. This was being dealt with when I contacted the Receptionist and was resolved satisfactorily. Disappointment with non-availability of corporate rate on this visit has been outlined above. ,4,2017,05,15
247,Trip to AVIVA Stadium,Excellent hotel. Very helpful and friendly staff. Food really good and great value for money. Perfect location to AVIVA Stadium which we were attending.

247,Great place,Stayed with two friends for two days at the  start of our Ireland road trip.  The location was quiet but had easy access to the city center (near bus stops and DART sop).  The  room was clean and well presented. I left my phone there when we checked out and the staff  went the extra mile to make cure I got it back.  They called my mom in the States and I circled back at the end of our trip to pick it up.,5,2017,05,09
247,Very Helpful Staff,"We had a four night stay at the Sandymount at the start of our Ireland trip.  Due to the long flight from Canada's west coast we decided to take a taxi from the airport. The cost for this was 45 euros since the hotel is in the southern part of Dublin.  We arrived quite early and they stick checked us in at noon.

We had the room right in the middle of the stairs. It was a little noisy during the day, but once we got over our jet lag we found it quiet at night.  It was quite a roomy space for the two of us.  Nice bathtub.  Toiletries were provided.  They tidied the room for us each day.

The location of the hotel is in a nice quiet residential neighbourhood.  It's just steps from the Aviva stadium though, so you might want to check ahead on any rugby games as it must be very busy on those days.  Its only about 10 minutes or so to lots of restaurants and a couple of grocery stores.  It's only 2 or 3 stops on the DART train into downtown (depending on where you want to go).  Tickets can be bought from a machine or an attendant.

The front desk staff was very helpful to us.  We asked lots of questions and needed help using the printer/computer centre as well and the staff never seemed bothered when assisting us.

Don't know if we'll ever get back to Dublin but if we do, we'd stay here again.",4,2017,05,09
247,Happy Customer,"We stayed here in January for two nights, we had a gig at Three Arena and again in May for same reason.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.

Made sure everything was perfect, even introduced us to the owner who was just as nice. Wouldn't change a thing. As a matter of fact we plan on staying once more at the end of our trip. ",5,2017,05,09
247,Happy to be back in Ireland,The hotel was very nice. Unfortunately we only got to eat breakfast at the hotel once bc of early tours. I wish breakfast hours were listed on the booking page when booking. The staff was very friendly. ,4,2017,05,08

247,Fantastic Stay,"I booked to stay here as a surprise to my husband for his 50th birthday. I emailed the hotel prior to arrival to mention we were staying as a special occasion. I was unaware that a semi final Rugby match was on at the Aviva stadium close by.
Although this was very close by and the hotel busy we were located n a beautiful room at the rear of the hotel which was very quiet.
On arrival the hotel had left a bottle of lovely red wine with 2 glasses and a note to my husband congratulating him on his special birthday.
Hotel was lovely, room excellent, public transport into city easy, dart only a few minutes away. Got air coach from airport which dropped us not too far away from hotel for 14 euro each return. bought tickets from outside airport.

Again our experience was great.  Room, food and service were all tremendous.

They were all so pleasant and efficient.  We have already booked for next year!",5,2017,05,03

Staff very pleasant, would stay again. ",5,2017,05,03

247,Herd of Elephants on the fire escapes,Patrons from the hotel using fire escapes to exit their rooms from 10am however there were no issues with hotel lifts and no fires at this property. When paying to have a relaxing stay I expect to be able to wake up feeling refreshed and not to feel like there is an earthquake outside my room !,3,2017,05,03
247,Love staying here!,"It is a lovely hotel, and has been refurbished recently.  My husband and I had a lovely  experience when we stayed.   We were made feel very welcome by Beatrice, and were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to an Executive Suite!  The location is excellent, as it is close to the DART Station, also if you're attending a match at the Aviva Stadium, it is right on your doorstep.   I have stayed there many times, and have always enjoyed the experience ... at the moment they are adding a patio, barbecue area to the garden, which should be amazing!",5,2017,05,02
247,Lovely Hotel with excellent food,The hotel itself is nice and modern. The food in both the bar and restaurant was top notch. Breakfast the next morning was lovely and well stocked. Staff are all friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay again!!,5,2017,05,02

247,"Sandymount Hotel, Dublin",A good venue.  Could hear noise in room overhead.  Staff super friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was included and was very nicely provided for.  Close to Dart so transportation was convenient.  Also has a small but good shopping area nearby.,4,2017,05,01
247,Munster Fans from Limerick,"Nice hotel, fantastic location for Aviva stadium - attended rugby match, handy walk to Ballsbridge and a longer but manageable walk to city centre. Have used this hotel several times. On this trip the room seemed very small in comparison to other times we have stayed in a different part of the building.",4,2017,04,30
247,"Comfortable, good location,","This family run hotel has been completely refurbished and is a charming, smart and a very comfortable place to stay. The bedrooms are well appointed, with great beds and good bed linen, luxurious carpets and curtains and in-room tea/coffee making facilities.
Helpful, polite and friendly staff address all queries from theatre tickets to public transport to taxis.
Popular with rugby fans because of the superb location right next to the Avila stadium, it holds its own even when there's no match (this place is rugby central on match days) and the food on offer is varied,tasty and hugely affordable.
Easy to get to city centre either by public transport or taxi but in such a quiet location that it's a treat to return to at the end of a days shopping or a night out in town.
It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for",4,2017,04,30
247,Don't go on match day,We went up for a match but the carvery was lukewarm and at 15 euro a bit steep.  We loved it was so close to the Aviva stadium but we could not return the same way so it meant a 35 minute walk back asking the gaurds directions,4,2017,04,30
247,Business friendly,"Very nice hotel with great WiFi. My 2-night stay was very quick, stuff was very friendly and responded to my questions promptly. Breakfast is definitely worth the upgrade. 15-min walking distance to Google HQ.",5,2017,04,30
247,"Clean, Friendly Staff but very noisy.",The only problem i had was noise related. I am quite a heavy sleeper however was kept awake the first night of stay by the person snoring in the next room. It sounded like they were in my room. And the second morning at about 5am there was movement in the room above me all i could hear was stamping around and doors banging. Needless to say i was exhausted getting home after the 2 night stay got very little sleep. ,3,2017,04,29

Clean and modern but retaining some lovely original features in the public areas.
Breakfast choice and quality was great, staff very attentive and checking everything constantly. 
Had one evening meal in the bar, good food well cooked and presented / served well.
Also ate at Marios in nearby Sandymount village which was excellent. 
Would definitely recommend hotel.",5,2017,04,28
247,Easter break,THE HOTEL GOT A NEW MAKE OVER. The staff are very friendly and very helpfull. We got newspapers every day and bottled water in our room. Fresh towels and the hotel has a good recycling system there. The room was very quiet and comfortable. It was a lovely break. The food is also good and a new make over given to the bar.,5,2017,04,28
247,Pleasantly surprised,"I'm not one that usually avails of the hotel restaurants fayre but this night I fancied something 'light'. Enter the daily special of salmon with mixed seeds served on a bed of egg fried noodles with onions, peppers and chilli. Just hit the spot for a late night bite before retiring to the land of nod. Happy I 'chanced' it.",4,2017,04,27
247,Dublin visit at Easter,"I visited Dublin this Easter to attend a friend's birthday party.  I chose The Sandymount Hotel and wasn't disappointed.  Whilst it is a little further out the city centre is easily accessible via the DART train from the Lansdowne Road Station, five minutes walk from the hotel.  

I arrived early but my room was ready.  The room was spacious and clean.

I had opted for Bed and Breakfast and there was a wide variety of food and the breakfast was open until 10.30am (11am on Sunday) which meant I could have a lie in and still get a good breakfast to set me up for the day.

The hotel also has the advantage of being a 10 minute walk from the pretty Sandymount village and a further five minutes from Sandymount beach with views of Dublin Bay, which provides a different aspect to a visit to Dublin.

Finally, I got back to my room on Easter Sunday to find an Easter Egg on the bed and a note from the owners which was a lovely surprise :-)

I would definitely stay here again if visiting Dublin",5,2017,04,27
247,"Good Hotel, Great location","Great hotel, Friendly staff. Plenty of car parking and a great location.
Close to Aviva Stadium and the Dart.
The bedrooms were well furnished and the hotel had a relaxed atmosphere about it.
Friendly bar staff. 
We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on this.

247,Very nice stay in Dublin,"A nice weekend for Dutch friends visiting a capital town in Europe. Hotel at nice location, good food, drinks and service by friendly people. Suprised by friendly rugby supporters. Easy to reach from town by DART.",4,2017,04,26
247,Good location and service,"We stayed at the Sandymount Hotel for one night last weekend. The Hotel is a few minutes walk from Sandymount village and c25 mins walk to the 3 Arena which is why we chose it as we were attending a gig there. 
One other big attraction of this hotel is the free parking - which is rare to find in Dublin city. There is a large carpark and no issues finding a space. 
The room was a decent size, with comfortable bed and plenty of tea & coffee supplies. The bathroom was spotless and the heated towel rail was great to have a lovely warm towel after a shower.
We had food in the Bar and there is also a formal restaurant. The menu was varied with burgers, salmon, lamb, salads, pasta dishes and steak. The portion sizes were good and the house white wine was tasty. The food was reasonably priced and the service was very quick. 
We did not have breakfast at the Hotel as we had already made plans for the next morning.
Overall I was very happy with our stay and would definitely recommend the Sandymount Hotel. We got a good nights sleep which sometimes is difficult if you are staying in the centre and the the Hotel is only a short taxi ride into Grafton St/ O'Connell St areas and cost us €12 coming back that night. I would stay here again.",4,2017,04,26
247,Review,"I stay here for work regularly. Rooms are very clean. The breakfast is good, good variety. The bar food tastes nice, although the portions are very big. I tried to order a half or starter size portion but was not allowed and adults cannot order off the childrens menu. Very close to the train/dart station to get into the city centre.             ",4,2017,04,26
247,Loved the hotel. ,"Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. Easy, free parking and wonderful place to walk to local pubs and grocery stores. Nice park nearby and safe in the evening to stroll around.  Rooms were very clean, and the bar offers a few snacks in the evening time if you need anything. ",5,2017,04,25
247,Wonderful Hotel,This is a great family run hotel. Rooms are clean and beds very comfortable. The staff could not be more helpful and friendly. Food is lovely and servings big.

247,Fabulous to stay ,"Excellent place to stay , very very clean , very friendly staff , close to aviva stadium just 3 min walk very handy . Will back there again for next game /definitely . Delicious breakfast, and diner every portion just enough . Will tell friends to stay there if they stay in Dublin.

247,"Above and beyond, customer service at its best","It was the new mums first trip away with our newborn to see the infamous Munster. As tension was mounting in the Aviva not far away on the N7 a Mum and Baby were anxious about their first real time apart since he was born.

Any anxiety faded away once we drove through the gates on matchday. Having checked in the Head of Housekeeping advised the initial room allocated would not suit us with all the baby apparel and rallied her troops and had us in a different room within 10 minutes.

During the game the Dad (myself) and Baby were guided through a buggy friendly corridor by a lovely lady who would appear to be the head of operations for the day. We watched in a quiet and cosy lounge while the crowds had temporarily made their way to the Aviva and kept an eye on for Mum on the TV.

The staff throughout the hotel were fantastic for our stay and again helped with the large collection of Baby transport devices when we checked out.

Having stayed here before as a solo Rugby Fan, with my wife and now with the next generation would highly recommend the Sandymount.

A short walk to the Aviva, RDS and Rolys Bistro as well as the City Centre the Sandymount is a great base camp for a any trip to Dublin whether travelling solo, in a couple or with the family.

Thanks to all the staff, you were fantastic!",5,2017,04,25
247,Business stay in Dublin,"I have used the Sandymount Hotel for a number of years and weekly over the recent few months. The hotel has undergone renovation of all its public spaces as well as its bedrooms and is a clean, modern, friendly place to stay either on business or as a base to visit the attractions of Dublin. The staff are always friendly and accommodating, particularly Beatrice on reception who makes a point of remembering your name, and it is always a please to stay there.",5,2017,04,25
247,Very nice hotel.,Sandymount Hotel is a very nice hotel. Rooms are very clean and the beds were comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. The reception and lobby have just been redecorated in a lovely way.  The location is about 35 min. walk from the center of town. The train station (Dart)  is only 5 min. walk away.,4,2017,04,21
247,Excellent ,"How funny that another Hobart contributor should be staying at the same time....no relation.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We found it close to the city by DART or can walk (30 mins) which we did.
The staff, housekeeping and wait staff were great.  Nicely renovated rooms. Free parking was a bonus.
One small thing was we found the duvet a bit heavy for this time of year so just used the sheet. That's just a comment not a criticism. 
A big thank you for our easter surprise... .lovely touch.",5,2017,04,18
247,Nice stay,"Me and my partner stayed at this hotel for 4 nights this Easter.  We were booked in a double room but got triple room on arrival. The room was spotlessly clean and the shower is the best we have had in a hotel and we travel a lot. We were not lucky with hotel bed they need to buy a new mattress for room 525.Probably we were just unlucky.  All the staff were really nice and on Ester Day we got a Ester Egg waiting in our room. Nice touch :) The bar was really lovely with great coctails and drinks.The food was ok. The hotel is in a really nice neigbourhood just around 9 minutes walk to Sandymount Village where are few restaurants and bars, plus Spar shop and Tesco and ATM.  We can reccommend the indian restaurant there named India Spice.Really good food there.
There is about 12 minutes walk to Ballsbridge where you can also find some bars and restaurants. We can highly recommend the italian restaurant Belucci. We were lucky to get a table there so book online :)  
The hotel is not in the city center and It costs around 12euros to take a taxi to Grafton Street.",4,2017,04,18
247,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here with my husband and 18 year old daughter on our very first trip to Dublin. Fabulous time.  Beautiful hotel, food excellent, bedroom for 3 adults very spacious. Wonderful staff. We certainly be back again.",5,2017,04,18
247,comfortble and clean,"Reception staff were very helpful and friendly; 5 of 5. housekeeping, great! clean room (thanks) 5of 5. However, and unfortunately the dinner menu lacks any sort of imagination and our dinner was the worst we have had in the 5 weeks we've been in Ireland. The coffee was at best only luke warm, the ""lamb chops"" were tough. My 12 year old nephew can cook a better pasta meal then we were served. (by the way, my father was a butcher and I'm a chef. The wait staff were tied, lack lustre, and unenthusiastic., bordering on lazy. These days I walk with the aid of a walking stick but I still had to go to the bar to be served.",3,2017,04,17
247,Wonderful Short Stay,"I had a wonderful 2 night stay with my wife and 18 year old daughter in April 2017. I found the hotel through an internet search and was immediately attracted by its location, price and also that I was able to book a room for three adults that was not designated as a family room, but contained three single beds.

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay at the Sandymount. From the moment we arrived to check in we were impressed by the friendliness of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble; at breakfast on the second day of our stay there was no porridge left and when I asked if there was any more, after a couple of minutes the waitress arrived with a bowl that had been made specially for my daughter. Also, on the day we checked out my wife needed a plaster for a blister and the Receptionist, despite clearly being very busy, took the trouble to find some for her.

The food was lovely and plentiful.There was a good choice of hot and cold food at breakfast - the scrambled egg and bacon were very tasty but the sausages couldn't be beaten for flavour! We had lunch in the Line Out Bar, Chicken Wrap and Beef Sambo, both of which were delicious.

Our room was very clean and it was also very spacious for three adults. The beds were comfortable and we all enjoyed a good night's sleep. The bathroom was also lovely and clean. Complimentary newspaper and Wi Fi were also greatly appreciated.

The hotel is in a great location. It is so quick and easy to get in to Dublin city centre. The Dart train station on Lansdowne Road is a couple of minutes walk away and it really does take only a few minutes on the Dart to be right in the heart of Dublin; three stops to Tara Street station at a cost of only 3.95 Euros return for an adult ticket.

What is just as great about the hotel's location is that it is only a few minutes' walk away from Sandymount village, which is well worth a visit. We saw the birthplace of W B Yeats, strolled to the village green where there are busts of both Yeats and Seamus Heaney and then made the short walk from there to the promenade to get some invigorating sea air!

The River Dodder runs past the Aviva Stadium on Lansdowne Road and there is a lovely riverside walk. Look out for the quotation from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake on the wall alongside the walk.

It is very straightforward to get from Dublin airport to the Sandymount. The Aircoach service, 702 or 703, departs from right outside Terminal 1 and the coach stops outside the Ballsbridge Hotel. From there it's a 10 to 15 minute walk to the hotel. Returning to the airport, the coach picks up from the bus stop opposite the Ballsbridge Hotel. The service was on time both ways.

We really enjoyed our stay at the Sandymount and would strongly rcommend the hotel to anyone paying a visit to Dublin. We will definitely be returning soon to the Sandymount and are already looking forward to our next visit!",5,2017,04,14
247,Good,"Overall ...excellent housekeeping, front desk. Restaurant & the bar was very poor: seemed more like a sports bar with very poorly trained wait staff & poor quality food. Stay at the hotel, but eat elsewhere.",3,2017,04,11
247,Family run hotel-perfect if going to Aviva as minutes away by foot and free parking in hotel,"Choose this hotel through trivago search as very keen price for room only for Dublin City prices and liked the look of hotel and it's safe location and free parking- we were doing show in bord gais and a taxi less than ten euro from hotel so good location not just for Rugby fans but theatre goers too! Stayed in room 206- has to be the smallest room I have stayed in an Irish hotel and small double bed too but it had a very comfy mattress!  The room had all the usual facilties but it really lacked atmosphere ! A few pictures on the bare wall opposite bed might have remedied that! It was a very clean room and had lovely but small en suite with bath and the best water pressure over head shower ! This won me over! Had breakfast here and only negative was the management of hot food trays as some were completely empty so we were eating our Irish breakfast in stages!  Would I stay here again?  Yes,  as the good location , free parking, convenience to city centre by public transport, clean room and friendly staff are what made up a good experience for us and a small room doesn't bother us but may be a deciding factor for other potential guests!  ",4,2017,04,11
247,Sandymount Re-visited,"We spent another 3 nights in this delightful hotel in March this year. The last time we were at this hotel was in June 2015. Please refer to my review following that visit.

As on the last occasion, we have thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sandymount hotel. All the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Indeed, a ""senior"" member Beatrice has been there for 35 years - that speaks for itself!

Our bedroom in the back was quiet, modern, clean and comfortable, inspite of the close proximety to the Aviva Stadium. There were loads of free parking spaces and WiFi acess was efficient. The self help buffet breakfast was plentiful with a good variety to choose from. Sandymount Green with pubs and eateries is only a short walk away from the hotel.

We cannot recommend this place too highly for its renown Irish hospitality! God willing, we shall definitely be back!",5,2017,04,10
247,Pleasant break in a excellent hotel with outstanding service,"Good sleep, good room, good food, very convenient location for the Dart rail to the city centre or the rugby. But what was outstanding was the service - friendly and nothing was too much trouble. It had the fell of a family hotel, but in a larger well-appointed establishment. Thank you!",5,2017,04,06
247,Terrific Stay,"I just spent 4 nights here for a conference.  The hotel is lovely.  Everything was super clean and comfortable.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was generous and the restaurant meals were delicious.  The only downside is that it's a bit of a walk or a rapid transit ride to downtown Dublin.  However, I found downtown Dublin to be very crowded and congested, so I was happy to be in a quiet area.  I had a room with a courtyard window that was absolutely peaceful.
    If you are staying here but want to see the museums etc in downtown, I suggest getting a visitor Leap card.  They sell them at the bus desk in the airport.  They give you unlimited travel on all public transport in Dublin for however long you choose, which means you don't need change and you can get where you want easily enough.",5,2017,04,03
247,So friendly!,"We spent a long weekend here with our son - we were watching the rugby.  The rugby was disappointing but the hotel was great!  So friendly, perfectly positioned and the room, a family room, was spacious and spotlessly clean!!  A nice touch was the offer of fresh milk to go with the tea and coffee on offer in the room.  Only 19mins from the airport and so close to a gorgeous coast road.",5,2017,04,03
247,Near Aviva Stadium and DART,Due to our flight being delayed from FLL and missing our connection the hotel was able to hold our room as we came in early the following morning.  The rooms are very nice and roomy.  The only issue was how the hotel was layed out with different hallways.  We were able to get a few hours sleep and walk to the dart to go in the city,4,2017,03,31
247,Nice place to stay,"This hotel is away from the city center, public transportation is within walking distance. The rooms have been updated and were really nice. Breakfast was a typical full Irish breakfast. The staff was really friendly.  This place is really spread out so be prepared to walk and talk a wrong turn now and then!",5,2017,03,29
247,Perfect for business.,"Comfortable room, good bed(s) and liked that there were two doors between the room and the hallway.

Staff were really friendly and helped us out by checking us in early.

Getting a hotel with parking at this price in this location was perfect. A short walk from Google's office.",4,2017,03,29
247,Visited for drinks pre Ireland vs wales,"Only popped in for one on the way to the Avila stadium but ended up staying for a few, lovely clean premises, reasonable drinks prices and amazing atmosphere.  Toilet facilities spotless. We will definitely be back in the future. Great find. ",5,2017,03,25
247,Great Atmosphere,"Room was large. Had an iron and ironing board plus dressing gowns and safe. Beds were very comfortable. We travelled from the airport to the hotel by Aircoach. We caught the route 702 to Ballsbridge. The driver lets you know when you have arrived at your stop. Journey was about 30 minutes then a 5 minute walk to the hotel. 
We had a brilliant weekend. The hotel was 2 minutes walk to the Aviva stadium where we went to watch the EnglandvIreland rugby match. The atmosphere in the stadium and hotel was a amazing.",5,2017,03,22
247,Beautiful Hotel,"I had stayed in this hotel while I was in Dublin for training with the new company I am working for, It was a fantastic experience. The staff are so nice and very helpful and couldn't do enough for me. The rooms were really nice and I had the best night's sleep as the bed was really comfortable.",5,2017,03,19
247,Disappointed about the food,Enjoyed our stay. Shame about the food. Brought this to the attention of the staff when checking out. and was delighted to receive a voucher in the post for a meal. Unfortunately this meal was worse than the first. Get a new Chef. Couldn't even cook a steak.,2,2017,03,19
247,99% perfect! ,"Stayed here with my mum for 3 nights, loved all of it! Staff were brilliant, very attentive and helpful with everything! As it was my first time in Dublin, they took the time to show us where to go, where the nearest station and bus park was and things we should go and see. 
The room was lovely, everything you needed including an iron and hair dryer. The hotel
Provides a room service menu for the evening and breakfast. We had ordered some toast for the morning which didn't turn up, but the staff were brilliant and gave us both free vouchers for a full breakfast in the restaurant, so no complaints! 
The only thing I can think of which wasn't much of an issue was the pricing for the menu/breakfast. We paid £414 for the hotel for 3 nights and didn't have breakfast included, so it would have been an additional €13.95 or €11.95 if pre booked in advanced. Quite a lot extra I felt. The menu was expensive, but I think this is standard Dublin prices. I had scampi and chips which cost €17.95 which had no salad/peas etc, but was very nice. 
Brilliant hotel, I would definitely stay here again! ",4,2017,03,18
247,Great Hotel on the doorsteps of the Aviva,"We were in Dublin on business but decided to stay over at The Sandymount Hotel to enjoy St. Patrick's Day on the day before the Ireland V England RUFC home nations game 2017. This is the nearest hotel to The Aviva and consequently the Irish under 20 rugby team were staying (more of that anon).

Given the date, the imminent rugby game and under 20s you'd  expect the staff to be under pressure. However there was no pressure in evidence. In fact the lady at reception took all the time and more to make us feel welcome. Five stars not three for that.

So our first impressions were of an incredibly well-run hotel that was operating well above the three stars it has.

Next thing was the cleanliness of rooms and, particularly, bathrooms were exemplary to the extent that, although we are not unduly fussy, this is probably the cleanest hotel room that we've ever stayed in. I know they should all be like this but, as seasoned travellers, we know that they just aren't. Five stars rather than three for that.

Next up food: We didn't eat in for dinner so I'm left with breakfast. Very nice it was too but one gripe - it's been a long time since we've been unable to request a vegetarian sausage/rashers as part of our breakfast. They're cheaper than the meat equivalent and they store for longer so why wouldn't you offer the option?  

The server took our order for veggie sausages but then never came back to say ""Sorry we don't do them"". To be fair that was a bit understandable because there was mayhem as the under 20s turned up and took half the restaurant. 

Lots of grumpy punters now but not us because we were already seated. However, after a polite 10 minutes we asked again - this time of a passing chef. Imagine our surprise when we were told that they weren't and never have been on the menu. The hotel need to make its mind up and cater for a growing minority. Three stars out of five.

Now back to the under 20s. I think it was a very bad idea to split the restaurant. The effect was a substantial queue of people getting more and more upset at peak breakfast time. To be honest I could understand their frustration because I'd have left and asked for a discount on the price of my stay. One star out of five for management's decision making.

That said, given the situation that the restaurant staff were placed in by management the team on the ground were brilliant despite those circumstances. 

They did their best with zero tables to spare and even managed to handle a really loud, rude and demanding young woman (you know the type and can guess from where) who just decided to ignore health and safety and sort herself out taking food randomly out of the restaurant with precariously balanced plates, overflowing cups and cutlery. Courteous to the last the team even protected her from the normal effects of natural selection. 10 out of 5 (yes that's what i meant) for the restaurant team. They were brilliant and we told them so.

Otherwise this is a sprawling join-up of a number of older large houses/buildings with nice break out areas throughout. It is decorated in a subdued modern fashion which we liked. Four stars.

I really want to give the hotel 5 stars for the presentation, the staff's courteous  professionalism and the cleanliness. However, management poor-decision making and the Veggie sausagegate farce shaves a star off.

That's a shame because this is a much better hotel than the 3 stars imply. We'll be back and will recommend it to others. And who knows maybe next time we'll even be able to have a real veggie breakfast.",5,2017,03,18
247,Excellent Hotel,Stayed on this hotel whilst on business. Free parking so close to Dublin is a bonus. The rooms have been refurbished to a good standard. Great beds and pillows. Pity there was no complimentary water. Friendly staff and a real joy to have stayed at this hidden gem.,5,2017,03,17
247,fantastic family run hotel,so from checking in to checking out this hotel does go the extra mile all the staff are fantastic there is even a courtesy mini bus on hand all the rooms are very fresh and clean with great showers breakfast is not to be missed only a 10 min walk to the rds and 2 min walk to the stadium also large free car park,5,2017,03,13
247,Best customer service in Dublin!,"This hotel is homely, comfortable and above all the customer service is superb! There's none of the artificial stuffiness that lots of hotel groups have.  Staying here for 2.5 weeks was a genuinely enjoyable experience!   The rooms are nice, and spotlessly clean. Although fairly standard, the powerful hot shower, comfortable bed, friendly and cosy atmosphere, delicious food and wonderful staff made the stay absolutely superb and a true home from home!    A rare but wonderful family run hotel, welcome to Irish hospitality at it's best, and thank you Sandymount hotel for renewing my fate in hoteliers!",5,2017,03,10
247,"Rooms were comfy, location not central enough for me.","I enjoyed my stay. Rooms were nice. 
I arrived late and ate at the restaurant, felt it was over price for what I got.
The building had many split levels and i found it hard to find the room.
There was free wifi, free parking.",4,2017,03,09
247,Short but nice stay. ,"We only stayed one night here. It was a nice room, big enough for bags and a cot plus a good sized bed for us too! 
Bathroom was really nice with a bath/shower combo. They had on site parking and a restaurant we had dinner at. Restaurant was pretty pricey and to be honest not that great for what we paid. But the staff were all very friendly, helping us with our bags and talking to our little boy. ",4,2017,03,09
247,Lovely hotel ,Stayed here for a friends hen weekend.The staff were very accommodating and the room was clean and spacious. Would definitely stay here again. We had the breakfast which was great and had a really good variety. ,5,2017,03,06
247,New favourite hotel in Dublin,"Easily accessible by car. Good public transport links. Good facilities - bathroom a little smaller than photos suggest. Large rooms, comfortable beds. Breakfast in bed is a great addition. Will definitely stay again. ",4,2017,03,04
247,wonderful relaxing stay,stayed the night before an exam and requested a quiet peaceful room. made to feel very welcome by the staff. room excellent and very quiet despite the busy Ireland v France rugby visitors. easy access on Dart into the city and parking at hotel really easy. we look forward to a further visit.,5,2017,03,04
247,This is a lovely hotel in a quiet street beside the Aviva Stadium.,"I had a business meeting there yesterday and we were so well looked after by the lovely staff. A couple of us stayed for dinner afterwards and the food was excellent. The toilets are the cleanest I have ever seen in a hotel, anywhere... Definitely recommended if you are visiting Dublin or just to drop in for a drink or a meal.",5,2017,03,01
247,Homely and cosy hotel,"Booked a triple room with breakfast for my daughters and myself on a very stormy night in Dublin. Our room was cosy, comfortable and beautifully decorated. We planned on going out for food but due to the weather we stayed in the hotel and we weren't disappointed. Beatrice and staff were very welcoming and everyone was very pleasant. We look forward to our next visit.",5,2017,02,25
247,Pre match atmosphere!,"If you intend going to a match in the Aviva you must stay here. You are practically at the turnstiles. The hotel is busy on match days but it's all about soaking up the atmosphere I guess! 
All the rooms have been renovated and restyled, great food options in the bar and wide selection for breakfast. The staff are all courteous and greet you with a smile, especially Beatrice at the front desk. 
For business travellers there is ample and secure parking behind the hotel. Great location close to town, near the RDS etc. 
Great stay! ",5,2017,02,25
247,Lovely Staff!,My friend and I stayed here on the 1st November. The hotel was lovely and very clean. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful! Even got ordered us pizza when we got back to the hotel that night late! The only downfall of the hotel would that it was very cold and the heating didn't seem to be on. Maybe we hadn't turned radiators on but other than that lovely hotel and I would stay again. ,4,2017,02,23
247,"Nice, quaint hotel ",Hotel was very clean and spacious with friendly staff. Location is a little far out but transport is really close by and reasonably priced so not a problem. Bar had great food and was not too expensive. Would recommend to others! ,4,2017,02,21
247,Friendly and welcoming,"Just back from a mini break staying in this hotel. As this was the first time in this area of Dublin,  we were a bit unsure, but oh boy we were pleasantly surprised. What a gem. Not a negative to find anywhere.  A beautiful homely hotel in a lovely area. Although not on a bus route, the Dart station is about 2 mins away where you can travel to the centre of Dublin for a good price of approx. 4 euros return. Great. 10 mins in the opposite direction and you are at the beach. What more could you want? A welcoming, beautiful hotel set in an ideal spot.  Will definately be back.",5,2017,02,21
247,Lovely Stay,"The room was spacious, clean, modern and the bed was comfortable. Room was equipped with a bath, TV, hairdryer and a kettle.

The staff were very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much for them. 

Ordered breakfast to the room, food was poor quality and tiny portion, defiantly not worth €12! that was the only disappointment. 

Overall a decent hotel not too far from the centre and located right next to a train station. 

Would defiantly recommend :)
",4,2017,02,19
247,Short Stay,"I needed to book a hotel to attend a family funeral.  Although we were staying because of a very sad occasion we enjoyed our stay. Our room though not large was very pleasant with everything which is necessary for an enjoyable stay. There was a very comfortable bed, tea and coffee making facilities, an iron and ironing board, a safe and a flat screen tv. There was probably a hairdryer but I didn't look for it. The ensuite bathroom had a bath with shower over it and included toiletries'.  Staff in the hotel were very friendly and the breakfast was really good. We had an issue with some food in the bar which was handled very well, the dish was removed from the bill and we were not charged for our tea and coffee.  They have a good recycling policy too. We got a very good deal and there was no parking charge. Will be back!",4,2017,02,17
247,Nice basic hotel,"Sandymount is a nice and clean basic hotel. Room and bathroom looked new. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room.
City centre is 3 dart stations away, 5 minute walk to dart station.
The only letdown: The hotel is not buggy/wheelchair friendly. Hallways very narrow, elevator tiny and cleaning team keeps staples of clean towls and bedlinen on the floors (!!) of the hallways so it's impossible to get through without touching the stuff.",4,2017,02,13
247,poor stay,"We stayed at this hotel for one night i was surprised i did not enjoy our stay considering the reviews were very good. The hotel staff very friendly and porridge yummy but that's about all. It's kinda neither here nor there hotel and bit up and down hallways which are very narrow. Our room was old and large I was initially impressed with room until we returned that evening it was freezing; the radiators were on but heating but it wasn't controlled in room I rang reception and they dropped up a fan heater it did warm me up by standing over it. Bed was small and was off level because of the floor being slanted to one side, had an uncomfortable sleep felt like i kept rolling into the middle of bed. Noisy outside windows are not sound proof. overall i was shocked i because of good reviews, i could not recommend hotel.",2,2017,02,13
247,Here since 1979,"We have stayed in this hotel since 1979. The fact that we keep coming back should say it all. Food is good. The hotel is quiet, central and close to the amenities that we use. Recent up-grading has kept facilities up to date. There are no problems parking.",4,2017,02,13
247,"Nice Hotel, Lovely rooms","I would recommend the hotel for it service, presentation and food. Our room was a little hard to find, felt a little like a treasure hunt down a rabbit hole but once we found it it was nicely appointed and clean. We ate in the bar on our first night as did friends of ours and not one of us found the food wanting for flavour or portion size. All staff we encountered were helpful and polite. The transport accessibility was ok. There was as bus stop about a 5 minute walk in one direction and a DART stop a 5 minute in the opposite direction but we opted for taxis returning at night due to weather and convenience. ",4,2017,02,13
247,Offers great location and more for a good price,"First of all, location is great. It's walking distance to Aviva Stadium and good choice if you have something to do South Dublin. It offers lots considering the price. It may not be the cheapest, but probably the best value around.

We stayed at 4th floor, executive floor, the room size and bathroom was quite big. Bed was comfortable and big enough. Bathroom amenities were more than enough. There was complementary shaving kit and toothbrush/toothpaste next to shampoo, body location etc. in the bathroom.

We arrived there with a buggy and it was really easy to walk around inside the building thanks to accessibility.

We haven't tried the breakfast. Staff we met at the reception was friendly and kind. Parking spaces were free and there were enough spots. Free wifi also worked well.

I would definitely stay here if I need an easy access to somewhere South Dublin. 5 star!",5,2017,02,12
247,Spotless room & friendly staff,"We stayed for the BT Young Scientist exhibition.  The rooms were spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was very good.  Their porridge was the nicest I have had in any hotel. Great location - beside the Aviva, 10 minutes walk from Ballsbridge. Reception staff were great.  I would stay there again.",5,2017,02,10
247,Very confortable,"The hotel possesses a big parking which is very conveniant.
The bedroom was big and very conforable. The bathroom was also great. 
The hotel is well situated at 5 min from the dart and the aviva stadium.",4,2017,02,09
247,Beautiful hotel,Would definitely stay here again and definitely worth the money especially as there wereally 4 of us.  So clean and pristine and very friendly staff . We only stayed over night for a concert so never got to try the food in the restaurant but it looked beautiful x,5,2017,02,08
247,"This was an overnight to be part of an audience of a very popular TV Show. Very pleased with Venue, Staff .","We enjoyed our trip immensely, food was delicious, staff very friendly and helpful. We even met with the owner who was so welcoming and personable. The beds so comfortable, we slept so well, no noise. Thank you.",5,2017,02,08
247,Perfect accommodation for a trip to Dublin,"Great location, calm but perfect connection to the city and to other sites or landmarks by public transportation e.g. DART. Delicious breakfast and very clean guestrooms,  perfect service.  Best price-perfomance ratio.",5,2017,02,08
247,Christmas stay,"Although generally enjoying my stays at this hotel, the bar was closed for renovations during Christmas and the place had the overall feel of somewhere that was in the process of closing down. There was no indication at the time of booking that the bar would be closed so we ended up having to go out.",3,2017,02,08
247,Excellent Hotel in a great location,This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The staff are really friendly and provide great customer service. The rooms are also very good. I would definitely recommend it for your next trip to the Aviva!.,5,2017,02,08
247,Perfect for short business trup,"Location perfect, room comfy and staff friendly and very helpful.  Perfect particularly for business trips or short stays.
The provision of  free parking is always a real bonus in a dublin hotel.
Wifi good service
",4,2017,02,08
247,Location was great,We spent a Saturday night here. The location was great and the dart was only a 5 minute walk.There was free parking and wifi. The room was modern and comfortable. Breakfast was good. Sandymount village was only a 10 minute walk. ,5,2017,02,07
247,5*,"Fantastic Hotel... 
Great Location - Quite yet close to Dublin City
Would recommend to anyone! 
Friendly Staff and Very Helpful!  
Room Service was Excellent 
Good Food and Variety of Dishes on the Menu
All in All, I'd a great stay ",5,2017,02,07
247,Rugby at Aviva,"We stayed at the Sandymount hotel after the Leinster Champions cup game against Northampton. What a great choice, it was fantastic from start to finish.
Great help from the staff on check in, great room and most of all great fun after the game.
The pubs around Sandymount were fabulous and full of great people just out to have a good time.",5,2017,02,07
247,Overnight for business,"This hotel ticks all the boxes for anyone staying for a night or two in Dublin for business. The rooms were particularly comfortable with good WiFi and the ensuite bathroom was new and modern. Parking was also very convenient, safe and free (which is unusual in Dublin city). 
I may not consider it for a family break though as it didn't seem to be the most wheelchair accessible hotel (my son uses a wheelchair). There are lots of steps as you make your way down quite narrow corridors to the bedrooms. I'm sure they do have wheelchair accessible bedrooms however and there is actually work on-going to make the downstairs restaurant wheelchair accessible. ",4,2017,02,07
247,Family visit,"We came to visit and celebrate my nieces 21st birthday ,the hotel is just at the end of the road comfortable room and excellent breakfast the hotel was in walking distance from the village where we found several welcoming bars ",5,2017,02,07
247,happy with my stay overall,"satisfied overall with my stay in the   sandymount  hotel  in ballsbridge  near the avaiva stadium 

room comfortable and clean - staff friendly and helpful parking on site was very handy , near bus routes and dart ",4,2017,02,07
247,Holiday world weekend,"It's very handy to get around Dublin near dart station   Staff are friendly food great room big clean and warm and lovely fire just inside the reception area
Free wi fi 
 enjoyed dinner and breakfast not first time we have stayed in Sandmount hotel",5,2017,02,07
247,review,"a good hotel, nice people, but the breakfast could be a lot hotter. The train station 2 minute walk to get you straight into Dublin or Bray. Right next to the Ariva rugby stadium. Some nice pubs and restaurants just a short walk.",5,2017,02,07
247,Great location!,The hotel is very conveniently located especially for a rugby weekend visit etc. and good value. Will still plan on a return trip hopefully when the renovations are complete and the bar is back up and running!,3,2017,02,07
247,The incredibly lovely Sandymount Hotel,"I have decided that whenever I'm coming to Dublin I'll always stay at the Sandymount Hotel! The nicest hotel in the world. We feel like at home!
The helpfulness and kindness of the whole staff is wonderful ",5,2017,02,07
247,Great weekend break for the rugby,"Booked in relatively last minute! Got a great deal! Room was excellent and extremely comfortable. Great location close to aviva stadium and dart, plenty of parking and excellent breakfast! Will definitely be back",5,2017,02,07
247,"Fantastic hotel, great location & friendly staff.","Fantastic hotel, perfect location, friendly staff. I booked as we were going to see Hamlet for my husbands birthday & we got a free upgrade to an executive suite & complimentary wine in the room. It made as feel very welcome & his birthday all the more special! ",5,2017,02,07
247,Good location & value,"Close to Dart for access to city centre & perfect for the rugby.
Restaurant / bar  was under renovation, so only temporary facilities available, which were adequate, I am sure the renovations will be a vast improvement.",5,2017,02,07
247,Sandymount Hotel Stay,"Great Location. Rooms a bit small. Layout a little bit scattered, but to be expected considering age & type of building. Reception area lacked atmosphere & space. Didn't eat in restaurant but breakfast good. Good parking. Staff helpful if a little bit inexperienced. ",4,2017,02,07
247,"Lovely, professional, family-run hotel","I had three business trips to Ireland in January, and stayed in the Sandymount each time. You can tell that it's a family-run enterprise - so friendly and comfortable, all the modern amenities you want.",5,2017,02,07
247,Outstanding service,"From arrival our stay was really great - I parked the car and an employee that was gardening offered to help with our luggage. Reception staff couldn't have done more for us , the room was cosy ( bit too warm in middle of night ) - food was ok , location was just perfect for our needs and we would definitely stay here again ",5,2017,02,07
247,Conventient location,"Lovely location but very noisy during BTYSTE. Convenient to RDS and to Sandymount for restaurants, shops, walks and to DART station for access to Dublin city. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Plenty of parking.",4,2017,02,07
247,Family stay,I had traveled and stayed with my family throughout Ireland. Your hotel was by far the best one we had stayed at. The television wasn't to small and was easy to work with and the rooms were very clean and big. The hallways were a bit small and it was confusing at times trying to find a way out of the building. To gain access to our vehicles we had to take a maze in order to get back outside. That was the only downside. ,3,2017,02,07
247,Dublin trip,"Spent weekend in Dublin with my mum, brilliant hotel and staff were very friendly. Rooms were lovely. Took us around 30 minutes to walk to centre but can easily get buses in. Hop on hop off tour is really handy for seeing Dublin and the reception have tickets for €10 ",4,2017,02,07
247,Excellent Hotel,"The Sandymount is an excellent hotel, within walking distance of the AVIVA stadium.    All rooms have been updated and are modern and clean.  The staff are excellent.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,02,07
247,Great location for South side events. Rooms a little tight.,"Excellent locations for south side events (Rugby, RDS, Sandymount area). Rooms were clean and staff were friendly and helpful (If a little overwhelmed by the number of visitors from the Young Scientists Exhibition.  Rooms were a bit too small for me to recommend wholeheartedly.",3,2017,02,07
247,Amazing stay,"Everything was perfect the room, location, cleanliness of the hotel, the food, service. I had a great time staying here and I will be returning shortly. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin you will not be dissatisfied.",5,2017,02,07
247,Excellent hotel and restaurant,Lovely hotel just outside the busy city centre. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would go back in a heartbeat. The restaurant is superb and the best burger in Dublin. My wife had the salmon and it was cooked perfect.,5,2017,02,07
247,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here whilst on a business trip, it is a great location for Aviva Stadium, the staff were all lovely people, the rooms were clean and comfortable  and the breakfast was fantastic. Would recommend.",5,2017,02,07
247,Nice charming Friendly Dublin Hotel,"Stay here for business and it is a nice charming friendly hotel, very homely and makes  a change for the large corporate brands normally stay in. The staff exceptionally friendly and helpfull and provide a great welcome and very friendly service. Rooms, corridor much smaller than large chains and the walls don't seem to be thick, so noises seems to travel. 

Great location and makes a change to the large chain and a chance to experience true Dublin hostility.",4,2017,02,07
247,Getting even better.,"This hotel is a favourite of mine for a few years.I used to use it regularly for business stays.Arrive late ,leave early.It was great for that especially with free parking and easy access to city by Dart.
The hotel has had a lot of improvements made over the years and is now great for a weekend visit to Dublin.
Again the proximity to the city is great but even more so, the lovely village of Sandymount and seafront.Lots of lovely eateries. If you have a car, its a short spin to Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire.Rooms recently renovated. Bit small but has comfortable beds.Only gripe is the bath.Why not take the opportunity when renovating toreplace bath wirh a walk in shower in the tiny bathroom.Big mistake.
Fantastic staff and great breakast.
Great value, in lovely location.
Love it.",5,2017,02,06
247,quality hotel just 20 minutes walk to Dublin city centre,"We went down to Dublin to see blacksabbath in the 3 arena, this hotel is perfect for direct access to the arena just a 10 minute walk. The hotel is right by The avia stadium and quite popular with rugby fans. Nice to be out of the hustle and bustle of the city and only 2 stops on the dart back in.  Staff were great and the fòod was good sandymount is a lovelyvarea and a walk on dublin bay is recommended ",5,2017,02,05
247,"Good value, well located hotel","I use Sandymount Hotel when I am in Dublin for business.  I find the hotel very convenient to the City Centre, the staff are friendly and recently refurbished rooms are very comfortable.  The room rates are very reasonable for such a well located area.",5,2017,02,05
247,Very pleasant and personal welcome back,"Been back a few times now, and after the recent full refurbishment the hotel is just even more a great place to stay. Using many hotels for work, to have a personal welcome back from Beatrice at reception, is so much more pleasant than the big corporates.
I can recommend the hotel to anyone, working, or travelling for leisure, it meets the requirements for both. Close enough to the city and yet just far enough out for some peace also. Highly recommended if you are in the Dublin area",5,2017,02,01
247,New year stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights over the new year. Room was lovely and clean. Bed was comfy. We didn't book breakfast but easily added on at reception for 12euro each.
Staff were friendly and helpful even tho I was a bit impatient on NYE as we booked a taxi and someone took it but they sorted another one. Thank you. 
We ordered room service one night only the soup and icecream as we wanted something light it was lovely. 
It was a little bit noisey one of the nights as you could hear people outside our room chatting but to be honest i did expect this as it was new year. 
You walk the dart 5mins away from hotel which takes you straight to the city centre.
Taxis are all different it cost about 32euros from airport to hotel.
About 19euros into city centre.
Tour bus around dublin also picks up about 10mins away from hotel.
Over all good location away from the city centre easy transport
Lovely hotel. I would stay again
",4,2017,02,01
247,My favourite hotel in DUblin,"I stay at this hotel every time I am in Dublin and was there again last week. From the front desk, where you are welcomed,  to the dining room & bar staff who are so friendly & helpful, I love this hotel. I find Beatrice on the reception & Rose in housekeeping exceptionally helpful and they never forget my name. The rooms have got a complete overhaul and are just beautiful & relaxing, the decor is very very well done. It's so centrally located to town, with beautiful walks nearby. This is one place where I know I will have a very comfortable bed for the night & can enjoy delicious food into the bargain.",5,2017,01,30
247,Nice place to stay,"The hotel was clean, in a nice location, close to Aviva Stadium, the RDS and close to luas stop. Staff were very helpful. Bar area was under renovation with the restaurant  being used as a temporary bar. Even though staff were good it does not work. Enjoyed my stay.",4,2017,01,29
247,Noisy!,"The rooms and the hotel has things you'd expect from any hotel.
I like that my room had a bath tub.
Apart from that, breakfast was rather disgusting(they weren't going to let me as I hadn't booked it with the room!), you cannot even buy a bottle of water in middle of the night (you have to go down to the bar, staffs are running around, I didn't get served for 15 mins, got sick of it so I came back), 
You can hear everything that goes on in the corridor, and the corridor is long.
In the night and in the morning. You can even hear footsteps and floors creaking and  all the conversations.

I slept quite well but every morning, my face was puffy for some reason, my body a little stiff. This is not for me.",2,2017,01,29
247,Very Noisy ,I am in this hotel as I write this review. I have never been to a hotel that is so noisy. The halls are very small so you can touch the room door facing you. All the doors slam shut and the walls are paper thin. So if your expecting a good night sleep forget it. You get the noise from all the rooms surrounding you. Unbelievable.,1,2017,01,28
247,Great stay,"We had a great stay, good room, very good location, and the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful.  They gave us a great welcome.  So hope to return soon, I know that they have been updating some rooms and hoping for a great stay again,",4,2017,01,27
247,Excellent,"Stayed here after a business trip as came over on the ferry and close to port of Dublin. 

Hotel is big and clean with free wifi and plenty of parking, if you can see the Aviva Stadium then you are there. 

Had to be at port for 7am so missed breakfast but dinner in the line out restaurant was very tasty. Only had the line out burger but one of the nicest burgers I've had in a while. Coors light on draft in the bar which is always nice to see. 

Give yourself about 20 minutes to get to the port and as always when driving in Ireland you will need a couple of euros for the toll. 

Nice time I'm back around Dublin, would not stay anywhere else. From receptionist to bar staff, everyone was really friendly. ",5,2017,01,27
247,Great place to stay,"One of the friendliest hotels I have stayed in so far :-)

This is situated in the upmarket Ballsbridge area with good access to public transport (Dart rail). 

The Aviva stadium is just few minutes away from this hotel. There was a football game on around that time which unfortunately I could not go. But walking around outside the stadium, I could feel the electrifying atmosphere typical to rugby and football games.

On the days I stayed, had breakfast everyday in the hotel and it was good.

There are plenty of restaurants and bars around the hotel which is great.",4,2017,01,23
247,What a difference a year makes!,"I stayed here on business almost exactly a year ago. The hotel was great at the time but there were decorators everywhere, which was ok but a little disruptive.

Returning this month I have to say the rooms are now of a very high standard and money has been spent well upgrading them. Very nice!

The restaurant is next under the knife and expectations are high. Really good to see a privately owned establishment stepping up and having a go. 

Great food, great staff, great rooms, great bar area, great location..........enough said!",4,2017,01,23
247,Big but homely,"A warm welcome awaited us at this hotel with friendly and helpful reception staff. The room was pre-booked on one of the well known sites and was very clean and hospitable but was on the 3rd floor overlooking a rooftop. For a booking in January with a hotel not full I might have expected better. But apart from that a lovely tool. Lovely bathroom too.
We had a bar meal in the hotel . I had beef in Guinness which was excellent and a cracking portion. My wife had the line out burger which again was tasty and well presented.
There was a lovely peat fire in the sitting area near the lobby which gave a homely feel.
We went to Dublin to see black sabbath and only went for one night . We wanted to stay longer.",5,2017,01,21
247,"Great location, clean and comfortable ","So pleased we chose to stay here. Friendly helpful staff, lovely clean comfortable room and nice breakfast this morning which we didn't expect but was included in our price. Will definitely be recommending to family and friends and look forward to staying here again the next time we're in town for a night out.",5,2017,01,21
247,Business Trip,"I stopped here in December with work.
The hotel is within very close proximity to the Aviva Stadium and the train is a 2 minute walk which will take you to the heart of Dublin in minutes. However if you prefer to see the sights whilst in a new city it will take about 30 minutes to walk.
The hotel itself is very well equipped, my room was in the main part of the building with benefited from period features, the bedroom and bathroom was really well appointed with 2 double beds so would be ideal for families.The only draw back was the room was extremely hot even in December which for some would be a good think. The staff we all very pleasant!!! I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere just out of town away from the buzz of the city.",4,2017,01,18
247,Friendly Dublin Hotel,Our family enjoyed a recent stay in the Sandymount Hotel. The Hotel is a little quirky and located slightly off the beaten path but close to the nearby DART rail line for easy access to the City Centre. Stand-out friendliness more than compensates for okay-Food and patchy service. Overall really good experience though - we will be back!,4,2017,01,17
247,January 2017 visit after major hotel renovation,"Just spent 4 days at the Sandymount Hotel, Dublin with a large group . Hotel has undergone a major renovation in the past 2 years (although to be honest having visited the hotel annually for over 10 years I didn't think that it needed the upgrade).  Their new executive rooms are huge and really well appointed.The staff, many of whom have been with them for the 10 years I have visited, couldn't have been more helpful  and all of the guests had a great time. A small illustration of the attention to detail I witnessed (which I have never seen in another hotel of any standard level )  was a small card by the in room tea/coffee facilities offering a supply of fresh milk instead of the inhouse UHT.  Typical of the great care in a stellar establishment.",5,2017,01,15
247,40th birthday!,"Stayed here for my 40th birthday weekend and can honestly say the photos don't do it justice! Perfectly situated for the Dart station which can get you into Dublin centre in 5 minutes. Great staff, great breakfast, but more importantly, great Guinness! Will definitely be back soon",5,2017,01,10
247,Best place to stay in Dublin! ,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in November 2016. I have absolutely 0 complaints. Our stay was made even better because of Beatrice ODonoghue. She was helpful in every aspect, even down to helping me get over a cold I caught on our first night there. She went to the kitchen every day and made her special lemon drink to aid my cold. By the end of our stay in Dublin I was good as new and ready to take on the next city! She also had great recommendations about where to go to eat and sightsee. When I think back to our trip to Ireland, I always remember Beatrice and it puts a smile on my face. Thank you for being so wonderful! ",5,2017,01,08
247,Back to our favorite hotel,"We have just returned again from our favourite hotel ,stayed here on our honeymoon 40 yrs ago ,we try to come back here twice a year ,we just love it the location is perfect the staff are lovely as is the food , beautiful walks around the village ,but if you want into centre of Dublin ,the train is 5 mins away ,and only 3 stops ,have to say we missed seeing Beatrice on reception ,so nice and informative lovely person ,room was lovely warm and spotless ,my only disappointment was we were celebrating our ruby wedding and we didn't even receive a box of chocolates or a congratulation  , hopefully the receptionist on that day learns to smile more and little more interested in the guests ,but still love this hotel great work owners .",4,2017,01,08
247,Lives up to the positive reviews,"Was here in the winter of December 2016 for a business trip with fellow guests for one night we needed a base for Dublin meetings. The location looked right, the reviews looked right so booked this one for me and my guests and no regrets, the experience for a short stay was better than expectations, everything I want was there, clean rooms, parking, free wi fi, good food and service, efficient and friendly staff without that fake smile, we landed, had lunch, done the business, rested, enjoyed breakfast and gone, see you next time.",5,2017,01,05
247,Clean and bright hotel,"The hotel is very clean and well kept. I had a single room also very clean and good shower, it did however lack a long mirror and somewhere to put your suitcase. Both things that could be easily addressed by the hotel.

There is a lovely sitting area beside reception. Bright and comfortable. We had lunch there which was delicious. Breakfast was included in my rate and had a good selection. My only complaint was the strong smell of disinfectant in the dining area which I got on a couple of different occasions during my stay. 

Staff overall friendly, efficient and helpful only let down by the handling of a fire alarm (or some type of door alarm) going off during the night. No explanation or apology given to those of us who had come out of our bedrooms even though the thing had been ringing for quiet some time. 

Hotel is 5 minutes from the dart and 5 mins by dart to the city centre. It is also near sandymount Strand. A good location if you want to be slightly out of the city centre but to be able to pop in to it. ",3,2017,01,02
247,Christmas break,Christmas break ideal in one of the friendliest hotels with a location that is second to none. Shopping and world class pubs and restaurants at its doorstep. Friendly staff are what separate the Sandymount hotel from the rest! Has to be expierenced to be believed. ,5,2016,12,21
247,Nice hotel. Great location ,stayed for 2 nights - twin room.  Clean & comfortable but a bit on the small side. Breakfast was good. Good variety hot & Cold breakfast. Very pleasant and helpful staff. The location is fantastic. Free parking at the hotel.   Beside the Aviva stadium. We walked to ballsbridge (RDS) - about 6 min walk - to get a bus into town. But plenty of places in Ballsbridge to eat & drink. Only down side to the hotel was the hotel bar is currently under a refurbishment - reopening in Jan 2017.  Definitely worth a visit if staying over for a match or a gig in the O2 or RDS or just want to be close to the city.  ,4,2016,12,20
247,Great location in D4,"Having looked for a hotel at a reasonable cost and convenient for the Aviva Stadium we found The Sandymount.
We are pleased we did because it met our needs perfectly.
It is in the shadow of the stadium and a short walk from Sandymount Green which is home to some very welcoming bars and restaurants.  
As for the hotel itself, it had been recently refurbished (the bar area was still closed during our stay) and our room, although slightly on the small side, was very clean and comfortable.
Breakfast was very good with a wide range of traditional and continental options. 
Staff at reception were very helpful and contributed to what turned out to be a very enjoyable stay. 
I would recommend the hotel for its location as it is in a very desirable suburb of Dublin and only a short walk from the local Dart railway station which makes it only a few minutes from the more central areas of the city. 
",4,2016,12,19
247,Dissatisfied,"Stayed here with friends,arrived to find the bar/restaurant is closed for renovations. Room was basic no room service available. Went to eating area and checked out the menu which was ridiculously overpriced with chicken wings costing e15.Came back after a night out to find no drinks available after 12.30 no residents bar or food available,was given a take away menu to get food-absolute joke never encountered such service in a supposed to be hotel. Didn't eat the breakfast next day as it looked disgusting. Would have booked elsewhere had I been informed of the lack of basic hotel services.",1,2016,12,19
247,Great little trip away,"Fantastic time , the staff were excellent  ,reception  were very helpful  and even printed our boarding passes off for us , the room was spotlessly  clean and the bed very comfortable, breakfast was very good and plenty of it and the tables were cleared very quick which was nice, the hotel is very close to the dart station which was great for getting around .",5,2016,12,18
247,Nice Hotel,"Lovely room, big, new and modern and brand new bathroom. The Hotel is old but rooms are new and decor is modern so its lovely to stay there. Handy hotel to stay in beside the Aviva and it has Parking out front. ",4,2016,12,18
247,"Great Value, Comfortable Hotel","Great Value, Comfortable Hotel close to Aviva Stadium.   Acccessible public transport using the DART at Landsdowne Road station.

I Stayed for 1 night on business at a rate of €88.16 for B & B in a twin room that was shared with a colleague, ie €44.08 each.  Check-in & Check-out was very efficient.  The room, was a little small but more than adequate for a 1 night stay, with a lovely bathroom & very comfortable beds.   Breakfast was tasty and had a wide variety of options to choose from.  The Bar was shut for renovations during our stay but drinks were being served from the dining room so no real issue.
I would definitely recommend this hotel for people visiting the Landsdowne Road/Ballsbridge area of Dublin.",4,2016,12,14
247,Great experience,"We love it here and will be back!  Great for family getaway and we love the atmosphere.  Location is central and everything is on your doorstep including the city centre, parks, beach, rugby ground and much more.",5,2016,12,14
247,Stay near airport,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights arriving and departing Dublin. Location is close to the ""Dart"" so it is easy to go down town., less than twenty minutes. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Second floor is better. Evrything was ok. ",4,2016,12,13
247,Handy for Rugby,"Ok room, if fairly small.  As usual in most hotels, pillows like rocks. Shame that the bar was closed for a refurb.  Nice staff, handy for the dart.     Good hotel for the rugby but not sure I would stay there again.  ",3,2016,12,13
247,"""Great""","Excellent 3 night stay with family. Service brilliant and staff were polite and friendly. The rooms were lovely with everything needed. Good location and easy to travel to tourist areas.
We would definitely stay again .",5,2016,12,13
247,A Home in Dublin 4,"Just updating my past review since the Hotel has gone under some extensive renovations. It has worked very well, and totally transformed the décor and accommodation. Latest upgrade was on the Bar area, and have yet to witness the results. Consistently excellent service form the Management and Staff of the Sandymount who make the stay a pleasure from the initial telephone contact to Front of House arrival. As always special mention has to be made of ""Beatrice"" for her welcoming smile and overall professionalism. Across the board this Hotel delivers in all aspects of service even involving an unsolicited offer by a staff member to de-ice my Jeeps windscreen, during some frosty weather. It feels like a home away from home, and suitable for all types of occasions....only fault I would have is driving through the archway without hitting John's Scooter or motorbike....Food as always is excellent, prompt and well served by friendly caring staff. The Seasonal atmosphere is always complimented by the building of the Gingerbread Christmas Village, and I had the honour of meeting the architects on my last stay as the produced another masterpiece.
The Sandymount is definitely a location I would recommend, and very close to amenities, within walking distance of the 3 Arena for any shows you may be booking.",5,2016,12,13
247,Birthday visit ,"We stayed in Dublin for my partners birthday and we found a good deal with the sandy mount to include dinner, bed and breakfast. I emailed the hotel prior to our stay to try to organise something special and lamina was very helpful offering us a complimentary upgrade to the executive room, which I must say was perfect. The room was massive and very clean with everything you could need. Dinner was amazing and the service from Bobby was outstanding. The breakfast was as good as our dinner the night before, buffet style with lots of choice. I would definitely stay here again so thank you for a wonderful stay. ",5,2016,12,12
247,Good hotel overall,"Perfect for aviva stadium or south side of Dublin.
Have stayed here many times.
Good atmosphere.
Excellent bar food.
Watch out for the ""pig and a pint"" offer during rugby match days.
Was a bit disappointed on last solo stay with standard of groom..but good overall.",4,2016,12,12
247,brilliant,"really wonderful place to stay, nice  and clean, room temperature was nice and airy, reception staff were nice and friendly, very helpful, beautiful décor.1 will  will be returning soon for another visit.",5,2016,12,12
247,Excellent accommodation and services,"I went to this hotel in December 2016, and have nice 3 days hosting for business. The company payed my stay.
The services are excellent, and the food is incredible and inexpensive. I strongly recommend this hotel if you are going to Dublin for business, since it's just a 10 min walking from the city center (big companies such as Facebook and Google are really close, and you can go walking).",5,2016,12,12
247,Perfect  for city break,Very nice good size  room and excellent bed . Quiet location for good nights sleep. Dart station close by for easy access to city center.  Breakfast was buffet with lots of choice. First time stay will return .Staff helpful and friendly.,5,2016,12,09
247,"Really wonderful place to stay and sleep, room airy, not stuffy. Bright hotel, well decorated.","I usually stay in the Trinity Capital For business and pleasure, I love it. But, you know, I had to stay here because of a meeting group and its going to be my first choice from here on in. I had a better sleep, less noise, brighter room, got 4hrs work done before breakfast. Only €7 in a taxi to get me to the same location in city centre as if I'd stayed in a 1.3 times more expensive hotel! No brainier for the future. Highly recommend ",5,2016,12,09
247,Would recommend,"I'm glad I chose this hotel from quite an extensive list available in Dublin. There were lots that were closer to the centre of Dublin for a similar price but I feel that Sandymount was an all round good choice. It was very clean, good value for money and an excellent location. It was a 2 minute walk to the train station & a 5 minute ride into the centre of Dublin, alternatively the Dublin sightseeing bus stops right outside the Aviva stadium which is also a 2 minute walk. There was free parking & free wifi which is normally charged for in lots of other hotels. The rooms were quite nice, not wow but everything you could want including a safe, iron & ironing board, tea coffee etc. A range of free newspapers too! 
Staff were very helpful & accommodated any requests. Bar area was pretty good for a hotel & food was very nice. 
The hotel made my trip to Dublin all the more enjoyable. Would definitely stay there again. 
",5,2016,12,09
247,An opportunity Lost,"A toasted sandwich and  a bag of taytos would have sufficed in the bar - which we did ask about and was declined.  This was a pity as it is always a pleasure to stay at the Sandymount Hotel, but this did put a slight damper on things.",3,2016,12,09
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Good location, friendly waiter staff, but restaurant was uncomfortably cold and the bar was closed for renovation. Rooms were very good. Breakfast was 12 euro but it was all you can eat. Food was very food, reception staff were not very friendly",3,2016,12,08
247,Excellent hotel service and staff,"Staff are extremely helpful and go out of their way to provide an excellent service .
The hotel is newly refurbished and the rooms are immaculate.
The hotel is right beside the Aviva stadium and a short walk from the RDS
",5,2016,12,08
247,By Paul  08/12/16,"Recently stayed for autumn internationals at the Aviva. Perfect for any event on that side of city. Very friendly envirinment, good food. Access from the north via the tunnell is simplistic and the dart is literally one minute away.",5,2016,12,08
247,Perfect for Aviva,"Look no further on a match day. Perfect location, staff could not be more helpful and value for money for location,  parking on site, very clean.  No ""fleecing""  overall great experience. Would recommend and return, absolutely! ",5,2016,12,08
247,Anniversary weekend,We combined an International rugby match with an anniversary weekend mirroring a similar stay we had many years ago. The hotel was well modernised and the staff were as equally pleasant and helpful. The restaurant was busy yet intimate and the food was lovely 😊,5,2016,12,08
247,Brilliant Hotel,Was going to the RDS for the Irish Craft Fair. I needed a hotel nearby with an outdoor Carpark for my van so chose this hotel. The room was lovely and the food was outstanding. I had the best steak dinner ever. ,5,2016,12,08
247,Great spot with real character,"Delighted to stay somewhere other than a big hotel chain. Winding corridors, changing levels and uneven floors. Great character to the place. The room was fine - comfortable bed, great shower. I didn't eat in the hotel so can't say anything about the food. Only 5 mins walk from The Aviva and 15 mins from the RDS so a great choice for sporting events and concerts.",4,2016,12,08
247,Perfect for us ,"We stayed here for 5 nights during the National Crafts and Design Fair in the RDS.  It suited us fine and is very central. 

The staff are very friendly and the room, although quite small was comfortable and warm. While we were there, some work was being carried out on the line out bar and this caused some noise in the morning, but as we were not there during the day it didn't affect us. 

We would recommend this Hotel as a good central location very close to the Dart line ",4,2016,12,07
247,good,"good but had to remove key card to stop buzzing noise The hotel was in a good location. A short walk away from the dart station, and The Aviva Stadium. The bed was comfortable and cosy. The room was a good size and tidy, as was the bathroom. The staff were friendly",3,2016,12,02

247,Nice lunch - great location,We had lunch in the bar.  Can recommend the delicious fish chowder.  Free parking.  Lovely open turf fire in reception area.   Walking distance to train or bus for travelling into the city.  Many old features in this hotel,5,2016,11,30
247,Nice Hotel.,"The hotel was in a good location. A short walk away from the dart station, and The Aviva Stadium. The bed was comfortable and cosy. The room was a good size and tidy, as was the bathroom. The staff were friendly.    ",5,2016,11,29
247,Handy spot for Internationals,"Needed a hotel close to Aviva Stadium in Dublin and this was the ideal spot. 4 Star property within a 3 minute walk to the Aviva Stadium. Very clean and friendly hotel. Choice of food is limited on match days ,",4,2016,11,28
247,Beautiful hotel very good food,Very enjoyable stay at the Sandymount Hotel. We arrived just before 9 and staff were very accommodating regarding having a meal. The meal was very enjoyable. The room was very cosy and very clean. Would recommend the sandymount hotel to friends,5,2016,11,28
247,Enda o'Neill's stay in the Sandymount Hotel,"Great hotel, Friendly staff will stay again soon,
Lovely and friendly place and spotlessly clean
The rooms are bright and airy only a few minutes fro m the city centre in a Taxi and yet far enough away from city centre to enjoy a nice rest afterwards.",5,2016,11,28
247,Room 126,"Car park adjacent to windows of the room, blocking view. One car-owner frequently returned to his/her car causing late night noise. Also bright street lights in the street outside room causing some brightness inside the room at night. Generator switched on early for rugby match. Otherwise a comfortable room with plenty of space and facilities. Fresh milk option a good idea. Biscuits?",4,2016,11,28
247,November 2 night stay,A hotel that is in a lovely & quiet location that has helpful and friendly staff. Had a very enjoyable & relaxing time. Lots of ample space in the car park. On match days in the nearby Aviva would imagine it is quiet hectic. Will definitely return to this hotel to stay again.,5,2016,11,28
247,Pleasant stay at convienent location,"have stayed here many times & will continue to - room size can be hit & miss - overall good place to stay, car parking at hotel - only negative comment - no gym albeit they have arrangement with nearby  gym",4,2016,11,28
247,Really good as always,It's not the most modern place I've ever stayed but I always try to stay if it's available. Really nice staff. Rooms are fine and food and bar are nice. Have stayed here for business and with family. Stayed last week and was going to car to be asked did I need de-icer for my car. That is the difference and the reason I go back. ,4,2016,11,27
247,Fantastic ,"There isn't one bad thing I can say about this hotel I stayed here Monday and checked out the Friday. 

The staff are all extremely helpful, the food is delicious the rooms are amazing and the bed is comfy everything you need! 

The one thing I do want to point out though is two members of staff Lee and Nathan,  you guys are fantastic!  You made that night at the bar very funny and very enjoyable! Sandy Mount they are a credit to your company and I hope you look after them! My stay wouldn't have been as good if it wasn't for those two and that's a fact!! ",5,2016,11,25
247,Rugby!!!,"Perfect location if you are visiting Aviva Stadium. We stayed for the NZ vs Ireland match and the hotel even had a beer tent and hog roast the day of the game. Atmosphere was great, all of the public areas were packed. The hotel is surprisingly large with many corridors snaking far away from reception so we didn't get any noise from the continuing celebrations. Very close walk to the stadium as well as the DART station for an easy commute into the city centre. 

Room was very clean, slightly cramped with two beds in it but had all of the necessary tea, coffee, toiletries and hair dryer. Bathroom very modern. My only niggle was that there was only one bedside table for the double bed so I had to use the chair for the water/ phone/ jewellery etc. 

Bar food/ drinks were fine, service varied - some staff members excellent and others not great.",4,2016,11,25
247,Another nice time at the Sandymount Hotel,As usual it was a very relaxing stay and the staff made it a great place to stay.Looking forward to next occasion to say in the hotel.Some improvements are being carried out and we are looking forward to seeing them.,5,2016,11,24
247,Missing ipad,"We stayed at the Sandymount last weekend for the rugby. As I couldn't close the safe I put my iPad under the tea tray on the counter, and unfortunately forgot it. The iPad cannot be found. They say. ????",1,2016,11,24
247,An Excellent venue with outstanding service,"On arrival we were greeted by the lovely Beatrice, who was as charming as they come and made us both feel very welcome. Our room was perfect and easy to get to with the lift stopping pretty much right outside our door. The highlight of the stay would have to be the breakfast which we certainly took full advantage of, it is also worth mentioning the quality of service we received was second to none. Nothing was too much for ask! even my girlfriends request for a lemon to squeeze into her tea, each day a fresh lemon was cut to precision and brought out with the tea. By the end of our stay they actually found a tea bag which included lemon in it. All in all it was a real pleasure to stay there, particularly the amazing atmosphere on saturday with the Rugby on. Would recommend this highly to anyone coming to Dublin for a short break or for business. ",5,2016,11,24
247,Perfectly located,"Great two night stay close to the stadium for the rugby and within walking distance to shops, pubs and restaurants.  The hotel was very good and the staff very friendly and helpful, couldn;t fault it in any way.",5,2016,11,24
247,Great hotel,"Stayed for only 2 nites, staff were extremely helpful in steering me in the right direction so that I could get the most out of my 1 day excursion into Dublin and pointed me in the direction of the nearby area of Sandymount where I would be able to find a nice pub and awesome food",4,2016,11,23
247,Another Great Stay,A great location for the Aviva stadium....and also very handy for the Dart train into central Dublin ..... and also not a bad walk either if you enjoy walking. Staff very helpful and even dropped us off at the bus stop to catch our coach to the Airport...☘️😁,5,2016,11,23
247,my weekend experience,"We went for the big match Ireland v All Blacks.
At the hotel we were made very welcome from arrival to leaving.
We could not get the room safe to work; phoned reception and within 2 minutes someone came and fixed it.",5,2016,11,23
247,Ideal for rugby,"My partner and I recently stayed at Sandymount hotel which was perfect for the Aviva Stadium.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean, however felt a little cramp and dark.  Staff offered suggestions on excursions and other places to visit.",4,2016,11,23
247,Will be back again and again,"Lovely hotel, nice clean rooms . Staff are so friendly and helpful. Hotels location is ideal for the Aviva stadium, Rds and more. The DART is only around the corner.  Lovely quiet area too. Would recommend to anyone",5,2016,11,22
247,Family favourite hotel,Excellent family run hotel close to Aviva Stadium and Ballsbridge. We are always made very welcome and service is first class. The staff are very friendly and efficient. The proprietor is a gentleman who engages with his guests and makes them feel very welcome.,5,2016,11,22
247,Sandymount  Hotel has it all!,"My wife and I recently stayed for another time in Sandymount Hotel.  It is ideal for Aviva Stadium.  The staff are so friendly and helpful.  Beatrice and Rose are lovely, and owner John is always so welcoming.  The room was of good size, bright, clean and very comfortable.  The food was excellent, and the service, in all areas, was second to none.  We have stayed several times before, and the standard has never wavered.  We will hopefully return in March - and beyond.",5,2016,11,22
247,Ideal hotel for a rugby or concert weekend in Dublin,"Booked this hotel for a rugby weekend and the location is brilliant for this as it is only a few hundred yards from the Aviva Stadium. The hotel is clean, bright and modern with everything you need in the rooms. Staff are friendly and helpful and our room 553 was at the end of a corridor so it was very quiet even though the hotel was packed with rugby fans. We had 2 nights of comfortable quiet sleep. Dublin city centre is easily accessible on the train. Landsdown Road Dart Station is only a couple of hundred yards from the hotel and 2 euros 40 cents takes you to Connolly Sation in the heart of Dublin. I would recommend a leisurely 10 minute stroll into Sandymount Village which has an old world charm and some good bars and restaurants. Altogether we had a great weekend and I would recommend the Sandymount Hotel very highly!",5,2016,11,22
247,Weekend break.,"We enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay again, Friendly staff comfortable surroundings, we had a lovely meal, When we could not get a taxi the Hotel owner drove us to the event we were attending, much appreciated. ",5,2016,11,22
247,Mary Greensmith Stay,"If I have to pick a fault it would be the bathroom, the shower was one overhead the bath, as my husband has a slight hip problem a bathroom with walk in shower would be my preference and also the rooms are a little tight size wise.",5,2016,11,22
247,Top class,This is our 3rd stay in the Sandymount and once again they didn't fail from the reception staff(special mention of Toni) to the excellent rooms great atmosphere and five star breakfast thanks again our favourite hotel to stay when visiting Dublin 👍👍,5,2016,11,21

247,As ever a good place to stay,"good, quiet location within comfortable enough walking distance of city centre, or easy access by public transport; spacious yet cosy, well-fitted room; good  public areas in the hotel, comprehensive range of items at breakfast (or alternatives supplied); friendly, efficient staff.",5,2016,11,21
247,Never Fails,"Find it difficult to stay anywhere else in Dublin and we keep coming back!! I have reviewed this Hotel before but just the best location and a recent uplift to all rooms ensures a very comfortable stay.
Customer Service is excellent from initial booking- always better value to book direct!
Reception staff were very welcoming as usual and on one of the busiest Rugby weekends ever...nothing was too much trouble.
On normal stays this Hotel is in one of the quieter areas but only 3 stops on the Dart into Central Dublin.
I would recommend that you explore the Sandymount and Ballsbridge areas for some great Pubs and restaurants instead of travelling into the City Centre . Enjoy!",5,2016,11,21
247,Nice little place ,Stayed there this weekend while the rugby was on ( although that's not what the trip was booked for ) and have zero complaints! Staff were friendly and very obliging. Room was clean and transport to and from hotel was very easy! All round an enjoyable stay.,4,2016,11,21
247,Friendly Hotel,"Can only recommend either for business, tourist or just to have a good time. 
The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.

247,Business stay,"Discovered this hotel from an ad on Facebook. Great location and car parking a big plus. Received a great welcome on arrival, staff are very helpful and courteous. The room was comfortable and clean as was the bathroom. Breakfast was lovely and buffee a good idea, no waiting for service, especially if you on a business triop.",4,2016,11,20
247,Week in Dublin,Sandymount Hotel was the ideal location for our family break in Dublin. The newly renovated rooms were comfortable and the DART station nearby was great for getting into the city. Free car parking was helpful. Breakfast was well prepared and our hint is to try the porridge and scrambled eggs. The staff were very friendly and helpful.,5,2016,11,20
247,Business Trip,"This hotel has an interesting floor plan with various levels. Given its age and what they have to work with I feel they have maximised on it. The room was compact but clean and fresh. As a business trip I didn't spend any real time in the room. Breakfast was very friendly, wide selection and a nice ambiance. I cannot praise the staff enough and will stay here again when the opportunity arises.",4,2016,11,20
247,Great Hotel with Friendly Staff,"Great hotel no downside that I found and would definitely return again. Location was great close to Dart although I did drive into Dublin centre and it was quite direct route. Rooms were very clean. Staff were excellent, food in the Line Out Bar was excellent and good selection of hot and cold for breakfast.",5,2016,11,20
247,Great midweek stay,Very well located hotel. Good midweek rates. Friendly staff and a very nice relaxed bar with good food. I thought it was a very nice touch when I arrived to my car last week and it was frozen. There was a staff member out offering de-icer for guests windscreens. ,5,2016,11,18
247,family stay,"Room was to small for a family,we were downsized from an executive suite and offered no decrease in price,heat wasn't working properly as radiator was leaking.bathroom was extremely small and badly laid out",4,2016,11,17
247,Decent location,"We stayed at this hotel with a party of friends during a rugby week-end (two nights). 
The staff was friendly and helpful upon check-in, unfortunately not many positive points to note after this. 
Our room was downstairs, small and an even smaller bathroom. The room felt damp and the bathroom smelled of dampness. 
After taking a bath we realized that the chain was not attached to the plug and the tub could not be drained. When we called reception they sent a friendly young man, who was obviously not a handyman. 
On day two, we noticed that they did not refill the toilet paper. I went to reception and asked for a roll, they said someone would bring it to the room. That someone never arrived. I picked up some toilet paper myself from one of the maids in one of the corridors. 
Breakfast is nice, unfortunately the service is not very efficient for coffee and tea, nor for cleaning the tables. 
Upon checkout there was a problem with the breakfast charged to our rooms, even though I had pre-booked ad paid rooms and b-fast in full. 
In conclusion: I found this hotel expensive for what it offers. Look at hotels in the area before booking this one.",2,2016,11,17
247,Comfortable stay,"Comfortable & good value hotel - very good location. Convenient to RDS, Sandymount, Aviva. Stayed at this hotel for the past 20 years and also liked the homely & personal atmosphere.

247,Rugby Trip,"Great location for Aviva Stadium and lovely staff, particularly on Reception Desk. Two minute walk from Aviva Stadium but generally a great location for visiting Dublin . Also good car parking, which is free. ",4,2016,11,17
247,good stay bad water,"Hotel located in a decent place, close to the aviva stadium and the train station which was handy to get into the city only two stops and then you are there. 

The hotel itself seemed a bit dated for the price and didnt include breakfast for the amount we paid seemed a bit steep, we did have to switch rooms due to the water in the bathroom running brown, we told reception and they moved us straight away however could have been avoided if this was checked before.  the hotel was not all that clean, when we arrived in our new room there seem to be hairs from previous guests too, perhaps a little more effort could have been made. 

not a lot near the hotel so you have to go to the city which was no trouble for us as the train is inexpensive and frequent. 

Staff were very friendly and accommodating,  although we didn't really need it we asked for a wake up call as we had a very early flight but they never called us which was a little annoying as we had asked for this and expected the hotel to follow through which they didn't. 

in the bathroom we had a towel heater but could not figure out how to turn this off and left the room very warm. 

it is a nice hotel but you  don't get value for money ",3,2016,11,16
247,Rugby Weekend Trip,"Can't get any closer to the Aviva Stadium without actually being on the pitch! Comfortable stay even on a busy weekend. Excellent breakfast. Staff attentive, very quick check-in and check out procedure. Handy for Dart station so central Dublin is only minutes away. Happy that we were also given adjoining rooms. ",5,2016,11,15
247,Very happy with Sandymount experience.,"I chose Sandymount based on TripAdvisor rating. Superb location for rugby at Aviva stadium. Convenient location for trains and buses. Staff were very pleasant and helpful . My room was clean and fine for one. 
2 things that I would have appreciated were a small fridge and control over the temperature. I found it too warm even with the window open.  I'd happily return!",4,2016,11,15
247,Pleasure,"Prime Location. Rooms spotless, noise level limited 2nd time to stay here and would have no problem recommending it especially if going to an event at the Aviva. Staff pleasant and very helpful even though it was very busy they were always smiling.",5,2016,11,15
247,Short visit,"Stayed here early November on Business. Room was very small but comfortable and look like it had just been totally refurbished it was spotless. Check in was quick and efficient. Finding your room can be tricky with different lifts for different rooms and alot of steps. Breakfast was ok, slightly cold and there was confusion about our voucher that we has purchased on check in as they lady in the breakfast room didn't seem to know what it was and had to seek assistance. Location is very good for the Aviva or the general D4 area.",3,2016,11,15
247,Lovely hotel in ideal location !!,"Party of six booked for weekend break. Hotel is ideal for easy access to Dublin City Center or the more peaceful Sandymount village where there are some lovely bars and restaurants.Hotel staff are genuinely warm and friendly with helpful advice etc. We were able to check in early and the rooms were perfectly adequate for our needs with comfortable beds, pillows and a refurbed bathroom.",5,2016,11,15
247,"Great hotel, top location !","Lovely hotel in a superb location next to the Aviva and close enough to walk into town or Sandymount village.
Great atmosphere, friendly staff and to top it all the breakfast was different class.
Would definitely recommend and be happy to stay again. 
",5,2016,11,15
247,Very Nice Hotel,"Great location. Great parking and easy to find. Excellent service. Wouldn't go anywhere else. 
Plenty of room. Hotel was very quiet. Staff were very friendly & helpful. The room was lovely and very clean.",5,2016,11,15
247,Family trip to watch rugby,"I was recommended the Sandymount and we were not disappointed.  I was looking for my large family ranging in age 2 to 79 as coming to watch the rugby at the Aviva and it could not have been better located.  The hotel were welcoming, rooms clean, comfortable and spacious, delicious and generous breakfast only downside was the bar bill......but that was due to us all having a great time!!!  The bar was humming on Saturday night so if you are not a rugby fan just check if there is a game on first but if you are a fan this for sure is the place to be!",5,2016,11,15
247,Sandymount review,"Booked this hotel due to the location as I was going to rugby at the aviva. From the first moment you arrive your made to feel very welcome, the staff are extremely helpful and very friendly. The rooms are also very nice, well kept and always refreshed tea and milk every day. The food was spot on every time, from breakfast to dinner you could never go wrong. 

Would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% stay there again. ",5,2016,11,15
247,Great little weekend away,"Had a great experience at the sandymount for the two days that we spent here from the very friendly and helpful staff on reception to the quick and friendly staff in the bar couldn't praise it any higher, stayed at the hotel over a very busy weekend with a match on and the place still provided us with a quite and relaxing  break away,  it is a bit away from Dublin city centre but with the dart station a mere 3 minute walk away the hotel is ideally situated,  we ate in the bar for our first night and the menu offers  a great range of meals to choice from and we were both very happy with our meals and the service provided, would definitely recommend the sandymount if your thinking of staying in Dublin and look forward to staying here again. ",5,2016,11,14
247,consistently reliable,I stay here regularly mostly for business. The management and staff make every effort to make the experience satisfactory. Access and paring are excellent. The recent room upgrades have made the experience even better. My only complaint is that it can be difficult to get a room occasionally. ,5,2016,11,14
247,Best hotel in Locale,This is the nicest hotel in the vicinity of the Aviva stadium although their rooms rates are quite high. Still to find a nicer hotel you would need to go nearer to the city centre. Our room/bathroom was quiet small but well appointed as I believe the hotel has been recently refurbished.,4,2016,11,14
247,Dublin's friendliest hotel,I use this hotel every time I come to Dublin now.  It is in a quiet location not far from the city centre but ites main attraction is that its a friendly and welcoming place.  The bar area is comfortable with good wifi and its a nice place to relax in the evening without feeling awkward eating/drinking on your own.   ,5,2016,11,14
247,A Very Happy Birthday to Me!,"Having worked in hotels for years, I appreciate how much a little touch can go a long way, so on telling them at the reception that it was my birthday, upon arrival, we were upgraded to a King Size room, given a bottle of wine and then free breakfast for the 2 days we were at the hotel.

This place is charming, and has all the comfort, modern touches and amenities you would want. The location is a little out of town, perfect if you are watching the rugby as it is right on the doorstep of the Aviva stadium, and just 10 minutes away from the beach and quaint town of Sandymount. To get into town was easy enough, regular trains from nearby Landsdowne Road will get you in within 15 minutes and the night is yours to enjoy this wonderful city. Even a taxi back won't set you back much more than 10 Euros.

Finally, the staff, all very friendly, like pretty much everyone I encountered in Dublin, but a special mention to Beatrice, who gave great advice and made us feel very welcome. It was a truly fantastic stay, I recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dublin, fantastic breakfast, fantastic team.... pretty much overall fantastic!",5,2016,11,14
247,Great Hotel in great location,"Very freindly staff, lovely room and great dinner. I chose hotel due to travelling on the ferry and it was perfect. I was on busines travelling with my wife and 6 week old son. They provided a cot and we nejoyed dinner in the restaurant. ",5,2016,11,14
247,Comfortable Stay,"Stayed at Sandymount for two nights. I was on a business visit. It was very comfortable stay and no issues at all. Good food, friendly staff and nice rooms. 
There was an easy shuttle service to go to work. Enjoyed my stay and Highly recommended. ",4,2016,11,12
247,excellent stay at Sandymount,We had a marvoulus time at the Sandymount Hotel. Nothing to complain. It was excellent. The staff was helpfull. Only the room was a little bit to warm when we arrived. It was quiet. We didn;t hear anything from the other quests,5,2016,11,12
247,I have used this Hotel on a weekly basis for my business trips and can not recommend it enough ! Totally excellent,"I have used this Hotel on a weekly basis over the last number of years for my business trips to Dublin. Great location with excellent rooms following their recent refurbishment. Friendly staff like Ann and Beatrice on reception or Toni in reservations, allways helpful. Bar food great, try the "" Line out burger"" you won't be hungry after that.
I will continue to use this Hotel until they get fed up of me !
Excellent ",5,2016,11,12
247,Business Stay,Very Convenient location.  Rooms spotless.  Food lovely in the bar.  Service very food. It's a bit of a maze with different floors and different lifts. Overall though nice stay friendly staff clean rooms and food value,4,2016,11,12
247,Lovely hotel,"Ideal location to stay when visiting the aviva and
 right beside the dart for travelling into the city centre for shopping
Lovely friendly helpful staff.. free parking also available if travelling by car",5,2016,11,12
247,Very nice Hotel within walking distance to the Aviva,I couldn't fault anything about the hotel. It was nice to stay in a hotel with its own personality rather than a chain. The rooms looked like they had been recently refurbished and was of a high standard. The bar was spacious and comfortable and the food is always lovely in here. The Aviva is a short stroll away so ideal for me. Would definitely stay again and recommend to colleagues.  ,5,2016,11,11
247,Sandymount Hotel,"We have just retruned from a weekend in Dublin, staying at Sandymount Hotel. From a warm welcome, excellent information provided about the locality to the hotel itself which was first class, it is thoroughly recommended. We wouldn't hesitate to return.",5,2016,11,10
247,Up for the match.,Myself and my wife stayed here last sunday night. WE were able to check in early. We had lunch in the bar which was fine.The room was small containing a double and a single bed even though their was only two of us.The food in the restaurant that evening was very good.,4,2016,11,09
247,Ideal Place to Stay in Dublin,"Service was excellent, staff met all our needs never asked for something that wasn't taken care of immediately.   Receptionist at the desk by the name of Ann Ryan was always there to answer all our needs, I feel she was an asset to the hotel.",5,2016,11,09
247,Great location and service,"On our 3rd stay. Great location, great parking, easy to find. Excellent service. Wouldn't go anywhere else. Stayed in a family room - one double and two singles.  Plenty of room.  Hotel was very quiet and had a great night's sleep.",5,2016,11,08
247,Very good hotel,"The staff is very friendly and considerate. Room accomodations are large and new. There is also a train station closer to the hotel and it is located in a very quiet neighbourhood, which makes the location privileged.",5,2016,11,08
247,NICE AN QUITE PLACE,"I had had a very good experience in this hotel.
I would surely repeat.
Quiteness and profesionality of their reception staff helps to have a nice stage.
Some of the rooms are larger tan the others but all of them are clean and confourtable.

",4,2016,11,08
247,Great hotel,Very friendly and helpful staff! My mum and I stayed in the executive suite.. great room .. very clean! Great location if you don't want to stay within the centre of Dublin. Train station is just a 5 minute walk around the corner,5,2016,11,08
247,Welcoming Hotel Experience,We always feel very welcome when we stay at the Sandymount. The staff are friendly and most of the other guests are as well. The breakfasts are enormous and great as long as you're not worried about putting weight on. This hotel seems to appeal very much to European guests.,5,2016,11,07
247,Nice Stay,"We stayed here the first and last night of our 7 days in Ireland, staff were friendly and helpful, room was clean and bed comfy, food was great. A little far from the city, was a good walk, which after all the food we had eaten on our trip was a good thing. Would stay here again.",3,2016,11,04
247,Pleasant stay,"I stayed here for the Dublin Marathon weekend. My flight arrived early on the Saturday morning which meant I got to the hotel about 11am and I was just hoping to drop my bags and go & collect my race number etc from the Marathon Expo @ the RDS which is just 5 mins walk from the hotel - they had a room available which was brilliant & I got checked in effortlessly.
I was allocated room 108 on the bottom floor - the room was pleasant enough albeit a bit dark and was very warm even with the heating off & the windows open.
The hotel has the brilliant backdrop of the Aviva Stadium which is quite a sight.

I decided that I would eat in the Line Out bar in the hotel that evening as I was wanting a fairly quiet & early night - this proved to be a mistake. The bar was extremely busy with fellow runners & their families aswell as other guests. I waited almost an hour for my food & when it turned up it was cold.

I purchased two vouchers for breakfast and it was great - staff lovely & pleasant.
I would certainly stay again as it's good base for the City - a wee bit out of the centre but it's lovely walk in.",4,2016,11,03
247,Lovely stay ,"Hotel is a bit far from the city centre but we got cabs/buses everywhere. Stayed there with my best friend for a weekend away. Lovely clean hotel, friendly staff and room service/hotel restaurant was lovely. Would definitely stay there again ",4,2016,11,02
247,Good stay,"Had a nice weekend on a conference trip. Good room, nice bed, great breakfast. Conference room was alright too. 25 minutes walk from Dublin centre. Close to communications but nothing at all to do close by.",4,2016,11,01
247,A warm welcome in Dublin,We had an enjoyable two days in The Sandymont Hotel recently. I found the staff friendly and the rooms comfortable. The quality of food was excellent. This was my first time staying in the extended piece and I found the bedrooms and meeting rooms hard to locate without guidance.,4,2016,10,31
247,Superb! ,"We visited Sandymount hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The staff were superb. We were given a room upgrade and a complimentary bottle of wine alongside a personal letter from the manager. 
The ladies on reception desk were incredible friendly and always went over and above to assist us. 
The location is excellent with very easy access to Lansdown Rd DART station. 
I cannot recommend the hotel highly enough! Thank you for making our stay in Dublin absolutely brilliant! ",5,2016,10,30
247,An excellent place to stay,It is an excellent family hotel! The personnel are always smiling and ready to help for you to have a great time! The food is very good and the rooms are properly equipped and with enough space. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2016,10,26
247,Fantastic Stay .. Above and Beyond Expectations,"We stayed at the Sandymount Hotel in Dublin for 3 Nights. We were celebrating Our friends birthday while we were there.  I emailed ahead of our visit to see if I could arrange a little surprise. This is where the hotel staff came into their own .. with a complimentary room upgrade & bottle of wine. It did not stop there even to my surprise they brought us Sparking wine and a little birthday cake to the table at breakfast. This made our stay so memorable. The hotel and the wonderful staff deserve 5 stars plus .. the breakfast and rooms were fantastic too .. all in all we would highly recommend this hotel. We will be back for sure Xx

247,Brilliant Stay!!,"Checked out today from a 3 night stay at Sandymount Hotel, nothing can be faulted! The staff are so nice and friendly, welcoming you back every time you enter the hotel, could not recommend a better place to stay!!!",5,2016,10,26
247,50th Birthday Celebrations!,"On arrival we were early, but the staff at the front desk had us booked in and the luggage was safely stowed in less than half hour. Everyone was very happy, smiling and very welcoming. Casey, who helped the four of us to our rooms, was very helpful. The bar and restaurant staff were all happy, helpful and friendly. Everyone was very smart in their uniforms and seemed very happy to be working there. We stayed for 5 days and experienced the same atmosphere every day. I can't remember everyone's name, but Nicola, Ioana, Bête, Patryk and the new girl that had just started, Anna Marie, all deserve a mention, but all the staff deserve a 'pat on the back'!
The bedrooms were large and airy, the whole hotel very clean. Finally a mention for the boss John, a very friendly, down to earth man who genuinely showed interest when chatting to his guests, and of course, thanks again for the round of drinks once he found out it was my birthday, a nice touch.
All in all, when we return to Dublin we won't be staying anywhere else for either business or pleasure!",5,2016,10,26
247,Highly recommend!,"Everyone at the hotel was extremely nice. They allowed us to check in early. When there was an issue, they went above and beyond to help. I would absolutely stay there again and highly recommend them.",5,2016,10,23
247,A home from home,"The staff are extremely welcoming and helpful in particular the girls at reception.
I stay there every week and would not stay anywhere else. I always get a peaceful night sleep as it is a quiet hotel location.
It also has ample parking.",5,2016,10,21
247,Lovely Stay,"We had a lovely stay in the Sandymount hotel.  Have stayed a few times now and love it.  Rooms are comfy and food is great.  There is secure parking with no charge.
Look forward to my next visit when in Dublin again.",5,2016,10,20
247,Beautiful hotel with some rare gems,"This is my first review on tripadvisor but I felt my stay at the Sandymount Hotel deserved it.  The hotel is really unique in that it is a street of houses that are now a hotel.  This adds to all the charm.  The rooms were very modern and had everything I needed it.  They have really done a great job to modernise the place but still keeps its cosy charm.  Breakfast was really lovely, too much choice for little old me.  One big plus for me was the lovely girl Toni that I made my reservation with.  Im getting on in years and having her help me with my booking just made my life so much easier.  There was nothing too much trouble for her and I felt like there was  no rush to get off the phone for the next customer.  She gave me lots of great tips for getting around and I wish every booking was as easy.  She even called me the day before I arrived to check I was still coming and if there was anything else I needed.  Other hotels could do with learning from this.  Thank you once again and I will be telling all my friends and family to stay with you should they ever need to be in Dublin!",5,2016,10,19
247,Wonderful hotel,"Had a great time, gives the feeling of a small family hotel bit is actually quite big with a lot of rooms , very nice staff, good breakfast. Located in a beautiful quiet area. Only 10 min by train from city center",4,2016,10,19
247,Excellent,Very clean and nice hotel.  Hotel staff is great and very helpful.  Can't go wrong.  Decent size rooms.  Love the hotel bar.  Really good food.  Try the Chicken wings.  Great choices of beers.  The metro station is walking distant.,4,2016,10,17
247,Like a Home from Home ,Couldn't do enough to accomdate you. Service in the restaurant last night was spectacular. Rooms super clean. Food beautiful and staff are exceptional and like I said a home from home couldn't recommend it enough the only place in Dublin I would return and so convenient for working in the city! ,5,2016,10,17
247,Okay,"Spent 2 nights here. Seemed good value but noise of guests returning to their rooms, at all hours, travelled through to the room very clearly, which disturbed sleep. Just didn't seem to be any form of sound proofing. Room and bed comfortable. Toilet seat broken and we reported straight away. Still broken when we left. Dined in the bar first evening and food was fine. Staff in the bar were pleasant and service efficient. Great parking at the hotel. Also good location for the dart and walking to city centre if you don't mind a bit of a walk. ",3,2016,10,16
247,sandymount hotel,"i stayed here October 4th, thru the 11th, 2016.   I was very pleased by the front desk allowing me an early check in as my overnight flight got in really early, for that I am grateful.  The hotel is old, with some modern touches, typical European style. small elevator, hallways that meander, its like several buildings were at one point joined together?  I had several issues with things that I was able to get the manager to listen and make right, so I will not list them.  Food in the restaurant was hit and miss, The room I had was considered a double, very clean, updated, but I mean small!  a chair with no reading lamp nearby, tiny cramped quarters, no place to even set up your suitcase, so it had to go on a twin bed.  The bathroom was modern and updated nicely.  The Aviva stadium, is literally across the road. The dart station ( train) is real close and I chose that for transportation to a lot of places, as I was able to also walk to an air coach bus stop for cheap fare to the airport. Would I stay there again? I think it all depended on the price I was able to get the room for. A few employees went out of their way to make things right, some others, could use some more training on what guest service is.",3,2016,10,14
247,Truly great service!,"Stayed here for one night with our daughter and her friend who were attending a concert nearby. I chose this hotel as I had been here before many years ago and found it to be comfortable enough, but nothing to really write home about. 
Clearly, the place has changed quite a bit since I was last there, as the rooms we were given were really very pleasant and included free, reliable wifi. 
We ate both dinner and breakfast at the hotel and found both to be delicious. 
However, what really stood out for us was how friendly and helpful the staff were. 
Foolishly I had left my hair straighteners behind, which I didn't realise until we had travelled home. I e-mailed the hotel to see if it had been found, only to receive a reply that it had not. 
I thought that was the end of the matter, and that my straighteners had been 'borrowed' by someone else. So you can imagine my surprise when I got a 'phone call a few days later from the hotel, letting me know that they had been found, and offering to post them back at no charge!
Anyway, I would just like to personally thank the hotel staff for their kindness and diligence. I would highly recommend this hotel and certainly stay there again myself. Well done!",5,2016,10,13
247,"Homely, friendly and good food","Is this the Dorchester or Grosvenor House? No. Does it have flashy decor? No. Does it have an expensive spa? No. But what it does have is a great sense of being welcoming, comfortable and refreshingly un-pretentious. I have stayed at many hotels in Dublin and this is my first time at the Sandymount. This place beats the rest by a mile. I'll be booking here regularly in the future, as my first choice Dublin hotel.",4,2016,10,12
247,Nice hotel close to bus routes and stadium,"Helpful and friendly staff, very nice room. Tricky to get luggage up front steps. Adequate parking, free, for hire car. Great breakfast. Restaurant was nice but nothing flash. Fair price for the room you get.",4,2016,10,06
247,Excellent,"recently refurbished more rooms in this hotel. Bar food menu also updated. Food is excellent, great service from very friendly bar and serving staff. Reception staff are most welcoming and helpful. Reservation staff very accommodating. Overall I would not stay anywhere else and free parking and wi-fi an added bonus.",5,2016,10,05
247,Beautiful hotel and charming staff,Stayed here for three nights last week and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  Cleanliness and food second to none.  All staff were charming from front desk to restaurant and all had smiles on their faces.  Hotel is situated in a lovely leafy suburb of Dublin and just a short walk to the DART station with 2 stops into the city.A few stops in the opposite direction takes you to the sea!!  I will definitely book this hotel again when staying in Dublin.,5,2016,10,05
247,Short but nice visit,"I will not write too much about my experience of the Sandymount hotel as it really was a ""pit stop"". I came in late, had breakfast and checked out the next morning. However, everything worked very well. The hotel is located close to the Aviva stadium, which is a very interesting building. The commuter train stops only a two minute walk from the hotel, with two to three stops to the city center. The room was large enough, fairly modern, and well cleaned. It was also very quiet. Breakfast was good. The staff at the check in was nice and efficient.",4,2016,10,04
247,Gillian is the best!,"I am writing to commend the wonderful service our group received while staying a the Sandymount Hotel in Dublin. There were 17 of us on a catholic pilgrimage and Gillian was our waitress in the restaurant the whole time we stayed at Sandymount. She was extremely efficient while always having a smile on her face. It was our first stay in Ireland and it impressed me so much that she was so nice. Of course, the others were nice too, but Gillian really made an impression on me of the warmth of Irish people.",5,2016,10,04
247,Perfect Choice and Great Stay,"Sandymount Hotel checked all the boxes for our visit.  It is in a great neighborhood, walkable (15 minutes or less,) to the charming restaurants of either Sandymount or Ballsbridge.  It is also a flat 5 minute walk to the DART station, and only 2 stops away to whisk you into the center of Dublin.  Don't even think about driving into center Dublin right now, as the level of street construction is huge!  Sandymount Hotel has ample off-street parking.  The rooms are updated, tastefully decorated and extremely comfortable.  The front desk staff were knowledgeable and helpful.  This stay came in the middle of a two-week trip to Ireland and we were delighted to learn that the hotel offers laundry service, 24 hour turnaround, with a good sized bag of clothes washed, dried and folded for 11 euro.  We had the bed and breakfast package.  The hotel offers an ample breakfast buffet in a very pleasant breakfast  room overlooking the back garden with their pet squirrel.  Compared to the sky-high prices of hotels in center city, this lovely property provided the perfect solution to a fabulous stay in Dublin.  We had stayed here back in the day when it was the Mount Herbert Hotel and it has expanded, grown and improved.  I will gladly stay here again and recommend it without hesitation.",5,2016,10,02
247,Regular visitor,"I frequently stay at the Sandymount Hotel while visiting Dublin for business or recreation. I really look forward to staying there as the welcome is always friendly and genuine. The location is great - only a short ride to the city centre by DART. All the rooms have been refurbished recently and are very comfortable. You are guaranteed prompt service in the bar for drinks and food. Other attractions for me are the ccnvenient access when travelling south via the M1 and Port Tunnel, wifi, loads of parking and quiet area.",5,2016,10,01
247,Wholesome Lunch,"Just popped in for an early lunch,  the food is a good as ever, it's nice when you can be sure of getting good wholesome food when you pop in, great WiFi too, was able to send a few emails while having a cup of coffee...👏👏",5,2016,09,29
247,Very Good Hotel,"We have stayed here separately when visiting our daughter. The hotel is quiet, the car parking is great, cleanliness great, and their best asset the staff who are friendly and welcoming. Sanja at reception is especially helpful. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again & would highly recommend.",5,2016,09,26
247,Great,"Can't really fault this hotel at all! Friendly staff, great location (beside Aviva, few minutes from the city centre, RTE studio close by too) and it's so clean! We got dinner in the bar and the food was amazing, bar staff are great crack too! Reason for 4 stars is found the room a bit small. But we'll defo be back ! :) ",4,2016,09,24
247,Great Hotel,A lovely lovely stay last week.  Hotel is always busy and proves how popular it is.  Staff so friendly and helpful.  I saw a comment about no WiFi - rubbish - they do have complimentary WiFi which works perfectly well throughout the hotel.  There are also two computers and printers that guests can use.  Well worth a stay and very handy for the Aviva for rugby and the Dart to get into the city centre.,5,2016,09,23
247,"Great hotel for business or pleasure, excellent location","I was in Dublin attending a conference at the RDS and my husband joined for the trip, so we we wer looking for a hotel that provided the convenience of being close to both the RDS and sight-seeing for my husband.  The location turned out to be excellent.  While not in the centre of Dublin, it is in a lovely neighbourhood, a short walk to Sandmount village and the RDS (less than 10 minutes).  If you don't mind walking, walking to the centre of Dublin is quite doable (20-25 minutes) or take the DART.  There is a DART station less than 5 minutes from the hotel.  The room was nicely appointed and larger than we thought it would be.  Loads of closet space and even the bathroom had storage despite its smallish size.  We made a few requests in advance - renovated room, facing the back of the hotel, early check-in - and all of these requests were met.  The staff at the front desk were exceptional.  Helped us with booking the hop-on-hop-off bus tour, booked the complimentary shuttle every morning to go the RDS, and were generally very helpful and pleasant whenever we asked a question.  The fellow who drove the shuttle was also very pleasant and accommodating.  Breakfast was good.  We opted for the continental, which was plenty for us.  If you prefer hot items like bacon and eggs, go for the full breakfast.  The wifi worked perfectly and was free, and the business centre was very handy for printing and doing things that can't be handled on an iPad.  Had dinner in the bistro one evening and the service was quick and pleasant.  We also used the laundry service and found it to be quick and very affordable.  Overall, this hotel offers excellent value.  It nicely combines the amenities and professional environment of a larger hotel, with a warm and welcoming setting.",5,2016,09,21
247,"Lovely hotel, wonderful people","The hotel is lovely and my room was big, luxurious and comfortable with an excellent shower. The staff at the reception desk went above and beyond the call of duty to help me with some arrangements for my visit. I highly recommend the Sandymount Hotel.",5,2016,09,20
247,No WIFI!,The hotel does the job but not much space for preparing paper work for the following day ( very small desk in the room) and no WIFI in my room. That said the room was fine and clean  Bar food was good. Staff were nice but very busy.       ,3,2016,09,20
247,"Great staff, spotless, fab location ","Had the pleasure of staying here last night. Spotlessly clean, great food, even better staff, and a great nights sleep. Couldn't have asked for more.  Will be back!!!! I managed to leave my phone behind, rang reception who immediately put it in a taxi to my destinations. So helpful. ",5,2016,09,20
247,Lovely hotel,The hotel is not far at all from the city centre. Out of the hustle and bustle and around a forty minute walk if your up for it. The hotel is very clean and modern and the rooms were comfortable and hand everything you need.,4,2016,09,20
247,Sandymount ,"Excellent hotel with friendly and helpful staff. In a quiet area but only a few minutes from the dart.  
Second time we've stayed and the rooms are clean and very comfortable. Breakfast is well worth the supplement. ",5,2016,09,18
247,Very nice hotel,My partner and I stayed in this hotel. We had a quiet nice little room with modern bathroom. Staff with friendly and helpful. You can go to Dublin by Dart within less then 10 minutes. We would come again.,4,2016,09,18
247,Very convenient hotel,"My partner and I stayed in this hotel, about 15 minutes away from the centre of Dublin by train. It was far bigger than I expected, and there were several seating sections around the reception area. The only drawback was that our room was in the basement, and we didn't seem to get much natural light. That aside, the room was very comfortable and had all the amenities that one would expect, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. What I liked best was the ""riverside"" walk into Dublin, and that it was only a 5 minute walk to the station, from where we travelled into Dublin and the coast. We will definitely return and explore more of the area.",4,2016,09,17
247,walk to stadium,Room was quite small but very clean.  Front desk reception was very helpful.  Within walking distance of the stadium.  Easy walk to Hop on hop off tour buses. The building is four old houses together. Good restaurants within walking distance in Sandymount Town.,3,2016,09,16
247,A family run hotel,"Just spent two nights in this very nice clean hotel, me & my best friend where in a double room plenty of space a great bathroom . The staff where friendly & helpful you can buy a 10 euro ticket @ reception for the hop on hop off yellow bus great fun worth the time & money takes you around the city with a commentary . Just a walk up the road to the sandymount village with some nice shops & eating places 3 pubs worth a walk . If you are going to Dublin this is a good place to stay.",4,2016,09,16
247,Great location for business Seminar,"We had a training day with our Company and due to the easy access for everyone coming from all sides of Dublin City we decided the Sandymount Hotel would be a great location, ample parking for everyone and the size of the conference room was perfect, there were 10 of us, the Wifi signal was great and the assistance we recieved with regard to requiring specialised Teas and coffees for the day was second to none.
We had lunch in the bar which proved to be a delight, beautiful home made soup and freshly made wraps everyone really enjoyed it, the staff were most helpful, the Hotel was bright and modern and spotlessly clean, we will certainly be back to hold client seminars and meeting there.",5,2016,09,15
247,4 Golfers from England,"5th year in a row staying at the Sandymount Hotel, we would not go anywhere else, the rooms have all been upgraded to a very high quality finish, but what makes this Hotel even more special is the Staff, always smiling and helpful a home from home, I would like to give a big Thank too Beatrice on reception for all her help. 
Thanks from Brendan.",5,2016,09,15
247,Elegant hotel in Dublin 4,We were fortunate enough to stay at the Sandymount for our first night in Dublin. We arrived very early in the morning and the hotel staff did not have a room ready for us so they offered to hold our bags Ina secure room while we had breakfast and enjoyed the city. Upon our return our rooms were ready which were fantastic rooms with excellent views. The concierge gave us tips on where to eat in the village of Sandymount and it was a hit. We had an amazing meal before returning for the night. I would for sure recommend the Sandymount to anyone who is going to visit. There is transit nearby and within a ten minute walk you can pick up a hop on hop off tour bus and see the city. ,4,2016,09,14
247,Hard to fault,"Stayed here many times and its location is so handy for Aviva and the RDS. Friendly staff both on reception and in the bar. Rooms are great and overall it ticks every box. The free on site car parking is a real bonus, too.",5,2016,09,14
247,Quintessentially exquisite executive all the way ,"We stayed in an executive room on the 4th floor spacious rooms very clean modern decor provided us with robes which we loved felt special slippers provided sealed in plastic shower  as and plenty of soaps. Decaffeinated tea brought by a porter on request,  requested and delivered within 10 minutes of request 5* free sweets on reception friendly knowledgeable politely staff no quibbling  no fuss just excellent service it really raised the bar and the hotel deserves higher official rating a tip if you need accomodation within 2 mins walk of aviva it's the only place to stay ",5,2016,09,14
247,"Great new decor, same excellent team","I've stayed in the Sandymount Hotel on a regular basis both on business & with family over the last 10 years.
Whilst the team there have always been great, most especially Beatrice at the front desk, the decor had become a little dated. That issue has been very firmly rectified with a huge refurbishment programme which (despite the nuisance factor at the time) has meant gorgeous rooms throughout. I'm a big fan of the breakfasts there and especially like the porridge (when I'm feeling virtuous!)
Just noticed last week that there is a separate table of Gluten-free breakfast options, which I know will be of benefit to many.
The personal attention which John and people like Beatrice give to their guests really makes The Sandymount stand apart from the usual anonymous ""chain"" hotels & that is one of the main reasons I continue to support them. It's a little like a ""home away from home""",5,2016,09,13
247,Lovely,"I was originally reluctant to stay away from the center of the city, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the hotel and its location. It was only a few stops on the Dart to most places we wanted to visit. The Dart station was only a 5 - 10 minute walk away. 
Sandymount is a quite neighborhood and after the hustle and bustle of central Dublin it was wonderful to return to the peace and quiet of our hotel.
The rooms are small but had all the amenities, the breakfast buffet was varied and the staff was friendly and helpful.
",4,2016,09,12
247,Exceeds Expectations,"We saw the ratings for Sandymount Hotel and set expectations modestly but the property has proven to be very very nice on virtually all fronts.  Rooms are large and fully updated.  The common areas are stylish and modern.  The breakfast options were traditional 'Irish / British' but well done.  

The main issue to be aware of with this property is its location.  Not close to the center of town.  Very close to Aviva Stadium, the beach, Ballsbridge etc.  If you don't mind being outside of the CBD, this place is great.",4,2016,09,12
247,"nice, clean guesthouse with friendly staff","located in a nice residential area, near Aviva stadium, a nice walk through the neighborhood to shops/restaurants in Sandymount,  loved the comfortable room,breakfast, and staff was very friendly & helpful,,  wifi connex was not consistently available",4,2016,09,11
247,Close to DART,"The hotel is close to the DART station so you can reach Dublin city center easily as well as Bray or Howth. The building is actually a row of old houses converted into a single hotel which is like a labyrinth. We had to turn at least 6-7 times and use staircases to reach our room.
Unfortunately we got a ground floor room which was actually a basement room since the reception is on the first floor. You could see into our room from the parking lot...
The family room was really small and there was no mini bar. It was clean when we arrived, it was not cleaned during our stay. It was very inconvenient that when we asked for new towels, we got some smelly ones, they were not properly washed.

The breakfast was an extra EUR 12 per person and it was not worth it. We have never tried such tasteless Irish breakfast so we decided to eat somewhere else.

The receptionists were friendly and helpful but they forgot to mention that the recommended bus runs only once an hour...",3,2016,09,10
247,A Nice hotel,"My husband and I were booked into this hotel by Air Canada vacations and Abbey Tours. The hotel is in a residential area. It is walking distance to several neighbourhood shopping areas but not Grafton St. in downtown Dublin. It is clean, staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast is typical Irish breakfast. Parking is free and easy as is the Wifii. My only comment is that the hotel is not near the airport and is not easy to get to from the airport. ",4,2016,09,10
247,Very nice hotel,"Super nice hotel, very cute! Very helpful to our needs and one of those including a fan bc the building does not have AC but we were comfortable. Very close to train station and only a 5 min ride to city center.",5,2016,09,10
247,I had such high hopes...,"I ended my two and half week business trip to Limerick in Dublin. My wife and I needed a place to stay before taking the ferry over to Holyhead, UK. 

I'll provide my review in pros/cons bullet points.

Pros
1) The onsite restaurant was FANTASTIC. My wife and I ate there twice and both times we walked away happy. I had the Wild Mushroom Pasta Carbonara, OMG...I could have eaten a gigantic bowl of this. My wife had the Beef & Guinness Casserole. Absolutely delicious...mind blown. 
2) Strong wifi signal. 
3) Easy and convenient onsite parking. 

Cons
1) The room felt like I was in a cave, miles underground. 
2) No ventilation in the room, No AC = very uncomfortable. 
3) I got to know my wife real well...there was no personal space. 

I would return to this hotel again.....for the Wild Mushroom Pasta Carbonara.

Good Luck,
CF",2,2016,09,07
247,"Good hotel, friendly staff","We stayed at the Sandymount hotel for 3 nights in September. The overall hotel location was fantastic for seeing a game at Aviva Stadium- hardly a 5 minute walk away. The staff was friendly, if not a bit overwhelmed (there were two games in two days- hotel was very full and busy). Overall though, they did a good job and were helpful when we needed them to be. Rooms a bit small in size for 3 people (2 adults, 1 child), but we were not in it very often, so it was fine. Bathroom was good size. Rooms were very warm. Next to no street noise could be heard from the room if the windows were closed. The hotel had a nice restaurant with some decent food, some good beers on tab at the bar- it was very nice to be able to go have a drink and relax without having to go very far. The Sandymount location was good too- just a 2 Dart stop away from City Center (Trinity college area), a 5 min walk from the stadium, and the area had many good restaurants to choose from as well! If I were coming back for a game or to explore, I would definitely consider staying here again.",4,2016,09,05
247,Nicer version of a premier inn,"We stayed at Sandymount for 3 nights. Very pleasant, clean hotel. Brilliant location, 15mins from beach and 30mins from city centre in a leafy lovely suburb. Room was smallish and a bit dark, but very clean and nicely done. Staff were lovely. I would stay again. ",4,2016,09,05
247,Nice hotel at stiff walking distance from citycentre,"Decent room, not very big. Buffet breakfast with moderate choice, for example no fresh fruit. Very helpfull personel at reception. At stiff walking distance from citycentre. More than enough parking space. Very nice bar with good food.  ",4,2016,09,04
247,Lovely hotel,"Just returned from our stay at Sandymount hotel. It was much nicer than I expected, our room was spotlessly clean, very well decorated and classy furnished. Although it was a little way out of the city centre it was in a very nice quiet location and very close to the railway station. I would highly recommend it to those who prefer to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city",4,2016,09,03
247,Lovely Hotel in a Residential Area ,Had a great nights stay in the Sandymount. Room had been recently decorated and was spotless clean. Tea and coffee facilities in the room. Also had a good quality iron in the room. Hotel is in the shadows of the Aviva Stadium and is only 10mins walk to the lovely Sandymount strand.  Also the off-street Parking is a bonus. ,5,2016,08,30
247,BEWARE THE HOTEL TAKES MONEY FROM YOUR CARD AND DOES NOT REFUND!!!!,"I can not advise strongly enough not to stay at this hotel! It is extremely over priced for what you pay for, you will not get the type of room you book and they will take extra funds of your card for no reason and then tell you they have refunded it back when they haven't. Also the staff who deal with their emails haven't  clue how to do their job!!  Far better friendly and cheaper hotels out there who wont steal your money and have staff who are trained and know what they are doing!  Also the WIFI did not work!",1,2016,08,30
247,Wonderful service at this friendly hotel,"Now our base for any visit to Dublin.
Excellent service by the staff especially Beatrice at reception.
Spacious and quiet, handy for the Dart train and next to the glorious Aviva stadium.
Good as a work base or for visiting Dublin.  Do walk down to Sandymount village though as there are lovely eating places there ...a five minute walk or so.",5,2016,08,30
247,Nice hotel,"We stayed for a weekend in Sandymount hotel. Hotel is nice, breakfast is good, rooms are clean and refurbished, location is fine. The staff was really friendly en helpful. 1 Remark: the frontdesk staff gave us 2 times incorrect information on the buses (hop on hop off and the bus to the airport) lucky for us it didn't had consequences but if you miss your flight it's a different story. Besides this we had a great stay and would definitely recommend booking this hotel. ",4,2016,08,29
247,"Good, friendly hotel","Great hotel. Unfortunately there are no sport facilities available. The rooms are fully renovated to a modern state.
The bar is ok and the food in the restaurant is fine.
The people who are working at the hotel are very friendly. 
It's always a pleasure to stay at this hotel. 
",4,2016,08,28
247,Excellent,"Stayed for 2 nights recently and found the hotel and staff to be very welcoming we even had a bottle of wine waiting for us to celebrate our anniversary, thank you so much, the rooms are very clean and tidy, the lineout bar is great too as is the breakfast. The hotel itself is very well located for a trip into town with the dart being located within a 5 minute walk away. Thank you to Marisol & Beatrice in particular for great tips & information on the local area, looking forward to returning soon",5,2016,08,27
247,One night at Sandymount Hotel,"I was on a tour with YMT with 32 people other people.  My husband and I  had room 131 which had a double and single bed.  It was very spacious.  We were only there for one night.  The staff was so wonderful!  We all had dinner there.  I had the vegetable curry which was very good.  They provided a special meal for my aunt for has food allergies which she did enjoy.
There is on site computers with printers so we all could print our boarding passes for our flights home the next day.
One of the rooms has a Wee lending library to exchange books in.
A really relaxing evening prior to our flight.  Thank you to the reception staff for mailing a postcard for me too!",5,2016,08,26
247,Great staff excellent room ,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my girlfriend. Staff were so nice and helpful when we arrived! The hotel we were told had been recently refurbished which could be seen as our room was great and modern looking. The location of the hotel is ideal! Right outside of the busy noisy city centre but yet so close too. 5 minutes to the dart station and 2 stops later you are in the middle of Dublin. And only 5 minutes walk to the charming and quaint village of sandmount. All in all had a very enjoyable stay here, would recommend !  ",5,2016,08,24
247,Very comfortable and always welcoming!,Regularly stay at the hotel while on business in Dublin. Front desk staff are very welcoming despite being constantly busy. Rooms while not large have recently been redecorated and are comfortable and spotless. Piping hot shower at all times. Handy room safe and iron/ board both of which are ideal for business travellers in particular who may need to freshen up shirts etc. Breakfast has an excellent choice of cereals and hot dishes to start the day off well.,4,2016,08,23
247,"Irish owned, FABULOUS staff, and great location","I have been guiding groups in Dublin for over 16 years and The Sandymount Hotel is the best by far!  The staff is exceptional, particularly Beatrice and Rose, they always make everyone feel welcome and will always try to help in anyway they can.  They are  very well organized and manage the hotel as if it were their own.  I have been in many rooms over the years and they are all very tidy, comfortable and well equipped with everything guests could need.  The location is great, just a 5 minute walk to the DART station that goes in to city centre.  I can't wait for my next visit!",5,2016,08,20
247,Superb Irish hotel experience ,"We visited Ireland with a group of nursing students this summer. We stayed at the Sandymount hotel during our week's stay in Dublin. What a wonderful hotel near downtown and the DART station. The hotel accommodations are excellent and include a nice Irish breakfast. The Sandymount hotel is a jewel in Dublin. The entire staff - reception, dining, and housekeeping are wonderful. Beds are good - hotel is in a nice little neighborhood near the Aviva sports stadium.",5,2016,08,20
247,Great base for a short stay,"Comfortable hotel, not just close to the Aviva Stadium but also within easy walking distance of the local village green and its shops, restaurants, pubs and cafés (and, for the more intrepid, of the centre of Dublin as well). Both the hotel restaurant and the Line Out bar serve good quality, tasty food. The hotel staff were unfailingly polite and helpful. Our bedroom (an executive double) was perhaps slightly on the small side but very comfortable - and not afflicted by the scourge of air-conditioning (probably rarely needed in Dublin!) but rather windows that actually open to control the room's temperature. Would definitely recommend and return.",4,2016,08,19
247,Excelent hotel in a great area,"It might seem a little bit far from the city center but the hotel has a great location. Very close to the Dart (2-3 stations to city center), in a quiet and good looking neighborhood. It's a great place to start the day with a morning run or to get in your car an go out of town in order to explore around Dublin. It also has a decent access to the airport.

The bad things - it was very expensive compared to other 3* hotels from around Europe. Also the breakfast wasn't that great (walk for 1 km and eat at Junior's Deli). The 3 person room was on the small side.",5,2016,08,19
247,A friendly hotel in a great location,"The hotel has a very personal friendly feel.  The staff at reception and Beatrice in particular went to a great deal of trouble to help us organise days out.  The bar (restaurant) staff were great too.  Food was good standard with lovely bread at breakfast.  The location near to the DART station means days out to Greystones, Howth, Killiney and Dalkey are easy and very cheap.  Also Dublin as well of course.  Also its a very short walk to the sea front.",5,2016,08,18
247,Great Hotel & very helpful staff,"We stayed at the Sandymount on the first night of our Honeymoon as we were stopping in Dublin for the night before moving on to Galway. The Hotel was great, very very clean and rooms were really well maintained. Very spacious rooms and a really nice atmosphere to the hotel on arrival. The entrance is great and staff were very friendly and helped us with directions the next day. It is within walking distance of a few bars and restaurants, a bit further away from the main nightlife but for myself and my husbands tastes these bars and bistros were great, quality food and a nice relaxed drink. Walking home in the dark wasn't too intimidating either, its a very quiet neighbourhood. Breakfast the next morning was great, good variety and speedy delivery of coffee and tea. This hotel really exceeded our expectations and we constantly compared the quality of the next hotel we moved along to (which was supposed to be a 5 star) to the Sandymount hotel and unfortunately it didn't match up, we'd of much preferred to have been in the Sandymount for the duration of our stay! Great Hotel!",5,2016,08,15
247,Very Nice Hotel with Easy Access to Everything ,The Sandymount was a great way to start our vacation. The location was a little outside the city but right near the DART. The hotel is well maintained and easy to get to with plenty of parking. The rooms were a little small so I was glad we booked two rooms for my wife and I with two teenagers. The staff was very friendly. The beds were too soft for me but not uncomfortable. ,4,2016,08,12
247,"A beautiful stay, staff friendly and courteous.   ","

Enjoyed my stay, staff was courteous and helpful. The hotel was recently renovated with beautiful room and bath. The Irish breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of foods. I enjoyed dining at bar one evening with cocktails. The hotel was conveniently located to DART and city center and brisk walk away from the 
village  of Sandymount. ",5,2016,08,12
247,Absolutely lovely,"We were hoping for a nice hotel and were not disapointed.
What a lovely hotel, nice room with 2 single beds as we wanted. Very clean and everything you can want. Very good location, near a train and busstops that bring you right into the city center within 15 minutes. We liked the number 1 bus the best. Leaves from the stop at star of the sea church, a 5 min walk from the hotel and brings you to Connely street in no time..great!!
If you want to go to dublin, stay at a quiet, cosy hotel not far from the citycenter and dont want to pay a lot of money...go here!",5,2016,08,11
247,All in all a great stay,"Great hotel, wonderfully helpful staff, free and good quality wifi and ample parking behind the hotel. The rooms are clean and mine was very quiet just as I wanted. The location is super convenient for trips into Dublin centre (only 4 mins on the Dart) and excursions to the south of Dublin. I very much enjoyed my stay at the Sandymount. 
The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for me, that is why I have given it 4 starts rather than 5. Although it is supposed to be award winning, the black / white pudding is too dry, the mushrooms done in the deep fryer and the scrambled eggs nothing to shout home about. The bathroom also had some bits and pieces that needed fixing, like a slight hole in the wall and paint coming off the ceiling over the door.",4,2016,08,11
247,Delicious lunch,"I've stayed at this hotel many times, my favourite in Dublin. Recently I brought my parents and we stayed for the most delicious lunch. The menu has changed since my last visit. Whoever thought to put rhubarb and goats cheese together.... WOW. The staff are always so friendly and welcoming.....my number ONE in Dublin. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. So central, easy to get to town, great value.",5,2016,08,10
247,Great choice for a weekend break,"Really lovely hotel with friendly staff. We had 2 twin rooms which comprised of a double & a single bed. The room was very generous in size. The bathroom was well appointed and very clean. Really good power on the shower! We had rooms at the front of the hotel & although it is in a quiet area there was a coach party leaving the hotel quite early on one of the mornings we were there which were a little noisy! Only a short walk to the DART and a couple of stops into the city centre. We walked into town one day which took about 45 minutes. Breakfast was ok, typical hotel fayre - although I think €8 for continental breakfast is a bit high. Nice relaxing bar area & good public areas. Overall we really liked this hotel & would recommend. ",4,2016,08,09
247,Above and beyond,"I just wanted to let everybody know , I attended an event here today with work. The staff here are amazing and went above and beyond what they should have to help me, from letting me use the hotel office to send and scan private documents to the amazing food. I must  say the staff are just perfect and the hotel is just amazing very clean and spotless. All staff greeting guests with a smile.",5,2016,08,09
247,A wonderful stay,We only had an overnight stay but found our experience most pleasurable.  The reception was very welcoming and all staff were friendly and efficient.  Our room was clean and very comfortable.  We enjoyed a lovely meal in the bar/restaurant and breakfast was very delicious with plenty of choice.  We were very impressed and will be back for a longer stay. ,5,2016,08,09
247,good base for a Dublin break,"Four of us stayed in two rooms at the Sandymount for a short break and found it to be a great choice of hotel. 
The rooms are very clean and comfortable and were refreshed to a very high standard daily. The breakfast was very good for a buffet with ample choice of good food and the hot food was hot; also on request poached eggs were freshly cooked for two of our group.The restaurant food was a good standard and reasonably priced. Also the hotel provides free parking for guests.
The location is a very short walk to the dart station which takes you in or out of town; the hop on hop off tour bus stops at the Aviva station just round the corner (yellow route only) about every half hour up to about 4.00 pm and a taxi to or from town is 15 euros: so lots of options for travelling into or out of the city, for the fit it is a half hour walk. Also a ten minute walk takes you to Sandymount strand  or to Ballsbridge which has lots of restaurants and pubs.
Overall a very good hotel with excellent staff good location and reasonable price for Dublin.",4,2016,08,06
247,Disappointd,Nice clean comfortable hotel. The room was a bit small but ok. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Was disappointed when we checked out to find that on the Saturday we were charged more than double than on other nights due to a football match that took place at the nearby Aviva Stadium. We had no interest in the football but seems that we had to pay the extra.,3,2016,08,06
247,"Great service, great food!","It is always a pleasure staying at the Sandymount. Recently refurbished, the rooms are spotless & comfortable. The food in the hotel bar/restaurant is as good if not better than local, well known restaurants, with a lovely, lively atmosphere. 

However, aside from the great amenities, it is the wonderful staff that make the Sandymount a pleasure to visit & revisit. They are so friendly & helpful, & always a pleasure to deal with. Beatrice, in particular, is quick to make a personal connection & so attentive to specific needs - she makes every visit an absolute pleasure. 

Location is central, yet quiet & a great base if spending a few days in the city. Local village is quiet & seafront is only 10 mins walk.",4,2016,08,03
247,Sandymount/Aviva,"Excellent location for the Aviva in an excellent neighbourhood with two towns nearby. The Dart is 5mins away taking you to the town centre in 11 mins. Staff were very friendly and room was big, clean and comfortable. Do your homework to get the Aircoach to nearby locations we changed in the town centre when there was no need to. If you head for the Americain embassy or Sandymount Rd on the Airbus yo are 5/10 mins away from the hotel, or if you end up I the town centre get the Dart to Landsdowne Rd out the station turn right with the Aviva in front of you and five mins your there.
Excellent location, hotel, staff and cleanliness, well done Dublin, but lower your prices or people wont come back...",4,2016,08,03
247,First stop in Dublin,"Beautiful Sandymount hotel is in the heart of Dublin without being in the ""busy ness"" of the City.  This hotel started out a a six bedroom BNB and has now morphed graciously into a sprawling hotel of charming beauty and very gracious accommodating staff!   Great comfortable beds, and even while I'm sharing my room with two 21 year old girls, the room is spacious and each of us have our own bed! 
More later as we stay here for two more nights before heading to Limmerick.  ",5,2016,08,03
247,Home away from Home!,"I have stayed at the Sandymount on and off for 3 months during a long business trip. The staff is extremely friendly (especially Beatrice at the front desk!) and they really take care of you if you need anything. The food in the restaurant is good and inexpensive. About a 5-10 minute walk to the DART to get into central Dublin, or to head south towards sea side towns of Dun Laioghaire and Bray, and a 5-10 minute walk to Sandymount village and 10-15 to the Sandymount Strand (beach). They were also recently",5,2016,08,02
247,Very much over priced for what is on offer.,This hotel is very nice however it is very much over priced. 149 for one night stay without breakfast I feel is a bit steep. Also the night we stayed there was a sporting event on nearby which resulted in the bar serving drinks in plastic glasses (1/2 pint) and still charging €5.50. The hotel was very clean however the rooms were so small and cramped. The ladies on reception were polite and friendly. The hotel offered free WiFi but had a very bad connection in most areas of the hotel. I don't think we would stay here again. Other city centre hotels that we have stayed in have much more to offer for the same price.,3,2016,07,31
247,Lovely clean room,"Location: 5-10 minute,( depends on how fast you walk) walk from Landsdowne Road Dart. 
Get leap card for Dart if staying couple of days, well worth it, can be bought at airport hard to find ask for tourist information very helpful.

Very clean.

Disabled access: have lifts, but we had room 337 stairs and steps, but staff very helpful, ask for an easier to access room.

Location: small village type area with supermarket, chemist, cafes, pub. 10mins walk. Close to Arena so will be busy when matches etc on.

Comfort: bed very comfortable, no fans in room.  Raditor but works centrally.

Peace: quiet in our room, rooms near restaurant etc may not be as quiet, check.

Breakfast: our deal didn't include breakfast we  purchased vouchers. 8 euros for continental and 12 Euros for full Irish.  Lots of selection fresh fruit, bread etc for continental breakfast, Irish breakfast includes hot food. Well worth it, if you eat out you have to pay 8-9 euros for food plus more for drink, at the hotel you can eat as much as you want.
Toaster a pain, remember to turn dail to toast.

Car parking if needed, there is plenty.
Lovely touch: when we were leaving early morning coffee and tea was provided and fruit at reception.Very thoughtful.

Shop around on internet for room with right price.

Happy tip: if veggie order day before, I wasn't told this.  If ordering taxi ask for it 10 mins before you really need it, the taxi firm don't rush.

247,The most amazing and friendly staff,"We just stayed 3 nights at this hotel. On our first night my brother-in-law left his cellphone in a taxi. Beatrice at the front desk was so kind and helped us retrieve it! The second day my husband was having pains. We didn't know if it was a heart attack, pulled muscle, etc. The manager Weldon was quickly at our door, called the paramedics and kept checking on us! When the paramedics left Weldon made sure to get breakfast sent to our room! Such kind people. The room was comfortable too😀",4,2016,07,30
247,"Decent location, classic hotel","It takes about 30 minutes to walk to the National Gallery and a little more to reach the center of Dublin. 
The hotel is classic and hosts business people, tourists and wedding parties. The interior and rooms are beautiful and spacious. The hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood, but I was sometimes disturbed by people talking in the hallway outside my door. 
The staff is professional, friendly and competent. 
Breakfast is very good and offers traditional Irish and buffet. ",4,2016,07,29

247,"Great Hotel, reasonably priced with superb staff",Stayed here regularly over the last few years while working in Dublin. Great hotel in great location. Reasonably priced and staff are very friendly and welcoming. Refurb over last few months has provided a real upgrade to accommodation. Good menu to be had and flexible when you want something a little different. ,5,2016,07,26
247,Well located,"The Sandymount Hotel is very well located to access Dublin, It is within walking distance ti the Aviva Stadium and the RDS and has near access Dart stations and regular buses to the city centre. It is within walking diatance of Baggot street and ballsbridge with its many restaurants. 
The hotel is comfortable and the breakfast is very good, tasty and fresh at a reasonable price.
Rooms are quite hot a tnight and some of the bathrooms are quite small but it is overall very comfortable.",4,2016,07,26
247,Nice Atmosphere,"I was stayed there 2 nights. It's very clean hotel & staff are very polite, specially porter Mr Daniyel was so friendly and good manageable skills. He done good job for me. It's very quite & nice environment hotel, I like that, also definitely will come back.",5,2016,07,26
247,Very central ,"Ok ok ok. But that's it. Recently refurbished but no atmosphere. A number of large houses pushed together to form a hotel. Lacks soul. Room fine
 Very clean. On suite very small

 Where to.put toilet roll? See pictures. 
 Check in staff excellent. Bar area very unorganised. 
Very nesr dart

247,Great place! ,"Great place, lovely staff, clean and good size rooms. We didn't have the breakfast as I thought €12 each was a bit steep! The bar was good - they do fantastic cocktails as well. The beds were comfy and rooms spacious. This hotel is perfect if you are visiting the Aviva stadium or the RDS. There's a great selection of eating places just across the canal which is within walking distance as is the dart station! I'll stay here again! ",5,2016,07,24
247,Great Dublin hotel,"The Sandymount hotel is a real gem in terms of location , quality and service.
The staff are excellent, hotel is well run and the rooms excellent.
One of the few family owned hotels left in Dublin and you can sense the charm and as a Dubliner I believe well worth supporting.
The food is excellent and good value.",5,2016,07,24
247,Average,"If arriving at the DART with luggage it's a 10 min walk to hotel.

Bar and gardens are nice.

Our room was noisy...with paper thin walls, we could clearly hear snoring from next door,  footsteps overhead and people passing by along the hotel corridor and the car park, therefore did not enjoy a good night's sleep.

Disappointed there was only a double bed...most hotels at least offer a queen bed nowadays. The room was narrow and felt cramped with no real space for the armchair,   office desk and chair. The tv was very small. No complimentary water in the  room...perhaps only offered in some rooms?  Shower temperature alternated between hot and cold which was frustrating.

It is an old hotel which has been renovated but there is no air conditioning and the room was stuffy.

Housekeeping walked in at 8.30am the next morning while we were asleep...the Do Not Disturb sign had fallen on the floor outside the door. They shouldn't have been there anyway as we were due to check out that day.

I mentioned the issues to the receptionist who apologised ... a manager overheard me and agreed it should not happen... but didnt comment other than that. 

Better hotels nearby.. We only stayed here as our usual one was booked out that one night...we moved to there later that day.

247,Great Spot Outside the City Center,"I wound up staying at Sandymount because so many of the hotels in the City Center had been booked up. That being said, I'm so glad I did! It was actually quite nice to be away from the busier part of Dublin. The Sandymount neighborhood feels like an escape to a seaside village, but only a 15 minute cab ride to the center of Dublin's attractions. For any Joyce readers, the area is featured in Ulysses, and one of the Martello towers is visible from the nearby strand. There's a little green nearby with some pubs and restaurants if you're looking to dine in an authentic Dublin neighborhood. It's also quite close to the stadium, but still quiet and lovely to walk around in the evening after a long day of sight-seeing. Staff is usually warm and accommodating, and there's a lovely restaurant and bar for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on site. Some of the rooms can be fairly inaccessible and involve a lot of stairs - even with an elevator. Should you have any physical limitations, be sure to notify the hotel in advance.",4,2016,07,18
247,An excellent hotel,"Great hotel, well located and newly furnished. Room a little small but fine and the bathroom was modern bright and clean. Its convenient for both trains and busses to the city centre. Staff were very friendly and helpful.",5,2016,07,18
247,Value For Your Money,"This hotel is in a nice quiet area. It is a green friendly establishment. It has free Wi-Fi. It is within walking distance from the bus or Dart train. The staff are efficient, informative and friendly.",5,2016,07,18
247,I loved the Sandymount!,"I absolutely loved this hotel when we stayed last year, so much so I'm going back in a few days! The location is great, I'm a big fan of the dart so you couldn't ask for a better location to hop on and off, it's a great location for the Aviva stadium and there's even a little path going down the side of the River Dodder if you wanted a stroll by the water. The room we stayed in was beautiful, with a queen sized bed and a single, complimentary robes and slippers and a great dresser to do your hair and make up. The bathroom and bedroom were so clean, and the walk in shower was amazing! The reception staff were ever so friendly, we arrived just after 9am and were so tired so they got us into our room very quickly to have a nap, despite arriving well before check in. Can't wait to come back, I would definitely recommend because it was worth every penny. 

Go raibh maith agat!",5,2016,07,17
247,LOVED THE AREA,"Sandymount was the first of 2 hotels where my cousin and I stayed in Dublin. This hotel was both the beginning and end of a 12 day ""Best of Ireland"" bus tour on which we were booked. We spent a total of 3 nights. This hotel has 2 restaurants and approx 3 gathering areas located near the front desk. They offer free wifi and computers. The hotel appears to be 3 buildings attached to one another and the inside hallways are a bit windy. But, the food and service were terrific. My luggage was delayed in arriving in Dublin from Toronto and the front desk was very helpful in dealing with that. My cousin and I loved this location because we would walk every evening and, if you've ever heard of the Ireland ""doors"" this is the neighborhood for the best photo ops. Beautiful colors! We only wish it had been closer to City Center but DART is close by AND if you are into sports, the Aviva Stadium is a short walk.",4,2016,07,15
247,"Great hotel, not great wifi","I need to have peace and access to wifi whilst staying in Dublin to do some work on Southern Hemisphere time.  I've always loved this hotel (my Dublin home is around the corner) and the area is superb.  If you're not from Dublin, you could''t ask for a better base.  It offers easy and safe access to the city centre. sporting venues, public transport, restaurants, pubs. parks etc.  Staff are fantastic, comfortable rooms (forget about the view, just keep the curtains closed if it bothers you).  Everything worked great, even the breakfast was easy, tasty, but the wifi was woeful, for all 3 nights of trying to work.",4,2016,07,14
247,Two nights stay at Sandymount Hotel,Very friendly staff. Rooms very clean and newly decorated. Had an amazing stay couldnt fault in anyway. Had a full irish breakfast both mornings it was very good no waiting for anything especially tea and coffee the staff continuously were walking run.,5,2016,07,13
247,short break,"staff very friendly, room lovely and relaxing and comfortable. Papers and early morning tea/coffee/ fruits complimentry for those busy and on the go. Walking distance to the dart, great location. Aviva stadium nearby also ballsbridge and the rds. also free carpark",4,2016,07,13
247,Good location,"The hotel is good and has great service, the location is good since you can walk to the tourist area. They have a good bar and food is good as well. The hotel looks new and the beds are really comfortable. The only thing that we didn't liked was the whole hotel had carpet and it was hard to carry the luggage.",4,2016,07,10
247,Not as hoped.,"First, the good: clean, well staffed by friendly people, near DART, comfortable beds.

Still, there were small and large annoyances:
Showers, while updated and nice to look at were treacherous. You step up a bit to get in, and then, when you're nicely wet (read: slippery) you have to step down back to floor level. There are assist bars, but for some unfathomable reason, NONE near this point of exit. I cannot even imagine a shorter or infirm person navigating this safely. After nearly going down (and badly bruising my leg) I chose to exit on my rear, pivoting on the edge of the tub. Pretty design, terribly engineered/executed.
Next, though there is a kettle with coffee and tea things, there is not a napkin, anywhere. Any spills, drips, etc., must be mopped up with toilet tissue. Add to that, by day three we were only being given decaf coffee. The reception people, all very accommodating, fixed that for us. 
The lighting near mirrors (bath and bed area) is extremely lacking. Again, it looks great, but doesn't offer visibility to do hair or makeup. 
Finally, shelf,  and desktop space was stingy for two people, neitther of us with extensive needs. It felt overly tight, not like a place to relax and unwind after a busy day touring.
We suspect our room was meant for one or two, but an extra single bed was forced into it for the tourist season, because we had to request the only armchair (tiny one at that) be removed so we could actually walk around the room for ordinary needs. The chair was removed.
We wouldn't choose to stay here again.",3,2016,07,10
247,Nice hotel,"Good rooms good service nice food , good location the staff are very helpful and could not do enough to make the stay a good one lots of local info room are very clean and beds are comfortable , breakfast is well worth the cost ",5,2016,07,09
247,three nights,"We used this Hotel as a Base for our Motorcycle trip, The staff were friendly, The Food was excellent, Our rooms were first class, secure parking, Some of the best   roads for riding 10 minutes away.  I would recommend this Hotel.",5,2016,07,09
247,Such friendly staff,"I had stayed at this hotel ten years ago and absolutely loved it. Imagine my delight when I found that the hotel has been completely refurbished and updated. It is really beautiful and comfortable and in the perfect location, being completely quiet yet a stone's throw from the Dart. Even more importantly, I couldn't believe it when I saw Beatrice still working on reception. She is so kind, friendly and more than helpful. It actually made my day.. I would definitely stay every time in this hotel.",5,2016,07,08
247,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff","Stayed two nights recently and was impressed.  Knew it was a distance from city centre but Dart is so convenient nearby.   Room was clean and the free Wi-Fi is always a plus.  All of the staff were friendly and Michael, in particular was very helpful.  We'll be back.",4,2016,07,08
247,Charming Hotel and Excellent Service,"Charming Hotel, ideal location to explore Dublin City.  Rooms very comfortable, staff very friendly and informative. Breakfast both mornings excellent.  Bar menu worth checking out.  Would recommend the Sandymount Hotel looking forward to returning again.",5,2016,07,07
247,Very good hotel,"Bar food is very good and large portions! The breakfast was very enjoyable! Staff were friendly! Rooms were clean and tidy! Free wifi and computers are available in the hotel lobby for guest use! Good location, very close to Aviva stadium and 15 minutes to city centre! In general a very good hotel!",3,2016,07,06
247,good hotel close to transport systems,Old fashioned but lovely hotel with great breakfasts. Has been recently updated. staff friendly and helpful. In  residential quiet area but close to the city. Good place to stay. Computers available and free wifi.,5,2016,07,04
247,GREAT HOTEL TO STAY AT FOR 4 DAYS IN DUBLIN,"The room we were given at the Sandymount hotel was exceptionally clean and very comfortable. Apparently the hotel had just had a major ""overhaul"", as everything was exceptionally clean and in very good shape.

We stayed 4 nights and found the position of the hotel was really perfect for getting to know the city, as there is a fast rail connection to the centre of Dublin only an easy10 minute walk from the hotel. 

The breakfast offered was extremely satisfying - so much so that we found we did could skip lunch and have dinner in one of the many eating places in the area of the hotel - or in the city centre. 

Our stay was exactly when Bruce Springsteen  performed in Dublin, and to our delight, we found that the train near the hotel could get us close enough to the Stadium where he performed easily, leaving us only a 15 mint walk from the stadium.

We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",4,2016,06,30
247,Excellent Hotel with good breakfast,"Staff is really gentle and helpfull. Rooms are nice and tidy. I have been there on a bussiness trip and this hotels offers all the services needed. A good breakfast is a must for me (which this hotel offers). Staff tries to help you as best as they can. 

No downsides from my experiance.",5,2016,06,30
247,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"We recently spent a long weekend at the Sandymount Hotel and can wholly recommend it.  It is in a fantastic location - a short walk from the lovely villages of Ballsbridge and Sandymount and a nice stroll into the centre of Dublin.

We received a fantastic service from from the staff on reception through to the bar staff and the people cleaning our rooms. We had lunch there and the food was very good.  Also a great choice of food served at breakfast.  Our room was lovely and bright and bathroom was excellent.

You won't be disappointed with your stay at the Sandymount Hotel.",5,2016,06,29
247,"Great room, great location, lovely staff","This hotel is a little bit on the outskirts of the City Centre, so if you are looking for something where everything is right on your doorstep then this isn't the hotel for you. 

However saying that, the Aviva Stadium is less than 30 seconds away so is great if this is your reason for your trip to Dublin. Additionally, the DART train is 30 seconds away which gets you into the centre for 3 euros and they come fairly regularly (every 10-15 minutes). Also a taxi from the airport was 30 euros, and into the City Centre was about 12-15 euros so the transport is workable.

The rooms were lovely, with a good TV and very comfy beds, with a nice bathroom, however I was disappointed that there was no bath.

The staff were very friendly and accomodating, being willing to offer advice on where to go, and booking taxis and storing our luggage.

Overall a great hotel with a fantastic price, and very high quality. Would 100% stay here again.",4,2016,06,28
247,Great Staff. Wonderful Staff!,"I stayed here on 26th June and was very impressed with it. The staff were wonderful. The room initially allocated to my booking wasn't ready when I arrived so they tried two other room numbers until they found one that was ready. They did this despite reception being very busy at the time. 
The room was very spacious and clean. The carpet was fresh and there was plenty of toiletries and tea and coffee. The room was warm and very comfortable. 
I would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,06,28
247,Amazing,"Amazing Hotel in Dublin, not so far from the Dart train station to go in the center but in a silence and green area. The staff is kindly and professional. The room big, new and clean. I strongly suggest who want to spent a wonderful time in Dublin.
Giada ( Italia)",5,2016,06,28
247,Very Good,We had a very comfortable stay at the Sandymount Hotel over the weekend.  Initially we though it was a little bit out from City Centre but Beatrice on reception was very helpful and pointed us to the local transport  - subsequently we got best of both worlds - were able to explore Sandymount as well as travel to centre without having to think about parking.  etc.  Breakfast was very good also.,5,2016,06,28
247,A+,"Stayed at this hotel one night with a friend as we were going to see a concert at the 3arena! Around 20minutes drive from airport which is only €25/30 euros! Get a taxi is my advice, we got the bus paid €16 each and it dropped you off ten minutes away from hotel! Hotel staff are lovely and very helpful. Rooms were big and very clean recently been refurbished looks great! Paid for a twin room received a triple room so the extra space was nice. Train station only a few minutes walk from the hotel €3.95 gets you a return ticket into the town which is 3 stops away. Great place for shopping! Received breakfast at the hotel which was lovely, full cooked breakfast, continental and cereals were provided along with water and fruit juices. The tea and coffee looked as if they were provided by staff but no one ever asked us if we would like any, not that we bothered about those. Overall a great hotel, central enough, reasonably priced aswell.",5,2016,06,27
247,We used this hotel as a base for meeting up with our Daughters boyfriends family for the first time,"On arrival at reception we were checked in by a lady called Beatrice who was excellent,we have stayed in a lot of Hotels and Beatrice is the best receptionist we have met she gave us so much time giving us maps and pointing out the best places to visit and when it came to checkout she gave us as much time enquiring about our stay making sure everything was ok and hoped to see us again (thank you Beatrice) Breakfast staff and Bar staff were welcoming and friendly and food was exellent we will be back to the Sandymount Hotel",5,2016,06,26
247,Nice rooms and neighborhood,"We had four rooms in the far north building. All of us were satisfied with the rooms   Dinner was excellent 
The breakfast buffet looked wonderful however we did not partake. It's a bit of a walk to the hop on hop off bus and the morning rush is apparent.  The taxi is reasonable. We walked to two excellent dinners. The neighborhood is very nice 
",4,2016,06,26
247,Great hotel !!!!,"Located 1 block away from the Aviva Stadium this hotel is great. You have the Dart station very close (less than 3-4 blocks away) and from there you can go to the city center and many other places. Sandymount Village and Ballsbridge (where the RDS Arena is located) are 10-15 min walking distance. Staff is super friendly, breakfast is plenty and delicious.

Perfect place to stay. I'll definitely return when I'm back in Dublin.",5,2016,06,25
247,Fantastic location ,"We booked a family room here, my daughter and nice were going to the Rihanna concert in the aviva.  The hotel is only steps away from the aviva.  The staff were polite and welcoming.  The rooms were bright and clean, beds were very comfy.  The bathroom was small but modern and clean, with the added bonus of a window (which is unusual in most hotels) There was a great selection for breakfast from smoothies, fruit, pastries, breads, cereals and full cooked breakfast (mushrooms were absolutely Delicious) I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone,  literally at the aviva and close to all public transport to city centre.  ",4,2016,06,25
247,Brilliant hotel,We used this hotel as a base for visiting the area. Excellent location. Dart station on the doorstep. Staff could not be more helpful. Breakfast choice and quality was very good. We would definitely use the Sandymount again.,5,2016,06,24
247,Exceptional Reception Staff,Stayed here on business. Close to the Arriva stadium and train that serves that. Otherwise a 20-30 min walk into town. Rooms were clean and basic. The reception staff really made this place stand out though. They were friendly and accommodating when enough towels weren't left in my room. Also humorous when getting hassled by German tourists about a plug adapter! A reasonable option if you are in Dublin. ,4,2016,06,23
247,"Great location, great night's sleep!","This hotel was only 2 minutes walk to the Landsdowne Dart service, which was brilliant for getting around Dublin. Ballsbridge was only a 5 minute walk and here there was a regular bus service. One of the sightseeing bus companies picks up hotel guests early in the morning and you can buy tickets at reception. What I liked most was the fact the hotel was in a  quiet residential area so a you could get a good night's sleep. The rooms were soundproofed and well ventilated. Breakfast was wonderful, lots of options from the self service buffet, they even had gluten free options. Staff were very helpful and efficient. The bar served food from midday to 9 pm at night which was really convenient . ",5,2016,06,23
247,"Dinner with a smile, and instant! :)","Called in for a quick bite before a concert at the Aviva. Staff attentive and welcoming, menu very good and reasonably priced! I chose fish and chips, it was served quickly and was really good indeed!  Then after the concert we came back for a bevvy in the bar before driving home and all the staff were again welcoming and happy to help! I wanted a coffee but  machine was playing up, however the member of staff behind the bar offered me instant, which was quick thinking and I accepted and it was very nice!! Thank you very much!  Great staff make a hotel, and they made the visits to this hotel for us! Excellent! Would recommend! Also, really convenient to Aviva. ",5,2016,06,22
247,Excellent,"Stayed here last Monday for one night business trip. A lot of the rooms have been renovated and are much better for it. Reception is very friendly and efficient. I got room 541 which is right beside the lift and directly leads down to reception and outside. The room itself is small but perfect for the single business traveller. Spotlessly clean and with tea, coffee etc. Pleased to see Barry's tea available. Had dinner in the bar and the food was first class. Breakfast we great also. If I had one small niggle its that the window in the bedroom could only open a few inches and on a hot humid June night it can get a bit stuffy.  I understand this is for Health & Safety but it would be nice to get fresh air. 
Checkout was easy and thanks to Ann for organising the hotel shuttle to take me to my place of work. I didn't request this but was delighted with the kind gesture.  
A really lovely stay. Perfect in every way. Hope to come back soon. Well done Sandymount!!",5,2016,06,22
247,Very good hotel,"We enjoyed 4 nights here.  The hotel is well located near the Dart station, which is just 2 stops from the city centre.  It has a large car park.  The hotel spreads across several buildings so there are some corridors to negotiate and the lifts are small.  The bedroom was fine with very little noise from outside.  We dined in the hotel on all 4 nights, which is unusual for us and quite a compliment as the food was very good and reasonably priced, and the waiting staff were friendly and efficient.  Breakfast was also plentiful and well set out.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone driving to Dublin but not wanting to use the car in the city centre.",4,2016,06,21
247,Delicious Food,"Having stayed in Dublin on numerous occasions, we chose this hotel due to free car parking and easy access to the DART.
We upgraded to an Executive Room so we paid extra money for this.
We stayed 3 nights in total. The hotel was very clean and comfortable. Plenty of rooms to sit in quiet areas, free use of internet and newspapers.
We had Room 401, top floor as requested and in a quiet area. The room was next door to the lift, so we thought we would be kept awake by this, but we didn't hear a thing. The hotel is carpeted throughout. 
The room was spacious and very quiet looking out onto the car park.
The bathroom was a little on the small side, but if I had one complaint to make, it would be the shower. I prefer a shower that you can take off from the holder for individual use, and not the one that stays on the top of the wall that you cannot adjust.
We decided to eat out locally on our first night, so we stopped off at Mulligan's public house - we so wished we hadn't, after staying in the second night to eat, the food was delicious. Peter the young waiter advised us on the menu, so we decided to go for the beef casserole and salmon - excellent choice and value for money. Big portion sizes and really tasty food. It is worth staying in this hotel just for the food!
Peter was really friendly and very helpful, a credit to the hotel.
Breakfast choice was excellent too, plenty of hot tasty food on offer.
A lot of German and French guests staying at this hotel due to the excellent transport services.",4,2016,06,19
247,Excellent value and great location,"Had a two night stay here and found it to be good value and the hotel's location close to the Dart station meant it was easy to get in and out of the city centre. The room was modern, spacious and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet had a good selection. Would happily recommend this hotel.",4,2016,06,18
247,Nice hotel!,"I enjoyed saying at the Sandymount Hotel.  It was very nice, but not five star.  There were too many stairs and the elevators were too far away from our room.  I particularly enjoyed the breakfasts.  I would stay here again, if I needed a hotel in this area of Dublin.",4,2016,06,17
247,Decent hotel ,"Traveled from uk, it's a ok hotel pretty basic for the price but everything is expensive in Ireland. 

Staff friend and everything is clean, which is what is most important when finding a decent hotel.

We didn't have breakfast so I couldn't comment on that.....",4,2016,06,16
247,"very clean, good value for money","We stayed for 4 nights and really liked it. it was very clean, staff was extremely friendly and the communal areas were very nice to spend our evenings with our friends playing cards. We did a very nice walk along the river into the city center. very close to the ocean as well if you are a fan!",5,2016,06,15
247,"Average, noisy, extremely overpriced....","This hotel is in a great location, near a Dart stop and close to Sandymount village. However, the corridors are dark, meandering and confusing. The elevator is old and slow. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and modern, they might have been refurbished recently. The wifi in my room dropped off at one side of the room, the side with the desk! The walls are very thin, I could hear a man in the room next door snoring. The floors and stairs are very creaky and therefore noisy. The lower floor rooms are somewhat dark. €12 for a continental breakfast is an absolute rip-off, go to the local village instead. At €220 per night on a week night you would expect not to pay extra for a bowl of weetabix!! The coffee available in the room was appalling. I would only stay here again if I could not find another hotel which is why I stayed here this time. The front desk staff are very hit and miss. ",3,2016,06,12
247,Great hotel for our family trip,"Loved the hotel, staff very friendly, location close to train for quick trip into Dublin city center.  Quiet neighborhood with restaurants in walking distance.  Breakfast was great, suited all 13 of us.",5,2016,06,12
247,Question ... Closest ATM is?,"I am arriving at the Sandymount Hotel in 2 weeks and am interested in where the closest ATM is from the hotel.  Where should I go to get Euros?

Where is it?
How far is it?
How many minutes to walk?
Are there multiple ATMs ... in case one doesn't work?

Thanks for your help!",5,2016,06,10
247,far from the city center and over priced,"I stayed in sandymount hotel for 4 nights in the end of may 
to see the bruce springsteen concert 
the hotel is far from the city center there is nothing to do near the hotel no restaurant or pubs / the pub in the hotel was nice.
it is a quiet place to stay if you looking for a quiet place.
the room is nice and clean but not special .
and for the  high price we paid we didn't even had  breakfast",3,2016,06,02
247,Lovely location and staff,"Hotel is in a great location - quiet and quaint neighbourhood that's just a short walk from the sea front, and a 10 minute train ride from the city (the station is literally just up the road). Rooms are clean and modern, and hotel includes a lovely restaurant, bar and garden area. I was most impressed with the staff - the owner of the hotel made a point of introducing himself and asking how our stay was during breakfast, and reception were very helpful whenever we had any queries, such as bringing up a fan when we said our room was too hot. Breakfast was very tasty, and so was the room service we ordered. One of the cheapest Dublin hotels I could find that looked comfortable as well. Would definitely use again!",5,2016,06,01
247,Lovely hotel in excellent location,I visited this hotel recently with relatives from abroad and was delighted to see that this hotel is maintaining its high standards. All of the staff were extremely helpful. Altogether it was a very pleasant experience.,5,2016,06,01

247,Close to sea and city,A nice friendly hotel close to Central Dublin. The rooms are comfortable and clean with tea/coffee facilities. The buffet breakfast gives a good choice and allows for a quick getaway to catch the nearby train to city centre. Free car parking to residents at hotel. Friendly staff. A nice stroll to Sandymount village and beach.,4,2016,05,31
247,"Vacation in Dublin, Ireland","I reserved 20 nights at this hotel via Hotwire.com, 3 months in advance. 
2 weeks before travelling I sent the hotel an e-mail requesting a quiet 
room away from any road traffic and up high if possible as a senior.
My room on 4th floor was a 'character' style room with a sloping ceiling in one corner.
It was really quiet, which I requested.  The mattress was firm and comfortable.
The bathroom was new with all modern fixtures. Everything very clean with 2 bottles of water supplied each day; also tea kettle, tea & coffee, sugar and milk supplied in room. This was classified as ""executive room"" which Hotwire supplied.
This hotel was terrific.  The staff are so obliging, helpful and friendly.
Upon arrival, the lift from the ground floor did not work. The receptionist
actually went downstairs and carried my heavy piece of luggage up to the reception area and to the other working lift and into my room!  The breakfast buffet is delicious with loads of fresh fruits along with smoothies, many types of croissants, brown Irish soda breads, among other Irish favourites.  Of course the 'full' breakfast included eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms etc.  This room looks out to the lovely gardens.  Food in this hotel is good value against the Canadian dollar.  The room service was really efficient and the bar is bright, and situated with lovely 'green' views onto the gardens. The deck attached to a corner of the bar provides smokers with outdoor sheltered seating to eat while smoking. Lunch/dinners are available here
Euros do not buy much, you discover this when shopping or eating out!

The Sandymount area, short distance from Ballsbridge, is lovely to walk around.
The village is small with lots of pubs, cafes and many Italian restaurants.
It is a nice walk along the Dodder river to the DART fast train service which runs regularly into the city and out to Howth, Malahide, etc.  DART also runs south to Dun Laoghaire, Bray, and Greystones.  Both Dun Laoghaire and Greystones are worth a trip because they have been upgraded and modernized in recent years.
Bray is the traditional seaside resort without much change in recent years.  
The bus routes are near the Sandymount hotel.
Walking along the Dodder river past the DART rail station is very pleasant as far as Ballsbridge where the famous 'Rolys"" is situated. Now a Bistro as well as a lunch cafe.
Considered one of the most expensive places with best food in Dublin, it is very busy and worth a visit.
Herbert Park is behind this crossroads and wonderful to walk through when the cherry blossoms are blooming. The swans and ducks provide entertainment for many.

Sandymount strand is known for miles of sand one can walk on when the tide is out.
All kinds of birds rest in the area on their way north or south.

For peace and quiet in this hotel I would not want to be on the ground or 2nd floor.
Coach loads of tourists stay a night or 2 and can be very noisy because of language difficulties.  Reception is on the 2nd floor.
Free computer use is available near the reception area.
For May the weather was unexpectedly warm, nearly reached 20C.
Only rain showers the last couple of days of my trip. Showers stop, but bring an umbrella !
Sandymount has a wonderful, long strand stretching as far as the eye can see when the tide is out.  All kinds of birds rest in the area on the way north or south.
Enjoy.",5,2016,05,31
247,Great Central Location,"When in Dublin I always stay at the Sandymount Hotel. It's staff always provide a friendly family type atmosphere which is greatly appreciated when away from home on business. Nothing is ever a problem.  Its location close to the Dart line makes it rasily accessible to the city centre. 

I would not stay anywhere else whilst in Dublin.",5,2016,05,30
247,Nice Hotel!,Nice hotel in the heart of Dublin; outside of the city but close enough to everything by car or a decent walk or bus. The hotel was nicely appointed. Only odd thing was the layout- but that is the buildings fault and not the hotel. It was new and had nice features and was clean. Would stay again thanks!,4,2016,05,30
247,Overpriced hotel does not live up to rating,"Stayed one night in this hotel after coming over on the ferry from Holyhead, It is only a short car journey from the Port. It is handily located for Central Dublin (it took about 45 minutes on a leisurely stroll). It is also very close to the Lansdowne Road DART station. It is only 3 stops into the Centre.
May main grip is that it is overpriced for what is on offer. I do feel central hotels are now going too far. I paid £281 for bed and breakfast for a couple. The room was clean and the bed okay (a bit hard for my taste). However, it only had a view onto a blank wall.
The breakfast was a shambles. There were no cleaned tables. So you had to ask for cutlery. It was help your self buffet that was fine but lots of things were not stocked up. They were busy as there had been a football match on at the Arriva Stadium but they surely should be able to cater for all their staying guests.
I went way thinking I had had much better experience in many Premier Inns paying £35 a night.",2,2016,05,30
247,Dublin Paradise,"Superb Hotel to accomodate all travellers. Great food, location and extremely helful staff - makes any trip to this hotel a pleasure! Room are really comfortable and clean! Easy access to the City Centre for shopping and nightlife!",5,2016,05,27
247,The perfect location,This hotel is  located to alot of sporting venues ( Aviva Stadium / RDS / Donnybrook / 3 Arena) Dart a quick 2 min walk!! Staff are very friendly and very helpful . Great place for fantastc food. Hotel rooms extremely comfortable and decorated to a high standard.,5,2016,05,27
247,My regular place to stay in Dublin,I'm a weekly visitor to Dublin and always look to stay here. Excellent service and always well looked after. Betrice  on the front desk is always looking out for the guest and knows what's needed even before it comes up!,5,2016,05,25
247,Perfect!,Thanks for feeling welcome. The female staff are handsome. The rooms are clean and a have a big and modern bathroom. Much space to park your car. We came here because of a overbooking issue with our accommodation. Now we're glad it happened. 😋 We felt really well and are sad too leave. ,5,2016,05,25
247,Nice Quiet hotel,Nice quiet hotel in the centre of Dublin located about a pitching wedge away from the Aviva stadium and Ballsbridge. Food is good and staff are very friendly. They seem to be doing a lot of work in the hotel which will only enhance peoples future stays.,4,2016,05,25
247,Great location,Fantastic location for my business meeting and plenty of parking. Staff very good especially one lady at reception couldn't be nicer or anymore helpful . Overall hotel was very clean and made you feel at home,5,2016,05,24
247,Pleasant friendly staff,Wonderful area and nice walking along the canal beside the hotel (even supplied umbrellas ha ).  One staff member very helpful in particular and nothing was a bother for her. I thought overall excellent hotel and will be returning next week,5,2016,05,24
247,Quiet Location,"On a recent trip to Dublin, we stayed two nights in Sandymount Hotel, and then chose to return for our final night before leaving Ireland. The hotel is conveniently located in an historic area of the city, just 10 minutes walk from the Aviva Stadium DART station and 10 minutes walk from Sandymount Village. Rooms were freshly refurbished and the staff (and owner) were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Several houses were joined to create the hotel, so navigating to rooms can be confusing, but the experience was delightful.",4,2016,05,23
247,Wonderful hotel,"Nice clean and modern hotel!!! I have to use a wheelchair and the room was perfect! The bathroom was wonderful, nice and big and two options of shower chairs! The breakfast had many choices and options and was delish! If I ever come back to Ireland, I will defiantly stay here and I will also recommend this hotel to anyone traveling this way! ",4,2016,05,21
247,"Great location, warm hosting","The hotel is on wonderful area, near Aviva Stadium where is lovely neighborhood and also very close to the city center.
The staff were friendly and the price was good.
Also special thanks to Daniela (the girl at reception) for everything.",5,2016,05,21
247,Dublin Hotel,"The Sandymount hotel is a fabulous hotel to stay in.  Hotel is well maintained and has recently undergone a full refurbishment and all the rooms are equally as comfortable.
The restaurant food is beautiful and the staff are very helpful. I spend a lot of time in Dublin with work and I would have to say that the Sandymount is my first choice in a Dublin hotel.",5,2016,05,19
247,Very friendly hotel,"The Hotel is situated in a quiet street just round the corner from the impressive Aviva Stadium. It is a beautiful building with plenty of places to sit outside too in really nice gardens. Just an easy 10 minute walk to Sandymount Village which has excellent bars and restaurants with a nice easy-going atmosphere. The staff at the Hotel could not have been more helpful and friendly, pointing out the local facilities and recommending a stroll on the beach. I did and it was perfect. Check in and out were a pleasure and the bar staff incredibly cheerful. I had a really pleasant couple of hours sat at the bar just people watching. I visit Ireland a lot on business and this was the first time I'd stayed in a private hotel i.e. not a Hilton or a Marriott etc. and this offered the kind of homely atmosphere that will make me book again next time.",5,2016,05,17
247,"All you can ask for, another great stay.","I've stayed the Sandymount Hotel numerous times now and despite the vast array of hotel options in Dublin I find myself continuously returning to this south Dublin retreat. 

On my most recent visit we were greeted at reception by Beatrice who was tremendously helpful and couldn't do more for us.

Our room was a ""double single"". It was spacious, recently renovated and a nice freshness also. 
The following morning we ventured down for breakfast. It was an excellent full irish offering and a fitting way to cap off our stay.

All in all this is the standard I have come to expect from the Sandymount. I would highly recommend a stay.",5,2016,05,14
247,Nice clean and quiet,"The hotel was actually better than what I thought it would be like. 
They were doing renovations at the time of going so parts of the hotel didn't look it's best but that's to be expected.
The room itself was great and spacious. Clean and neat. Perfect. 
Not much of a view from the window but we didn't mind as it was just a place to lay our heads in between exploring. 

We walked to the centre every day from the hotel which was probably around 30/40 mins? But there is a tour bus stop very near the hotel. 

The hotel is well equipped with a free computer room to access the Internet with printer. There was an abundance of info leaflets on things to do. Also you could buy tour bus tickets direct with reception which was slightly cheaper than if you got it from the information centres in town. 

The staff were friendly, accommodating and informative. 

We didn't have food there as we wanted to make the most of our days. 

Overall a good stay and would book again. The only downside really is that it's slightly out of the centre but meant it was cheaper and quieter :)",4,2016,05,11
247,Very Good,"Sandymounth Hotel may be seemed like it is far away from the city center, but it is very very close to the most important places which are worth to see. Also, if you buy a Cityscape ticket, one of the bus stations is very close. Staff is really friendly,(especially Daniela in the reception) she even shared her experience about the places to see or eat the traditional food. Rooms are pretty. Compared to other locations, prices are almost cheap for that high quality.",5,2016,05,11
247,Cozy weekend getaway,"My husband and I visited for his birthday weekend. I wanted a hotel away from the city center, yet still easily accessible via public transport or a quick cab ride. This hotel fit the bill. From the moment we walked in we felt it was cozy, extremely clean, and just what we wanted for our weekend. I had noted in my booking reservation that it was my husband's birthday and therefore I wanted a very quiet room. Not only did we get a lovely room on the fourth floor, but the owner/management left us a delicious box of chocolates and a bottle of wine with a note. This was such a nice touch and set off our weekend on a great note. There's a cute village nearby (in walking distance) if you don't feel like going into town for dinner (we ate at Mulligans which was delicious). The train station is a short walk as well. On our last day we decided to go for a long walk into town which was not long at all! Overall-Great hotel for the value, excellent location, friendly and helpful staff. And clearly owners who care about their guests. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,05,10
247,"Nothing fancy, but adequate ","We spent three nights here as part of a tour. The rooms are small but clean-we had a double bed and a single bed, but no real place to put suitcases except on the bed. I like electrical outlets next to the bed (to plug in phones for alarms) but no luck. The bathroom was tiny-the door hit the toilet on opening. The lift wasn't working the last night, which was a problem for some in our group with mobility issues. The restaurant was okay and the bar was fine. Wifi was available in the rooms and worked well. The staff were friendly. ",3,2016,05,10
247,Great break,"The hotel was very clean and the staff very helpful and friendly. The rooms were very clean and maintained and the bathroom spotless. It is very close to the Dart station allowing for easy travel in to Dublin city centre. There are a number of good restaurants nearby in Ballsbridge and I recommend Mario's. There is also a Tesco in Ballsbridge. We had breakfast at the hotel and it was absolutely brilliant. There were lots of choices including fruit, cereal, pastries and full English.",5,2016,05,09
247,Wonderful hotel,"Room was lovely. Really comfy bed, good quality pillows & a really good hairdryer unlike in most hotels. Good quantity of tea & coffee although no biscuits & I do like a biscuit. Also bath towels were tiny, literally hardly covered any of your body. Staff were lovely, we travelled with our 7 month old & they couldn't do enough for us, offering us extra laundry & towels. Service was excellent in the bar & food really good. For us the location was a little far out but that's purely because we had the baby normally it wouldn't have bothered us. Would highly recommend. ",5,2016,05,09
247,Lovely hotel and great dinner,"I stayed for more than 10 nights in mid April and enjoyed great dinner at inside hotel restaurant ""Line-Out"". Every meals I had were delicious. Among all, confit duck with egg noodle is one of my favorite. Location of this hotel was also good. Even though it is not exactly the center of Dublin city which I mean it is not a few minutes walk to Grafton Street or Trinity College which most travelers may want to visit, however it is still close to the center, say in 10 - 15 minutes by walk. Furthermore, there are many rather local pubs and stores around this hotel, for example at Sandymount or at Ballsbridge. I will be able to feel more local Dublin life.",5,2016,05,08
247,Lovely place to stay ,We stayed for three nights at the beginning of April and had a great time. A slight problem with noise above us was rectified straight away. Very clean and tidy and very nice staff. Great area for a stroll around and some nice restaurants. ,5,2016,05,07
247,A warm welcome,"We've stayed here on several occasions in recent years - it's our usual base when visiting Dublin - and it's difficult to beat.  There's an extensive renovation going to modernise what were looking rather tired rooms, but that doesn't detract from the comfort.  We had a modernised room which was excellent.  The staff are all friendly and helpful, ready to accommodate unusual requests.  There's no lunch or evening restaurant, though the bar serves a range of good dishes, and there are plenty of alternative places to eat nearby.  It's a family-owned and family-run hotel and the difference is positive - indeed the owner is very visible around the hotel.  Like everywhere in Dublin the rates on a Saturday night are high, but it's good value the rest of the week.  Ample free car parking and a 5-minute walk to the nearest DART station are real plusses.",5,2016,05,07
247,great hotel and friendly staff,I have stayed here many times and have enjoyed it every time and always made to feel welcome as soon as I walk in the door.  Beatrice always welcomes me with a smile and I have been to lucky to always have a peaceful nights sleep while here on business.  I can't recommend this hotel enough from staff to the new rooms to the lovely fresh food at breakfast to the peaceful surroundings.,5,2016,05,06
247,great hotel,"Stayed here an I can say that the staff were very helpful,some sections were being refurbished but it was a really nice room. only thing was there was no vent in bathroom so everything steamed up. Bed was really comfortable. Breakfast next morning was good with the choices (from a fry up to cereal etc ) plenty of coffee or tea. Room I had didnt have a view except to look at windows about 20 feet away.",5,2016,05,05
247,Credit card debited without asking,"I was staying at the sandymount hotel on and off, on business in dublin.
On the day I was due to checkout, I was woken up at 6.30 AM by an sms saying my credit Card was debited 500 euros by the hotel.  I immediately went around and demand they recredit my card.  The lady tried to tell me that this might take several weeks (I build bank and payment systems for a living..So this was complete bull.)

I had not even checked out, and they debited my card without signature.  The attitude of the staff who work at reception must change.  Every other hotel always asks ""how would you like to settle the bill sir?""

",2,2016,05,03
247,Staff dont care,"A few points for management to note 
The bar staff are doing this hotel no favours. Myself and a friend went in there on 3 occasions and we're not once asked if we were eating. Had to ask for a menu each time and this was at lunch and evening times. The only time we were approached by staff was on Friday 29th when the owners were doing a walkthrough with the bar manager/supervisor. On the occasion that we did eat the food was fantastic. The chef should be very proud of themselves.  I noted that on all occasions there were too many staff. This may be why there is a lack of interest in the patrons as the staff may think someone else is going to be of service. They all seemed very new or disengaged. Maybe a more mature person to guide them would be helpful. The last point I would make is that the lady on the front desk, blonde hair, a little more engagement would be helpful in making the guest feel comfortable, at least pretend.Refurb looks great !",2,2016,05,01
247,"Modern hotel, Great Value","Stayed with a group of mates.
Modern hotel in quiet location.
Excellent value for money. 
Comfy beds.
Good value meals.
Staff efficient and friendly.
My third stay.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in the City.",5,2016,05,01
247,Great,"All round lovely place to stay. Stay here!

I was here for two nights. Arrived exhausted after a sleep deprived journey. The room wasnt ready, but when they realised just how tired i was (I knew had to go to work a few hours after I checked in and i was discreetly snoozing on a sofa.) The receptionist got me a room made up especially so I could get 90mins shut eye.

The bar is friendly and food is very comforting.

It is also just near a river path for a peaceful walk so that is just a lovely bonus. 

Picture is of view from breakfast, and along the river walk.",5,2016,04,29
247,"A character Hotel, with a modern refurb (currently being refurbed)","The Hotel was being refurbished and directions to avoid the works were confusing, leading me to navigate a building site on my first trip to my room (I'm OK with adventures)

My room was spacious, clean and very well appointed.

The staff were really friendly and helpful.  Although the Hotel has a long history, the interior refurb was tastefully modern, light and airy.  Plenty of free parking and very well situated in leafy suburbs.

I had the chicken and cherizo salad from the bar, which seemed to set the bar for the  cost of eating out in Dublin at 17Euros.  5Euros for a Pint of Guiness was also par for Dublin, as it turned out.  

I would say this Hotel was good value for money.",4,2016,04,28
247,Great value and location,"Travelled with a book club group recently and our request for a triple room with 3 separate beds was overlooked. When we brought this to their attention, the staff were quick to resolve the problem and treated all 7 of our group to a complimentary drink for the delay. The hotel is located in a quiet suburb but just a quick Dart ride from the city centre. It was lovely to come back to after a hectic day sightseeing. Great breakfast in a large, airy room.",4,2016,04,27
247,21st Celebrations,"Stayed 22nd of April-24th and previous to our arrival, I had exchanged emails with the hotel to request a few surprises for my girlfriend during our stay. Everything went without any hitches, the reservations agent even upgraded us for free! Nothing was too much trouble. Lovely spacious executive suite on the 3rd floor, and located in Sandymount, a gorgeous setting with lots of bars and restaurants only a few minutes walk and of course the Aviva Stadium just down the road. Lovely breakfast, clean rooms and attentive and welcoming staff. Would stay again and again!",5,2016,04,25
247,Our first choice in Dublin! Again and again :-),"We have been to the Sandymount Hotel about  five times now and we were never disappointed - we absolutely love it! The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is so cozy and just perfect to relax when being on holidays. The location is perfect as it is very close to the City centre (10minutes by Train and by taxi you pay less than 15Euros). Also we love the fact that when you leave the Hotel you are right in front of the amazing Aviva Stadium! It just Looks incredible! This time we were lucky and got a freshly renovated room - the room was so modern, the bathroom probably the best i've seen in ireland so far - just all in all a fantastic Hotel!! :)",5,2016,04,21
247,Fantastic Hotel,"Enjoyed a great stay at this hotel for our birthday celebrations, the staff could not have been more helpful, and nothing was too much trouble for them. Would definitely have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone traveling to Dublin. Hope to return soon.",5,2016,04,19
247,Ideal location,"My husband and I stayed one night to attend a concert in the 3 arena. There was loads of free parking available which is hard to find with Dublin hotels and it was right on the doorstep of the aviva stadium, walking distance to the 3 arena only 15 mins. We stayed in an executive room on the 4th floor - really clean and fresh - not huge but still very impressed. We did not have breakfast at the hotel on this trip but we will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,17
247,Great hotel!! ,"This hotel is great, everything about it. The reception to restaurant staff are brilliant and so well presented and spoken. If you need anything you will always get it, nothing is too much for sandy mount hotel. Room is clean and comfortable. This hotel should not be 3* - should be 4 or even 5!!! Thanks for a amazing stay to conclude my trip around Ireland! ",5,2016,04,14
247,As good as ever,Enjoyed a great stay again.  Warmest welcome by staff and thoroughly enjoyable stay.  Last leg of room renovations nearly complete.  Comfortable beds with fresh clean linen everyday.  Free carpark and a short stroll to the DART train to the city and right beside the Aviva Rugby Stadium.  Looking forward to a return stay later in the year.,5,2016,04,13
247,Good hotel ,"Just got back from staying at the Sandymount hotel for a 3 night stay, there's lots of renovations going off but we were never disturbed by the noise. We stayed in room 210 which was a double and adequate in size, the room was good, cleaned everyday, and bed was comfortable. A few small complaints, the shower was very good but also very loud, the phone in the room didn't work and 1 day we asked for some milk twice and never arrived so went out for drinks instead. Apart from those minor things the hotel was good, in a good location, just outside the city centre so quiet but lots of local transport services to get you in the city centre within 10 minutes. We didn't eat in there so can't say if the food - breakfast was any good, front of house was very helpful and bar staff were great. If your going to Dublin the Guinness storehouse is a must to visit an amazing place, would definitely stay at the hotel again and Dublin is a very friendly city with plenty of stuff to do. ",4,2016,04,13
247,"Clean, tidy and a great location","Stayed here midweek, the place is coming to the end of a major refurbishment, just a pity we were located right in the middle of the final batch of rooms being worked upon, maybe the hotel was fully booked! saying that the room was very clean, lovely bathroom and the bed was very comfortable with lovely fresh linen.
Great value and a great location.",4,2016,04,13
247,"Ok , location great","rooms large and comfortable.
Location great
Staff in the bar/restaurant rude!!! You should never talk about your guests behind there back especially when they can hear you.
Front of house very pleasant and helpful.
Overall this hotel is good value for money. You get rude people everywhere.",4,2016,04,12
247,Dublin visit,Good hotel good breakfast. Free parking. Great location. We booked 2 rooms at short notice over the phone no problem price was reasonable for Dublin. 10 minute walk to Baggot Street try Searsons pub for food drink. City centre is about 20 minute walk. We will be back. Des,4,2016,04,12
247,Easter weekend,"We stayed over the weekend on Easter. Our main purpose was to relax and escape the busy city center with its celebrations of Easter Rising. Check in was quick and the lady on reception (beatrix? Beatrice?) Very friendly and welcoming. Nothing to much trouble.
The room was spotless and one of the newly refurbished ones. Loads of coffee and tea in room aswell as space for hanging up clothes.
We asked for extra shampoo and toothbrushes as we forgot ours and the lady at reception that night( sorry not good with names) organised it very promptly.
We had dinner in the bar, menu not too big but tasty. Service was a bit slow despite the bar wasnt busy that evening. Breakfast  made up for it, lots of choises and lovely attentive staff. They even have a section with gluten free bread. 
All in one a great hotel if you are looking to visit the aviva stadium or to escape the city center but still stay in dublin! Sandymount is a lovely village and the sea is close by aswell. Would stay again! ",4,2016,04,10
247,Great location. Will be great after refurbishment.,"Situated right next to Lansdowne Road Stadium (I'll never call it the the Aviva!) this hotel is currently undergoing refurbishment, which will be great when finished.

The rooms are large and comfortable, good food (limited choice) in the bar and a good quality breakfast. Friendly staff and a good price considering its location.

The DART tram leaves from the top of the road into the City centre and there is ample parking for all guests.

Good hotel........soon I think to be great!

Would stay here again👍.",3,2016,04,09
247,Great value hotel for New Years in Dublin,"The hotel was incredible value for spending New Years in Dublin. The breakfast was great, rooms clean and close to the train in to the city centre. Ballsbridge is very close and some great pubs and places to eat really close by. You couldn't fault the place for its value! The owner was also there on arrival and really helpful and welcoming, as were the rest of the staff!",5,2016,04,09
247,Great venue for proximity to Aviva 3 Arena etc,Checked in and were given card for our room had to walk through a somewhat building site to get there but when i did the keycard didnt work! Trekked back to reception and got this fixed and when we got into room it was fabulous but just a little noisy from the drilling noises with the ongoing work. Tried to ring reception but phone didnt work so back to the trekking! We were offered an alternative room away from workmen and it too was lovely and peaceful and very modern. I totally understand that construction work and updating needs done but im glad we got moved away from it and then had a totally enjoyable stay. Reception staff very helpful with directions etc if you just ask and provide you with a map also.,4,2016,04,08
247,"Lovely staff, very clean - small room","I booked a premium Double room for a trip with a friend. The cost of the room was extremely expensive but we thought it would be worth it and premium sounded like we were getting something special. The room which we were allocated was one of the refurbished rooms but it was tiny!! I felt i didn't get value for money with it. One armchair, pushed against the wardrobe doors, the whole room felt claustrophobic.

The staff in reception are lovely, and in the restaurant too. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the food is very good. 

When we arrived back in the hotel after seeing a show, the bar was quiet, which suited us down to the ground. The barman gave us a jug of milk to take back to the room to enjoy a cup of tea before bedtime, and he was very pleasant to deal with.

Its a great location, close to the DART station but also not too far out if you needed to get a taxi to where you're going to.

I have stayed at the Sandymount Hotel a few times before, and will definitely return. It's our ""go-to"" hotel in Dublin. 

Thanks",5,2016,04,08
247,Perfect,"1st time to visit hotel and will definitely be back again. Warm friendly atmosphere, very kind and helpful staff especially Beatrice at reception. Room very modern newly refurbished and very cosy. Food excellent. Can't wait to return",5,2016,04,07
247,Recommended for a rugby stay,"Stayed in a generously sized family room, in this friendly hotel. The staff were very helpful and attentive. It's a nice, 25 minute walk into town and would be perfect for a rugby stay, due to proximity to the Aviva and also atmosphere of the onsite bar - Lineout. We were also happy with the cooked breakfast, on offer in the restaurant, but a disappointing fruit selection if you were to opt for just the continental.",4,2016,04,06
247,Lovely family stay,We stayed here for one night at the end of March.  All the hotel staff were extremely friendly and the hotel was clean and welcoming.  Great location too.  In particular the staff at breakfast were brilliantly helpful and delightful.,5,2016,04,06
247,home from home,"Having stayed at this hotel some years ago for the first time when visiting family, i was very impressed and have used it whenever I get the chance to get over to Ireland. Each time I have been the hotel has just got better, from speaking to Toni in reservations ( nothing is too much trouble, and always wants to give the best service possible), and then meeting Beatrice and the team on reception with a warm Irish welcome it second to none in my book.  It has been sometime time since I have been back, but it’s the lasting impression of the friendly relaxed atmosphere and the service the hotel provides that always bring me back there.  It is a family run hotel, and they all give off that they are all like a family working together. I came with 12 members of my family, and we are all of the same opinion, and won’t be leaving it so long this time to go back. 
As far as location the Hotel is located by the Dart (the Irish rail network) that runs from one side of Dublin bay to the other. It takes 10 mins to be in the centre of Dublin, but if you buy a day ticket you can get on and off all day as we did and is great for sightseeing, and visiting the sea side towns of Bray Dun Laoghaire in the south and Malahide and Howth in the north. Then if you like a walk and chill out, its 10 mins to Sandymount (lovely little village)which has shops pubs and restaurants, or another 5 mins you can be on the beaches of Dublin bay watching the ships go in and out of Dublin Port. So all in all I find this hotel a great place to enjoy Dublin, but also to take time out to relax. I have no problem recommend The Sandymount Hotel, and now come to regard it as home from home.",5,2016,04,06
247,Nice hotel!,"Stayed here for a long weekend and was very happy with the hotel. The reception staff were friendly and took our bags for us when we arrived early so we didn't have to pull them around the city, they also held on to them the day we departed. They also arranged a couple of taxis for us and recommended a hop on hop off bus company which helped massively with our travel around the city.
We had an executive room which had clearly not long been renovated which was lovely! 
The breakfest was to a high standard with a wide selection and the restaurant staff were friendly. 
One small criticism was the menu in the line out bar, I thought it could have had a wider selection and the menu in the restaurant was not the same as advertised outside the front of the hotel. Also as the hotel is undergoing some renovations we were woken by noise quite early on the Saturday morning.

Despite these 2 small things, I would strongly recommend a stay at this hotel and would definitely stay again! ",4,2016,04,05
247,One for future visits..,"I had stayed at this hotel in December 2014, and it was the first hotel on my list for a recent visit with my daughter. We stayed for 2 nights and the staff were extremely helpful with any enquires that we had.
Mitch",5,2016,04,05
247,Very pleased,"Came here with some friends and we were all super happy,the rooms are clean and the staff is super helpful. Especially the duty manager Gosia,she explained how to get to the Jameson distillery and recommended us one more place to visit. Price was reasonable.",5,2016,04,04
247,Easter trip. ,My fiancé and I stayed here Easter weekend for my birthday. Excellent location lovely walk in to city centre along canal takes 20 minutes. Local village has plenty bars and restaurants. Staff are lovely and friendly. Thanks for having us would love to stay again. X,5,2016,04,01
247,Sandymount hotel,"Arrived in Dublin expecting to book in at the Jury Inn for a business trip only to find out that there is a mix up between my company and the hotel which couldnt be resolved. And the Sandymount hotel helped me out loads, got me two lovely rooms that evening and enjoyed the two nights i stayed there. Very friendly staff lovely food and highly recommend.",5,2016,04,01
247,In Dublin 'Out of Dublin'.,"A family run hotel with great customer focus. Stayed during 2016 Easter weekend and were warmly greeted by staff who recognised us even though we had not been there for a few years. Got a refurbished room which was much appreciated. Excellent breakfast!!
Great location for business but ideally suited for families too.  Free parking. If driving from the North it is only minutes from the Port Tunnel / East Link. c.250m from Lansdowne Station and 6 mins by DART to the city centre. 
Less than 10 mins walk to the beach, providing for a refreshing promenade stroll or run! 5 mins walk to Sandymount Village and Green, which offers some excellent eating and drinking options and a good local independent bookshop too! 
Very much part of Dublin. Close to the Centre but with a 'local' feel, without the traffic and parking hassle.",4,2016,03,31
247,Ideal Location,Stayed here early March for three days. Hotel was excellent and despite a lot of renovation work disturbance was kept kept to a minimum. Staff were excellent in all areas and breakfasts a delight. All requests were cheerfully dealt with. Location was ideal. Close to dart station so very easy to access city centre. Also a short stroll to Sandymount village and some great coffee shops and restaurants. Beach also close by and great walking on promenade. Will use this hotel again.,4,2016,03,31
247,Restaurant and staff,Had a meal with family who were guests there. The staff from the time we went in were so jolly and helpful. Number of guests changed 3 times nothing was a problem. The food was absolutely delicious. Hats off to the chef. Pate so good even hot a takeaway.  Thank you for a wonderful night.,5,2016,03,31
247,Love this hotel,"this hotel is the best hotel in Dublin ,the staff are amazing,especially Beatrice on reception ,such a nice welcoming and friendly person ,we first came to the hotel  39 yrs ago on our honeymoon ,been back loads of times since ,all rooms are pretty good ,some quite small but comfortable and spotless ,the location is perfect only a 5 min walk to bus or train ,then another 5 mins to centre of Dublin ,breakfast is highly recommended everything you can possible want ,there is a refurbishment in parts of hotel at present but won't interfere with your stay ,can't wait to return again this year ,",5,2016,03,31
247,Very good Hotel,"We were part of a group of 11 family members staying in the Sandymount Hotel for 3 nights over the Easter Weekend to meet with family in Dublin and attend the 1916 celebrations.  This was not our first stay at the Sandymount and as we had such a pleasant stay last time we decided to stay here again.  The hotel is not in the City Centre but is very close to the Aviva Stadium and about a 5 minute walk to the Dart station and it is just 2 stops from here on the Dart into the centre of Dublin and in our opinion was nicer than staying in the centre of town.

We arrived very early on Good Friday but unfortunately couldn’t check into our rooms until later in the afternoon (3pm) but we were able to leave our bags in a locked room while we went out and explored the local area.

When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by Talitha on Reception who was extremely helpful and friendly, professional and tried to get us into our rooms as soon as she could.

The reception area, lounge areas, bar and restaurant areas are all very clean and welcoming.

My Partner and I had a classic double and this room contained both a double and a single bed.  The room was in a part of the hotel which has recently been refurbished.  The room was spotlessly clean and did look as if it had been recently decorated and the bathroom again was spotless.  Although the room and bathroom were quite small, it was fine for our needs as we were just using the hotel as a base during our stay.  The only downside is that as part of the hotel is still being refurbished we had to walk through an area where works are still being carried out to get to our room but that is a very minor niggle.  We experienced no disruption because of this during our stay.

We did not have breakfast included in our room price but we were able to book this each morning and was added to our room at the end of our stay at a cost of 12 Euros per person per day.  For breakfast there was a choice of a full Irish breakfast with the usual, sausage, rashers, fried eggs (or you could choose to have scrambled or boiled), tomatoes, mushrooms, black and white pudding.  There were also a selection of breads, pastries, cereals etc, as you would expect to find.  The breakfast was fine, no complaints.

We also spent some time in the Hotel Bar and again the staff were professional, efficient, helpful and friendly.

I would recommend this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying here again.
",5,2016,03,31
247,"Excellent for the rugby, will be back again","Travelled to Dublin with a group of friends to watch the rugby. The location of the hotel is fantastic as it is only 100 meters from the Aviva stadium. Seems to be the hub for fans and I am sure some of the Ireland team were there on the Friday before the match. 

The owner (John) came and chatted to us on our last day. Very friendly and full of useful tips.

The hotel is currently being renovated and we had to walk past some of the work being carried out. However our room had been done and was great.",5,2016,03,29
247,A Bit disappointing,"We only stayed for one night but doubt will be going back . Some friends booked this hotel and would have thought our two rooms may have been closer together as booked at same time , but we were a very long way apart from one side of the hotel to the other. On checking in we went through a ""building site"" dodging various plasterers and builders to get to our room which then the key card would not work so to avoid a very long walk back and obviously could not ring reception as weren't in the room , rang our friends who did get a little man to open up . Quite a nice room although view of brick wall not very nice. Had decided to eat in the restaurant as it had some good reports re special dietary  requirements .Unfortunately it was shut ! Bar snack menu had no information about special diets and the request also seemed to confuse some staff .Eventually the only item which fitted the criteria was a steak but the chef did not want to make some mash as it would take too long (chips were not suitable for gluten free allergy sufferers) so just got very large portion of new potatoes. The steak was OK as was the scampi . No lie in following morning as builders started banging . Did not have breakfast as we had no confidence in the dietary needs we wanted .",2,2016,03,29
247,A nice cosy hotel for a short visit to Dublin.,"It is a very nice and charming hotel. The social areas are very agreable and invite you to stay just to rest or read a nice book. The room for three was large enough and very comfortable, especially the beds. We particularly appreciated the facilities to make tea or coffee or even ironing your own clothes in the bedroom. Free Wifi at the hotel room is very good too.The whole hotel is clean and friendly. The staff were very nice, friendly and helpful. The surroundings are very quiet and nice, but it is a little bit far from the buses stops.",4,2016,03,28
247,So close to the centre of everything,"What a lovely, family run hotel. The whole place was clean. The staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful. The beds were comfortable and the area was quiet. There are local areas of beauty within a few minutes walk and yet the hotel is so close to the city centre as well that you really get the best of both worlds. Small enough to care yet large enough to cope really does sum this hotel up.",5,2016,03,26
247,Very nice but little bit tricky to get into the center,"This is a very nice and clean hotel. Very traditional and don't expect your room with number 5xx is on the floor! It has many meeting places, very convenient to have gathering or personal meeting. The restaurant is nice and staff is super nice. The surrounding is nice and you may be woken up by bird singing at 5:00 in the morning. The only inconvenience we felt was going to get on the city tour bus. We are from English speaking country and the front desk spoke English, however, we felt our way all along.",4,2016,03,24
247,Great for an event at the Aviva stadium,"This was booked only a week before the six nations game so was a bit pricey, but that`s the way it is. The room was very nice with the usual features. The hotel is totally geared for the event at the Aviva so don't expect it to be quiet if there is a game on. If oyur going to the game its as good as you will get.",4,2016,03,24
247,Sandymount Hotel is first class in every way,"My wife Isobel and I, for the second year, stayed in Sandymount Hotel for an Ireland 6-Nations game at Aviva Stadium.  The hotel was clean, and all the facilities were excellent. Food was great and all the staff were all very friendly, attentive, pleasant and efficient.  It was also a pleasure to meet the owner during our stay.  Its proximity to Aviva is a real bonus, even if it means it is always very busy before and after the game - but that adds to the atmosphere. We could not speak more highly about the hotel, and we will definitely be returning for an Autumn game and for next year's 6-Nations",5,2016,03,23
247,Prime location for the Aviva Stadium,"We stayed at Sandymount for the Wales and Italy matches of the 2016 Six Nations Championship. There couldn;t be a better location, a few hundred yards to the ground. Excellent staff throughout. The hotel is going through refurbishment but the disruption was minimal. We had a refurbished room on the second stay and the finish/amenities are all you could ask for; a great, hearty breakfast is available or simple continental if desired. Atmosphere on match day was very good.",4,2016,03,23
247,Lovely Friendly Hotel,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel in March 16, staff were extremely friendly couldn't do enough for you. Rooms recently refurbished bed one of the most comfortable I've slept in. Had breakfast both mornings which I was rate 10/10. 1 evening meal which was really enjoyable. If I had to complain would say the portion was too big!! Overall would recommend this hotel. Just outside the city centre few minutes away the lovely costal road and quiet village of Sandy Mount. Ideal location for a relaxing chilled break. ",5,2016,03,22
247,Ireland v Scotland 6 Nations,"This hotel cannot be any closer to the stadium. Match day though it was absolutely rammed all day. As the match didn't start until 1700 we toured Dublin during the day and returned just before the game. The bar was about 10 deep in the hotel but it's easy enough to get a drink in the tented bars around the outside, or just at the stadium which is a 100 yards away. After the game the bar was still full but we went to the hotel restaurant to have a meal and watch the last game in comfort. The rooms are a good size and our room had a double and single bed, which I understand is the norm. Meals are excellent, big portions and very reasonably priced. From the airport get the aircoach 747 to Dublin Centre and then the 4 or 7 bus to Lansdowne Road. It's a little bit of a walk but we got a three day travellers pass with a bus tour of Dublin included and it is far cheaper than taxis.",5,2016,03,21
247,"Great hotel, really helpful staff","Left it until the last minute to book but hotel was really helpful especially Toni who organised our reservation, excellent customer service.  Location is great and price was competitive especially for Paddy's weekend.",5,2016,03,18
247,Very comfortable visit,"Recently returned to the Sandymount Hotel for a business meeting there the following day. Check in was seamless and receptionist was very pleasant and welcoming. The hotel is currently upgrading some of its rooms so expect some slight disruption....nothing of concern. I stayed in one of the refurbished rooms and they have been excellently finished, are comfortable and bright. Breakfast was excellent with a great selection of hot (buffet)and cold dishes. Complimentary newspaper available.",4,2016,03,17
247,Excellant stay,"Stayed for one night at the Sandymount Hotel, we have stayed here before for the Horse show a few years back but it has even improved in standards,from the onset all was excellant. Toni on reception was very helpful and professional, the hotel is in a great location with great car parking facilities, renovation work going on but no disturbance experienced.We were given one of the executive rooms and the refurbishments were of a very high standard.Breakfast was great with a wide selection and there was a rugby game being played the day after our stay so the atmosphere in the hotel was buzzing, thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely return in the near future and highly recommend for a stay in the city centre.",5,2016,03,16
247,"Sandymount Hotel, great bunch of lads!","Stayed with 7 ladies for a hen weekend. Easy to get to in a taxi from the airport. We were greeted on arrival by very friendly and helpful staff, who were very accommodating while we arranged to split our bill equally and generally were a bit of a nuisance. The Aviva stadium is 2minutes walk away, and on match day the hotel had a bar/beer tent set up outside, as well as the hotel bar being open. We ate in the Line Out bar on the Friday night which served a good range of tasty food. Breakfast was plentiful and good value at €12. The room was clean and the beds very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and the shower was nice and powerful. The only downside to the room was the temperature. It was very hot with no thermostat to control it so we had to leave the windows open all night but this didn't help cool is down much as the towel rail in the bathroom seemed to be permanently superheated and you couldn't turn it off. The toaster in the breakfast room could do with some instructions on it as a lot of people seemed to have trouble turning it on (turn the timer knob!) and spent a lot of time watching bread not toasting!  
All in all a lovely stay, staff are great and all the girls agreed we would definitely go back",4,2016,03,14
247,Boutique & Beautiful,"I have stayed in the Sandymount on a number of occasions. On each visit I have found it to be one of the most friendly and relaxing environments to stay in. The rooms are very comfortable and the bar and lounge are hubs of activity populated by many varied and interesting characters. 

The breakfast is excellent and is more than enough to set you up for the day. Parking is free which is always welcome and its close proximity to the Aviva Stadium and the delightful Sandymount village are big plus points.
The DART is a pleasant 10 min walk past the stadium giving access to Dublin City Centre with the hotel being close enough to transport links including bus routes while having a feeling of being far enough away from its hustle and bustle.",5,2016,03,13
247,"Comfortable, friendly hotel","We chose this hotel as we were going to watch the Ireland - Italy rugby game at the Aviva Stadium. There were 8 of us as it was my daughter's hen weekend. It was such a good choice! The hotel is very comfortable and the staff are wonderful. I'm sorry I can't name any of them but without exception they were all helpful, friendly and thoughtful. Our room was very nice with adequate space and had a spotlessly clean bathroom. There is some refurbishment going on but there was no apparent inconvenience to the guests. The location is perfect for anyone going to an event at the Aviva Stadium - just two minutes walk away.  The only slightly negative comment I have is that our room was very hot at night - even with the window open. It was only a trivial matter and certainly wouldn't put us off staying there again. Thank you to the lovely staff who really did help us to have a wonderful weekend.",5,2016,03,13
247,Hot & Noisy,"Hotel is perfect location if going to the aviva. Room was very clean but way too hot and no way to cool room down, very uncomfortable nights sleep had to leave windows open all night. Then woken from 8am onwards by housekeepers chatting outside room loudly banging doors & dragging squeeking hovers up & down corridor past room. Should appreciate people are there at weekend on a leisure break.",2,2016,03,13
247,Excellent hotel on all levels,"Stayed here for a business trip in March 16. Couldn't recommend this hotel more, cleanliness, old world charm, super location and very helpful staff. Beatrice on reception took very good care of us. Will return in summer for social trip",5,2016,03,11
247,Fantastic hotel,"This simply is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in.

The rooms are immaculate and set to the highest standard, the staff are friendly and inviting and its a stones throw away from the local attractions.

I must say a massive thank you also to John the owner who took the time to wish us farewell. A very personal touch indeed, and one that has ensured we will be shouting from the hills how good this place is.",5,2016,03,10
247,Great hotel,"Stayed for two nights B and B. Exceptionally clean room with very nice decor,  adequate space and comfortable bed. Great staff and a good breakfast. Also just a few minutes walk to the Dart train line into the city centre. Next to the Aviva stadium for sports fans. Reception staff booked taxis for us on two occasions, both turned up right on time and we received a call to let us know it had arrived. Would definitely recommend. Thanks for a lovely stay Sandymount. ",5,2016,03,08
247,"Service good, shuttle taxi was a disaster","When leaving to the airport, I trusted the hotel and its shuttle taxi. Worst decision of my life - almost ruined the whole trip.
After half an hour of wait I had to start running the nearby streets to catch a taxi myself. 
During the waiting I tried to get information about the arrival of this taxi - no use. I tried to ask them to use another taxi company - no use. Hotel taxi never arrived. On the hotel front yard was also another bunch of guests waiting for they taxi with similar success.
Will not return to this hotel ever.",1,2016,03,08
247,A few days in Dublin,A short Friday to Sunday break to Dublin. The hotel is in a great location 1 minute from the Aviva stadium & 2 minutes walk from the DART station to the city centre. The hotel is undergoing some refurb work but it's well contained and disruption was minimal. The rooms are a good size and are finished to a high standard. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2016,03,07
247,Great place to stay comfortable rooms great staff,Stayed at beginning of vacay and end. Rooms very modern comfortable but very tiny. Hallways extremely narrow but is a historical place so can't rebuild. Bathroom showers incredible! Heated towel racks are the bomb! Loved them so much will be installing in bathrooms back home in Canada. Beds very comfortable.  Incredibly clean. Excellent staff so helpful and welcoming. Only problem was extremely loud noisy guests drinking running screaming yelling in hallways (after a very exciting rugby game) settled down after midnight though. Unfort we had to be up at 6 for early am flight but caught up on sleep on the plane. Breakfast was delicious - top drawer! Pub was good food really good. Loved the tea in the rooms-so much I found a small grocers to buy 2 boxes to bring home to Canada! Will definitely stay again when I return to Dublin.,5,2016,03,05
247,Great small hotel,"This hotel is in a bit away from the city center but is great for business travelers. 

Rooms are clean with modern fixtures that work well. (Exception being the bathroom basin which doesn't empty quick enough... but no biggie) Wifi is good and free. There is some construction going on now (March 2016)... so some temp facades and 

Breakfast is good- a full Irish breakfast spread (bacon, sausages, fried eggs, baked beans, grilled tomatoes, bread, fruits, juices, cereals ... well pretty much everything. Only, tends to be a bit tepid and not hot. 

Staff is super friendly and helpful at all times. All around. Loved the service. 

They have a bar which is not like an Irish pub (dark, wood paneled and cozy) - but good all the same. 

The shuttle service is disappointing - we had one incident when to drop one other person, our party of six was made to travel all over town to finally get to our destination a mere five km (3.5 mi) away after 1 hour and a good 15 min late for our meeting. I'd give that a skip and just Uber. 

There is really not much around - it is mostly a residential area. A grocer is close by and so is the rugby stadium. But that's about it. 

And don't try to exchange your currency for euros at the hotel. Ridiculous rates. 

But purely from the quality of stay, service and restaurant - grant value for the money. ",4,2016,03,05
247,A great place,"Spent three nights in Sandymount hotel and liked everything. A very friendly and helpful staff, nice and very clean room, excellent atmosphere, good breakfast and dinner. Must be beautiful during summer time. Dart very close, so it's easy to reach the city centre. Will come back!",4,2016,03,02
247,So homely,Had a great time here on Sunday past. The staff have to be the friendliest in Ireland. Very clean and tidy even though there going through a refurbishment. Every time I stay here the owner always has a chat at breakfast time. A nice touch something the bigger hotels are sadly missing. Then he went out of his way to accommodate us at Easter. A huge big thank you John Loughran Top man,5,2016,03,01
247,Average,"Stayed for one night only as we were going to show at Bord Gais theatre. On arrival we were greeted by an unsmiling Dara O'Brien look a like. He was efficient but not overly friendly and not a great first impression. Now for the reason behind the average review - there is a lot of building work going on which spoiled the atmosphere. Having said that we got a renovated room which was very nice, clean and comfortable. The hotel is close to a DART station which was handy to get into the city as it is just a bit long to walk to the city centre. Although we walked back from the theatre/drinks late at night and it was very quiet which put the wife off a bit, but I thought it was safe enough. Breakfast was standard hotel fare and staff friendly and ver helpful. Once renovations are completed this would be a nice hotel to stay in, especially for a rugby match and if you didn't mind getting DART into city.",3,2016,03,01
247,"Great service, very good location, great value","I stayed at the Sandymount Hotel for 3 nights during my business trip. The hotel is located just 2 minutes walk from Aviva stadium and 5 minutes from the DART station from which you can be in the city center in just a few minutes. I have to say that service at the reception was exceptional, always helpful, friendly and ready to assist with any request, I especially have to thank to Sanja for being so kind and helpful. Breakfast was very good and the breakfast staff kind and attentive. Rooms were exceptionally clean. Overall great stay, thanks Sandymount for your hospitality!",5,2016,02,22
247,Regular visitor,"I am done on business regularly and the hotel is in a great location, with comfortable recently refurbished rooms.  Gosia is a great duty manager ensuring everything runs smoothly and Beatrice and her team at reception are always welcoming and helpful.",5,2016,02,22
247,Great hotel great staff,"Just arrived back from a 3 day stay at the sandymount hotel and i must say its a stunning hotel from the decor to the staff. On Thursday when we arrived our room wasn't ready but the receptionist went out of her way to find a room that was ready which she did room 202. 

The food in the restaurant is beautiful and for the price its well worth it.

Breakfast is also great for 12 euros.

The hotel is a 5 min walk to the dart which is only 2 stops to the center .

It was also my birthday on friday so they sent a bottle of wine to me which i thought was fantastic.

On our departure we didn't really no where we were getting the shuttle from so the manager drove us to the stop where we were picked up 

All in all great hotel ",5,2016,02,21
247,Comfortable and well placed for Dublin's attractions,"Great staff, comfortable rooms and a lovely pint of Guiness to round things off. The hotel is minutes away from a DART station which is the public rail line around the east of Dublin, though it does go near many of the attractions. The hotel was undergoing refurbishment at the time of our stay but it didn't affect us. The food in the bar is good and reasonably priced and as I said, the staff are wonderful. Altogether a great choice if you're in that part of the world",4,2016,02,21
247,Beautiful weekend.,"A family owned hotel with a very warm and welcoming atmosphere.. It has a quirky layout since it actually consists of 8 Victorian houses linked together and an interesting history. Our bedroom was very stylish and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast caters for all tastes, with plenty of choice.  The location is ideal for Landsdowne, within walking distance of the RDS, Sandymount Village and many well known restaurants. The staff are very friendly and helpful and we will definitely be back for a 3rd visit.",5,2016,02,20
247,Location location location ,"I booked this for my family. 2 rooms. They loved it perfect location. Car park was super. Staff were great. They praised the receptions. Breakfast also great and the hotel happily met requests for twin rooms. The hotel was near the dart staton but the drive to the city was also easy. The rooms were very quiet  
",5,2016,02,20
247,Great service in the Bar,"I visited the Sandymount Hotel for a snack. The atmosphere in the 
bar is very relaxing. I must say the food was absolutely delicious. 
But best of all was the fantastic service I received. The bar manager Beata 
was so helpful and nothing was a problem for her. She gave a level
of customer service that was natural, warm and effortless. It is a special trait of 
enlightened hospitality. Well done.",5,2016,02,18
247,Great location and great rooms,"We have stayed here a few times and have always liked it. They have recently upgraded many of their rooms and they are really lovely. We had a huge room and a great bathroom. All very comfortable, quiet, with everything you could need. Also plenty of free car parking - which is a scarcity in this part of the city. We love that is is family run and you get great, friendly service. Depending on demand, prices can ber very reasonable - especially if you book in advance.
Very convenient to the Dart station and lots of restaurants and pubs in the surrounding area.",4,2016,02,17
247,Weekend trip.,"Dont write many reviews, but thought this deserved one, allocated room on what we presume was the refurbished end,we arrived early and was told room would be ready in 10 mins which it was,room spotlessly clean, in fact every part of hotel I saw was the same 10/10 to the cleaners, breakfast adequate, enough choice to set you up for the day. We ate in the main restaurant/ bar one evening food lovely. All the staff were polite and helpful, from the cleaners saying good morning, breakfast and restaurant staff attentive, to the Reception staff who helped with any questions we asked, a special thank you to Beatrice who advised us with bus and train information to telling us about the discounted tickets for the open top bus. Thank you sandy mount.",5,2016,02,16
247,Amazing,"Loved this place. I stayed here during a trip to Dublin with friends for a Comic Con, location was perfect with easy access to the city, and the convention hall. 

Hotel staff were amazing, so friendly and helpful, even when they were rushed off their feet with customers. Rooms were large with good TV's, beds, and coffee making facilities, and we loved the PC room available to the guests. 

Only thing to be wary off is how loud guests at the bar and outside can become during the rugby games, but the same can be said of any Dublin hotel at that time of year. 
Would definitely return if we ever come back over!",5,2016,02,15
247,"Perfectly located, great hotel","Stayed Feb 16 with a friend to play in a poker tournament at the RDS which is a pleasant 10 minutes walk along the river, perfectly situated for Ballsbridge or Dublin itself, Dart train is 5 minutes walk and 3 stops to City Center. Lansdowne Road Stadium is on the door step(literally) and Sandymount village is very close by also for a slightly cheaper eating alternative to Ballsbridge. The hotel itself is very clean and tidy and all staff were friendly and helpful. Only ate at the hotel once which was breakfast, very nice although I thought it a little pricey at 12 euros, there seemed to be no middle ground with this either-whether you had a bowl of cereal or the full Irish it was the same price!? Other than that this hotel ticked all the boxes, i would definately stay again if I was back in Dublin and would highly recommend to others",5,2016,02,15
247,Highly recommend,"We stayed at Sandymount hotel for 6 nights in a twin room. From the moment we arrived we were treated first class. The receptionist gave us local information of where to eat, drink etc, the maids were conscientious to our abnormal sleeping habits, and nothing was ever too much trouble, from changing money to having fresh milk and clean beds and towels every day. The location is superb too, 10 mins walk to the poker tournament from a selfish view, but also 2 mins walk from the dart station and 10 mins walk to sandymount village and to the aircoach pick up.

Would highly recommend, I will certainly be coming back.",5,2016,02,15
247,Nice weekend hotel,"Stayed for one night. Hotel is very well located in a nice area of Dublin (and beside the Aviva stadium). Rooms are very clean, comfortable and functional but otherwise nothing spectacular. Nice restaurant for breakfast. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Perfect for a weekend stay.",4,2016,02,14
247,Rugby Weekend,"This was our second time staying for a six nations match. Location is brilliant. Atmosphere on match days is great. Our room was large, clean,bright and airy. Food was good, service was fast, only fault I found  and it's not really a fault as such,was no starters available on Sunday night in restaurant which I found odd for any restaurant. Reception Staff are extremely helpful. Have stayed in other Ballsbridge hotels  for business and leisure and Sandymount Hotel is my favourite. ",5,2016,02,11
247,RUGBY WEEK-END,We really enjoyed our visit here with 4 friends.It was an ideal location for the rugby 5 minutes walk away Aviva stadium .Rooms was clean and bed was most comfortable .Breakfast buffet style was very good and as they say if you leave a buffet meal hungry thats your own fault.Plenty of selection to go at and our evening meal was also good. The staff was always polite and helpful and a special mention must go to John the owner who not only made sure that our stay was good but also drove us all to the ferry port which was way above anything we expected but hearing we was going to the port drove us his self.Well done Sandymount Hotel and well done John.,4,2016,02,10
247,Ask for Bernard or Dave for a free drop off within reasonable distance,"I am coming to the end of a two year secondment, working in Dublin. Would highly  recommend this hotel for the corporate traveller.  Friendly staff from Marie in the restaurant to Bernard and Dave who drive the shuttle bus. John the owner always has a word of welcome for you too.

The recent revamp of the rooms has made the hotel even better.  Modern colours, comfy cushions on the bed. I look forward to coming back for a weekend with my husband.",5,2016,02,09
247,Rugby trip,"Stayed in the Sandymount in August and returned this weekend for the six nations rugby. Hotel is having a refurb and have to say we thought it was lovely before but bedrooms are even better now. Staff were very helpful and friendly , food was faultless , evening meal and breakfast. That owner John kindly arranged transport to the ferry for us as we had to wait until Monday evening for a ferry as due to weather , our afternoon one was cancelled. Would definitely recommend and stay again when next in Dublin",5,2016,02,09
247,"Quiet, clean and comfortable but lacks happy staff","I last stayed at the Sandymount 5 years ago when it was known as the Mount Herbert. The hotel is in a lovely quiet area close to some lovely bars and restaurants. Hotel is very clean, nicely decorated and my room was very comfortable. I chose to ear in the hotel bar which was very pleasant. My only gripe was that the staff appeared robotic and lacked charm. Breakfast staff in particular seemed to want to be elsewhere, yawning all the time. To smile and say good morning doesn't take too much effort. Apart from that a really nice place to stay.",4,2016,02,09
247,A wonderful first experience in Dublin,"I didn't know Dublin so I went there for a few days with my mother. The staff of this hotel is very nice and helpful and the owner John which we had the pleasure to meet is one of the nicest and humorous persons we've known. You feel like home. The rooms are very cosy and clean and the breakfast is very good and with a view to a great garden with beautiful birds and squirrels! The location is excellent, the DART is very close and the Sandymount Village and beach can be accessed in a very few minutes walking. Loved the experience! :)",5,2016,02,06
247,noise,"nice enough hotel, room was clean/ noise was shocking person above had convo all night on phone an must have been dragging a bag around all night. put me off the hotel everything else was fine but this",3,2016,02,03
247,Family celebration,"A very welcoming hotel with lovely, clean rooms, a brilliant location close to Dart and a ten minute walk from Sandymount beach.Private parking on site.
Staff very helpful and friendly.
Excellent food served efficiently in the bar. Good variety of foods available for breakfast including a gluten free selection.",5,2016,02,02
247,Excellent hotel,"Home away from home, lovely clean comfortable bedrooms. Breakfast delicious and plenty to choose from, very friendly and helpful staff, bar food was very nice. We stayed here for four nights for showcase in the rds, very near the rds, so location was perfect, will definitely be back.",5,2016,02,01
247,Best scampi in Dublin!,Just enjoyed the freshest most delicious scampi in the Sandymount Hotel. We had a most pleasant impromptu evening in relaxed elegant surroundings. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and the service was impeccable. Well done to you all we  will most certainly be returning in the very near future.,5,2016,01,30
247,Perfect,"I love The Sandymount! Staff are helpful, beds are comfortable and location is perfect. Best breakfast ever. I visit every year, wouldn't go anywhere else...it's kind of quirky but for all of the best reasons. Right next to Aviva stadium & not far from RDS & busses & dart 
xXx
 ",4,2016,01,27
247,Visit ,"I enjoyed our stay. But the breakfast let it down. It was very plain, no scrambled eggs. Also the room we stayed in was very small. The bathroom was very extra small. The staff were very nice and couldn't do enough for us. ",3,2016,01,27
247,Central and comfortable,"I would definitely recommend this hotel for those looking to explore Dublin. The location is ideal, being close to city centre (15 min walk through a beautiful area or 5mins on the  local train) and also close to a lovely beach with great views over Dublin. The local train also goes to the south of Dublin so you can visit pretty seaside towns like Dunlaoghaire and Killiney. The staff were really helpful and offer great advice about places to see and how to get there.",5,2016,01,26
247,Everything you want,Stayed here late January. Couldnt fault the hotel very helpful receptionist ladies who explained to us how to access the dart which was less than a mile up the road and a fraction on the price of a taxi into the main city centre. Had something to eat in the bar on our first night very nice atmosphere and freshly made pizza! Very spacious hotel that's situated right beside the aviva and not a long walk from the 3 arena to which we watched Kevin Hart. Very handy hotel will be staying again on my next visit. ,5,2016,01,24
247,Sandymount,"We stayed here for one night to attend a show in the 3arena, which was only a 15-20 minute walk away, so very handy. The staff are friendly and the rooms are nice, but the en suite bathrooms could do with sprucing up. The breakfast was lovely and well worth including in the stay. All in all we had a good stay and would definitely stay again if going to the 3arena again or to the Aviva.",4,2016,01,24
247,Great Hotel-great Staff but watch how you book-They do not honour loyalty,"This is one of our favourite hotels in Dublin,it's situated by the Aviva Stadium,close by is the Dart and a taxi to take you to the centre of Dublin will cost less than €10.  
The hotel has and still is being refurbished and although work is still ongoing you do not notice. The rooms are comfortable and clean.
The staff ( particularly in the bar ) are friendly and helpful and are an asset to the hotel.
On a downer....... We booked this in January for a three day break and went direct to the Sandymount web site and were invited to book at a 10% discount room only which we did.
However Sandymount then a week later sends us an e-mail with Winter sale if staying January or February of  15% off Bed &Breakfast rates and a half bottle of wine .
Upon our arrival and checking in we pointed this out to the receptionist and she checked on system and stated that it was sad we booked the wrong time as we could have saved quite a bit if we had booked the 15% I asked if it could be changed and  informed us she would let admin know. 
We stayed our 3 days,no-one contacted us and we paid our bill ( yes a lot more than if we got the 15% deal). After we paid our bill I asked if anyone was available to discuss this situation and wanted to inform them that I was putting it on Trip Advisor to make other people aware that by booking early you could pay a lot more than other guests waiting last minute but the receptionist  just stated that they didn't know when offers were coming up and couldn't do a thing about it.she did not call any management to discuss. By the way our dates we wanted were still available when the 15% e-mail arrived. 
We will still go back but in future take a chance and book very late.",4,2016,01,23
247,Great Dublin base,"Great location,friendly professional and genuine staff ,together with a real fire burning in the foyer and tempting sweets to ease check-in..
Free car-parking and wi-fi in this well located Dublin suburb close to Sandymount village with good choice of bars and restaurants
Complimentary coffee,fruit and daily newspaper...nice touch
The hotel bedrooms are undergoing a comprehensive refurbishment-restful tones,good bathrooms,quiet.
The bedroom sizes vary reflecting the different extensions added over the years. All comfortable.
Overall,very hard to beat -value ,staff,service and location",5,2016,01,21
247,Lovely,"Rally nice place, under renovation at the moment so bits were boarded up, but still nice. Room not as nice as I expected for an executive suite,quite basic really, but clean. Food in the bar was really nice,staff were excellent.",4,2016,01,16
247,Comment on Stay,"Reception personnel were extremely friendly as well as efficient providing us with an excellent room - clean, comfortable and spacious with all necessary components - excellent shower and also tea and coffee-making facilities.",5,2016,01,15
247,Well located Hotel,"This was our first time to stay at this hotel and it was for the Dublin Horse Show. It was the ideal location 5 minute walk to the RDS, 2 minute walk to the Aviva stadium, 5 minutes from the bars and restaurants in Ballsbridge. Convenient to everything we needed. Had a fine sized room plenty space for 2 adults 2 children. Great value for money for the time of year and great location. Ample parking and shuttle bus to the RDS during the Horse Show. Very nice friendly staff.",5,2016,01,15
247,Best place to stay in Dublin,"I am a repeat visitor to this hotel and in almost 30 years I have yet to find a hotel to equal the hospitality. From the moment you step inside there door you are greeted by a friendly face, quite often its the lovely Beatrice who is a long serving member of staff, if you're a regular, you are greeted by name and so sets the scene. The rooms are well laid out, a lovely size, immaculately clean and the food is first class. It's so close to all amenities and sights and I could not recommend it highly enough.",5,2016,01,14
247,"First Class Service, Friendliness and Facilities","Stayed for 3 days with student group attending RDS .   Convenient location in a quiet suburb . Stayed in refurbished room and was very comfortable. Staff of hotel couldn't have been kinder or more supportive - from reception through restaurant staff : this is 12th time I have stayed in hotel in early Jan - continuity of staff members is notable and  all show a genuine interest in their guests.  Hotel is part way through renovation and their new rooms are excellent

Night time staff  very quickly allocated additional room when student became ill unexpectedly and needed isolation.",5,2016,01,12
247,Good hotel First Class service,"stayed here on the 29/12/2015 for a three night stay with my Wife ,Daughter and her Boyfriend over new year, room was very nice good shower ,ironing board and iron provided safe in wardrobe which was free. breakfast is served until 11 am and is very good a full English is provided as well as cereals and pastries and cakes ,tea and coffee as well as fruit juices are also provided . There is a bar in the hotel and drink prices are reasonable. We ate our evening meal there on new years eve prior to going into the city centre and it was very good service was first class . The staff at the Hotel are all very friendly from the reception   ,cleaners to the staff who work in the restaurant nothing is to much trouble for them . The hotel is located near the Aviva stadium the dart railway is a 5 minute walk away and it is 3 stops into the city centre a taxi is between 12 and 15 euros. Dublin has a lot going for it a wealth of history and temple bar for a few beers of a night the only downside it is very expensive so be prepared for your bank balance to take a hammering.",5,2016,01,10
247,Good hotel in a quiet area,"Touring Ireland by car we enjoyed the spacious and free car park of the hotel. Rooms were not too big but clean, quiet and comfortable. For breakfast you can order either full irish or continental, but actually it is buffet style and self service. The hotel seems to be popular with tour groups, which sometimes might occupy the whole breakfast room. We didn't find any pub or restaurant really near to the hotel but it didn't matter as we usually went to downtown Dublín, either by local train or by car. For a group of five using the local train was quite expensive and on Sundays or Holidays parking in the city centre of Dublín is not a major problem and free.",4,2016,01,10
247,Great every time,"This is my regular hotel when I stay in the area, the staff are always cheerful and accommodating, there is always plenty of parking and check in is so easy. It is a great location and the hotel food is always enjoyable.",4,2016,01,04
247,Birthday celebration,"First time to stay here with a group of friends from cork. Great time, amazing staff , comfortable rooms. Ample free car parking. We had dinner in the bar, really good and good price. Receptionist pointed us in the direction of sandymount village, well worth the visit. All I can say is it had a warm friendly atmosphere with nice staff and a lovely location . We will be back.",5,2016,01,03
247,Awesome hotel,Very accommodating hotel. Front desk staff very helpful. Happy to get taxis set up for you and help with directions. Rooms are clean and your bed made everyday. Beds are very comfy. Simple but perfect with a bathroom in room. We had a double room with twin beds. Very comfy and clean. 5 min away train station ,5,2016,01,03
247,I love this hotel!,"Myself and my husband stayed here in early December and thoroughly enjoyed. It is in a lovely part of Dublin near The Aviva Stadium in the heart of Ballsbridge yet it feels intimate, is easy to find, has ample parking(no underground parking)....and Daniela on reception made check in and check out very straightforward yet welcoming and professional. Our allocated room 607 was at the front and couldn't have been more comfortable, clean and well positioned. Breakfast is a casual affair with a great array of travellers in a nice dining room full of banter and with plenty of everything to set you up for the day...I would highly recommend this little homely well priced gem and look forward to our next visit well done to you all.",4,2016,01,02
247,best in dublin,"first time in sandymount hotel, and i will make it my new home from home in dublin.
warm welcoming staff, with great local knowledge of the sandymount area.
bar food good and well priced, compared to city centre prices.
i will be back. thank you sandymount hotel.

247,Great hotel,"The hotel was lovely and easy to locate. Staff were very friendly, room was very comfortable and spacious, hotel was clean, nice breakfast. Free wifi and parking which was very handy. overall great service and would definitely return.",4,2015,12,28
247,Family overnight trip to dDublin,"We stayed in A double  and also had a twin room Both rooms were Very comfortable and Clean. The staff were very helpful and friendly ,Breakfast great .Very convenient to Aviva and Ballsbridge.  Dart station is 200 metres from hotel",5,2015,12,23
247,Excellent staff and great value ,Friends of mine stayed here for a recent rugby match and were very impressed. I met them in the hotel for dinner and the staff were very welcoming. I will definitely recommend to friends and family again.,5,2015,12,20
247,"GREAT STAFF , GOOD LOCATION","The Hotel is lovely . Great location, very close to Aviva Stadium , 3D Arena , Dart Station etc. The room was little bit small but nice and clean.Breakfast was good. Food in the bar was delicious ,especially chicken wings and chowder.Staff was nice and very helpful , just one thing was missing , resident bar .... but Beta (polish girl ) was amazing and helped us with everything .Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,12,18
247,Wonderful and enjoyable,"We stay at the Sandymount Hotel regularly for our business and with the comfort of the rooms and free parking it makes it a very comfortable and welcoming place to conduct business. The rooms are clean, warm and well decorated. City Centre is very accessible with the Dart service.",5,2015,12,17
247,Independent hotel on edge of town; not the best welcome,"Standard 3 star hotel/large guest house and fine for a night or two in Dublin, with generally helpful staff, though on arrival with a big group we were very quickly and abruptly told checkin was at 3pm and no rooms available.    In a busy hotel I can appreciate that early checkin might not be available but it was our group that had to suggest to the staff on reception that they could be a bit more helpful with more than 10 of us needing a room or space to quickly change before we all went our for a our Xmas lunch.    

Fortunately the rest of the staff helped out and found a room we could use, as well as giving us rooms as they became available.  

Top tip - don't try getting a taxi back at night by walking out of town towards the hotel as on a weekend there won't be any.  I couldn't get a taxi or Uber for love nor money and my colleagues had the same problem.   Stick to the city centre and put up with the massive queues or pre-book one.    I also mention this as it's a good 15-20 min drive into the city centre.",3,2015,12,13
247,Cozy Hotel,"I had a pleasant stay... The room was nice, clean and silent. The breakfast could have been a little bit better. A coffee machine would be highly recommended. The hotel is located fairly close to a train stop.",4,2015,12,13
247,"Excellent, would stay again ","Check in fine. Reception area lovely and comfortable. Room very clean and beds were nice to sleep in. One double bed and a single bed. 
Bathroom compact but exceptionally clean. Toiletries provided were nice but wouldn't say they were ""luxurious"". Only shampoo, body wash and body lotion. Conditioner would have been good as well. 
Breakfast was standard. Nothing to fault but nothing out of the ordinary. 
Reception staff were extremely helpful and polite. 
Overall a lovely stay, would recommend to others and would return here ourselves. ",5,2015,12,13
247,Christmas Work Party,Lovely venue for our Christmas Party this year. Fantastic value at 35 euro for a mulled wine reception followed by a three course meal and so lovely jazz as entertainment. Staff were great and catered to our every need. Really enjoyable thank you Sandymount Hotel will definately be back.,5,2015,12,12
247,Very welcoming family run establishment,"Located close to the Aviva Stadium and the Dart station, this hotel is away from the hustle of Dublin city - yet very accessible. Fine breakfast offering a variety foods. Staff are very helpful and friendly with an excellent knowledge of Dublin. Situated close to bars and restaurants in Ballsbridge the hotel is very well managed. Work is ongoing through the winter months to upgrade some more rooms. Look forward to staying here again",4,2015,12,11
247,Excellent hotel in a great location ,As a local I frequently recommend this hotel to friends and clients visiting Dublin. It's in a convenient location within walking distance to the city centre. I often meet them in the hotel and the staff are always helpful and accommodating. Recent clients were very happy with their stay. Couldn't recommend more highly. ,5,2015,12,11
247,Excellent hotel,"The hotel is very well located in a quiet leafy area so no traffic nose. 
Everything you need was in the room including bathrobe and slippers☺
Staff were very helpful and friendly. 
Will be staying here again.",5,2015,12,11
247,Great Stay,"Arrived at hotel after a hectic day to be greeted by a receptionist by the name of Beatrice. What a lovely person. Very informative and friendly. I have stayed previously at the hotel, however, I am very impressed with the refurbished bedroom I stayed in. Can't understand why the hotel is not 4 star! Looking forward to my next stay.",4,2015,12,10
247,A most memorable stay!,"Having stayed at this hotel before we decided that we were due a trip back, this time including family. On entering the hotel I was greeted by a really welcoming lady at reception who showed me to a seat whilst awaiting my family's arrival, my son who is 7 ran to greet me and the receptionist called Beatrice (I made a point of remembering her name after extending my son such a welcome) quickly greeted my son with monkey nuts and sweets seeing as it was Halloween weekend! She gave him a colouring pack and asked him about school. My husband on arriving in to see our son chatting away to the receptionist was delighted to see such a friendly face after his car breaking down on the journey there. Beatrice quickly booked us a taxi for our restaurant and rang us when it arrived. She bade us good night as we left for dinner which instantly cheered us up! Hotel was warm and welcoming and the staff make this hotel something special. We will visit again soon! The only negative point if pressed for one was when we arrived in at 12.15 we were refused access to the bar for a night cap, when I asked the closing time he said - the barman - it was now. When I returned to my room I saw that closing time was not yet over until 12.30. But seeing as Beatrice was so lovely I'm overlooking this!!!",5,2015,12,10
247,Friendly welcome and clean Green Hotel,"Hi 
Stayed at hotel last week. 
Staff were very helpful on my arrival and a pleasure to meet after a long days travel 
Also impressed with the service at breakfast and at reception any time I needed help .
Room was clean and very tidy. 
I was quite impressed with the Green efforts of the hotel and their active initiatives to continually reduce their carbon footprint . 
Look forward to visiting again in the New Year.",4,2015,12,08
247,Home away from home,"Great location practically around the corner from the Aviva Stadium. The DART-station there gives you access to Dublin City Centre and the Dublin Bay Area, so you easily get to see more than just buildings. In other words: you can easily go for a stroll by the sea. The hotel itself offers a very welcoming atmosphere and great breakfast. The only aspect on the downside was that our ensuite bathroom needed a renovation but on the upside the hotel was working on that. In short I can strongly recommend the Sandymount Hotel.",4,2015,12,06
247,Worst Hotel ever,"Hello,

I am coming from very poor country, from Bosnia and Herzegovina, but even for my standard it is below any criteria. I slept in many hotels in Bosnia, but each one was far better than Sandy mount. It is surprised how such place can have license to run hotel business. Hope one day inspection will visit it.

There is many thing I did not liked, like poor breakfast, no meet expect pork whatsoever, so I can tell that Hotel is not friendly to Jewish, Muslim, and any other non eating pork people.

Rugs older than 30 years looks so dirty.

It was leaking from the roof in my room, room, by the way is not on the last floor.

Only positive was nice and helpful stuff, which makes this miserable easier to survive.

Cheers!

Haris",1,2015,12,03
247,"Great hotel, good amenities in room, good breakfast!","Stayed here for one night as we were attending a concert at the 3 Arena.  Great location for this purpose.  We were made to feel very welcome and were pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail given at reception (we were asked whether we wanted to book a shuttle to the arena later that evening).  Complimentary papers at reception was a nice touch too.  Hotel was delightfully decorated for Christmas.

The room was small but more than adequate for purpose.  Good tea/coffee making facilities.  Very clean and tidy bathroom with complimentary toiletires.  Hairdryer, iron and towelling robes provided.  There was a safe in the room too.

Breakfast was included in our rate and was served from 7-11 which was great for us with our late awakening after the concert.  Good spread including cereals, toast, pastries alongwith the ususal hot food.  I was especially glad to see almond milk on offer too.

All in all, very pleased with our stay.",5,2015,12,01
247,Good location for Dublin,"Well positioned in a quiet location, well connected to the city centre through the nearby DART station (local railway, 5 min walk from the hotel). Nice bar and restaurant.

Only 2 negative points:
- breakfast is quite expensive (8€ continental, 12€ irish style) and there are no coffee houses nearby
- really small twin bed ",4,2015,11,30
247,First time staying,"Recently stayed here with my partner for one night. Very close to the Aviva Stadium & the Dart station. The rooms were clean & modern.

Just a few negatives the hot breakfast was luke warm to cold, the bar menu on the hotels website & in the room is very different to what they actually have in the bar. Finally one of the accommodation staff came into the room at 9.30am when we were getting changed which we found very off putting. She did knock once but came straight in. I understand that it is quite a large hotel with a lot of rooms to service, but coming into a room two and a half hours before check out is a bit much.",3,2015,11,29
247,"Nice enough, location not great","Hotel itself is actually pretty nice, rooms are very clean and bathrooms are lovely. If you were staying here to go to a match at the Aviva stadium the location couldn't be better, however wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you are here to go round Dublin city centre, bit of a pain getting around. Reception staff are very nice. Hotel bar food isn't cheap but it does taste good, only thing is service wasn't very organised, we had dirty plates left on our table for ages with staff just wandering round. Overall it isn't a bad hotel, we just found that the location wasn't ideal for city centre.",3,2015,11,27
247,Nice weekend Dublin.,"Very Nice room, good breakfast. Very friendly staff. Very close to trainstation, easy acces to the  Citycentre. Nice trips to Guinness Storehouse. Take a walk with the free walk city Tour with Richie. Very good!",4,2015,11,25
247,Quite a pleasant stay,"A little out of main Dublin. Rooms are good size. The shower was great, spacious with good water pressure. Sits in between two little villages with amenities. Bars, restaurants, supermarkets. Sandy mount has a nice bar and restaurant attached as well. It's close to the 3arena should you be in town for a concert. It's also quite close to a DART stop and the bus system drops you close by as well. Their pillows are a little thin and uncomfortable. That would be my only complaint. I would stay here again for sure. The front desk staff's help was top notch. ",4,2015,11,22
247,Amazing staff and amazing hotel ,"The staff at the sandymount are amazing.We arrived just after 6am on 16/11/15 and they found us rooms straight away so my 2 year old son could rest.Thank you so much!Brogan has a fantastic time in his 'new house'and didn't want to leave!We have been staying at the hotel for the last 11 years and the staff have always been helpful and friendly.
If I could have given you more that 5 stars I would have done.We can't wait to come back in June.

",5,2015,11,21
247,Hotel,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff, room was great with really friendly staff.  Very clean excellent price and breakfast was really good.  Close to the dart for Dublin City.  Half the price of hotels in Dublin City.",5,2015,11,20
247,Dated and over rated. Good staff make up for tired edges.,"Business trip here - OK but, really? I have known about this hotel for years and had always wondered what the appeal is. As a location, good for the Aviva arena, and the Dart into town, food OK..otherwise, a somewhat tired and peeling at the edges hotel. The bedroom was basic, food OK..noisy floorboards, annoying ..cant really say much more. Room was clearly a coal cupboard under the stairs in a previous life, now a small window looking out onto the wheels of a car..",3,2015,11,18
247,"Great Service, Great Experience!","I have visited the Sandymount Hotel many times and am always struck by the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to do everything in their power to make my stay a happy one. In particular, Emma, Dympna, Jack and Lee provide exceptional service.The location, food and all the facilities are excellent and I would recommend the hotel to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced hotel in Dublin",5,2015,11,18
247,Business Trip,"Good location near to the RDS. Comfortable clean room, but not very sound proof.   Restaurant was nice, food was good. Friendly Staff.  Easy check in and out. Free wifi was a bonus. Would come back again.",4,2015,11,17
247,Excellent staff service,"Arrived to a really warm reception, check in was quick and easy.  Our room was one of the newly renovated with a beautiful bathroom.  Can't fault staff, service, food and bar. We were working at the RDS for 5 days and in the end we only ate out of the hotel once as the food was so good.  We checked out Sunday morning and asked for a taxi to take us to RDS as it was raining, one of the staff then took us in the hotel bus to the RDS without any charge, what more could you ask for.  Would recommend and will be going back again.",4,2015,11,17
247,Good value and clean,"Stayed for a 2 night break and does exactly what it says on tin. Rooms are clean, compact and well equipped. The only thing is that the walls are a little thin and you could hear doors slamming and other rowdy residents returning after a few too many drinks! Breakfast is OK but would probably recommend holding of for a local cafe serving fresher, local, better value food as the sausages and bacon didn't seem to be of the highest quality, but there was plenty of it!",4,2015,11,17
247,Woken early because of renovation work!!,"Any hotel that is doing renovation work really needs to handle it properly i.e. informing guests that work is being carried out, preferably before checking in or when booking. Also guests should be allocated in rooms away from the work.

 This did not happen for our stay; we only found out when we saw corridors blocked off after checking in. We were also woken the following morning at 7.30am by loud drilling and persistent hammering!! After calling reception I was told that the workers should not have started until 8.30am and was told the noise would stop but it didn't. The receptionist did apologise and offered a complimentary breakfast.

Otherwise the hotel is clean and pleasantly decorated. Breakfast was the usual hotel fare but of a good standard and the restaurant was clean. Generally staff (particularly at breakfast) were friendly and efficient, apart from a girl behind the bar who I found to be rude and curt. ",2,2015,11,17
247,Convient location,"The hotel is situated very close to the Aviva and Dart which is exactly what we needed. The hotel itself has a nice dining area and lovely choice of breakfast. The room we were situated in did feel like a maze to get to and we didn't have much of a view as it was directly across from another room which meant keeping the curtains closed for privacy when lights were on. We both found the room to be very warm, even when we had turned off the main radiator, it was still an uncomfortable heat. The morning we were checking out, we looked forward to our lie in but unfortunately there was a lot of hammering (at a guess) going on within the hotel which began around 8.30am. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly especially in guiding us to nearest shop, as it is a bit of a walk away. Would recommend for anyone looking to stay close to the Aviva",3,2015,11,15
247,Average hotel with poor service,"I stayed here recently with work colleagues, on arrival the check in was extremely slow I then went to the bar and was charging to my room however there systems were not set up right and I had to pay cash after a long wait, rooms were average with extremely small bathroom, I won't be returning",2,2015,11,15
247,COMFORT AND CONVIENENCE,"A very warm greeting at reception when you first arrive , gives you a great first impression and this will last throughout your stay. This multi level hotel has a maze of corridors leading to the rooms , but when reached, are warm and tastefully decorated to the highest standard, in a compact form. If its a sound sleep your after , the soundproofing is the best ever experienced , not a sound from the outside world. Breakfast is substantial , and freshly topped up buffet , with loads of seating . The other bonus is on site car parking particularly as it right beside luas stop, Aviva Stadium or a comfortable 20min walk to city centre.",5,2015,11,15
247,Great spot! ,"I've stayed in this hotel a few times and I can't fault it. The staff are friendly, it's in a good location and It's reasonably priced. I would choose this hotel over the extortionate prices of a city centre hotel. There are a few nice restaurants and bars nearby and it's right beside the Aviva and not to far from the Three Arena. 👍",5,2015,11,13
247,Very accomodating - would deffo return,"As an exiled Dub, returning for the first time in a while, with friends, I was looking for a good location, reasonably priced, with a decent standard of provision, and at the Sandymount Hotel we got that in bucket loads.

We arrived earlier than expected having cleared airport formalities very easily at the new Terminal 2 and the hotel were extremely accomodating, searching out 2 made-up ready rooms for us close to each other. The rooms were very well provisioned although I understand where other reviewers have said they are small. Both rooms had a double and a single and if the single wasn't there, there would have been loads of space, but as it was space was a little tight. In the bathroom the toilet was a little close to the wall when there was plenty of space on the other side. It seemed strange although not something the hotel can alter very easily.

The toiletries were in the cupboard under the sink which is a little hidden, but were good quality and plentiful. I wasn't enamoured by the shower head which was a little to direct for my liking. I would have preferred larger towels and more of them, but didn't request this from reception as we had a busy weekend and it wasn't a show stopper.

The bed was very comfortable and the room blacked out very well so I slept well. 

Breakfast was typically fully featured comprising Irish (with black AND white pudding), continental, fruit, juices, breads, cheese and ham for the continentals, and pots and pots of tea and coffee served at your tables by plentiful pleasant, helpful and capable restaurant staff. 

We didn't eat in the hotel other than breakfast but the bar restaurant was very busy each evening and the food looked very good and was popular. Bar prices were very reasonable for a D4 hotel.

Location - this was one of the key points for me. Not in the centre is a bit of an issue, but 5 mins from the DART station with access to the city centre (10 mins) and points north as well as Dun Laoighaire (15 mins) and points south. The Aviva Stadium looms high to the west so I'm sure the hotel is very busy on rugby and soccer weekends. Taxis were swift to arrive when booked thro reception.

The reception (and other) staff were always very helpful, friendly and polite. Nothing was too much trouble.

A very enjoyable stay and I would deffo return here next time in Dublin.",4,2015,11,06
247,Very helpful staff & friendly,Stayed here recently whilst in Dublin for marathon. Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Printed out marathon confirmation. Menu had 5 pasta dishes- pre-marathon! They also had rooms for post marathoners to have shower following event. ,5,2015,11,06
247,amazing  service as always !!! beautifully decorated bed rooms  and breakfast to die for !!,"i have recently stayed at this lovely family run hotel  ,it has been a long time since i last stayed here as it was then known as the ""mount herbert hotel "" ,i was delighted to find that it was still run by the original founder family of the hotel approaching its 60th year in business and still the same family at the helm..the lovely lady at reception (who has been there since the 80s )couldnt do enough for us and sean drove us by the courtesy bus to our evening location as the pre ordered taxi didnt make it in time ,breakfast was 1 st class ,as good or even better than most 5 star hotels ive stayed in the past...all the resturant staff were delightfully friendly and helpful  and it was no bother to prepare for us 3 fussy ladies poached eggs to order ..on exiting the hotel we managed to get slightly lost but seeing that we were a little confused ,the owner was able to point us in the right direction but not before taking at least 15mins to satnd a happily chat to us ,,,A wonderful expierience and i definitely shall return the next time i am in TOWN !! thank you again to all the sandymount staff for such a wonderful experience x",5,2015,11,05
247,Amazing,"This place had it all. It was our first introduction to Irish cuisine and we were NOT disappointed! 
The staff was so friendly and accommodating - gave really great tips and directions for what to do around town. Driving in Dublin is a bit of a nightmare - and this hotel is so close to the subway that we left the car parked and explored without having to worry. 
Everything was spotlessly clean and quiet. Highly recommended!  ",5,2015,11,04
247,Relaxing stay,"Just returned from a lovely overnight stay at the Sandymount Hotel. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome by all the staff. Nice modern decor in a cosy but bright room. Enjoyed a delicious meal and bottle of wine which was included in our Overnight Indulgence great value deal.Breakfast also great. Good location close to dart station, Aviva Stadium and Sandymount strand. Can't wait to make return visit!",5,2015,11,03
247,Great hotel,"This is a very nice hotel. Comfortable room, pleasant staff, very tasty food from the bar and a decent breakfast.
The only problem was staying for 2 nights and on both mornings there was no hot water so had to endure cold showers.
Would love to stay here again but would have to make sure that the hot water is on

",4,2015,11,02
247,Wedding anniversary ,"Fantastic hotel and fantastic staff a credit to the family owners 
We stayed two nights and loved every moment of it Dublin is some city and we would highly recommend the Sandymount Hotel which is right beside the Aviva Stadium and the Dart railway station 

We hopefully be back next year ",5,2015,11,01
247,Happy days in Dublin,"I love this Hotel, right next to the Aviva Stadium, friendly reception staff, clean rooms, child friendly, Well worth a visit.
Great value for money, love the hotel bar, and the ""dart"" (train/tube) just around the corner for easy access to Dublin city centre.
      ",5,2015,10,31
247,Great stay,A lovely warm welcome in this very comfortable family run hotel. Very good location close to dart and the city yet very quiet neighbourhood. Good breakfast selection and great service will definitely stay again.,5,2015,10,29
247,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed here for a convention. It was greatly located near the Aviva Stadium where the conventions was held. Great hospitality, we were able to check in early, which was incredulity helpful due to overnight travel. Staff welcomed us and helped us with maps and locations of great food. Always met us with a smile every morning. Rooms were great, perfect for what we needed. Enjoyed the quietness of them. Would stay here again!!!",5,2015,10,25
247,nice spot,"nice spot, not a lot to eat nearby, but a few things within a reasonable walking distance.  The hotel staff were friendly and helpful- one lady helped us out of a bind in booking a train for a later  part of our trip.  Very transit accessible to the rest of the city and nearer to the tourist destinations.  Cheap(ish) cab ride to the hotel ~25 euro.  Seems reasonably easy to do by bus, but we were leaving early in the morning.",4,2015,10,21
247,A 5 day break in Dublin,"Excellent hotel with very friendly staff. Great local knowledge and nothing was too much trouble. Location of hotel great for access to the DART railway and for the Aviva rugby stadium. 10 minutes walking distance to Sandymount village which has all sorts of facilities around an attractive green.
Hotel room was clean, bathroom too. Only downside was intermittent internet.
Would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,10,21
247,3 NIGHT STAY,"Overall a nice hotel in great location. Plenty car parking space. Staff excellent. B.fast ...good selection.
Value for money...excellent.
Nice Bar....seating service. 
Yes .....would recommend this hotel in dublin 4.",4,2015,10,20
247,Nice rooms in a quiet area. Easy to reach city centre.,"Nice big rooms, clean and orderly, quiet area without traffic or other noise. Good service all the way from check-in to check-out.
Very short walk to DART train station three stops from city centre. 
No cafés, restaurants or shops close by, except the bar in the hotel, but an area with a few pubs and restaurants a 15 minutes walk away.",4,2015,10,16
247,"Five Days at Sandymount, in Dublin, to know nice  people 😳 (green) !","The Sandymount Hotel is quiet and not expensive place. We did take the Aircoach bus from Airport and we had to walk a lot with luggages because it stoped many blocks away! The taxi drive to Airport costs the same. The Hotel is near (100m) the DART- Dublin Area Rapid Transit- train station, so it is easy to come and go downtown.
The parking was free.The breakfast was ok.  The room was small and the open-close doors was noisy.
The hotel is some blocks from Sandymount District, where we found nice Italian restaurant and pubs.",3,2015,10,14
247,Very welcoming,Room very calming and exceptionally clean.  Bathroom was nice and bright and good shower.  Nice bar and good pub food with friendly staff.   Plenty of seating outside of the bar and restaurant area which was very comfortable and quiet.,5,2015,10,14
247,As lovely a stay as always,"Sandymount Hotel is a family run hotel and ever popular because of its location.  The staff are always very friendly and efficient.  A warm welcome greets you.  Perfectly placed for the Aviva Stadium for rugby fans (5 mins walk) and the Dart (5 mins walk) to get into the city.  A 15 min walk max will take you down to The Strand where you can take a brisk walk along the beach - 10 minutes walk to Sandymount Village where you will find a few restaurants - so Sandymount Hotel is perfectly placed.

Always have such a lovely stay at the hotel where everyone is so friendly and welcoming.",5,2015,10,14
247,So and so,"Yes, I have stayed here for three nights and I want to tell you pro and contra reasons to choose this hotel.
Negative arguments:

- very far away from city center especially on week end days, darts circulates at each 40 minutes,
- chemicals smells in toilet,
- very basic room,
- poor breakfast, no sweets.

Pozitive args:
- very good customer service, especially Remus, clearly explaining city sightseeings
- good price vs city's other hotels,
- express check in.",3,2015,10,13
247,Nice hotel in a lovely area,"We enjoyed our stay in the Sandymount hotel. Friendly and helpful staff, nice and cosy room. The area is calm and quiet and you can take the hop-on hop-off bus nearby. The perfect end of the summer. Next time I'll go to Dublin I'll certainly book again. ",5,2015,10,13
247,A lovely hotel,"The hotel is located near the Aviva Stadium, close to the DART station.  You can get to and from the hotel from the airport by using the Aircoach for €16 roundtrip. A taxi to/fron the airport is around €30. We were able to check into the hotel early. The hotel was clean and comfortable. Throughout the week the staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful! They made sure we were taken care of in anyway they could. My only complaint is that the walls are thin but that is the case in most European hotels. I would stay here again.",4,2015,10,12
247,Good Value and Location,"This was my first stay at the Sandymount Hotel, although I have stayed in the same place when it was called the Mount Herbert, albeit still under the same ownership. That said the room was comfortable and the housekeeping staff were amazingly efficient. The bathroom did lack large bath towels.
The hotel is ideally located literally a stones throw from the Aviva Stadium and likewise the DART. 
The hotel did get busier during for the football, however that was enjoyable.
Generally the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, giving excellent tips for the traveller when it came to obtaining a taxi after the match.
Would consider this hotel again. Thank you all.",4,2015,10,12
247,One night stop,"We checked in at the end of our weeks Ireland tour, the hotel has a good central location, almost next door to the Aviva Stadium. The bar area is very good, and they have a number of informal guest areas. The hotel is a bit of a rabbit warren, however when we found our room, it was not huge but adeqaute, comfortable bed, decent bathroom. The dining room is fresh and comtemporary, and the steaks we ordered were great. The staff were very helpful, we met with friends and family in the evening and found one of the private areas just away from the bar, perfect. This is our fifth differant Dublin Hotel, and we would use it again.",4,2015,10,12
247,Excellent hotel in lovely Dublin suburb walking distance to centre of town,"Stayed here as part of a 5 man group celebrating our 50th birthdays.
Hotel is situated about 35-40mins walk from the popular tourist center of town like Temple bar etc. and next to Aviva stadium.
There are good local public transport options if you don’t want to walk but the walk is pleasant and very safe with section along the canal.
Hotel situated in a very nice suburb of Dublin city – village of Sandymount ~10mins walk from hotel with pubs, shops, etc.
We had two triple rooms both of which were a good size, well-appointed and very clean.
Hotel has plenty of public areas, a nice bar and breakfast room. 
There is free decent quality Wi-Fi throughout the hotel.
Our rate included a good quality full Irish breakfast with continental options too.
All the staff at the hotel were very helpful and pleasant, as were the folks of Dublin in general.
A taxi from the airport (large 7-seaters) cost us ~ 35-40€ one way.
Dublin itself is a great city for a weekend break – I can recommend O’Neil’s next to main tourist info center (old church),
The Temple Bar for great traditional & modern music, and Oliver St. John Gogarty's bar too name a few. The Guinness Storehouse
is also good for a while learning how the “black stuff” is made before sampling it with 360’ views of Dublin in the sky bar. 
All in all we had a great time in Dublin and I would highly recommend this hotel if you want good service in a nice environment but don’t mind not being smack in the city center.",5,2015,10,12
247,Acceptably average,"The hotel is located near the Aviva stadium, and is easily accessed by a 5 minute train journey from the city centre,  the train service is frequent and the station (Lansdowne) is a mere 5 minute walk from the hotel.  To walk from the city centre Took me 30 minutes.  The hotel is situated in a quiet, and picturesque residential area. 

The hotel seemed busy when I arrived, and check-in was efficient if unwelcoming.  My room was acceptable there was a double and single bed.  Tea/coffee facilities, a (broken) safe, iron and board.  Bathroom had shaver sockets, bath/shower (with good pressure) and plenty of space to set things down.The hotel also has free wifi, and the signal was good in my room.  Unfortunately the walls were paper thin, and noise from the adjecent rooms was very audible in my room, - people talking and using their bathrooms! 

Breakfast was Average, I don't eat cooked breakfasts so I can't comment on this but I noticed a counter with bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage and tomatoes.  There was also cereals and a choice of cows milk or soya.  juices, tea and coffee.  The staff at breakfast were warm and helpful. 

I was Checked out by the same person who checked me in, it was quick and awkwardly  unfriendly - he asked me if everything was okay as I was walking out the door! 

I stayed in the hotel as I was on business, and was convenient to the centre - and the hotel served its purpose - some place (spotlessly) clean and comfortable to stay.......but It lacked character and charm, and was therefore unimpressionable.  I would stay here again if I could not find an alternative.",3,2015,10,11
247,The Quiet Man,"Catering to corporate accounts here...long hallway boutique property gets ""foreign language loud""...professional youthfully exuberant staff ...catering to a business whining and regular community event clientele...From airport take Bus #41 to Collins Ave & transfer to Bus #1 Sandymount $6€...Bus Drivers will help get you off to the hotel a short walk...Visit in town small store Tesco their ATM takes M.C. and Cirrus ""Yank"" for Extra Euro's ...Train ""The Dart"" To explore an EZ5 minute stroll...Recommend Howth for daily fresh caught cod emporiums and very seaside Summit pathways...Have a pint at Gaffney's before hand...This is a beautiful suburban area with students, residents and friendly owners of dogs in paths and parks...Sandymount Hotel staff is tops especially the cleaning troupe...Scrubbing the bricks outside from the overly perfumed eurosmokers nastiness cig butts...Godbless and visit here without hesitation ...",3,2015,10,11
247,Clean and Comfortable,"My wife and I spent two nights at Sandymount Hotel in Dublin during September and really enjoyed our stay. We found the staff to be very courteous and  helpful. The room was clean,  just quite smaller than we are accustomed to in the U.S, but we would not hesitate to stay there again. In fact, should we visit Dublin in the future, Sandymount would definitely be one of our choices.

247,Welcome free car park,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights last week and enjoyed our trip to Dublin.Very easy to get to if using the ferry(10-15 mins) ideally situated for the Aviva Stadium And only a few minutes walk to the DART railway station (3 stops to town)
The hotel itself was clean and comfortable and staff excellent and the breakfast delicious,but as this is a review site i would just like to mention a couple of points.There was no large bath towels (even Travelodge supply these) and not an ideal place for anyone with limited mobility due to lots of steps and a warren of corridors and coded lifts.We encountered quite a few guests wandering around looking for the right lift.but all in all a nice place to stay",4,2015,10,10
247,another lovely stay at the Sandymount Hotel,"I have used ( and recommended) this hotel for years. I have always found it very reasonably priced, a quiet location ( but very handy for the city centre) with excellent, friendly and efficient staff. I would unhesitatingly use it on every visit to ""Dublin's Fair City""",5,2015,10,10
247,Short break away.,"The hotel is very nice, our room was large, comfortable and well furnished. The room and bathroom were both very clean. The bed was comfortable and warm. The breakfast was excellent and had a wide variety of hot and cold food. The bar food was very good and were large portions plus you could eat in the restaurant  . The staff were professional and efficient but I feel they could be a little more friendly.  Quiet area, near train station 3 stops into Dublin.  No restaurants near the hotel, nearest in Sandymount village 15 minute walk away.",4,2015,10,09
247,Sandymount Hotel,I recently spent 3 weeks in Dublin and during this time I spent 12 nights in the Sandymount Hotel. I found the hotel excellent in every respect - from very friendly helpful staff to extremely comfortable well equipped bedrooms. I loved the informality of the Lineout Bar in the evenings for food which was first class.,5,2015,10,09
247,An excellent hotel offering great value for money,"The Sandymount is small enough to feel family-run but large enough to be able to offer the level of service that you would expect.  The staff are excellent -friendly, efficient and proactive.  Rooms are all different but with a high level of comfort and cleanliness.  All this from a hotel within a 3 minute walk of the Aviva Stadium, 10 minutes from the RDS and 5 minutes from the Dart, which will have you in the centre of the city in 15 minutes.  Very highly recommended.",4,2015,10,09
247,"Clean, friendly","My husband and I stayed in a double.the rim had a double bed and a twin, which was a little weird. It was very clean, we had a flat screen tv, and it is close to the dart. Breakfast in the morning was a delicious buffet.",5,2015,10,07
247,Great Value For Money,"Visited for a couple of nights at the back end of September- Price was too good to turn down at around £60 pounds a night!

Conveniently located 5 minutes in a taxi from the city centre, and only 2 minutes walk from Landsdowne Road Dart Station (3 stops from the city centre)

Helpful staff, and a well equipped, clean room. Would definitely visit again, thanks very much!",5,2015,10,07

247,A great place to stay,"Myself and a group of 9 other lads were booked into the Sandymount Hotel between 1st and 5th October 2015.  Right from our arrival, the staff and manager (I didn't catch his name) were fabulous.  They were great fun in the bar having a bit of 'craic' with us all and also advising us on the best 'hostelries' to visit in the area and in the City.  The rooms were very clean and the food was excellent.  The location of the hotel is perfect if you are going to the Lansdowne Road Football stadium but the DART railway link is just around the corner too.
A great stay and thoroughly recommended - I look forward to staying there in the future with my wife.
Thank you again to all the team at the Sandymount!!",5,2015,10,05
247,Great hotel at great location!!!!,Very nice hotel at great location. I had 5 day stay at this hotel .Very supporting and polite staff.

Room I stayed was small but they have better rooms as per your budget .Its better to take bigger room .But very memorable stay,4,2015,10,05
247,Perfect,My wife and I recently stayed 3 nights at Sandymount hotel on our honeymoon. The staff was excellent. Very helpful and polite. We were able to checkin early as our flight landed at 7am. They fed us and had us in our room by 1030am. The hotel is perfectly located just outside the city centre. Train station only steps away. Downtown in moments. The village of Sandymount also has its own quite and delightful pubs. I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff location and cleanliness was top notch. I will be back.,5,2015,10,04
247,Great and friendly place to spend time,"Spent a night staying at the Sandymount in advance of attending a travel seminar aimed at independent hotels in Ireland. Suffice to say the Sandymount is a fantastic hotel and is a credit to the Irish market! I was made to feel completely welcome - the room was great, the location superb, the bar and food lovely and best of all the staff - especially on reception were fantastic. You can tell the staff and owners are proud of the hotel and they should be.",5,2015,10,04
247,A family run hotel ~ with a family of staff who care for their guests,"Set in the beautiful superb of Sandymount, close to Dublin city centre, it ozzzes the old world charm of the original houses, while tastefully decorated suitable for the needs of today`s guests. It is apparent from when one first arrives in reception that there is a mutual appreciation and respect between the owners and staff, and the same is notable throughout the hotel. There are adequate parking facilities, free to guests, on ground level to the hotel. The rooms are comfortable and immaculately clean, with all necessary requirements, room service was efficient and friendly, the bar staff obliging, friendly and accommodating too, and the buffet breakfast was just delicious, with so much to choose from - for €12 you could eat all you wanted, enough to keep you going for the whole day, unless that is you had time to retire for a nap back in the comfy bed! I would have no hesitation in recommending the Sandymount Hotel for it`s convenient location, ease of parking, comfortable rooms, good food, competitive pricing and most of all a team of staff that make every effort to offer the best service.

247,Sandymount Hotel,"A great hotel in a quiet location, and easy walking distance to Grand Canal area and City Centre. Reception and bar staff were all very efficient and helpful and the room comfortable and well equiped.",4,2015,10,02
247,Cozy with comfort,"Situated near the heart of the city, this hotel offers the convenience of short walk to the beach, park, transportation and the city centre. Breakfast on site was satisfactory, the staff are all too eager to assist - they make you feel at home. 
Restaurant serves excellent meals and the hours of operation is very convenient for the guest. Clean and accommodating - watch your step as you transition throughout due to connecting steps or ramps.  The bedroom was satisfactory except that the bed itself was way too soft - find it difficult to relax in.  Overall, the price and amenities coupled with the staff services made it quite pleasant.",4,2015,09,30
247,Old but good,"We spent three nights in a family room. Beds were comfortable, the room was clean, rather far from the reception and very quiet. We appreciated the kettle with good choice of tea and coffee bags. Reception staff very professional and efficient.

Price a bit too high. Bathroom too old, and lack of shelves.",4,2015,09,30
247,A wonderful hotel in every way,"We stayed here for one night, and on check in we were upgraded to an executive suite, which was a lovely surprise.  From the moment we entered the reception area, the warmth and friendliness throughout our stay was really genuine.  The receptionist took an interest in everything and gave us a great recommendation for a nearby restaurant for evening meal.
The bedroom  was very large, with a really comfortable king size bed, really exceptionally good bed linen too.  Tea and coffee facilities in the bedroom too.  Free parking is a great bonus at the location which is very good for nearby Sandymount beach.  Free newspapers were also available, breakfast had a good selection of everything, with a gluten free option also available.
Value for money is good, and overall it was a memorable stay.  Well done to all the team.",5,2015,09,29
247,An Excellent Frienly Hotel,"Such a nice change to stay in such friendly family owned hotel, every member of staff could not do enough to make my time there enjoyable, everyone from the Gardner to the manager. If i had to single anyone out it would be Blue, the mini bus driver who made my journeys a real adventure.
I could not fault my room, and the restaurant and bar equally.
It location, next to the Aviva Stadium (Lansdown Road) (Shame there ware no games on while i was there) and close to the DART station  to get into town, or just an easy walk to Sandymount Village or to Ballsbridge. 
This was a business trip but would happily take the family there for a city break.",5,2015,09,28
247,Short stay,We stayed 2 nights and were impressed by the high quality in every respect.  Also the hop-on hop-off tour bus stopped at the hotel at 9 a.m. For the return in the evening it was easy to use the DART train as the station was only ma few minutes walk from the hotel.,4,2015,09,25
247,Fresh and modern,"Had another stay at the sandymount and had the luxury of staying in one of there newly referred rooms. Finished to a really nice standerd  and as always the staff where helpful, friendly and always greeting with a warm welcome. Thanks sandymount.",5,2015,09,25
247,Mattresses worn so uncomfortable sleep,"We stayed only one night mid September to catch an early flight.  The room was fairly small, two single beds.  The mattress on one of the beds was lopsided.  The other bed was tipped backwards due to a very uneven floor.  The bathroom was modern and clean. All essentials were provided.",2,2015,09,24
247,Great couple of days,"Stayed here when it was the Mount Herbert, and was very pleased to find on our return that we got the same friendly reception and service as before.  We were very pleased with the value and taste of the steak special on one of the nights we dined in the hotel.  Breakfast was also outstanding. Looking forward to returning for our next ""wee break""",5,2015,09,24
247,Please do stay here ,"We were in Dublin this year for 2 nights and had the pleasure of staying here.  The staff are so friendly and helpful. I would say that the hotel is not close to the city centre it took us 24 minutes to walk to Trinity College, but the town of Sandymount is lovely to visit if you have the time.  

The breakfast served is hot and delicious the best we've had in Ireland. The servers are attentive to your needs during breakfast and the sinking area is clean.

The room we were in was small but clean and quiet.  Not he greatest view but no complaints from me.  You will get a good nights sleep here. 

The DART is near by but we did not use it. We took taxis to he city centre costing about €10-15 euro (if you split it €6). ",4,2015,09,21
247,Charming hotel,"Really nice little hotel just a walk or bus ride away from shopping and restaurants in the Dublin town center.   Staff was very friendly and helpful.  They were kind enough to check us in early so we could sleep off the jet lag.  Blue, the shuttle bus driver, was the best.  He gave us directions to the sights and even loaned us an umbrella.
",4,2015,09,19
247,Nice place with friendly staff,"This is my first time to stay at the Sandymount Hotel, and I have to say it will not be my last,
 I was blown away by the warm welcome, information on the local area, transportation etc. I did not have dinner, but breakfast was amazing. The tour bus picked us up in front of the hotel and it was really good. They have secure parking, and we were able to leave our car there even after check out. 
We stayed here with friends from overseas and they were very happy also.
I will be back for sure.",5,2015,09,16
247,Back again,"we are 4 golfers and go racing from England , the hotels location is perfect for everything, what makes this hotel different is friendly staff and quality of service in all areas, I would like to thank Beatrice on the reception again for looking after us ' very professional members of staff, big thanks for Brendan and the boys , we will be back again next year again and can't wait.",5,2015,09,16
247,Brilliant!,"Excellent Hotel, Great food, free wifi close to public amenities very helpfull staff. No request to much for the staff. Free parking is a great bonus as well. I would absolutely recommend this family run hotel.",5,2015,09,15
247,great location.,Stayed a night for a concert at 3arena. Great location and a nice walk along the canal to get to and from concert. Room was very comfortable and staff very helpful regarding getting around the area and Dublin city. Great barfood too.,4,2015,09,15
247,Sandymount hotel,"Great hotel great location staff very friendly and helpful 
      Fantastic value for money would recommend this hotel  we have been going to this hotel for the last four years and will definitely be going back",5,2015,09,14
247,Good hotel,"Stayed here one night when down in Dublin for meeting. Easy to get too through the port tunnel. We paid an extra €20 for the Premier room and it was worth it, lovely bathroom great shower. Breakfast was substantial and good quality. €15 for taxi into the city centre but the Dart line is also close by.
Will stay here again.",5,2015,09,13
247,Night at the dogs,"Although dated, this is a good hotel, which has everything you could expect, or need, staff are friendly and helpful. Hotel could do with some moderisation, A residents bar would be nice too. Breakfast is wonderful. And room was upraded FOC.",4,2015,09,13
247,Excellent stay!,We got a great deal for this hotel for when the soccer was on in Dublin.  Couldn't believe how close it was to Aviva stadium - brilliant! The rooms were spotless on arrival; nicely decorated. Drinks in the bar were pretty reasonable which was great.  The craic before and after the game in the hotel was second to none! Breakfast the next morning was lovely; great selection.  Staff were very helpful.  Will definitely return to this hotel!,5,2015,09,13
247,Great value for the price ,"Great location, great service on a family run hotel. The oldest one running on Dublin. Rooms are nice. Good cleaning service. Nice reception crew. Food it's good and we'll priced.  Worth coming.  Won't disappoint you.",5,2015,09,13
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Boutique hotel in an excellent location, near the city centre.  Family run so very friendly and helpful staff.  Facilities are average - this is not the Ritz, but it is good value for money.  Don't go during major events such as the Dublin Horse Show as the price increases dramatically at those times.",4,2015,09,12
247,Night and restaurant staff are useless!,"The restaurant started our bad experience. Completely ignored from the start that after 15 minutes I finally went to the bar and asked if we needed to order at the bar and was told someone would be over. Finally after flagging a gal down we were able to put on an order. There were maybe 7 tables and 4 wait staff and apparently a ratio of less than 2 tables per wait staff was too much for them! Additionally, the guy working on the evening of Sept. 11th had such a horrible attitude it left me with a sour taste in my mouth that I will not be eating there again. 

Then as suggested in the guest information book in the room we asked staff for assistance booking a tour, which was responded to by saying ""I don't know I sleep all day and work at night"" yeah really helpful...NOT! Night staff was useless and full of more attitude! 

The room was small, but fine. I guess I value friendly sincere service more and if you do too this is NOT THE PLACE TO STAY! If you like unfriendly and not helpful staff than this is the place for you. I wouldn't stay here again. ",1,2015,09,11
247,On the compact side of small!,"Stayed one night in room 601 - the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in - with the soundproofing qualities of a tent! B&b rate was €159. I'm sure they have much better rooms on offer - but I got this one. 
Room / en suite was clean and bed was comfortable - although it was recessed into the wall to fit in the room.
Evening and lunch food was fine, breakfast was limited. 
Overall rating - not hectic!",2,2015,09,11
247,"Delightful hotel, great location","I found so much to like about the Sandymount Hotel. The location, close to the DART station and in an historic, attractive part of Dublin, was great. It was easy to get into the centre of Dublin or travel down to Dalkey and Bray and I also loved wandering around Sandymount itself. Reception was genuinely welcoming. The room, while quite small, was still close to perfect and so comfortable. And breakfast was all that I was looking for. The quality of the Sandymount Hotel really helped make my stay in Dublin memorable. I'd be very keen to return.",5,2015,09,11
247,First Class Hotel!,"This was my first time staying in the Sandymount Hotel, I highly recommend it!!!!!! 

The Hotel was clean, the food was great and the customer service was fantastic. :)
They made my Mum and I feel so comfortable.  Everybody was so friendly, especially Beatrice. After traveling all night Beatrice checked us in. She welcomed us with a smile and made us feel at home. She is a true asset to the Hotel.  I wish more Hotel's had staff like this!!!
We stayed in a basic twin room, it was very clean and updated.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. The price was very reasonable.  
You can't beat the location, although you have access to a taxi, you are in walking distance from the Bus and the Dart Train.",5,2015,09,09
247,"Great Hotel, Great Location.","We have stayed in the Sandymount Hotel a number of times and have always had a great visit. It is in a great part of the city and being next to the DART, 2 or 3 stops takes you to the city centre. We have always found the staff very helpful, rooms are good, as is the breakfast. We will definitely be back.",5,2015,09,09
247,UP for the Match!,This was a FIRST to stay in the Sandymount and the experience was such a positive one from the moment we entered the hotel (lovely Lady from MAYO!!) greeted us with a smile to the relaxed atmosphere resenating everywhere. The bedroom was excellent with a superbly comfortable bed and a really nice touch was the toothbrush/paste/shaving cream provided. Great location also. So will most definitely be back!,4,2015,09,09
247,Nothing Special,"We have just arrived home after a three night stay at Sandymount hotel. 
We were a little disappointed with the room size, especially as we paid for a premium room. Our room looked  out over the back of the kitchen and we were woken up at 7am by the noise of kitchen staff standing outside chatting , smoking and taking out rubbish etc. This was also an issue in the evening. Our room was very warm meaning that we had to keep our window open, not helping with the noise issue. 
We paid for breakfast on one morning of our stay and we thoroughly enjoyed it, there was lots to choose from. On our second night of the trip we decided to have dinner in the restaurant, big mistake!!! We both chose lasagne, it arrived in minutes after ordering and it had obviously been reheated and lacked any flavour. The staff never once asked how the meal was and our plates sat waiting to be collected for a long time after we had finished. Overall very disappointing.
It has to be said the reception staff are very welcoming and are able to help you with any questions. 
The hotel is located on the outskirts of the city. We used the DART which is a 5 min walk away from the hotel and is 3 stops away from the city. Would recommend getting a leap card for traveling, this covers you on all trams, busses and trains fo 72 hours and costs something like €19. 
Overall we enjoyed our stayed there was just a few aspects that let the standard of the  hotel down.",3,2015,09,09
247,Extremely small rooms!!,"Stayed for one night in the premium double room. Room and bathroom was extremely small and looked nothing like the pictures on booking.com. No room to move around, nor to even open my suitcase, not what you would expect in a 4 star hotel. The room was stuffy and warm. When we opened the windows, a leech got in as there was no screens on the windows. Only a short taxi to many restaurants/attractions. Ordered breakfast in the room which was good. Free wifi.  ",3,2015,09,06
247,Summer in Sandymount Hotel :-),"i have stayed in the Sandymount Hotel on 3 occasions now and my longest stay was during the summer. i  had a really enjoyable time - Reception staff are very welcoming and no request is too much for them. The breakfast staff in the morning are very pleasant and have personality. The bar food is fabulous - burgers are really really tasty. The weather was miserable while i there so i did spend a nice bit of time in the Hotel. My bedroom was perfect, i was given a free upgrade to the newly refurbished premium bedroom on this occasion and it was gorgeous. The bathroom was modern and perfect for two people and i was only 1 person.  i have stayed in other rooms before and i was always very happy - the premium upgrade was such a nice surprise. I am looking forward to going back . 

Also one last point, Sandymount Hotel are offering guests to opt out of the housekeeping and linen change - soo good for the environment. Hotels with a green policy's is important for me when i search for hotels.",5,2015,09,06
247,Breakfast a massive disappointment when visiting for a meeting,"I wasnt staying in the hotel but was using it this morning for a meeting and i decided to get breakfast.
When i arrived for food i was asked to pay up front for my breakfast, all i had wanted was tea and toast but i was told breakfast was 12 euro that there was no options.
As someone that uses the hotel regular i always wondered why more business people didnt use the hotel for breakfast and meetings but this answers the question without to me.
Any other hotel offers 
Tea and Toast
Tea and scone
Egg and Toast
Porridge for far less cost.
While eating or when leaving the Restaurant i was never asked once how was food was while being there 25 minutes.
Food was average.
Then i had two meetings in the room just off reception and after 20 minutes meeting the first person i had to go to and ask for two coffees at reception and when meeting the second person nobody came near us.
This hotel has such potential but is missing a huge amount of business from not understanding what many customers want.",2,2015,09,05
247,Great location,"Stayed here for 5 nights during a recent trip back to Dublin. 
The best thing about the hotel is the location in Sandymount - 10 mins walk to Sandymount Green and Sandymount Strand and a 20 mins walk into the City Centre.
The hotel is in a quiet street - although I gather this is different on match days at the Aviva Stadium - and there is ample parking.
The rooms are quite small but are fitted with eveything you need and are clean. The only thing is that most rooms look out over the car park or the side so no real views as such. The noise from the other rooms next door and above was very audible - you could hear toilets flushing and people just simply walking around. After the first night I had to buy earplugs - after that it was ok.
The breakfast is not included and would have been EUR12 for a continental breakfast which is extravagant. I therefore enjoyed walking down to Sandymount Green and having breakfast there in one of the local coffee shops and chatting to locals.
I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin on previous trips and would definitely come back to Sandymount Hotel looking at the value for money and location.",4,2015,09,05
247,Hotel full of character.,"We took a family break to Dublin and stayed here. The hotel has a lovely feel about it as it is a combination of houses. The staff are great and check in was easy. The room was large enough for the 4 of us. Had breakfast which was really nice and met the owner who was very engaging with the hotel clients, a nice touch. Hotel setting is really nice, in a quiet area, but easy access to the city centre by car or dart. Would definitely stay here again. ",4,2015,09,05
247,Great!,"The hotel staff were really helpful and friendly during the stay, the room was always tidy and clean when we returned. Blue made our stay great, he was very helpful and knows the area very well so was able to recommend places and give accurate directions! ",5,2015,09,04
247,Brilliant for a quiet meeting,"Met a colleague for a business meeting and was very impressed.  Nice decor (nothing too flashy!), very pleasant waiting staff in the bar area, plenty of quiet space, and free parking also added to the event!!",5,2015,09,04
247,Hotel near City centre,Stayed at this hotel overnight while visiting Dublin. Good clean and has character. Three stops on train to Centre of Dublin about 10 minutes. Very good resteurants within walking distance. Free car park.,4,2015,09,02
247,Perfect Location,"Stayed in The Sandymount Hotel recently for a few nights break.
On arrival it was great to see free parking in the grounds of the hotel, considering that every time you set out in Dublin with a car you need to have a pocketful of cash!
The location of the Sandymount is superb, Its in a very quiet residential area, with a little village green and a strand in very close proximity, and the centre of Dublin a few minutes by car. There is also a dart station behind the hotel, but having not used it I cant say where it goes or how long it takes.
There are also places to walk should you choose to go out on foot, the Aviva Stadium is basically next door and there is a walk along the river just next to that, also the strand is a bustling place with lots of joggers and walkers making the most of the beautiful scenery.
The hotel acknowledges its rugby connection with a large statue in the forecourt of Irish Rugby.
On arrival the reception staff were very friendly and courteous as well as professional.
Our room was very modern and bright and also very clean, the bathroom the same.
The bed was well made and comfortable, with extra pillows, blankets and even complimentary dressing gowns and slippers in the wardrobe.
Our room looked out onto the gardens of the hotel, and although we didn't make use of them ourselves, it was pleasant to look at and the weather permitted others to make the most of it.
When the window of our room was opened there was a fair amount of noise with staff coming and going but it wasn't enough to disrupt our stay, just enough to disrupt little snippets here and there and we heard nothing through the night or when the window was closed. 
We had an enjoyable stay and the staff were first class, even providing take out menu's and ringing a take away for us.
A nice clean and modern, very welcoming hotel, the staff were lovely and our stay was very relaxing, just what we needed.",4,2015,09,02
247,Our holiday in Ireland,"The ladies at the front desk gave us various tips and advice to see the most interesting sights from Dublin in one day. 
The parking place gave us enough space and it was not so far from the entrance. 
The Hotel has a good restaurant with friendly and helpful staff.",4,2015,09,02
247,Great hotel for rugby international weekends!,"We stayed at the Sandymount twice in two weeks. Both were one night stays to coincide with Ireland rugby matches.  Booking was easy and parking in the hotel grounds just 200m from the stadium was a great bonus!  The hotel was very busy but the staff were excellent and arranged an early check-in to accommodate kick off time.
Our first room was a bit on the small side but still comfortable.  Second time the room was excellent. Breakfast was almost the highlight of the stay!",5,2015,09,01
247,Pleasant stay ,"Me and my partner stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during a weekend break to Dublin.  Lovely stay here, it is very clean, modern and beautifully decorated. The rooms are spacious enough, there's a hairdryer and iron/ironing board. The maids were around everyday. The breakfast is lovely lots of selection to choose from. The bar is nice reasonably priced. The staff are very helpful and friendly they took the time to show us how to get into the city on the DART, stop to get off etc. The DART stop is very near by and it's two stops to get into Dublin town centre. A taxi is about 12 euros from the hotel into Dublin.
",5,2015,08,31
247,"Noisy, old and too expensive.","The staff in this hotel are very friendly and location is good but they are the only positive  points I could see. Booked a classic double and ended up with a small twin room and no space to leave down our bags with a any comfort. Would be in trouble if I tried to order room service as we didn't have a table to accompany our one chair. The room was very small, stuffy and hot with no Air conditioning, could only open the window about 100mm. The bathroom was tiny and had a horrible musty sewage type of smell. Constant door slamming from all guest rooms as door closer is set too hard,impossible to sleep. I got a free 24hr wifi trial for my two night stay.( in this day and age wifi should be free especially at €245 for a Saturday night. Food was poor, we were here for a rugby match and felt like it was cheap bulk reheated with no taste, (it's match day it will do), there was people standing up with plates trying to eat in the bar while the restaurant was closed. In summary too expensive for the quality we got. Wouldn't go back",2,2015,08,30
247,"Efficient, friendly & welcoming","It's hard to fault the Sandymount. You are made very welcome at reception and despite the age of the building there is every modern facility.

I had an ""Executive Room"": it was one of the biggest hotel rooms in my experience with a large TV and a very comfortable bed. No aircon, but two large, sash windows that opened fully so very light and airy.

There is no question I look forward to another trip to Dublin so I can stay here again.

For the tourist or sports fan the location is ideal being with in sight of the Aviva Stadium and very close to Landsdowne Road DART station which is a few stops from the heart of the city yet Ballsbridge has a ""country"" air and the village is well stocked with a variety of restaurants and ""real"" Irish pubs.

Being critical, as one should, the Executive Room is very big and lacks something. My room had a large settee and a single chair that didn't match. A shame that might let down the overall class of the room. I think a small table & two chairs would have enhanced it for the purist. Otherwise, my room at the front of the hotel was very noisy at night: there seemed to be a fleet of lorries chugging up and down outside from 03.00 onwards - especially noticeable with the windows open! Get a room at the back!",4,2015,08,28
247,Weekend break,This is a decent hotel for a last minute weekend away with ample free parking. You can walk into the centre if you are fit but are also close to Herbert park and the beach so it's generally a good location.,4,2015,08,28
247,Fantastic experience.... Again,"Stopped at the Sandymount for a weekend break and the whole experience was excellent. Arrived four hours before ""check-in"" (due to early flights) but staff booked us in and took our bags so we could go off to Dublin Centre.

Excellent room (Executive), all staff were fab and attentive, irish breakfast (OMG) and the hotel itself was modern and clean.

Front of house provided excellent information on things to do around the hotel area. Tip - Its worth a walk (10 minutes) into Sandymount Village.

And to make our weekend Ireland won the rugby!!!!!",5,2015,08,27
247,Noisy! ,"The staff in this hotel were very nice, but unfortunately that is its only good asset. We paid to upgrade to an ""Executive Suite"", however, I would really hate to see a standard room! The room was spacious but decor was horrible, and the bathroom dingy - it just wasn't a comfortable room to be in. The corridors of the hotel were quite grubby and very narrow, and we didn't get a proper night's sleep due to the constant noise from within the hotel. Throughout the night and early morning we could hear doors slamming, people walking around, shouting and kids running around. The hotel is well located, however it is quite tacky and not a comfortable place to stay. ",2,2015,08,26
247,Anniversary break,"We had a spacious clean room and the friendly efficient helpful staff and the relaxed atmosphere all lead to a very enjoyable stay + good food and great Guinness. Front desk staff were pleasant,always helpful and full of advice re places to go and HOW to get there easily.",4,2015,08,26
247,Good location,"We had two nights here in August We were upgraded when we arrived so that was nice.The room was  spacious,clean and tidy.There were bathrobes and slippers provided A lovely breakfast buffet plenty of choice. Only a five minute walk to the dart train that takes you into the city.They run frequently. Would stay here again.",4,2015,08,26
247,Really lovely hotel in a great area near to Dublin beach and in a great little village.,"We were well looked after by the staff. Even set out a table for us and served water with a takeaway that they ordered for us. Great cocktails too. 
Great French Cafe in Sandymount Village called Browns is a must. 
I will go back lots.
Bar prices fine. Under 4 euros half a larger and 7.5 euros a cocktail.",5,2015,08,25
247,40th anniversary return visit,The hotel is in a superb location. It is family run and the staff and service were excellent. We had our honeymoon there 40 years ago and returning for our anniversary was a perfect choice. We wanted it to be special and the staff made sure that it was. The room was very good. The restaurant and bar were also very good. The hotel is set in its own grounds with plenty of car parking spaces. There is a picturesque garden area at the rear of the hotel.We could not fault anything and would strongly recommend this hotel. A gem not to be missed. We will not wait another 40 years before returning.,5,2015,08,23
247,A lovely weekend stay,"Pros: Lovely and friendly staff, clean and modern room and bathroom, modern fixtures and appliances, tea and coffee making facilities, and easy walking distance from the DART.

Cons: The hallway is quite narrow, so you can hear doors slam shut quite often (though that is a problem caused by the customers and not Sandymount Hotel).",5,2015,08,23
247,Perfect place to stay and see the rugby.,"We stayed at Sandymount on a Friday and Saturday night so we could see the Ireland Scotland rugby match on Saturday.  A perfect location for getting to the match - literally right down the street.  The accommodation and food were great as well.  The Sandymount Hotel is family owned and the staff are fantastic.  So wonderful to see a family owned property.  Also loved the ""Pig and Pint"" following the match.  Thanks for a great stay.",5,2015,08,21
247,Lovely hotel! central! great friendly staff! Always a great stay!,"Centrally located for town and Aviva right beside dart station. A lovely homely hotel. Bar food good and rooms are fine. What is really lovely about this family run hotel is how friendly courteous and good the staff are-from management, porters, bar staff & Beatrice and her team at reception everyone is extremely good at their job and most accommodating yo guests which makes a stay for business or pleasure at this hotel both memorable and positively enjoyable. Really centrally located and a gem in ballsbridge. Seldom offer a review about a place but feel this hotel deserves a positive mention for the good service and decent accomodation it provides it's customers .",4,2015,08,21
247,Brought my 13 year old son for his first visit of Dublin,"We stayed in Sandymount for 2 nights, and found the proximity to the Dart (200m, Aviva Stadium 100m) and buses excellent......easy to get to the city centre and back again. On arrival we found the  exterior of the hotel pleasant and welcoming, loved the rugby statue, and the free and private parking was a definite upside. The room was nicely decorated and clean, the bathroom modern and trendy, and the beds comfy, the only downside was that our room was insufferably hot (the weather, not the hotel), making sleep an issue (also constantly banging room doors)....which brings me to the hotels greatest asset...the staff, who moved heaven and earth to get us a fan to make it more comfortable for us. They were exceedingly pleasant, helpful, and informative, with nothing too much trouble, and service like this is memorable in this day and age! One member of staff who stood out for us was the minibus driver, Blue, who took us to Merrion Square......pleasant, friendly, and full of wonderful stories and songs....my son loved him, and he brightened up a horrible, wet start to our day! I would definitely stay here again if we visit the city at a later date, but in a different room!",4,2015,08,21
247,"""Nice Hotel""","Stayed in the Sandymount for one night as we had to catch the boat from the port the following morning. The hotel is only about 15 minutes from the port which was very handy as we had an early start. You will need a car if you traveling into the city centre, but it is perfect if you are going to the Aviva stadium. The staff were very friendly & as we had to leave early the following morning they had a picnic breakfast ready for us to take away.",4,2015,08,17
247,Great location and service,"We spent two nights at Sandymount, Aug. 14-15, 2015. This location was close to a DART station, so we easily got to our tourist destinations. The service was great-i received an important message concerning my car rental when we were out and they typed the message, put it in an envelope and slipped it under our door--who gives such personal service any more?
We would stay there again.",5,2015,08,17
247,Great location for Dublin City,"Stayed over three nights with my wife visiting Dublin as tourists. First time to Ireland and found the hotel ideally situated for the Dart (metro), coastal or walking into the city (approx 40 minutes), a short walk to Landsdown Stadium. Found our room was a little dated and faults in the bathroom which was latter rectifed, the constant noise of room doors slamming was annoying, I believe this was down to the door closures.
",3,2015,08,17
247,Great location!,"We booked this hotel for its proximity to the Dublin Horse Show and it was perfect. Set in a very pleasant area on the outskirts of Dublin we had a 10 minute walk to the horse show. We went into Dublin by train next morning from Lansdowne Road and it was a cheap, efficient service that took us to the centre of the city. The hotel was spotless, staff were friendly and the room was very comfortable. My only criticism would be that it was very warm in the room even with the window open. Would recommend this hotel for a short city break.",5,2015,08,15
247,Leafy Suburb Hotel D4,"This Hotel is a bit further out of Dublin but well worth a visit. We found the staff to be very friendly,helpful and polite at all times. The Breakfast was very nice with a good selection of both hot and cold food and if you ask you can get whatever type of eggs you would like with your breakfast.  The restaurant was very clean and modern with a lovely outlook onto the garden area. The upper Bar/restaurant has a small balcony to sit out. The Bar staff are very obliging and when we asked for some glasses and ice to take back to our room they said that they would send someone along with it so not pushy with having to spend your money in their bar but the prices were very reasonable too.  Our room was clean and spacious although next to the lift and sometimes early risers did disturb us a little.  This is room 201.  We were firstly put into room 208 but found that it was an adjoining family type room and there were other residents in the adjoining room and we could hear their conversation and when we addressed this problem to the reception they change us without hesitation so just check out your room to see if it is suitable for you and as i say they were very compilable. One thing i would like to share is the lovely gentleman who was the shuttle bus driver and front of hotel maintenance man i think as he was always with broom and pan cleaning ,Blue who is a legend in his own right and could not do enough for us. He took us to bus stops so we could get into the city as we did not want to hire a car not knowing the area very well.  On out last morning we booked him to take us to the bus stop for the airport and because we had quite a wait he suggested going for a walk along Sandy mount Beach Road along the beachfront and said hop in i will take you down and then you can just make your way back to the hotel in time for your bus.  Very knowledgeable too with lots of interesting facts and places to go. Just a treasure. Thank you Blue O'Neil",5,2015,08,13
247,A treat once we found it!!,After a desperate drive through the city where road signs are just hopeless a fabulous Garda let us use the bus lane to get to the hotel! Welcome was friendly and helpful room was small but spotless bathroom also very clean. Car par good food in bar excellent staff great . only drawback noisy bus party in corridor but not late at night so not really a problem breakfast was very good and in pleasant surroundings,4,2015,08,13
247,lovely little place,"just home after 2 nights staying in sandymount hotel to go to Dublin horse show with 4 teenage girls.Sooo handy to RDS..lovely area and right beside the Aviva stadium. Staff very helpful..locked away our luggage on day of arrival as too early to check in and we wanted to get up to show. Gave us clear directions for show, got me a chinese takeaway menu as girls wanted a chinese on Sunday night.  lovely reception staff. Breakfasts hot and plenty of choice... Great place if you want to get to Aviva stadium or to anything in the RDS",4,2015,08,12
247,A peaceful night in Dublin,"We selected this hotel for one night prior to travel to the UK by ferry from Dublin port. The location was ideal for an early Monday morning arrival at the port. The hotel did not disappoint in any way. On arrival we found the car park, which is located at the rear of the hotel, to be safe and well illuminated. We were greeted with a warm reception by a very professional staff, our room was not particularly spacious but it was comfortable, clean, tastefully decorated and the ensuite bathroom was excellent. The food served in the hotel bar was a revelation! Plenty of it, well presented and cooked perfectly. The range of beers was adequate but reflected Dublin bar prices...expensive! Sandymount Village is a 5-10 minute walk away and provides a pleasant place to spend a quiet evening. There are plenty of interesting bars and restaurants are to be found in Sandymount and the area does have a village feel to it despite being in the city. Significantly, the hotel is located a few yards from Lansdowne Road Stadium so it is ideal for rugby matches etc. There is a DART station nearby so access to the city centre is very easy. We will certainly use this hotel again when staying in Dublin.",5,2015,08,12
247,Very good,"I recently stopped here for tea with my group,  after visiting another amusement nearby. The hotel itself is beautiful .. the line out bar is beautiful . I happened to catch one of the ladies in the bar on an off moment and she came across less than eager to help me. I also purchased a scone and was alarmed to find a hair in it..  having said that other members of our group did not have the same issue whatsoever .  We also returned here later that afternoon for food and they couldn't do any more to accommodate our entire group  and the food was heavenly . I also thought for the area we  were in prices were actually quite reasonable.  I had beef nachos for lunch which cost me 12:95 .  Well worth it .",4,2015,08,11
247,Holidays ,"Have really enjoyed my stay in sandymount hotel Dublin.Staff lovely and Friendly.Meals ,dinner breakfast fantastic Hotel so comfortable. My parents stayed same night give them a surprise that I was staying to with the help of the lovely staff to suprize  them . Thanks again for lovely stay Derek joy  parents joe and Nellie joy . See all again soon ",5,2015,08,09
247,Business Trip,"I normally stay at the Ballsbridge Hotel round the corner when I visit Dublin on business. I have been staying there half a dozen times a year for five years now and have always been very happy there. However on this occasion due to the short notice for the visit, the Ballsbridge was full and so I had to look for an alternative Hotel around the Ballsbridge area and I came across the Sandymount.
I will NEVER stay at the Ballsbridge Hotel having stayed here. The Hotel is lovely inside, the Car Park is large, free and very secure. The Exec Rooms are very big and comfortable and although the Hotel itself is like a Rabbit Warren, I can't find any faults at all from my stay. Lovely quiet part of Dublin, five minutes walk to the Dart and three stops to Tara St on the edge of Temple Bar. The hospitality and food in the Line Out Bar is great, not a huge choice, but what you get is tasty and reasonably priced. All in all I enjoyed my three nights at the Sandymount and will be returning in early Autumn for another business trip. Well done Sandymount and their Staff.",4,2015,08,07
247,"Excellent Location, Free Parking and Near-Enough to City Center","Location was amazing. We did not spend nearly enough time in Dublin to appreciate it fully, but to two Chicagoans-turned-Minneapolitans this neighborhood almost felt like home.

Quiet yet exceedingly urban, this hotel was a spectacular finish to our week-long stay in Eire. ",5,2015,08,06
247,Good and reliable hotel,"We stayed there for a business appointment before a great week around the country. It was clean, the staff were friendly, the location was convenient. They did not have room service available by the time we got there but they called and order a pizza for use instead. Not luxurious but a great place for good prices.",4,2015,08,04
247,Family run hotel in lovely residential location.,"We enjoyed an overnight stay at the Sandymount last month. The receptionists were so helpful, and enquiring on the train into town they also encouraged us to perhaps try the local area, 10 mins walk to a lovely local green area surround by shops, cafes/restaurants and a further few mins for a walk along the promenade. The hotel is situated a beautiful residential area. We also bought tickets from the reception for the hop on/off bus which pick up residents from the hotel. Plus the hotel is only minutes from the train station and the Aviva Stadium. We enjoyed a spotless large double bedroom overlooking the front of the hotel, light and airy. breakfast was served in a lovely bright dining room, buffet type, all good. As we drove and took the ferry from UK, we were looking for a hotel with parking, the Sandymount had plenty, plus being approximately 20 mins from the port. On leaving the bus tour in Dublin City we took the DART from Pease Street, 2 stops to Lansdown Road stop and 5 mins to the hotel. I would highly recommend the hotel and feel it was value for money, would definitely visit again.",5,2015,08,04
247,Great location for Travelers who want to explore Dublin.,Lovely neat & clean hotel near Lansdowne Road dart station. You can get connections to all attractions from Conolly station or Tara street. The staff was very friendly & polite.Food & drinks at Line Bar was very good with nice ambience.,4,2015,08,03
247,Well run hotel - always enjoyable,"Stayed here a few good times - can get some good deals on the usual OTA's. Family run hotel - and I suppose it shows. Front desk are excellent. Worth paying the extra for an upgrade if you want a more enjoyable stay - standard rooms are fine - but it's an option I usually do take.
Food in bar is good - great bar as it's never too busy. Use it as a base for lunch meetings also if I'm in Dublin for a day.",4,2015,08,03
247,Management excellent,"We were in town to see someone in St. Vincent's Hospital and found staff and management were extremely helpful to us. Food was very good, service was excellent and the hotel family  overall helped to alleviate our worries. It's close to Aviva if you are into rugby or the occasional music event, and close to the DART station if you want to travel. Parking outside is secure, and the road is quiet",4,2015,07,30
247,Great value,Stayed at the Sandymount on a recent business trip to Dublin. Lovely airy room which consisted of one double & two single beds. Bed was very comfortable and room also contained tea/coffee making facilities. I ate in the bar where the staff were more than willing to make me a sandwich rather than insisting I eat from the bar menu ( which itself was extensive). Breakfast was excellent with great choice of hot and cold options. Service from start to finish was really friendly. Well worth a visit as location is excellent adjacent to both Ballsbridge and Sandymount village ( and the Aviva stadium).,4,2015,07,29
247,Great location just outside the city centre,"We travelled to Dublin with a group of 5 friends and found this nice hotel over the internet, just outside of the city centre, close to the rugby stadium. Every morning we enjoied a fine Irish breakfast before we left. The rooms were nice and cosy and all the comfort we wantend was there. It was not the cheapest, but it's worth it's price.
Compliments to the kind staff for their service and advice.",5,2015,07,29
247,"Loved this hotel.  Very friendly , good location","Stayed here with my husband ,for weekend break , absolutely loved this hotel , staff on reception where very welcoming , location is perfect for us beautiful area very safe , 2mins from dart takes you in to city , food was delicious , rooms spotless small but very comfortable , we go to Dublin quite often , will be returning again in January , and have already booked to stay again , so don't hesitate book it you won't be disappointed .",5,2015,07,28
247,Great hotel in a fantastic location,"Stayed there weekend of 24 July with two friends in a triple room.  Lovely room, lots of lovely toiletries, comfortable beds, well laid out.  Staff at the hotel are great and very helpful and friendly.  It is located right beside the Aviva Stadium but also right beside the Dart so perfect for public transport.  We had breakfast there one morning and it was lovely, and good value at €12 per person.  Free wifi, free papers.  A really lovely spot and would highly recommend it.",5,2015,07,28
247,"Perfect location, very clean and friendly","I was pleasantly surprised, it was spotless, the newer rooms were fab, standard rooms are not very big but all you need for a nights stay in Dublin. Everything was spotless and seemed very new. Location is perfect, dart was only a 2 min walk and brings you all the way to the Connolly station. Nice breakfast and lovely staff.",5,2015,07,27
247,I'll definitely go back if I visit Dublin again,"I was in Dublin for 3 nights and was so glad I chose this hotel. Friendly staff, good breakfast, the room was sizeable, nice and clean, great WiFi, etc. I have no complaints whatsoever. I won't bother looking for another hotel whenever I visit Dublin again. Highly recommended.",5,2015,07,26
247,An oldie but a goodie,"This place is a maze of rooms, stairs and landings from several buildings joined together over the years.   Its a bit olde worlde, rather than ultra modern, but is comfortable amd clean. 

Breakfast offerings are reasonably varied in the room with a view of the gardens. 

Parking is free and there are numerpus parling places in front of or at the rear of the hotel. Wifi is included and consistent. 

If you're into walking, it is about a 25 minite walk into the centre of Dublin.  Alternatively, the DART station is about a 5 minute walk away.

There is a good selection of restaurants at Sandymount village, a 15 minute walk away.

None of the rooms seem to offer any particular advantage over the others on terms of view or aspect. They are all quiet.",4,2015,07,26
247,Good value hotel with all the trimmings,"Decent price for 3 nights over a long weekend, any cheaper and you'd have to go to travelodge or a motel. Helpful staff, nice bar, and great value food. The ribeye steak on the specials board made for a great date night meal .Rooms nice a clean with a good sized bathroom. 2 minute walk from the dart station and/or only €12 for a taxi into temple bar.",4,2015,07,26
247,5 stars,"Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights while traveling around Ireland with my girlfriend.
I am absolutely amazed with this place. Nice, clean and comfortable room. 
And staff are real credit of the hotel. Everyone, from reception to bar and restaurant staff were realy welcoming and friendly. 
Would highly recomment. ",5,2015,07,24
247,An excellent hotel,"I was staying in Dublin for a week
We had a really warm welcome everyone could not have been more helpful.
The hotel was excellent, food really good
The price of all drinks in the hotel bar are far cheaper than elsewhere in Dublin
Its well worth staying in the hotel.",5,2015,07,23
247,One of the worse nights I ever spent in a hotel,"We stayed here recently while attending an event in Ballsbridge.  Everything else in the area was booked out so we didn't have much choice. The staff were pleasant enough.  The entire place from top to bottom was shabby and could do with a massive facelift.   It smells musty - like a B&B from the 70's.  The room was the smallest 'double' room I have ever stayed in.  The key card wouldn't work - so each time we went back to the room - the receptionist had to come down to the room and let us in.  The worse bit was the noise.  We got no sleep at all.  The rooms are so dated they are not sound proof.  Noise hit us from every angle - guests banging around overhead, at either side of the room and in the corridors.  The staff also seemed to use the corridor area directly outside our room as a linen storage drop off - we heard every pack being thrown on the ground (along with the staffs conversations).   At 4am a busload of guests began getting reading for check out - we heard showers from all angles, guests shouting in the corridors - and worse of all each guest pulled their luggage across a car park outside our window.  We packed up and left at 7am for the drive to Cork.  I can only imagine what breakfast would have been like.  

I would imagine its OK, if you are attending a match in Aviva and aren't too pushed about the noise or comfort levels as the location is handy.  I personally would not return.

A note to the owner - please do not reply to this review with your generic reply - I wrote you a personal  letter outlining my dissatisfaction before posting here - and I received no reply.",1,2015,07,21
247,Always good to return to the Sandymount,"Been based here whilst working in Dublin for many years. Staff are always very friendly and helpful. Service is great. Rooms comfortable and clean. With an average of a month stay each time, we are `part of their family' each summer.
No hesitation in recommending them.",4,2015,07,19
247,Relaxing hotel in a super location,"We really enjoyed our stay here. There was a lovely relaxed atmosphere, the breakfast was excellent and the room was clean and comfortable.

Many thanks to Beatrice at the front counter too who was very pleasant and helpful throughout our visit, and provided great advice and recommendations.",5,2015,07,16
247,Very Nice!,"Nice rooms, nice lounge, amazing breakfast including everything from scrambeled eggs over sausages to healthier food like Flakes, Porridge or Fruits... Well done housekeeping, everyone there's so friendly and always ready to help! Had a wonderful stay in this hotel. Rooms have a flat tv and there is also a free wi-fi for guests. At all there's really nothing to critisize! Well done, folks! :)",5,2015,07,15
247,168-Room Bed & Breakfast with Hotel Amenities,"Just returned from an 8-night trip to Ireland. We spent our first 2 nights in Dublin at the Sandymount Hotel and were thrilled with our experience. The hotel can best be described as a 168-room bed & breakfast with hotel amenities. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, even offering tips for the rest of our trip. You could tell they all consider each other and you part of an extended family. The hotel location was wonderful...a beautiful neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city center, yet convenient with its proximity to the DART. The rooms were modern, clean and tastefully decorated, and the restaurant had great service and delicious food. They even have a beautiful garden area that offers peaceful relaxation. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin, especially to someone who is looking to feel more like a local and less like ""just another tourist"".",5,2015,07,12
247,"Friendly, Clean, and Classy","I just spent a few days at the Sandymount Hotel with my family. Our experience was nothing less than fabulous! The staff was friendly and accommodating. The rooms were very clean, tidy, and spacious making our long journey relaxing and peaceful. From arrival to departure everything and everyone we encountered was an absolute class act. During my next stay in Dublin I will be returning to the Sandymount Hotel. The staff truly made us feel like part of their family. ",5,2015,07,11
247,Barbara Gibso,Great welcoming hotel room and service first class went to Arena3 to see Fleetwoodmac went for drinks in theVillage first lovely and then got dart to concert so practical had great time highy recomended,5,2015,07,11
247,Great for Business Travellers - Highly Recommended,"I have stayed at the Sandymount Hotel on numerous occasions for business over the last year. All of the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms are all very clean and generally well equipped. However, some of the rooms are in need of updating - a process that is on-going. I believe some 60 of the 168 rooms were been renovated earlier this year and they are extremely nice.

The hotel is made up of several older building joined together so it can appear a little confusing at first, but you soon get used to it. I have had rooms in all areas of the hotel - they have all been quiet. The main road at the front of the hotel is not at all busy so even front facing rooms are fine. 

Overall, highly recommended.",5,2015,07,10
247,Great position at Landsdowne Road next to the Aviva Rugby stadium and also the DART,"Family owned hotel with great service, good food and comfortable rooms. Although I took the DART to Bray from where I took the coastal walk to Greystones, I was happy to come back to the hotel with my wife for a meal back at the Hotel
The food was fine - not excellent - but fine, we were happy with the quality of the food we were served and the waiting team were friendly and attentive. 
It was a hotel full of coach party tourists, but that was no problem to me - it was a big hotel and I am more than happy to recommend it",4,2015,07,09
247,Dublin hotel stay with a family atmosphere,I recently spent 3 days at the Sandymount in Dublin on my first ever trip to Ireland. The accommodations made me feel at home.  The food was good and the staff went out of their way to help us. The hotel is only 2 blocks from the Dart train which connects you to the entire city. The town of Sandymount and shoreline is only 2 blocks from the hotel. If I am able to get back to Dublin one day I will be sure to stay at the Sandmount. ,5,2015,07,08
247,Warm welcome,"This was my first time to stay in this hotel, but it won't be the last. Great welcome by the woman at reception. She gave us maps and showed us where to go and what to do.
The hop on off bus stops just outside the hotel, great way to see the sights. Sandymount village only a ten minute walk away, sample the delights of the local neighbour hood.
We had breakfast and it was excellent, snacks on the beautiful terrace, overlooking the well kept gardens. Free, wifi, ample free parking, clean and comfortable rooms. Most important a feeling of home away from home. It is a real family run hotel, and I will be back.",5,2015,07,06
247,"Odd layout, but great choice.","Have stayed here a few times on business. The hotel is in a beautiful quiet & plush area. It is laid out over several houses which are interconnected. Loads of free parking, great staff and very good value too.

Some of the suites are very spacious if you are in town for a few days and need a space to work from as well as sleep. The bar is a little odd, but there are loads of quiet alcoves with comfortable chairs.

Well worth a visit.",4,2015,07,05
247,Very welcoming and friendly,"really enjoyed our stay here, we felt very welcome from the minute we checked in. The staff at reception were lovely and very helpful. The breakfast was tasty and fresh. Will defiantly be back to stay here!",5,2015,07,05
247,A great hotel and staff,"During my two night stay I found the staff helpful, efficient, friendly and polite.  The bedroom was comfy and well-equipped and the hotel clean.  The menu has a variety of types of dishes, the food was good and they catered well for people with food allergies.  There were books to read and a lounge area and it has a nice garden too.  No problems with the Wi-Fi.

It is in a pleasant suburban area and is only a short walk from the sea and several other local attractions.

I enjoyed my stay and would return should I visit Dublin again.",5,2015,07,03
247,A Great Hotel,"We stayed in this Dublin hotel for 3 nights in June, unknowingly during the football match between Ireland and Scotland at Aviva Stadium a short distance away. In spite of many football fans also staying at the hotel, we found our bedroom (401) to be quiet, comfortable and very clean. All the Reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful, even though they were quite busy most of the time. The self-service buffet breakfast each morning was excellent with plenty of choice. There was free WiFi with strong signal throughout the hotel. There were plenty of free car parking spaces. The hotel is conveniently located within easy walking distance to the Dart railway station for Dublin city centre and beyond. Sandymount Hotel is situated in a quiet and pleasant suburb of Dublin, ideal for a relaxation holiday. We can definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers.",5,2015,07,02
247,A good hotel,"This hotel is out of town near to The Aviva stadium and Dart railway station into town.  We are walkers but it took well over 40 minutes to the centre of Dublin, so we only did that once!  It is clean and tidy with a nice dinning room.  Breakfast is 100% perfect. The free Wifi was great to have.  The one thing that was not good was the flapping shower curtain over the bath which just did not stop clinging to one's body when taking a shower.  I needed 3 hands, one to hold back the shower curtain, one to squeeze the shower gel and one to put it on my sponge! The bed side lights are not bright enough to read pamphlets and maps by late and night which I love doing. The hotel garden is well cared for with some picnic benches.  The bowl of sweets on reception is a nice idea but too tempting!  A walk to Sandycove village is worthwhile where there are few pubs and a Tesco and Spar. Carry on further and the beach is there; we never saw the tide in, but it is lovely just to wander on the sands at the end of a day. There is a nature reserve to the left of the bay.  This is on reclaimed industrial land.",4,2015,07,02
247,Nice Hotel,"Stayed here with family and friends for one night, the hotel was very clean with lovely bar food and its only a few mins walk from the Aviva Stadium and the Dart. However the rooms are basic enough a little out dated but comfy enough overall the staff are friendly but we did come across rude bar staff when asking for a glass I understand plastic cups are always used when a match is on but my grandmother wouldn't drink her drink from a plastic cup and when I asked for a small glass the response I received was quiet rude and unprofessional, yes the bar was very busy but that doesnt excuse the bad manner no need for the ignorance. That was the only negative we came across while there.",3,2015,06,30
247,Ok but the bathroom is old,"Business trip (one day). For that price is not really a deal, the room is ok, no mini bar just some water and coffee. 
The structure is quite old and the bathroom is too old (see picture). The reception is ok and the location is not the best but you can reach the airport in approx 30 min.",3,2015,06,30
247,"Part of our ""Mini-moon""","Stayed here as after our wedding for a night. It's in a nice area about a 2 minute walk from the Aviva Stadium. The hotel itself is an old building lovingly restored, having narrow winding corrider with nooks and crannies throughtout. The staff were pleasant throughout our stay. For a break away I'd definitely recommend this hotel but I'd prefer to be closer to the city centre next time.Dublin taxis are soo expensive.",4,2015,06,29
247,Great Hotel,"Stayed here a few times, friendly staff, clean rooms, nice food in the restaurant and one of the best places to be before and Ireland international football match! A band plays outside and people are everywhere with drink flowing! The Aviva stadium is at the end of the road.",5,2015,06,28
247,Great ,"We stayed here because of how close it was to the Aviva stadium for an Ireland match! The reason I've given this hotel five stars is because when me and my boyfriend got to our room there were 3 beds there so that meant I had loads of room and could kick him out :D also I loved the pulled pork burgers outside and the live music, super fun hotel. ",5,2015,06,28
247,Peaceful and close to the city,Stayed here for three nights. The hotel is located in an calm residential area. So no hectic and traffic in the surrounding. The city centre was for my wife and me in a walking distance. The lobby area is very comfortable. Free wifi in the public areas and in the bed rooms. Price-wise and from the location for my perception an good advice in Dublin.,4,2015,06,28
247,lovely hotel,I stayed here for a week. 5 mins walk from the dart station and aviva stadium. Nice local area. Rooms are cleaned daily.10 min walk into nearby sandymount and about 20 min walk into city centre. Bus tours departs from outside the hotel daily.,5,2015,06,28
247,Weekend break,Staff were all Eastern European and although friendly and efficient it was disappointing not to be able to hear the Irish accent on arrival.  Room was spacious and comfortable and there were plenty of toiletries. Remote control batteries were flat. Unfortunately we had a flat tyre and staff were very helpful in signposting us. Staff were very helpful in directing us to the Dart which is 100m away and offered advice on shopping areas. Breakfast was nice but disappointing no soda or potato bread.,3,2015,06,28
247,"one night stopover, friendly, helpful, good service","Our stay was arranged by Irish Ferries as a one night stay in route to the West Coast. We were greeted in the hotel car park by the owner who was very polite, friendly and told us about the hotel, the area and where were nice places nearby for a walk, good atmosphere and range if restaurants and take away. We were very pleased when the owner helped take our luggage through to the hotel where the reception staff were very efficient and friendly. A private hotel celebrating 60 years as a hotel sits by the Aviva stadium and has a strong association with rugby football.
Our room was very clean and comfortable as was the very well appointed bathroom. Breakfast was excellent.
We enjoyed the walk to Sandymount village where we sat in the sun and ate very good fish and Chios. Nearby is the promenade for some good fresh air.
I would recommend the hotel to anyone arriving into Dublin in the evening for a one night stop over. Away from the excitement and bustle of Dublin nightlife we left refreshed for our drive across to Westport. There were taxis outside to whisk anyone wanting to head into the city centre.",4,2015,06,27
247,Birthday treat,"After a minor hiccup with our room, we ended up in a really nice room at the front of the hotel. The staff were all really friendly and the hotel is only two stops from the city centre on the Dart. 
This hotel has been here for ever and is a great place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of Dublin ",4,2015,06,25
247,"A ""maze"" ing Hotel","Great hotel in a very good location. I say a ""maze"" ing because until you get used to it the hotel seems like a maze. This is due to it being several georgian buildings made into one. Despite this the hotel is bright and light with clean rooms and large areas to relax in. Breakfast was a ""serve yourself"" with a very good selection of both hot and cold. We dined in one evening and was a little disapointed with our fare. Maybe we chose wrong, but both of us not over happy. The staff never even asked if our meals were OK, I even had to point out to them that they had missed our drinks off the bill. Not a word of thanks, just reproduced an ammended bill. All this aside I would stay here again and would ask you to do the same. Take the car - its also got complimentory parking. Short walk to the Dart & bus, restaurants and pubs.",4,2015,06,22
247,"A lovely, reasonable hotel","We stayed in this hotel when in Dublin to see The Script, we were lucky to get a reasonably priced hotel as a lot of others seemed to have bumped their prices to extortionate levels!

The hotel staff were friendly, we had lunch there too and it was really nice. The rooms were very warm and a wee bit dated but spacious enough with a good sized bath. The free wi-fi connection was excellent and I would definitely stay in this hotel again!
",4,2015,06,22
247,A genuine oasis in easy reach of the City Center,"Our family of three found this via Exploring Vacations. Created from a row of conjoined properties, it has its hallway twists and turns but the public rooms are welcoming, premises spotless, the neighborhood quiet. Walk to the sweet but well-stocked nearby village for meals and grog. Most importantly, staff is adept and efficient and Emma Butler, from behind the reception desk, is a marvel--we had left an important item at a petrol stop a few miles away and she saw to its retrieval graciously and resourcefully. 
 Just a couple minutes' walk from a handy DART stop. and the locale is a respite from the crowded city center you may not wish to navigate by car. 
     Highly recommended.",4,2015,06,22
247,Great Hotel with good facilities and rooms.,A great hotel with large communal rooms and a comfortable bar and large restaurant. Stayed here for the Ireland/England match and it was perfect for the match and convenient for Dublin. Lansdowne Rd stadium is just five minutes walk away and the Dart station the same. The Hotel has a large car park and a spacious reception rooms. Two quite large seated areas and quite a large bar leading onto an outside seating smoking area. Out front of the hotel there is another area with picnic benches for drinking and smoking. The bar serves food during the day and the restaurant is used for breakfast and evening meals. The room I was given was a treble with a double and a single bed. The bathroom was modern with a good shower but no bath. A bit on the small side but very clean and bright. The bedroom was spacious and bright with plenty of sockets for charging and tea and coffee making facilities provided. Enjoyed my time here with great staff in a really nice building.,5,2015,06,20
247,"Cute, reminds you of a country house","Stayed there 2 nights during a business trip. It is located in a nice, quiet area, ~4km from city center. It is a cute place, that reminds me of a country house. Flat building, lots of turns to reach your room, neat decoration and very clean. Better ask for a double bed instead of 2 single ones, as single beds were really tight. The only negative thing was the breakfast: only few things to a choose from , that didn't even look that fresh",4,2015,06,19
247,Wonderful stay at an excellent local hotel,"I was recently in Dublin for approximately 8 days for a work-related trip.  I chose the Sandymount Hotel for its location, access to public transport, and a more local hotel experience.  The hotel never disappointed!  It is located in a beautiful neighborhood split between Ballsbridge and the village of Sandymount - each just a ten minute walk from the hotel through beautiful neighborhoods with the Aviva football stadium just 200 meters walk.  The DART train station is just beyond the stadium and offers access to all access points within Dublin and beyond.   I opted for a 5 day pass that saved me lots of money.  

The hotel staff is wonderful and generous with their assistance.  I arrived early (about 9:30 AM) from my flight and Emma checked me in and offered me a room right away - I was happy to have waited - but she was very accommodating.  Both Emma and Hannah generously offered their insights into the city which allowed me to make a strategy to see many of the local sites around my meeting times.  In fact, I would have missed out on visiting Howth (just 20 minutes north on the DART) - a beautiful coastal fishing village complete with lots of hiking by the sea walls - had Hannah not informed me of the beauty of this village.  

The hotel is grand with many of the rooms refurbished with nice modern finishes.  My room was spacious - I opted for slight upgrade - and very clean and quiet.  Lots of amenities are included for instance wifi (important for me getting some work done), TV,  tea and coffee.  The common areas are very spacious and comfortable with outside seating as well.  The bar and restaurant served up very good food and drinks with breakfast being very good.  In addition, I had a pair of trousers and shirt laundered and received them back the same afternoon...great service!

Transport to and from the hotel is very easy.  The hotel has explicit directions to reach them from the airport.  I took the air coach bus and followed the directions from the stop to the hotel and they were spot on with me never losing my way - about a 10 minute walk along sidewalks in the nice neighborhood from the Ballsbridge stop to the hotel.  Emma arranged for the hotel shuttle to take me to air coach stop and made sure I went to the stop that went directly to the airport instead of another one winding its way through the city.  I greatly appreciated hers and the staff's insights and generous assistance.  

The hotel is unlike a big chain hotel in charm and personal assistance.  I will definitely book this hotel again upon any return to Dublin in the future...oh, book through the hotel website and enjoy a 5 Euro coupon for credit in the bar!",5,2015,06,18
247,Communion Party,"We recently held our daughters 1st Holy Communion party in the Sandymount Hotel. The Staff in particular couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating. Siobhan in marketing was the event planner and was a pleasure to deal with.  Beatrice at reception greeted all our guests and looked after us for the day. We were are party of 60 people and the despite the size of our party the service was excellent. The menu was good value with a number of options to choose from. All our guests commented on the quality of the food and how lovely the staff were with all the children. I would highly recommend the Sandymount Hotel for any family or corporate party you are thinking of having. Catriona, Kevin, Aoífe and Áine",5,2015,06,18
247,Nice local hotel,"The location is superb, the staff very friendly and the hotel is clean. It mught feel a little different from chain hotels but it brings a local charm that works. If you take the bus from the airport take into consideration that the hotel is 1 km away from the closest stop",4,2015,06,16
247,Fab Location,"We were at the Sandymount for the ROI v Scotland football match.  The hotel was in an ideal location for this and provided gazebos for outside refreshments.  The receptionist was very friendly on check-in and even though we arrived 3 hours early, our room was ready and we had been upgraded to an Executive Room.  The hotel is a rabbit warren of corridors and rooms, but once you get your bearings it is easy to make your way around.  The room was nice enough, a good size with tea and coffee, toilettries, iron/ironing board, safe and hairdryer.  The bed was comfortable and we both slept very well.  

There was a big tv, which, unfortunately, we had no remote control for.  We reported this on leaving the room at 12.30 pm, then again later in the evening and at the end of the night, with no controller being supplied.  We reported it again at reception the next day and on our return from a day in the city a controller had been supplied.  I realise this may seem like a small issue to some, but we like to have the tv on when we are in our room and felt that it should not have taken 4 attempts to get the issue resolved.  

The bar area was comfortable and bright, the staff were friendly.  The restaurant was open and airy and the food was very good and we didn't think it was too expensive.  However, like everywhere else in Dublin, the cost of alcohol was extrotionate!!  

The location was great for the Dart train which had you into the city centre in 3-4 stops so was great for us, although we think we'd possibly stay further into the city if we were not attending a football match, just for the convenience of being able to walk around.  

We may well stay here again in the future, but as stated previously, only if attending a game at the Aviva Stadium.  

Not related to the hotel at all, but if flying into Dublin International, agree a price before leaving for your destination, we were ripped off on the way in, paying 40 euro, when it should have been 25-28 euro.",4,2015,06,16
247,Perfect location trains local shops and stadium.,"Greeted by the delightful and helpful Beatrice we were shown through a rabbit warren of corridors to our clean and tidy room. Free wi fi, tv, tea and coffee are provided. Yummy breakfast was part of our package and had everything you would like, hot, cold, juices, espresso coffee. And helpful friendly staff to hover about helping and cleaning up. Beatrice needs a special mention. A lovely friendly front of house greeting. So helpful and full of advice where to go and how to get there. And it should be mentioned that the hop on hop off bus picks up at the hotel at 09:00. Rooms are a little tired and dated but that did not detract from our lovely experience here in Dublin.",4,2015,06,15
247,"Great hotel, fantastic food, very accomodating staff.","I visited the Sandymount hotel with 5 friends for my 30th birthday for 2 nights. The hotel was in a great location, few minutes walk to the DART with a short ride into the city. The public transport was easy to use and cheap. The staff were very welcoming, everything we asked for help with they were more than happy to assist us. The food was excellent in the bar and the restaurant, so good we ate there both nights which is something I never do as usually like to experience different places, reasonably priced too. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would return again. The only downside would of been the bathroom, it was quite dated, very small low sink (and im only 5ft 2) with a shelf placed above it making it difficult to wash face/brush teeth. The room would benefit from a full length mirror in addition to the dressing table mirror, particularly as there were 3 girls sharing a room, with only 1 mirror, getting ready was difficult. However I wouldn't let this put you off. Great find!!",4,2015,06,15
247,A nice place to stay with friendly staff,We stayed on two separate occasions at the Sandymount and were very pleased. The rooms were spacious and clean and the overall quirky/vintage/unique vibe of the hotel was comfortable and attractive! The best part was that the hotel allowed us to leave our luggage and rental car for a few days while we traveled to London for a couple days in the middle of our Ireland vacation. Very professional and attentive staff!,5,2015,06,15
247,Great Find,"A great hotel in a great location, easy to access from Dublin Port and convenient for walking or using the Dart into the city centre. We arrived early but were given our room straight away. Though quite small the room was very clean, comfortable and well equipped. The food was good quality both at breakfast and the couple of times we ate in the bar. The staff throughout were very pleasant and helpful, creating a relaxed atmosphere. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,06,15
247,A nice place to stay,"A group of 10 brothers, sisters and partners stayed here for 1/2 nights for a nephews wedding. In places the hotel is a little tired but our room was large, clean and everything worked and it has a great buffet breakfast.",4,2015,06,12
247,"Great hotel, friendly welcome","Sandymount Hotel is right next to the aviva stadium, next to a dart station and a 10 min walk to the buses into town.  Room was clean and comfortable, bathroom well equipped with a bath and lovely shower and the breakfast was good, plentiful and the majority of the food is locally sourced.",4,2015,06,12
247,Central,"Stayed here recently - Great central location, ideal for visiting Dublin city centre and surrounding area..very pleasant and helpful staff..fine sized bedrooms with comfy beds..lovely food...would highly recommend a visit",5,2015,06,08
247,Nice Hotel but needs some room cleaning.,"I stayed in this Hotel for one overnight at a cost of €129, without Breakfast. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Bar Food was very good and at reasonable prices. The hotel is located near a Dart Station and the Aviva Stadium. I was put into a downstairs bedroom. The room was small and comfy but there was plaster coming of some of the walls near the desk and at the window. There had been attempts to paint over it but dry rot has to be properly treated. There were brown stains on the carpet near the desk probably from coffee or tea stains. The window net curtain was no longer white but brownish in colour and the window surrounds was covered in mould and attempts have been made to paint over it. The curtains were hanging of the pole. Woken early in the morning due to foot traffic above my head and the fact that the entrance to the car park and Hotel entrance is outside this rooms..  Otherwise a pleasant stay but could do with a bit of maintenance.",3,2015,06,08
247,Great warmth in a cool country,"We arrived on a cold and rainy day in early May, soaked and shivering and found a haven of friendliness, charm, beautiful surroundings and a wood and peat fire roaring in one of the several cozy public seating areas.  Our room was a good size, bathroom nicely stocked with toiletries, everything freshly painted, carpeted and very clean.  The breakfasts were amazing, catering to every appetite and most ages and nationalities.  If something was not visible, you were urged to ask.  The servers were wonderfully friendly and attentive.  Desk staff answered our questions at length, gave us excellent directions to the DART and to Sandymount town centre. An all-round good experience. Oh!  And it is half a block away from Aviva Stadium, so wonderful for rugby fans!",4,2015,06,07
247,Sabbatical ,"Great hotel, spacious room, good car parking and friendly staff. Good Irish beer and excellent food. Easy public transport into the city, and right next door to the Irish Mecca of rugby. We spent a few nights here travelling the UK and Ireland and thus was one of our more comfortable stays.
",5,2015,06,07
247,First time in Ireland,My sister and I who are from Australia recently embarked on our first overseas trip.  During our time in Ireland we stayed for 7 nights at the Sandymount hotel. What a fantastic choice.  We felt so comfortable and welcome at this hotel and everything was at our fingertips. The hotel was exceptionally clean and the beds were very comfortable. Nothing was a problem for the staff who were all so very pleasant and cheerful.  We enjoyed our time there so much we returned for another 2 nights at the end of our trip. We cant recommend this hotel highly enough.,5,2015,06,05
247,Friendly hotel,"This is a lovel friendly hotel in a great area and close to the centre of Dublin. The staff are fantastic, very friendly and can't do enough for you. I stay here regularly on business and thoroughly recommend it!!",5,2015,06,05
247,Very friendly staff,"This hotel has a real family run feel compared to an average chain hotel.   It was a last minute booking and probably a bit more expensive because of that: €149 for a double room single occupancy.  Reception and check in was very friendly.  The room was quiet and a bit tired but perfectly functional and clean. The hotel itself is a bit rambling with narrow corridors.  The location is good if you are into Rugby and it is a short walk from a number of bus stops and a short taxi ride to town.  It is a quiet reverential area rather than noisy city center.  Breakfast was quite good, although with a limited buffet selection.  Evening meal was fairly good pub food.",4,2015,06,03
247,Great hotel!,"Stayed for two nights in May. Lovely hotel with very spacious and clean rooms, most importantly the beds are soooo comfy! Feels very much like luxury. Location is good, its a long walk into the city centre but there is a dart station at the end of the round which is affordable and only takes 5 minutes to get into the busy city! Staff were very informative and helpful. The bar and breakfast were both excellent and value for money. Loved our expensive here and would definitely visit again!",5,2015,06,02
247,Lovely hotel in lovely area ,"I've stayed in Sandymount Hotel for three nights in April. I can highly recommend this hotel. Great location, close to city center with a dart and also placed in nice,quiet area of Dublin. The room was spacious and clean. And the real credit if this hotel is stuff. All very friendly and helpful. I will definately stay again when I am back in Dublin.",5,2015,05,31
247,"Good location, nice hotel, great outside terrace","Definitely a hotel I will return to again if I can, as the hotel was very conveniently placed close to the train into town and overall the hotel had everything one needs. Had a decent room (although the one I stayed in was on the small side), a restaurant/bar with plenty of food and drink options, as well as an outside terrace for sitting outside on a sunny day sipping or eating whatever the bar has to offer. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay there. ",4,2015,05,31
247,Perfect Weekend,"I came here for a surprise hen do and it was the perfect location, staff were friendly, great restaurants close by and the bars atmosphere was just what you needed when coming back from a night out, I even got locked out my room and the staff were accommodating.
Even the Germans staying there were great! perfect hotel",5,2015,05,29
247,Nice quiet area,"Lovely hotel, friendly informative staff, only a short distance away from hustle and bustle of city centre, good transport links into city, we visited Dublin on 22-24th May for a concert at Vicar Street, used a couple of taxi's as well as public transport, the Dublin taxi drivers were hilarious, all in all very enjoyable stay and would stay at Sandymount hotel again, good value for money and very clean, didn't find Dublin any more expensive than any other major city.",5,2015,05,28
247,The hotel that reached our expectations!,"We visited Dublin and stayed at Sundymount Hotel last week for four days.  It was really a very nice experience. The hotel was very good, the stuff very friendly and helpful and most important it was very clean. Our room and bathroom were very spacious and had everything we needed. We definitely recommend it and hopefully we will go there again in November for our son`s graduation. We cannot comment for its restaurant as we had our meals outside. The hotel`s location was very convenient as it is very near to Landown train station.",5,2015,05,27
247,Good quality hotel in decent location,"I'm from Dublin originally and I stayed here for 4 nights on a trip home. I've been at the hotel many times for rugby match related functions as it is right beside the Aviva stadium, but I had ever stayed here. Warm welcome from helpful staff. Decent room with all the facilities you'd expect, good size, and quiet. I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel but have had lunch there a few times and it was good. Location is good. Not city centre, but very close to DART, 10 mins walk from Grand Canal Square, 15 mins to canal at Baggot St or Mount St. , 25 mins nice walk to city centre. You are also close to Sandymount which is a lovely urban village, off the tourist trail, and nice sea walks. Recommended.",4,2015,05,26
247,Gets better all the time,"this hotel never ceases to amaze me. It has recently celebrated 60 years in business yet still retains the friendly family atmosphere that sets it apart from many others.

It's best asset is its staff . They are friendly, obliging, helpful and this goes for all from reception to housekeeping to bar and dining staff, outdoor staff and drivers and reservations. Management are very involved and a friendly greeting on meeting them makes one feel very welcome indeed. There have been times when staff have gone over and above for people which is why many guests, including myself, return time and time again.
Newly decorated rooms and public areas, a new ground floor entrance for the less able bodied, great free wi-fi and ample free parking show this hotel continues to look after its guests.
Here's to another 60 years",5,2015,05,26
247,Extremely nice but slightly forgettable.,I've stayed at Sandymount in September 2014 for couple of nights. Pretty much everything was done the way it should be in a hotel of this class but before writing this review I was unable to remember the name. The one thing I definitely will remember is the fact that the hotel offered a shuttle bus to the Three Arena for all the guests going to James Taylor's gig. Nice touch. The show was great as well!,4,2015,05,26
247,Garden Sanctuary,"I recently caught up with friends at The Sandymount Hotel, loved my stay, great welcome, great food, love the recent refurbishment, the hotel is "" Top on Trend"",  I like the fact that you can chill out in what I call the Garden Sanctuary, great place to relax.  
The staff are very helpful, thanks to Nicole, Rose and Bea, for all their help. Cant wait for my next visit, BBQ evening.....",5,2015,05,25
247,Family run boutique hotel,Boutique hotel. Beautiful rooms with comfortable bed. Good sitting areas to relax and chat. The bar was great and had really good food. Staff were charming. A perfect location in a quiet area with superb transport links. The charming 'village' of Sandymount a short walk. Right next to the Aviva stadium and close to the Royal Dublin Showground. Great value for money.,5,2015,05,25
247,Perfect weekend (apart from the rugby result!),"Stayed here over the Easter weekend for the Bath v Leinster rugby match.  Apart from the result, the weekend was perfect!  The hotel is wonderful - quirky layout, sure, but nice, clean bedrooms, tastefully decorated with everything you'd expect.  The bar was great, with nice food (can recommend pulled pork with a fried egg - try it!) but avoid on match days if you are after a quiet drink!  What makes this hotel is the staff, who are just a credit to the industry.  Superb service.  The DART is a short walk away, 10 mins and you're in the centre of Dublin.  But do take a short walk into Sandymount village, which is very pretty and take a refreshing walk along the seafront.  Thank you for looking after us!!!",5,2015,05,24
247,"Very nice, clean hotel.","A well-run family owned hotel. The friendly staff is always willing to give advice, assistance and make your stay as comfortable as possible. The food in the restaurant and bar was always good. Only negative is that they aren't a 'short walk' to city center. If you stay here, be sure to go on the Red HopOn HopOff bus that stops in front of the hotel.",4,2015,05,21
247,Miss Julie Burling,"Despite the fact there was no TV remote & the kettle didn't work, the room was very comfortable, warm & clean. Managed to get a free complimentary breakfast & the staff were friendly & helpful. Thanx to beatrice & the rest of the staff for making my stay better.",5,2015,05,20
247,Great return,"Having stayed at the Sandymount before I thought I knew what to expect and yet I was more than pleasantly surprised on my last business visit. I had the great pleasure in staying one of the newly refurbished rooms, No:546, which was very tastefully done. Beautiful bathroom and comfortable bed made my stay very welcoming. 

the ladies on reception are a real credit to the hotel being very helpful with nothing too much trouble. 

I liked the hotel before this visit and now I think they have raised their bar even higher.",5,2015,05,18
247,Great for a short stay on business at the Silicon Docks,"[rodrigodfq] Very friendly staff, did the utmost during all my interactions with them, at the check-in-check-out, and restaurant. The hotel is a stone thrown from de Aviva Stadium and 10-15 minutes walking from the Silicon Docks, which makes it a great option if you're travelling for business. They also have special rates for employees of some of the big IT companies nearby, so make sure to ask for it during booking. Also, the restaurant and the bar are great, with great food and large portions! I will definitely stay again there when visiting Dublin in the future.",4,2015,05,18
247,Nice place...,"Clean, good location.  Easy to get to the train to travel downtown (suggested - hard to find parking downtown).  Good food in the restaurant.  Outstanding breakast included with the package we took.  Parking on site.  Friendly staff and very, very helpful with getting around town to see the sights.",4,2015,05,18
247,"No lift, noise and television not working!","My first ever trip to Ireland this hotel was booked by my partner for my 30th birthday. Although I will return to Ireland I will not be returning to this hotel. First the staff were lovely I had no faults they couldn't do enough. However there was no lift to are room so we had to go down a flight stairs carrying heavy suitcases. Secondly the television didn't work and even when reported nothing got done. Lastly the two nights I stayed I had four hours at the most due to the room above as you can hear ever movement. I wrote to the hotel and explained what had happened on my stay in which they have offered upgrade on my next stay which will not be happening ever again. I suggest if you do stay, stay on a top floor and don't bother reporting anything not working!!",2,2015,05,18
247,Charming hotel with friendly staff,I live locally and often call in here. The staff are so friendly and are always willing to help. I often pop into the hotel bar and it has a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. When my friends come to visit Dublin they often stay here and always have a great visit. The staff are so helpful and the location of the hotel is ideal. It is located beside the train and is in walking distance to the city centre. I couldn't recommend this hotel more highly.,5,2015,05,17
247,Happy to recommend my local  hotel.,This is a family hotel with a personal touch. I live locally and frequently drop in to the hotel which has a bar which serves food. I also meet friends here as it is very convenient and has good parking. The Dart station is very near the hotel. The staff are most helpful and kind and I always get a very warm welcome here. On a cold day the open fire is a homely touch!,5,2015,05,16
247,Excellent value for comfort and great location,"I have been leery of ""boutique"" and non-chain properties lately, but the Sandymount blew my expectations away. This cute hotel was everything you expect from a boutique hotel in a charming neighborhood literally a block from the transit line. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the property was clean and updated, and the bed was comfortable. 

The streetcar line is a little over a block away, but is a lovely walk near the river. The charming neighborhood shops and restaurants are close but not right next door; totally walkable. The hotel has dining options and a great business center. 

My only caution would be that the room was still rather small (typical for European cities) for two people with luggage. Also, the AirCoach from the airport leaves you off 10 minutes walking away, but it's not a bad walk.",5,2015,05,15
247,Good Location,This hotel was in walking distance of the Dart (train station)  Was very easy to get around and had a friendly helpful staff.  The food at the restaurant was decent (what we ate anyway).  Staff was very accommodating.,5,2015,05,14
247,Great Value for a 5 Night Stay,"A 10 minute drive from Dublin Port, The Sandymount is a warm and professionally run hotel which achieves high standards without breaking your bank balance.
On the same road as The Imposing Aviva Stadium (Well worth a tour) The hotel is a 5 minute walk to Landsdowne Road Station where the DART will take you into the centre of Dublin for about 3.50 Euros return. We used the railway every day due to its convenience.
As for the hotel, the room was airy, spacious and well appointed with toiletries, towels and tea/coffee facilities. The beds were comfy, not too soft and a medium quilt so you didn't cook in the night. Breakfast was well organised and filled us both up every day. 
Just a small gripe, the size of the sink in the bathroom but that didn't spoil the overall visit. With a friendly welcome and pleasant surroundings, this is a hotel I would wish to visit again in the future.",4,2015,05,12
247,H Campion,Myself and husband stayed at hotel for a night away. We have nothing but praise for the staff and facilities. We ate in the bar in the evening and the food was fabulous and very affordable. Overall we couldn't fault anything and would definitely stay there again,5,2015,05,12
247,one night stay,Nice clean hotel close enough to city but far enough to be a quiet stay ! within walking distance of 3 arena (our main reason for our stay). Very friendy staff and a welcome upgrade for our wedding anniversary !!,4,2015,05,12
247,Nice Hotel,"We stayed in Sandymount hotel for one night and we were upgraded to an executive room for €1! The room was very spacious and the bed was a lovely, comfortable king size bed. There were a few things that needed attention, namely the toilet roll holder was hanging off the wall, the door in the bathroom could be touched up with paint as some of the paint was coming off, no blind in the bathroom (the glass was frosted but guests in the car park may have seen a little more than they wanted to!) None of these things, however impaired our stay. The bar was a nice place to have a few evening drinks and the staff at the hotel were all very friendly and polite.",4,2015,05,11
247,1 night in Sandymount Hotel,"Just had a really pleasant stay in the Sandymount Hotel. Lovely room 613. Comfey bed. Bathroom looked recently done up with a shower bath combo that was a little difficult to get into with the glass siding however the shower was perfect. The bath was 3/4 size in length but was very deep. 
Good toiletry selection including tooth brush and razor packs, robes and slippers. 
Breakfast was really good with great coffee being brought to the table whenever you wanted it. 
Real people for staff, personable without being over the top. 
Gosia, I think her name was, very friendly on the check out. 

",5,2015,05,08
247,Friendly staff.,"Lovely little hotel close to Aviva Stadium. Compact, clean room with well appointed bathroom. Great staff, approachable and friendly. Tasty breakfast. and tasty bar snack.Very close to Dart Station. Sandy mount village very close. Nice walk along promenade.",5,2015,05,06
247,"Sandymount Hotel,a home from home!","We booked this hotel last minute and got a great deal.The room,the dining area,the staff and the overall hotel experience was second to none.I couldn't recommend this family run hotel enough,it lacks the corporate feel of most Dublin hotels and has the warmth and friendliness often associated with the Irish bed and breakfast/guesthouse sector.A beautiful break,in a beautiful location,close to everything you need.",5,2015,05,05
247,A fantastic Hotel with fabulous staff,"We started our holiday with three nights at the Sandymount, we then toured Ireland & Northern Ireland finishing up back at the Sandymount.
The staff  couldn't do enough to make us welcome, the restaurant  staff especially Chip, made us feel at home, the friendly atmosphere & amazing food was memorable.",4,2015,05,02
247,Great place! Service great! Breakfast - not so much.,"Facilities and service were outstanding. Great staff!!!

The only minor note is that the breakfast is lacking in quality in many ways. It needs a complete rethink and new management. But as I said, the hotel and all other aspects of the stay were delightful.",5,2015,04,29
247,Great Hotel,"Lovely hotel, very comfortable, staff most helpful and polite. Room comfortable, great power shower in bathroom  and if you want fresh milk instead of those horrible little 'things' of long life milk you can ask for it.
Breakfast choice was excellent, continental, full, or you could even ask for specifices such as poached eggs etc. Fresh coffee and smashing breads! Breakfast staff were on the ball all the time ready to ask what you wanted or if you needed a coffee refill etc.
I had room at the back and it was so quiet - perfect!
Only had 2 minor gripes. I had flown in early from Scotland, had really busy day and by the time I got to my room was ready to seriously chill. By the time I unpacked etc decided to put on TV to see the news and no luck - thought the control wasn't working so went to reception to complain. They quickly sent someone round and it transpired that I hadn't put the swipe card into the holder which switches the electricity on. Doh! But... not all hotels do this... I was really tired... and the reception hadn't mentioned this.. so maybe hotel does need to say this to ALL guests regardless!
Also, the weather was still chilly and the radiator in the room and bathroom were turned off, it would have been so nice to have had the room warm and comfortable when I got there!",4,2015,04,28
247,Ideal Location for Family attending Concert Event,Stayed here with a group of Teen Girls attending concert at 3 arena.  Although family rooms are dated in decor they are comfortable and spacious.  Food at the hotel is reasonably priced and good choices on menu.  Very easy to walk to 3 arena and Taxi reasonably priced to return.  Lovely staff creating a perfect atmosphere.,4,2015,04,28
247,Great location and home away from home,"I stay in Dublin 2-3 days a week for business and this is my number one hotel to stay in as it is like a home away from home, yet they still have all the business facilities I need, free Wi-Fi, conference rooms and good areas for coffee meetings. Free parking is definitely a plus for me and my business connections, also the location is great, easy access from all directions and walking distance from city centre. The staff is fantastic, always friendly and ready to help out with any query, 10 out of 10 for sure. I also appreciate that this is a family run hotel and you will see the owner there daily engaging with the guests.",5,2015,04,28
247,WEEK-END IN DUBLIN,"Hotel location non far from downtown, rooms are  confortable but non so quiet.
becouse of the fire doors sliding very loudly. Good breackfast service .
Desk service absolutely not affrodable. . We had to pay twice  the bill!
We asked for this mistake but the lady had not answer for us. Only after
several days we had our money back  thanks to BOOKING.COM. Pay cash !",3,2015,04,27
247,Home Away From Home,"On a 6 month effort spending two to three weeks at a time, the Sandymount was always and will always be my choice.  Great people, great food, comfortable and clean rooms, what more could you ask for.  The staff is exceptional, they go above and beyond to make your stay as rewarding as possible and the neighborhood is close to great food, shopping and the lovely Aviva Stadium.",5,2015,04,24
247,Great Service!,This hotel was amazing. In a nice area of Dublin and a 45 min walk through a beautiful area to get to the city center. Tanya at the front desk went above and beyond to help us with lost luggage. So nice! We def. recommend this hotel!,5,2015,04,21
247,Clean tidy hotel ,"We stayed here for 2 nights. The room we had was small but was very clean. Size wasn't a problem as we literally just slept there and explored Dublin! 

The staff were friendly and helpful. We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food. 

Location was great. ",5,2015,04,21
247,"Friendly, spotless and great location.","I stayed in the Sandymount Hotel recently as I was attending an event in the RDS. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance of the RDS. It is also a short distance from the Dart station (beside the Aviva Satium) and bus stops. Staff on the reception desk were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel itself was spotless, room appeared to be newly decorated. The hotel was very busy but despite  this there wasn't a sound to be heard during the night. Bar food was very tasty.  I had a very pleasant stay and definitely will be returning.",4,2015,04,19
247,Great hospitality!,"This hotel is located in a beautiful en quiet area of Dublin, with good connections to the city centre (DART). The rooms are fine, spacious with nice beds. But what I will remember the most is the staff, they were really friendly and helpfull! Great price for good quality.",5,2015,04,18
247,"Friendly, Vibrant & Good location","This was our second stay in Dublin and this hotel was in a much better location to last time with us being closer inner city links. We would recommend a leap card as this will get you on all forms of transport Dublin has to offer - Great Value if you want to get about everywhere.
Reception staff were really friendly, informative and the desk itself was well manned - No waiting to be served.
The Bed was a little small and not to the comfort we were use to (Mainly as we brought a super sized bed at home!) but everything we needed was within the room - Fantastic!
The Aviva stadium is a stones throw away, so could be busy on match days but also a great atmosphere around the area.
We would definitely stay again and strongly recommend.
Thanks to all the staff for a warm friendly weekend stay!",4,2015,04,18
247,Super Sandymount,"The Sandymount Hotel is ideally situated just outside of the city and walking distance to Sandymount and Ballsbridge, and less than a five minute walk to the Dart (the train).

The hotel is a maze of rooms but it is quiet and comfortable. The staff are incredibly helpful from the minute you check in, which was fast, as was check out. Throughout the hotel everyone had a smile and was only to willing to help or guide. 

The room was clean and warm. Had all the mod cons and although fairly basic in terms of a room felt spacious. The over bed light is hard to locate as it actually sits behind the pillows!

Wifi was free and worked without any problems. The hotel offered free parking, and also when the called for a taxi it was very quick in arriving. 

We dined one evening in the bar and the food was excellent. Good value for money and very tasty. I personally loved all of the old black and white rugby photographs adorning the walls. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again. The staff were almost like family they were so helpful and welcoming, which made the stay just that little bit more special.",4,2015,04,17
247,Standard Hotel,"Hotel served its purpose, business trip, easy check in and check out.  Rooms clean and comfortable, nice and warm.  Didn't eat there so can't comment on the food.  Very good location.  Renovation works going on at the time.  The lifts are slightly confusing as are the layout of the floors but not a big deal.",4,2015,04,16
247,Nice Family run hotel,I was a bit disappointed by the size of my room I paid for an executive room and would hate to see the size of a normal room!! Other that this great location 5 mini dart trip from the town close to bars and local restaurants all within walking distance. Friendly staff and great food!! Nice quiet location which is a cheap taxi ride home at night!! Again only problem was the room size ... if you pay extra should you not expect extra?,4,2015,04,14
247,AMAZING HOTEL AND STAFF,"Stayed in the Sandymount for 2 nights at the weekend. Cannot fault the hotel or Staff, simply amazing! Beatrice in particular was so lovely and helpful, she gave us an upgrade and helped us with taxis and anything we needed. Food was gorgeous and room was excellent. Cannot wait to stay again, such a gorgeous hotel and good location for us!",5,2015,04,14
247,Memorable stay in the hotel!,"Loved the Sandymount hotel- ticked all the boxes for us! 
Very convenient for the city centre through the dart. Rooms are good but what makes the place so special is the exceptional friendliness and helpfulness of the staff who go the extra mile to ensure that every need is catered for. 
One of our party has stayed in numerous Dublin hotels over the last 40 years and described this stay and service as the best she has ever experienced.
We are a group of 6 with an age range of 8-85 and will definitely be coming back!",5,2015,04,13
247,pleasant stay,"A group of us stayed on Saturday night last, as we were going to a show in the Grand Canal theatre, staff at reception were lovely and helpful, no bother calling taxis for us, room was lovely, bottled water, bathrobes and slippers were provided, and a note, if we required fresh milk for tea or coffee just contact reception, lovely touch! Lovely homely feel to the hotel, bar staff were very nice too, and the food was lovely and tasty. I have no problem recommending this hotel, and would definitely stay in the future.",4,2015,04,13
247,Lovely hotel ,"Stayed here at the weekend with my partner, we also stayed here last year and we will stay again. Staff on arrival were very friendly, the room was really nice couldn't fault it at all. We got the dart into the city centre which was just around the corner from the hotel. I would highly recommend staying here, prices are very fair. ",5,2015,04,13
247,refurbished,"During our previous stay refurbishment work had been going on and we were delighted that on this visit we were allocated one of the ""new"" rooms - 555 - and found it excellent. The power shower is a real treat. Our arrival at round 1:00 p.m. coincided with the buildup to the Leinster-Bath game and the hotel was really busy. An earlier reviewer complained about plastic glasses. Well I was also disappointed that there were no cherries for my Pimm's!! But then us old rugby guys can make allowances!! We had a most enjoyable 2 night stay and a special thanks to Gosia. She went out of her way to deal with questions about Dart timetables, etc. And she asked us, on return, about our  trip to Howth on the Sunday - personal attention indeed. P.S. Brought a couple of the Guinness branded plastic ""glasses"" home to impress my pals!",5,2015,04,13
247,Fri & Sat 10th April 2015,"Another great stay at the Sandymount.  Their revamped rooms are fantastic. Great venue for me, close to the ILCU for meetings and Ballsbridge. 
Staff always friendly and helpful (thanks for the loan of an umbrella Beatrice).
Great breakfast included and enough to keep you going all day",5,2015,04,13
247,Service in High Class!,"Me and my family visited the Sandymount hotel for a couple of days during St.patricks day to enjoy ourselfs and to see the beautiful city Dublin. When we arrived at the hotel we were welcomed by the receptionist Beatrice(what a hostess). This woman was amazing. She helped us with everything from taxi, tourguides, resturants, sightseeing, you name it and she knew what to do.

Our room was beautiful and recently renovated. It was fresh and had a nice design. The bathroom was the best!!

The food was good, we only tried the breakfast. It was a nice buffé with a good variation of different alternatives.

Both me and my mom work in the hotel-business and know the value of service and this hotel delivered. 

Next time we visit Dublin we will definatly come back to this hotel! 

Best Regards, The Molvig Family!",5,2015,04,13
247,Very pleasant stay,"On arrival we were greeted warmly at reception and chatted to the receptionist who has been commuting into Sandymount for 30+ years (neither of us caught her name) but she was so lovely, we got an upgrade to a very nice room which included bathrobes and slippers! Our room was so clean with a nice added touch of a little vase containing a tulip on the table, the shower has to be one of the best I've had and was so welcome after a long day on the train. The bar area is nice and was busy enough, serving cocktails (mojito was fab) alongside the usual pints on tap. Breakfast was immense and tasty, a help yourself buffet style which was perfect for us as it set us up for the day - we were not hungry again until dinner at 6pm!! Overall the hotel was clean and nicely set up, all staff members we encountered were so friendly and helpful. Would most certainly consider staying here again on our next trip to Dublin.",4,2015,04,12
247,Wouldn't recommend this hotel ,"Held 2 work meetings in this hotel and was very disappointed. 
Totally over priced for lunch.  20 euro per head and that's not even getting a choice for main course. 
On another occasion sandwiches were ordered as lunch for my group.  But as I don't eat bread 
I asked in the bar to order something from their menu but I was more or less told that I couldn't ! 

One occasion we had a 2 day meeting with some staff staying overnight. 
There was a match one night in the Aviva.  
I was told I had to move my car by 5pm as I wasn't staying,even though most of my team were and I was paying the bill!  
The staff weren't at all friendly. Wouldn't recommend or visit again. ",1,2015,04,11
247,Great place to stay,"We stayed for a two night cycling holiday, staff very helpful re bike storage and directions.  Spotless big room, fantastic hot shower and comfortable beds, free newspapers and fruit at reception in the morning. Sandymount area is pleasant for short walks, and the nearby Brownes restaurant is great for breakfast. Highly recommended.",5,2015,04,10
247,Anytime you can get availability,"Would try to get this hotel anytime we travel to Dublin 
It is very cosy very clean great food and the staff are very helpful and friendly 
Rooms are delghtful and lways fresh and clean 
There's a lovely bar in the hotel but with Dubln prices 
The only fault I find is that the hotel seem to boost their prices when ever big events take place in Dublin which is unfair to those who try to use the hotel more often",5,2015,04,09
247,Wonderful service,Found this hotel to be a great location to get to city centre by subway. The staff were so kind to us and helped us through our first 2 days in Ireland. We did the on and off bus which starts there and we enjoyed the service. The only one challenge is the place is a bit of a maze but if you follow the signs you will be fine. ,5,2015,04,09
247,Very enjoyable stay all around in this family run hotel.,"Spacious clean room, very helpful and pleasant desk and bar staff. 
Away from the hustle of the city but easy travel by neary Dart train and easy, interesting walk into city too.
Nice neighbourhood, pleasant pubs and restaurants in Sandymount and Ballsbridge villages. Good walk to coast via Sandymount village.
Room at front on first floor was queit",5,2015,04,08
247,Great Hotel (shame about the rugby result),"Lovely hotel, staff, food, Guinness........my wife and I stayed 2 nights while in Dublin for the Leinster vs Bath game. Its a great family run hotel: clean and bright; very professional without being impersonal. Lansdowne Road stadium is all of 2 minutes walk away.

The only drawback was the result - Bath lost :(   but it would seem harsh to blame the hotel for that.",5,2015,04,07
247,Excellent stay.,"First time staying at Sandymount but it won't be the last . From arrival to departure the staff were friendly, polite, and helpful. The food both at breakfast and in the bar was very tasty . Our room was modern ,clean and had everything you need for a comfortable stay . The hotel is close to the Aviva stadium and RDS , also within 5 min walk of the dart which takes you to Dublin city centre. We had a very enjoyable stay.",3,2015,04,07
247,"Pretty good, but could improve","We stayed at the Sandymount Hotel over the Easter weekend.  We were primarily there for the rugby, but always look to spend an extra day or two for sightseeing.  The hotel was pretty good all around, but there are a few things that could be improved.

The Good:  There seems to have been quite a bit of renovation & it has been carried out really well, retaining many of the original buildings features, but now incorporating stylish features you'd expect to find in high-end hotels. The rooms are stylish, modern, functional & very comfortable.  Great bed and bathroom, which I find most important.  The room (and rest of the hotel) was spotless.  Staff all really friendly & helpful.  The location is perfect, being just yards from Lansdown Road and an easy, level, walk into Sandymount village.  There you will find a couple of good pubs, several decent restaurants and cafes.  Just beyond that is the beach & a nice walk along the shore.  

Location is also very convenient for the DART into the city centre & surround areas.

The hotel price was really good, particularly as it was Easter weekend.  Food was really good, though we only had dinner as friends prefer to go out for breakfast.

The Not So Good:  Our room was quite small, at the front of the hotel & in the basement.  The floodlights at the front of the hotel were very bright and the curtains didn't keep out the very bright light so i found it difficult to sleep with so much light.  A blackout blind would be useful.  (Friends had a room 1.5 floors up & at the back and that was much bigger & less light/noise.)  Also, there was some noise from rooms above, but that's difficult to deal with as it's an old property with wooden floors.  However, having the beer barrel & recycling bins outside the bathroom window did mean that there was some noise, mainly at the end of the evening & early morning.  A little annoying, but not a big issue.

Overall, we really enjoyed our visit and will certainly consider staying here again when we next visit, though we would ask for a room toward the back of the hotel and ups level or two.",4,2015,04,06
247,Drinks before match,"Had drinks here before a recent rugby match, very disappointed to be served with plastic glasses while inside the hotel, no reason for this except cutting down on staff. You can't serve wine in plastic cups.........",3,2015,04,05
247,Comfortable rooms with extremely friendly staff,"The rooms were very comfortable, with extremely friendly staff. Although the bathrooms are a little tired looking, it was fantastic to have a hot bath that fills in seconds. The location is great too, next to the Mecca of Irish Rugby, with easy walks into town (or a quick hop onto the Dart). Free Wifi and parking, with gourmet comfort food to die for. We really enjoyed Dublin, and the hotel experience certainly added to it.",4,2015,04,05
247,A wish given ,"My daughter and I stayed here from March 9-20, 2015. The entire staff was incredibly kind to us. The owner of the hotel, John, made sure that he met and welcomed us to Ireland. My daughter has had a wish her entire life to visit Ireland and this hotel made our visit magical. ",5,2015,03,31
247,Fantastic stay,"We were 2 couples from South Africa and stayed here for 2 nights. The staff were very professional, they organised our transport to the airport for us. The rooms were clean and well maintained and the bar/dining area very good. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit.",4,2015,03,31
247,Great hospitality!,"Spent time before the match Poland v Ireland. Hotel just metres from the Aviva Stadium. It was very busy day but service was brilliant! So much understanding for the fans, great spot outside the hotel, band and good atmosphere. Hotel is small but there is enough space to seat and relax. Staff very helpful.",5,2015,03,30
247,Would stay again,"This hotel is located close to Dublin The room was nice and clean, the staff very helpful.
Some of the reviews say the noise level was unbearable but that wasn't the case with us.
We were there when there was a major soccer match at the Aviva Stadium (walking distance) and we had no problems with noise
Very short (10 minute) train trip to Dublin proper. Walking distance to the village of Sandymount, which is a typical Irish town and the North Sea. It's also walking distance to Ballsbridge with all the pubs and music you care to soak up. One thing though. If you bring an adaptor for things that plug in, you need one for Ireland. The ones that work in England, Scotland, France, Germany, etc. don't work. No worries though, they sell them at the front desk.",5,2015,03,30
247,Very nice hotel - close enough to the city centre but in a quiet location.,"Clean rooms, very friendly staff and convenient location. Good for staying in Dublin on business and 100 yards away from the Lansdowne road stadium - which might make it difficult to book around game time.

Room was great, breakfast very nice.

The only downside to the hotel was the bandwidth of the free wifi seemed to make it difficult to send emails for some reason.",4,2015,03,30
247,DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL,"We have just arrived home after a nightmareish experience at this hotel.  The noise level from drunken residents and screaming children was nothing like I have ever experienced.  After the screaming children running unsupervised up and down past our room woke our baby for the fifth time we asked to be moved.
 The receptionist assured us she was moving us to a quieter room, which indeed it was until 4am when we were awoken by extremely drunk guests singing obscene songs right outside the door of the room, added to this the constant slamming of doors and screaming at each other, this stay was an episode we will remember for a long time.  
  We had travelled for four hours to get to this hotel and rather spend the day in dublin today as was our plan, our only option was to check out at 6am this morning and drive home, sleepless, for another four hours....having mentioned this to several friends today I have been told this hotel is known for putting up stag parties, match fans and that the awful noise we were subjected to all night long is a regular occurence at this ""hotel"".  There are many many civilised hotels in the same area so please take my advice and steer clear of this hellhole.",1,2015,03,29
247,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for two nights. The hotel was obviously a few houses at one time as the rooms are a bit of a warren, long corridors and an elevator that takes for ever. However the staff were pleasant and helpful. I did have a problem in having each night billed separately as 'computer says NO ! Hopefully that problem will be resolved soon. Nice location and close to Aviva, and dart around the corner.",4,2015,03,28
247,Staying for 2 nights for concert ,"Arrived in Hotel today , Very quick check in , Very good staff at check in . Showed to our room , Great room just what we had booked . Booked in for 2 nights B& B & one Dinner. Went to Dinner tonight, Had a lovely waiter to serve us . Ordered a Medium Rare Steak which I must have due to a medical condition , , Mine arrived Well Done returned & asked for Medium Rare Again , Same thing again , . Waiter never came back to ask if we ok , Surprised at that , Rest. Manager sorted it out , We were not impressed when I was asked to pay  € 6 extra for steak that I could not eat......  So surprised that this should happen as this is my third stay here,hopefully things will improve tomorrow as I have recommended this hotel to all my friends ",2,2015,03,27
247,"Perfectly OK, handy for Lansdowne Road","I stayed a night here; arrived at 6 ish, left at 7.30 ish, didn't eat, so a bit of a flying visit.  My wife stayed 3 nights and had brek, so I can offer 2nd hand experience.

The best thing about the hotel is probably it's location, about 5 mins from Lansdowne Road.  If you're going there, this is the place to stay.

The hotel is made up of converted houses and extensions, in the usual manner of suburban hotels.  It's a little shabby outside and, more so, inside, but not too bad.  Work is being done at the moment.  The place lacks character, and seems to be aimed mainly at the cheaper end of the business market; there was a meeting of IT people taking place in one of the meeting rooms (poor blighters were still there when we returned after 11pm!), and there are lots of places to work on your lap top, that sort of thing.

Or room was an 'executive suite' or some such.  It was large, with a decent size double (very comfortable) and a single bed, plenty of wardrobe space, TV, tea/coffee making, a chair or two, a sofa.  Not very homely décor, but perfectly comfortable.  The bathroom was very small and in need of freshening up, bath, shower over bath.  Nothing to complain about at all, but could have been better.

Breakfast was reported to have been fine, although the breakfaster tends not to go for the more demanding cooked effort, so who knows?

The hotel is definitely not a destination in itself, but if you find yourself needing a bed but not much else in the area, it's fine.  Free wifi.",3,2015,03,26
247,St. Patrick's Day ,"The most amazing trip.. Sandymount was in a PERFECT location.  The staff went above and beyond helping us to find places, recommending great events, and allowing us to check-in a little early so we could settle in and get ready
for our adventures!! ",5,2015,03,26
247,Great Choice,"Great hotel, all the staff were very friendly & pleasant, each time we spoke to them they all seemed interested in what we were going to do that day etc. rooms were good, bar food & beer the same as was the breakfast & plenty of choice & quantity. Easy to get into city centre & a lovely village just down the road with good sea view & promenade walkway, all in all we would stay here again :-)",5,2015,03,25
247,"Friendly service, good location and a boutique vibe","Friendly, clean and comfortable, The Sandymount Hotel is a good choice for those wanting easy access to the city centre or the pleasant environs of Ballsbridge/Sandymount.  Free parking and wifi are a bonus and nice touches like bathrobes and slippers for guests add to the boutique ambience and give it a definite edge on other hotels in the area. 

Room was a little smaller than other hotels I have stayed in but it was modern and very functional.",4,2015,03,25
247,Nice Hotel...,"We stayed 2 nights in this hotel. When first arriving the outside looked amazing. They catered well to our needs (as we had gotten on an earlier flight than expected and they let us check in early!) 
The reception staff were warm and welcoming, told us everything we needed to know about getting around the local areas and answered any questions we had. 
Room was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed for our short stay. 
It wasn't far from the station at which we were able to jump on the DART and get into the town centre very easily and quickly. 
We both really enjoyed our stay! :)",4,2015,03,25
247,Great hotel!,"I was staying at Sandymount hotel almost a week due to a class I was participating nearby. Room was excellent. And especially big thanks for great staff working in this hotel! Check in was really quick and friendy, which was really refreshing after a long day of traveling :) 
Hotels location was pretty good as well. Everything was in a walking distance.",5,2015,03,25
247,Average hotel but good location,"We've just spent 2 nights in The Sandymount Hotel while attending a concert. The location is good if you're going to an event in the Aviva or the RDS and the Luas is just a short walk from the hotel making it convenient to access anywhere in the city and the hotel provides free parking so thats the good points!
For the negatives...on check in the receptionist seemed to have no interest whatsoever in making guests feel welcome, we overheard her speak to different guests over the weekend and every request seemed to be a monumental effort to her, hardly the type of person you would put at front-desk! The first room we were given was on the ground floor, we followed a narrow corridor to a room that was so tiny it was really only suitable for single occupancy, we returned to the reception to complain and 15 minutes later we were given a room on the first floor that was a little more spacious but had a really small bathroom, we decided it was probably the best we were going to get in this hotel and left our luggage and went to the bar for a drink. The bar stunk of food and yet nobody was eating at the time, the tables were sticky and after seeing the poor upkeep of bar we decided we'd definitely skip breakfast in the hotel the next morning! 
As previous guests have said this hotel is noisy at night, you can hear every guest passing on the corridors and wow were they loud!
I really wouldn't return to this hotel unless I had to as there are so many other fabulous hotels in Dublin to choose from that are cleaner, more spacious and have pleasant reception staff!",2,2015,03,20
247,Impressed family of six!,"We stayed for 2 nights with 4 small children and have nothing but nice things to say about this hotel - and possibly more importantly its staff.  From when we arrived to when we left each member of staff we had any interactions with were just so polite, welcoming and helpful.  We ate in the bar the first night and were some impressed that we planned out activities the next day so as to be back in time to eat there the second evening.  We felt so at home in this hotel - I cannot recommend it highly enough.  The price, location, food and genuinely homely or family-like welcome was so worth it.  I suspect they train or select their staff to take pride in customer service.  Ambassadorial (if thats a word!!) for Irish hospitality.  We would DEFINITELY stay there again.  Thanks to all the staff - well done.",5,2015,03,20
247,Nice hotel,"Managed to get a room for St Patrick's night.

Clean and comfortable well equipped  rooms.

Very good for the price you pay in comparison to other hotels in the area 

Only down side was the building work going on at the moment",4,2015,03,18
247,Well worth a visit here!,"What a lovely hotel from the exterior to the interior! Stayed here for 3 nights with two of my friends and we were very impressed.  The hotel was clean and all the staff were very friendly. Our room consisted of two single bed and one double bed and was far bigger than we expected.
We used the hotel as a base  as we were there mainly to visit the Temple Bar area all weekend. The location wasnt the closest to this area but the taxi only cost between 12.50 & 15 euro there.  It was 30 euro from the airport and all the taxi drivers were very friendly and helpful.
We originally hadnt booked for breakfast but ended up having breakfast there every morning and really enjoyed it, it was a buffet breakfast with the usual, toast, cereal, full Irish and gluten free options etc. There was more to but too much to list.
The resturant was clean and outside the garden was massive and well looked after.
The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, sorting out our taxi's and gave us some information and leaflets when we first checked in.
We would highly recommend this hotel and if you want to go to the Ariva Stadium it is right on your doorstep.
We will stay again.",5,2015,03,18
247,"Excellent hotel, shame about the bathroom.","Stayed for 2 nights to attend a show in the 3Arena.  Fantastic staff and service.  Clean room with a large comfortable bed.  Breakfast was great and the bar food even better - couldn't fault it. Catered for gluten free with ease.  Only downside was the extremely small run down en-suite, my husband couldn't stand up straight in the shower without hitting his head, & although it was clean it looked dirty because it was so old.  Other than the bathroom the hotel was well worth the money, We would definitely stay again.",4,2015,03,14
247,Average room great service,"Recommended hotel through a work collegue, so needed a base in Dublin for the night 
Room very basic and harsh fluorescent lights, bedside lamps did not work and room a litter depressing, however ticked the box for a quick overnight stay only

Bar good and atmosphere great

Breakfast good

Service makes up for the room standard with great regret 

Overall I will be back for the staff over the room standard as its a great place for ballsbridge and aviva full stop but little else",3,2015,03,13
247,Surprisingly Good,"Wined and dined here over the Rugby weekend. Staff very friendly and the place was jammed on Rugby Day., but as usual, rugby supporters were in great form. Lineout bar excellent venue , food was varied and well presented.  Definitely a place to consider when going to the Aviva for any event. Within walking distance of stadium, and the delights of Sandymount village or if you are fancying a bracing walk by the sea just beyond.",5,2015,03,11
247,"Great Hotel, but for 1 thing....","I've now stayed twice at the hotel, both times for a mix of business and pleasure. First stay was in the standard room and it was as expected for what we paid for. Decent room, no bother, clean and good sleep. Second stay was in the new refubished rooms, very nice, very clean, everything you could want for the value. Great location, friendly staff, easy access into the city centre. All is fine but one thing, the WIFI. If you're staying for pleasure and WIFI isn't important, perfect spot, no complaints, but because I needed it for business, quite terrible, to be honest, on both occasions. First time I needed to leave the room to even get a signal, mangaged to get a signal and had to sit outside to use it as it disconnected in the room, on all 3 Apple devices. Second stay, I requested when booking, a room with good WIFI, and it was even worse than before, in the new refurbished rooms. Again, had to pace the hallways to get a signal, when I was able to get 1 bar of signal in the room, the speed was woeful. The worst I've experienced, speeds of around 1mbs. I rang the desk but was told there isn't much they can do. It's a shame as it's much needed for my business needs. I'll be staying in Dublin again at Easter, and would love to stay again, but the WIFI is enough to make me consider elsewhere, sorry to say. Other than this, no complaints at all and would highly recommend if WIFI is not needed.",4,2015,03,10
247,Very impressed.....,"Stayed in this hotel last weekend Friday 6th and Saturday 7th of March.  If I was to pick one thing that was possibly a little annoying, it would have to be that it was quite noisy.  We stayed in room 526. Firstly, there seemed to be what looked like upwards of fifty something Spanish Students staying in our hotel on the Friday night. The students themselves were really well behaved but obviously with so many of them it meant it was extremely noisy the following morning.  Once they had vacated the hotel (around 7.30am) things became quiet again but alas this was not to last as the cleaning staff began their rounds.  There was a door banging incessantly just above us which I assumed to have been where items were stored for the purpose of cleaning staff - this I must admit was most frustrating.  Had I known precisely where the noise was coming from I would've gone and personally closed the door myself. Overall though, we had a very memorable stay - lovely room and very comfortable bed!  I would definitely visit this hotel again but I'd have to see if they had a quieter area.  Beautifully designed property ..... Yes! It gets a thumbs up☺☺",4,2015,03,10
247,An excellent hotel,"An excellent hotel for a business stay, The rooms in the newly refurbished wing are excellent. The Staff are friendly and helpful, its a real pleasure to stay there.
The only slight down side is the standard of food in the bar, a little more attention to detail from the cooks and the hotel would be perfect. 
Definitely a hotel to return to.",5,2015,03,09
247,In Dublin for a concert.,"First time to stay here in many years.Picked it this time for location, ease of car parking and a very special B and B price.
Into the city centre from the very near Dart Station.
A very short and inexpensive taxi ride back from the city after the concert (NCH)
Great breakfast in the morning then a stroll over to Sandymount and a walk along the seafront.
Will certainly go back (soon) on future trips to Dublin.
Friendly staff and good hotel",5,2015,03,07
247,Rugby and relaxation,"What a lovely surprise this hotel was! We had been booked in to attend the England v Ireland rugby match last weekend, but didn't really know what it would be like.
It's a great place to stay - especially convenient for the Aviva Stadium, but also in easy walking distance of a great beach area, some beautiful houses and quirky shops and bars.
Breakfast was the only meal we ate there, but it was generous and the staff very attentive. The buffet had a range of different cereals plus fruit, hot food, selections of bread and pastries...I could have happily grazed there till lunchtime!
Currently undergoing a refurb, this is a place we'd definitely go back to. Rooms were very clean and comfortable even though we were initially confused by the different staircases!
Cannot recommend it highly enough - shame the rugby result was not as good as the accommodation!",5,2015,03,06
247,It is a wonderful hotel!,The most important feature of this hotel is its location: it is located in a very nice district of Dublin where you can see the famous colored doors of Dublin and 5 min. to the city of Dublin by train. It is easy to get to the Hotel from Dublin Airport. We chose the Aircoach.The rooms are absolutely clean and comfortable.,4,2015,03,05
247,Ideal Hotel for seeing all Dublin has to offer,Having stayed in this hotel twice now I would never stay anywhere else.  The staff are friendly and the free wi-fi was brilliant.  I stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms and it was warm and modern with a fantastic wet room.  The fact it is right beside the Aviva stadium is a big plus but it also has a lovely villiage atmosphere with the Sandymount shops a short walk away.  We ate at the hotel for breakfast and dinner and found the food delicious and reasonably priced.,5,2015,03,05
247,Wonderful friendly hotel,"Has to be one of the best hotels i've stayed in. Have stayed in about ten hotels in dublin ranging from 2 to 5 star. For value for money and quality of Service this is the best.
Staff were helpful and everything was spotlessly clean. 
When bar had closed at midnight the member of staff at reception sent someone up with some drinks for us.
When we had to check in late; that was no problem. The staff are a credit; professional but warm, polite but efficient. 

There is free, safe, plentyful Parking and the location is fantastic. You're right beside Lansdowne road stadium, near sandymount and ballsbridge but you can walk to the centre or get a 3 minute dart train. 
If you are using dublin port, it is a 5/10 minute drive away.

I loved our short stay here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin. 

Didn't use the restaurant so can't speak to the quality of food.",5,2015,03,04
247,JUST GETS BETTER,"My party now on its 9th visit in 16 years for the Ireland v England match. Would never consider staying anywhere else. Its a pleasure to see the hotel expand and improve its facilities, and feel part of it. This year the improvements were to the bedrooms such as soundproofing,and a greater variety of bathroom toiletries
Always amazed at the organisation that falls into place on matchday.
Staff incredibly friendly and helpful. Special mention to breakfast girl Nicole who made sure our day started with a smile - surely worthy of promotion!!
Take a 10 minute walk down to Mulligans pub in the village - definitely worth a visit.
Hopefully back in 2017.",5,2015,03,04
247,Perfect hotel and close to Aviva Stadium,"Our first visit to this hotel and was not disappointed,this hotel has everything you need for a good stay.restaurant,bar,places to sit and have a coffee and chat,internet business room.
We stayed at this hotel to go to the rugby on Sunday but it's handy for the City,train station just round the corner from the hotel.on Match day it was heaving.....the staff were so nice though.....you could not get to the bar so a lady called Marie said we could have a coffee in the restaurant as we were travelling back that day....very obliging.the rooms were great,lovely fresh air through the windows,hardly any noise at all at night apart from a few revellers ha ha 
We will definitely return to this hotel next time in Dublin ......thank you Sandymount",5,2015,03,04
247,Great spot for Aviva Stadium,"Just back from 6 Nations Rugby and a very pleasant stay at this friendly hotel which is situated almost next to the Aviva stadium in Dublin.
The hotel was literally rammed with good humoured fans enjoying the day but the staff coped admirably and kept a smile on their faces late into the evening! In fact, they went out of their way to be helpful on a day that must be quite ""full on"" for them.
Our room 230 was perfectly adequate in size and comfort but we would have liked to be able to open a window as it was a little warm, even with rad off. Breakfast good.
Quick access into town using taxis or the Dart train which stops near hotel. An easy drive from Dublin port to this hotel.  Parking no problem at the rear of hotel. We will revisit when next in Dublin.",4,2015,03,03
247,Leisure,"As we arrived at the Sandymount Hotel, we noticed on the Hotel's Courtesy Coach ""Discover one of Dublin's Best Kept Secret"". It certainly was a very pleasant discovery.
It was our first time staying at the Sandymount and we were a Party of 4, (2 Couples).
We were allocated rooms 309 and 314, we did have the option of an upgrade to a newly refurbished Room for €15 euro a night but declined.
The Rooms that we were given were very pleasant, well equipped, except for a Radio, otherwise they had everything that one would require. We did not dine there but the Restaurant did look very appetising. The Breakfast the following morning was 1st class and could not find fault with it. Location is also someting that the Sandymount Hotel has going for it, it is only 5 min from the Aviva Stadium, and Ballsbridge and an 8 minute walk to the village of Sandymount.
As we checked out the next morning we asked to see the Up Graded Rooms and they were very well decorated and fitted with all Mod Cons incl a Walk In Shower.

We certainly will be back to the Sandmount for our next trip to Dublin.",4,2015,03,02
247,Friendly and first class!,"From the moment we walked through the door of the Sandymount we were cheerfully greeted by Emma on reception who checked us in quickly and efficiently. She was extremely helpful in pointing out local places of interest and travel alternatives.

The hotel is quite spread out but we eventually found our room which was spotlessly clean and very well appointed. The bathroom had a nice selection of toiletries.

The hotel is situated some little way out of Dublin city centre and the best way to and from the hotel is via the DART railway. The nearest station to the Sandymount is Lansdowne Road, and the stadium itself is only a couple of hundred yards from the hotel. The journey time from Tara Street station near the centre of Dublin is about 8 minutes.

We didn't have dinner at the Sandymount, but we did have breakfast on both mornings of our stay. The choice, freshness and presentation was excellent, with numerous healthy options as well as the traditional hot Irish breakfast items. The restaurant staff were also excellent, polite and attentive and going out of their way to please the guests - nothing was too much trouble.

Sandymount is very close to the coast - about a fifteen minute walk takes you to the beach where you can enjoy a bracing walk. On the way back through Sandymount village be sure to pop in to Brownes Café on Sandymount village green for a quick coffee and maybe a bite to eat. Definitely worth a visit.

Overall, our stay at the Sandymount was great - lovely hotel, good accommodation and good food - but most of all, lovely friendly staff who genuinely want you to enjoy your stay.

We will be back.",5,2015,03,01
247,Loved it,Great location for the stadium and the rds very clean smart rooms shower was great great service from Nicole who was on each morning for breakfast what a way to start the day we always stay here when on business in dublin,5,2015,03,01
247,Very smart,Great location for the aviva or rds very smart quite hotel rooms are a good size bathroom was great shower was the best but most of all we had the pleasure of the whirlwind they call Nicole on our breakfast service that is just what you want to start your day breakfast was fantastic ,5,2015,03,01
247,Always a great sleep.,I stay at the Sandymount every month and not had a bad time yet. Doing the Irish Motorcycle show over this weekend and have found everyone accommodating. The room has been comfortable with all the facilities I need. Breakfast is good and service great. Breakfast has been served by Nicole whilst I have been here- what a little pocket rocket. Great sense of humour and quick service too. She is polite yet quick witted to have a bit of banter with you as well. Great member of staff- keep it up Nicole. Many thanks ,5,2015,03,01
247,Great hotel,"I recently stayed in the Sandymount for the Ireland France game.  I picked it for the location to the Aviva but the hotel itself was great, even though it was full to the gills, the rooms were really quiet.  The staff were really efficient and helpful and there was a great selection of hot and cold food for breakfast. 

Definitely recommend this hotel  :)",5,2015,02,24
247,Great hotel - best we've experienced so far in Dublin,"Fantastic hotel with reasonable price per night. Staff friendly and attentive, hotel is clean, very quiet and conveniently close to the beach and to the city centre. Rooms cleaned and fresh towers given throughout the day even if you sleep in! We had a very positive experience and will certainly return again. The only negative aspect we experienced is that the shower in our room was very cold on the day we left (around 7-8am in the morning). I am not sure if this is an issue experienced at this time on the morning or a temporary blip - nevertheless we believe it should not sway others from considering a stay at this wonderful establishment.",4,2015,02,24
247,a home from home,"I have stayed several times at the Sandymount Hotel and each time has been a pleasant experience. It is a very clean and well run hotel in a good location with the City centre, the more suburban Dublin of Ballsbridge and the beach at Sandymount all within walking distance. The whole hotel has been recently refurbished and the rooms are in great condition. It also has the additional bonus of ample free parking.
I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2015,02,24
247,Weekend in bublin,"Fantastic weekend great staff great food and bar spotlessly clean 
Location perfect  local pubs are friendly and local restaurants are good value we felt safe on the streets at hight
Would not hesitate in going back",5,2015,02,23
247,"Great Hotel, Excellent Staff, Beautiful Neighborhood!","Emma's perfect service at the front desk started our absolutely outstanding experience at Sandymount Hotel.  We stayed for 7 nights in early February 2015.  Breakfast buffet was good, hot & cold.  Hotel is near Aviva Stadium, Lansdowne and Ringsend areas.  Take the walk out to the Lighthouse for some amazing scenery, exercise and fresh air.  Nice parks along the way back.  Go to Mulligan's Pub nearby.  From the hotel, it's a short 5 minute walk through a beautiful neighborhood to the DART, which goes to Tara Street where you can get off and walk right along the Liffey River to anywhere you like within 5 or 10 minutes.  If you need exercise, walk past the DART Station and take Northumberland Street up past Oscar Wilde's house, all the way to National Library of Ireland, museums, parks.  We are already planning our next trip to Dublin and definitely going back to Sandymount Hotel.",5,2015,02,22
247,Great Location and staff,"Brilliant stay.  My wife and I were down for the Ireland v France game in the Aviva and couldn't have got a better location.  Staff were very friendly on arrival late on the Friday night and the room was grand, the only downside was the staff in the bar were very good at keeping us in the bar to the wee hours on the Friday night :).  Cracking atmosphere around the hotel all day on match day.  We will definitely return to this hotel for any future games.  Honestly cannot recommend this hotel enough for staying in Dublin during match weekends.",4,2015,02,20
247,Good hotel. Good location. Excellent staff!,"Stayed over for the rugby last weekend. We were given one of the newly refurbished rooms - spotlessly clean, good size and very comfortable. We ate out in sandymount village for breakfast so can't comment on food. But atmosphere was great! Would recommend hotel to anyone.",5,2015,02,19
247,Brilliant Location,We have stayed a few times at his hotel usually to watch international rugby. Convenient location beside the Aviva Stadium. We where upgraded this time but that did not matter as we got the usual friendly family service. Highly recommended.,5,2015,02,18
247,GREAT LOCATION,"We stayed here for 3 nights whilst in Dublin. The hotel is situated right near Aviva stadium which is great if you are traveling to Dublin for this reason. Unfortunately we were not, thus, the price of the hotel was ridiculous for the Saturday night! Make sure to check Rugby game dates for your stay and avoid this hotel if you are not here for the Rugby as the hotel is very busy with lots of loud people drinking outside the hotel and public transport is a night mare if you need to escape it all! 

Other than that the room itself was basic, clean and comfortable. ",4,2015,02,18
247,Amazing staff!,We've just checked out after a three night stay in the Sandymount Hotel. It was our first time staying there. We thought it was terrific value and our room was beautiful but we wanted to write this review to particularly mention the staff. Everyone from the cleaners to the receptionists were so friendly and a special mention for Beatrice at reception who was so friendly and helpful and made our stay so memorable. We'll be back!! Paul & Katrina.,5,2015,02,18
247,"Wonderful first visit to Dublin, perfect hotel!","We had such an excellent time at Sandymount, I had to create an account just to rave about it!

The hotel itself is a short walk from the Aviva Stadium and from a Dart station - perfect for getting to and from Dublin and a lovely tour of the stadium (which I also recommend!). I suggest anyone who'd like to explore Dublin to grab a Leap card (acts just like an Oyster card for buses and the Dart).

We found all the staff at Sandymount to be very helpful and friendly to us. The receptionists in particular were very knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly. 

The hotel itself has been part renovated with the exterior, lobby and dining areas decorated to a high standard. There were some hallways that looks a little tired, that were in need of a touch up, but certainly not run down. The wi-fi was complementary and I had no trouble getting signal.

Our bedroom (which I believe may have been renovated, or if not certainly wouldn't need it) was a spacious double room, including TV, wardrobe, vanity desk/mirror with a lovely en-suite bathroom. The room was cleaned every day to an impeccable standard.

The bar and restaurant served drinks and delicious food at reasonable hotel/Dublin prices.

Though we did not have time to fully explore the small town nearby, it certainly looked like a lovely place to have lunch or breakfast. There is a tesco and other small convenience stores if you'd like to pick up any food/necessities. However, it lacked many places to have dinner out - although with central Dublin 10 minutes away on the Dart, you won't lack for places to eat in the evening.

We had a walk along the waterfront, which was absolutely lovely - I thoroughly recommend this to anyone staying at the hotel. 

Thank you for such a lovely few days - we will almost certainly be returning to explore the rest of Dublin, and stay in this wonderful hotel again :)",5,2015,02,17
247,Brilliant location ,"Great hotel to stay at, only 325m from the Aviva stadium. Staff on reception very very good. Breakfast good. 
Hotel is undergoing  a refurb and will be even better as the bathroom in my room more than in need of a lick of paint. That's the only reason not full stars",4,2015,02,14
247,"Friendly, comfortable hotel","We had two separate short stays in February, firstly on arrival in Dublin, en route for elsewhere, and then for 2 days to visit Dublin itself.  All staff (front desk, restaurant, and especially the bar staff) were very friendly and helpful.  There is a useful room with computers and printers, and several small lounges, some with real fires.  Our rooms were quiet and comfortable, with plenty of space and amenities. The only downside was that they were quite a long way from the reception/bar/restaurant.  The hotel is less than 100 yards from the Aviva stadium and the DART local railway, which is handy for getting into town.  Sandy mount village is charming and a short distance away, with the beach a bit further.

We would certainly return to the Sandymount on any subsequent visit to Dublin.",5,2015,02,14
247,Good first stay would stay again,"Was doing a course nearby so location was ideal for me. Hotel was friendly & staff were very helpful. They stored my laptop for me in the reception while I was out. The room was clean, sheets crisp white and the shower good n hot as was room temp. Breakfast good except black pudding& that only sml matter really cooked scrambled eggs one morn boiled egg follow morn v nice! All in all grand! ",4,2015,02,13
247,Lovely Christmas Present,"We were thoughtfully given a 2 night stay in this lovely hotel and flights from London as a Christmas present from our gorgeous children. The staff at this lovely hotel were so so helpful, as 1st timers in Ireland we were clueless, they told us all about the dart and even printed off the train times for us, they recommended places to go and seemed genuinely interested in how we had enjoyed them.The room was large & airy, although a very loud middle eastern gentleman !! on his mobile phone at 6.30am on a Friday morning in his adjoining bathroom was not really appreciated but that is not down to the hotel. The bar meals were lovely and very welcome after a long Friday seeing the sites of the Dublin and the exchange rate made it a very reasonable few days for us English.",4,2015,02,13
247,Great for a Weekend Break,"As a regular visitor, we are pleased to see the recent refurbishments. Easy access to the city, Sandymount and the Aviva are great advantages. A comfortable hotel in a great location. We will certainly be back soon.",5,2015,02,13
247,A home from home,"Last week we stayed  for just one night when we came to Dublin for the Jesus Christ Superstar show at the Bord Gais Energy theatre. We've been staying at this hotel a number of times each year over the years. Its a lovely quiet place with friendly management and staff who always make us feel welcome and give a very good service. Its less that a five minute walk to the nearest DART station and then a ten minute journey into the centre of Dublin. Its just next to the Aviva stadium. There is a great buzz about the area on the big match days. The breakfast here is always something to look forward to and we see improvements every time we come back. After staying in a variety of places in Dublin over the years we finally discovered the Mount Herbert (now the Sandymount hotel over ten years ago. We haven't stayed anywhere else since. Its a home from home so we keep coming back.

                                                                                                        John and Mary from Co Cork",5,2015,02,13
247,Really positive experience as a business traveller,"Spent a number of weeks here working on a project in Dublin.  Really positive, staff are helpful (allowed me to keep a bag in the hotel over the weekend, to save me from carrying it home and back).  Hotel rooms vary in size and quality, but I found even the ""worst"" room to be perfectly fine.

Food is surprisingly good, salmon etc, rivals some of the local really good eateries in Sandymount.  Decent wifi, never had issues connecting or streaming speed.

Negative's: if you want to head into central Dublin you have a 45 min walk, or a short train/taxi journey into town; 
room was really warm, which I personally dislike so kept a window cracked open

Definitely recommend it.",5,2015,02,13
247,"Lovely, cosy hotel in beautiful area","Have stayed at this hotel on a few occasions now and it is simply beautiful.  Staff are very friendly, the feel of a family run hotel. Excellent value for money and rooms are updated and modern. Free on site car-parking in a safe area. Just a short trip into city centre or short walk to the beautiful Sandymount village with some lovely cafes.  Ate in the hotel bar in the evening time and food was beautiful, lovely surroundings & nice and peaceful for us to take our 1 year old. Will continue to stay at this hotel when in the area.",5,2015,02,13
247,Great Place to stay,"I have stayed at this hotel previously and I would certainly recommend it. The staff were very much service oriented and really gave a personal touch to the experience. Sandymount is not in the city centre but close enough and is a very safe, nice part of Dublin.",5,2015,02,11
247,Friendly & comfortable,"We have just returned from staying here for three nights. The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful throughout our stay, and our room was lovely and a lot bigger than expected. 
It is undergoing a refurb which is needed in places, but a bit of paint in need of refreshing here and there really doesn't impact on our overall experience in a negative way. 
We really enjoyed staying here and had a few drinks and food here Which were also very nice. Staff from all departments always say acknowledge you with a greeting which is so lovely and gives the place the welcoming feeling that you just don't get with many other large hotels. Price is very competitive considering the available breakfast is beautiful. Not only is there and extensive continental style breakfast, there is also a cooked option. And I don't mean the plastic tasting crap you get in a cheap chain hotel, no, ingredients are locally sourced and actually taste like they are supposed to. Something we have never been fortunate to come across in a ""Hotel"", only privately run B & B's.
We would definitely sty here again as the location is right by the train station but nicely tucked away from the main hustle and bustle.",4,2015,02,11
247,Great budget choice in a quiet location,"Our third stay in two years, dictated by proximity to a family friend's apartment in Sandymount and an unbeatable quality/value ratio. Mid-week room-only rate for a double was £92 (117 euros) - less than most b&bs.
Generally positive experience - very friendly and helpful staff, pleasant public rooms and bar, good level of cleanliness - but our room felt a little tired: a loose tap in the bathroom, loo and basin both slow to drain, a stain on the carpet. Also a very small (three-quarter length) bath, so avoid Room 126 if you like stretching out for a relaxing soak with a book. The owners are midway through a refurbishment programme and these issues are probably related to our pre-makeover room.
We'll be back, to be sure. And if you're looking for a relaxed non-corporate stay just a little way out of town (although well connected via DART or bus) but don't want to pay through the nose, the Sandymount is certainly worth considering.
Top tip: there are a couple of laid back cafes on Sandymount Green, which is at the heart of the characterful Georgian/Victorian village ten minutes' walk away. These offer pleasantly varied and relaxed alternatives to the hotel's fairly predictable breakfast offering, so a room-only deal can make sense.",4,2015,02,06
247,Nice Hotel in Leafy Dublin,"I have stayed in this hotel a number of times during visits to Dublin. It is a very convenient hotel in a very safe and attractive part of Dublin. The hotel staff are pleasant, friendly and efficient. I have stayed here with friends and on some business related trips. Some of the hotel rooms are a little dated but they are clean and quiet. The bedrooms are being up-dated. The reception areas are bright and modern. There is a large safe car park. i will definitely be staying at the Sandymount Hotel again.

Elle",4,2015,02,03
247,"Comfort, location and value","We had stayed in the Sandymount before and were impressed by location, walkable to city centre and Sandymount strand for lovely walks, restaurants etc. Got a great deal this time also, booking directly with hotel. Reception staff and friendly and helpful. We were attending a family party in Blackrock, which was a bit further than I imagined. Got a taxi there, called by reception staff and although expensive I was impressed as I left a gift in the taxi and taxi driver returned it to the hotel and lady in reception rang me to let me know - great service! The room was on the small side but warm, comfortable and spotlessly clean. I would definitely return.",4,2015,02,03
247,Functional,"Stayed here for a Rugby game in the Avia with my husband & 2 daughters.  We normally stay in the Herbert Park but it wasn't available.  We requested adjoining rooms, which although was received by the hotel was not available on check-in.  After persisting, the hotel staff did accommodate this request - 20 minutes delay on check-in.  The hotel was clean but is cheaply furnished & the rooms can be tricky to get to so be careful about booking if you have any mobility issues.  The bar area & restaurant are soulless in décor.  The staff were helpful & friendly but even they couldn't make a silk purse out of this particular pig's ear!  If you are looking for a clean bed & room, without any attention to detail or if the overall decor & ambience is not important, this is the functional hotel for you.",3,2015,01,28
247,Wonderful stay,"I stayed here with my partner and friends and had the best stay. Everyone was polite, the room was comfortable and clean. Spent some time in front of the fire reading our books and the staff were lovely enough to keep us hydrate with tea and wine. Would recommend this place for a great stay in Dublin. ",5,2015,01,27
247,Warm Irish Welcome,From the moment we walked into reception the staff were welcoming and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. The bar staff were excellent and the food was really good. Guest rooms were large and airy finished to an excellent standard. This hotel is one I would definitely visit again.,5,2015,01,27
247,The Labyrint !,"When your bored of these chain hotels, come here. The first time getting to your room a GPS would be useful, however it was worth the walk. Great room, and a wonderful reception by the lady at the frontdesk. We spent a very pleasant two nights here,",4,2015,01,26
247,Useful rediscovery,"Briefly: if you are thinking of staying in Bewleys Ballsbridge, check this out first. I got it 25% less than Bewleys and parking was free. 
Near to RDS and Aviva  stadium. Modern rooms, full bar menu, standard hotel breakfast. Family run for many years, I used to know this as the Mount Herbert hotel and then forgot about it, so I'm glad to make the rediscovery. ",4,2015,01,17
247,Comfortable stay in a convenient location,"I spent two nights at the Sandymount Hotel last week as I was attending a training course nearby.  The location is excellent - even if you don't have business in the area, its proximity to Landsdowne Road Dart station means it is very accessible for the city centre.  I have stayed in this hotel previously and have always liked it.  The room was very comfortable, staff are friendly and efficient and the breakfast is very good.  I will definitely stay again.",4,2015,01,17
247,Comfort and luxury,"I stayed at this hotel for a four-day city break over New Year. 

The hotel is really excellent and I couldn't fault the service or room. 

We arrived via the Air Coach from Dublin Airport. It is a bit of trek to get to the hotel from the drop off point - you have to meander through several streets and a little village - but it took no longer than ten minutes to get there. The hotel is just a short walk - five minutes tops - to Landsdowne station from which the Dart train takes you into Dublin city centre in about six minutes. It costs 3.35 Euro for a day return ticket so not bad value. 

The hotel reception staff were really helpful - they told us all about the Dart service, booked taxis for us when we needed them and couldn't do enough to help us. 

The room was excellent. It was a twin but came with a double and single bed. There was a wardrobe and dressing table with mirror (I hate it when hotels have a mirror at the opposite end of the room to the plug so you have you dry your hair blind!), plus an arm chair, TV and kettle. The bathroom was spacious and had a shower and bath. The bath was a tad short (I'm only 5'4"" and couldn't get my full stretch) but it did fill up in record speed so I forgave it. 

There's free wi-fi in the hotel, too, which was fantastic. 

The bed was really comfortable. There was no noise and we had a very relaxed, peaceful stay here.",5,2015,01,09
247,Home from home!,"Great hotel in a great location, just get off the Dart at Lansdowne and walk around the corner. Helpful staff, good breakfast, but as usual breakfast coffee abysmal according to Wife (nothing new there, why is coffee so bad in hotels?) Nothing wrong with tea though!
Just a short walk to Sandymount village and some nice cafés. Overall can't fault it, clean, friendly, efficient and very convenient, totally recommended! ",4,2015,01,08
247,home from home,"We have been staying at the Sandymount for many years (and as Mount Herbert) and to return is like ""coming home"". The stay this time was a ""break"" before going back to the ""grandparenting"" stuff in the New Year! The ""winter warmer"" was excellent value and everything was as we expected from the reception on arrival to check out. We didn't move far this time and had meals in the LineOut bar. Service was courteous and first rate. Happy 60th birthday Sandymount and have a brilliant 2015. Hope to be back soon!!",5,2015,01,07
247,Pleasent stay at Sandymount,"We had a pleasent stay at Sandymount, staff was friendly, the room was clean and had everything you needed, even a hairdryer and iron board. The hotel bar had a great choice of food and drinks. It is close to the Aviva Stadium, a bit further out from the centre. The train station is only 5min away though.",4,2015,01,06
247,Comfort and great value,"Had 3 rooms booked for a family Wedding on the 19th Dec.  Even with building works going on, the staff were helpful, snacks and bar food great and the rooms very comfortable.
Good value for money. Excellent car parking.",4,2015,01,06
247,A fantastic New Year stay.,"Staying here for NYE was fantastic for the area the hotel is and the staff that helped make our stay a very pleasurable one. From the serving staff, to the reception staff and to the bar staff everyone made us feel welcome and gave us advice on where to go and what to see. The breakfast a all you can eat cooked breakfast with continental options was just what was indeed each morning after a few pints of the black stuff!

A honourable mention to the staff; Shane, Chris, Danielle, Dermot and Hannah - I know I have probably forgot some but thanks for a cracking time!",5,2015,01,03
247,Great stay!,"Excellent stay in a lovely hotel, situated in a great location. Hotel staff really friendly, polite and helpful. Even chatted to the owner who recommended places to eat and visit. Would definitely recommend this hotel... Especially as a rugby fan!  ",5,2015,01,02
247,Great find in central Dublin ,"Lovely family run hotel. Newly renovated and very cosy. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an affordable hotel in a great central location. Lovely staff and the food in the bar is good too. Will be back soon and look forward to staying in one of the new rooms. Well done to all the staff. 

",5,2014,12,30
247,A Dublin Favorite,"Recent work assignments have me visiting Dublin frequently and Sandymount is my preferred place to stay.  The rooms are comfortable and recent renovations add a touch of new to the charm of a Family run hotel.  The customer service is exceptional and the food is much better than I had anticipated.  The location for my work is prime, but everything is within walking distance including Grafton St., St. Stephens Green, and the amazing Aviva Stadium.  The event parties to support the local Rugby and Football games at the stadium are amazing.  Great people, great service...great stays!",5,2014,12,23
247,Extremely satisfactory,Thoroughly enjoyed staying here. Staff in particular were very obliging and friendly. I stayed there for over two weeks with work and was able to get a fridge put in which was a great help. Hotel was very well located in Dublin 4 with my offices very nearby,5,2014,12,23
247,"Great hotel, wonderful find 😄",My husband and I have just returned from a wonderful stay at this hotel. Beautiful and relaxing with very friendly and helpful staff. Small touches like fresh milk for tea and coffee and ice for our room just added to great experience . We also had dinner on Saturday night . Food was lovely and very nicely presented. For a relaxing break away I would definitely recommended this hotel plus the dart into the city is only 5 minutes away. It is safe to say we will be back. There are ongoing renovations at the moment but this is clearly advertised throughout the hotel and we had no disruption from this at all. ,5,2014,12,21
247,Comfortable and Central.,"Booked B&B on line, which was done in a prompt and efficient manner. Check in was a smooth and easy process
 Logging onto their WiFi was explained upon checking in and there weren't any issues. The hotel is refurbishing some of the rooms but this didn't impact. There is free car parking at the hotel. The room itself was clean and tidy and spacious. The continental breakfast 🍳 wasn't brilliant but was ok.  Check out was friendly and professional. Overall I would go back as the rate was great and they are going in a good direction. Hope to see what the refurbished rooms are like the next time.:-)",4,2014,12,13
247,Basic Hotel Under Renovation ,"Stayed in hotel while sitting finals, everything was extras, breakfast costly, staff could have been friendlier. Sound annoying of building works in evening. Website does hotel justice in current condition, it should let people know it's under renovation when booking !! ",3,2014,12,13
247,Sandymount at Christmas,"The Sandymount is a family-run, warm, friendly hotel.  I found the staff welcoming & very helpful.  I liked the proximity to the DART, to the RDS for Craft Fair & Sandymount Strand, where I walked each morning. It is an old-style hotel with a window in the bathroom for natural light which I liked. The room was quiet, warm & comfortable. I was able to walk to Dublin City Centre from here also which is a lovely walk.  There was a Gingerbread House also in the Hotel to raise money for Charity.  I had easy access to wifi. I will stay here again & recommend staying here to others.",5,2014,12,11
247,Business meeting rooms,"I have now had the pleasure to use the hotel meeting rooms on over 5 occasions and across 3 different rooms. The facilities were perfect for a group of 10-12. I have also attended a larger event there booked by the Sales Institute of Ireland (which must be a recommendation in itself). 

The management and staff were very helpful and friendly throughout. 

Great location for a meeting in the city...that feels like you are getting away from it all. ",4,2014,12,10
247,"Great trip, would come back again","I heard about the hotel through a work colleague. The hotel were happy to repeatedly change our booking based on numbers, size of room and was incredibly accommodating.
On arrival there was a confusion with the dates of booking which was quickly resolved and the receptionist was happy to accommodate us at the same rate as the other nights. 
Food was lovely, we only had the included breakfast though. 
Staff were friendly and helpful providing us with taxi's whenever required. 
Occasionally noticed one of the receptionist being slightly sarcastic, but think it comes with the territory. 
Rooms were absolutely lovely. 
Couldn't have stayed in a nicer place if we tried!
Would definitely come back.",5,2014,12,09
247,Noisy and dated,"Do not stay here if you want a decent nights sleep. At the time of booking I requested a quiet room as I was on a business trip and was to attend a day-long seminar early the next morning. The room I was allocated was located half way up a staircase. Straight away I went back to reception and expressed my concerns about noise from people using the stairs, but I was told that most guests use the lift! The door to my room was right on a small landing, halfway on a stairway, and the bed was just inside this door. So I was kept awake by the noise of guests who were up and down the stairs (loudly) all night. Secondly, there is literally no soundproofing-proofing whatsoever in this hotel. I could hear the TV, flushing toilets and the conversations of guests in the room next door. But loudest and worst of all was the noise of creaking floorboards as guests walked around in the room above me. This was 3.30 am. The bed might as well have been outside in the street with all the noise around me. 
The hotel is quite dated and the room itself was very average. When I checked in it was around 5.30 pm and when I got to the room the window was wide open so the room was freezing and I found a used bar of soap left in bath. There were broken tiles on the bathroom floor and broken shelves in the wardrobe.
On checkout I complained about the noise and lack of sleep and I was promised that the manager would phone me later that day. That was two days ago and I've heard nothing. No missed calls, nothing at all. Total disaster and total waste of money.
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and I will definitely not be staying here again. Spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere, there are plenty of other hotels in this area.",1,2014,12,08
247,"Good hotel, good service, and convenient for center of Dublin","My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in late Nov 2014. The hotel was in the middle of refurbishments, so I was woken at 8am by the glorious voice of the local hammer drill (Though my wife slept through it, so it cant have been THAT loud!)

The room (336) was nice, clean, and well equipped if a little dark. We were worried about being cold, as it was November, but the two radiators in the room put out ample heat, and i actually had to turn them down by the second night.

Reception, and the breakfast staff were always smiling, and polite, and genuinely helpful. The same could be said for the bar staff, as our food and Guinness were delivered quickly even though a large party were also using the bar area.

The hotel is situated close to Lansdowne DART station (Not Sandymount - its quite a walk if you make that mistake!!), which is only two stops from central Dublin, though you wouldn't know it, as the area is quiet and there wasn't much traffic (I'm sure its busier when there is a game on!)

Overall, would definitely stay again, but would have preferred not to have been woken by builders - i'd think this wouldn't have affected those commuting, or the earlybirds out of bed before 8am!",4,2014,12,04
247,Poor experience...,"A group of us were going to the Ireland v. Australia match in the Aviva Stadium and the hotel was chosen by a member of the group for its close proximity to the Stadium. 

The positives were that despite the large volume of people in the hotel post match (I presume they were booked out) our rooms were very quite and we weren't bothered by any outside noise. Also, the beds were very comfortable and the buffet in the morning was delicious as was the food in the restaurant. 

The negatives were that when we arrived the staff at reception were okay but didn't seem like they cared much and it took us quite a while to book in - she didn't seem to understand that one couple booked in earlier and the rest of the group were only booking in now (due to every road to the hotel being blocked off). The staff at breakfast were not in a great mood either. I asked for tea and the waitress didn't even acknowledge me. I was told we booked 3 double rooms but what everyone got was 3 single rooms but we weren't really that bothered. The bathroom was very run down and small and when I turned on the hot tap in the bath, brown water came gushing out of it. 

However, what was worse was trying to sleep in a room that was not soundproof at all! I could hear the people above us (two men) walking around all night then from 6.30am til check-out. It was a very heavy and loud foot traffic noise and at some points I could actually make out their conversation. I would have rang reception but its not the fault of the people upstairs, they were merely walking about. Needless to say, I didn't get any sleep at all.

I don't think I would stay here again considering there are many other hotels close by of similar price where I could have probably get some sleep.",2,2014,12,03
247,"Nice staff, good public areas, so-so food","Sandymount hotel is a collection of what were once suburban private houses, knocked-through into one bigger hotel. Therefore a bit of a labyrinth, but rooms are nice and clean and reasonably-sized, if a little outdated decor-wise. Staff throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful. 

Best bit about the hotel is the number of comfy tucked-away public seating areas; little nooks with sofas etc. Very nice. Downside was the food; mediocre sandwiches, over-salted soup, felt they were trying too hard for what they were actually able to deliver. 

My recommendation would be stay there, but eat elsewhere.",4,2014,12,03
247,Great Hotel Close to Light Rail,"This hotel was very clean, roomy and hospitable. It was within walking distance to the light rail system and about a 20 minute walk to the main part of town. The staff was very pleasant and helpful the entire time. The only issues we had were the thin walls and the keys. The walls were so thin I could hear the neighbors having an adult sleepover, but that was easily fixed by using some ear plugs. The keys seemed to deactivate very easily, so we had to keep going back and having them reactivated to get into our room. 

Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for those that want to sleep a bit out of the town in a nicer hotel.",4,2014,12,02
247,My favourite Dublin Hotel,"Never fails to deliver on value, hospitality, and top class service from a professional management and staff. The food is excellent, check in efficient, rooms well maintained, free secure parking, and most importantly a warm family type welcome from all staff. I never fail to be impressed by the friendliness and flexibility of all associated with this hotel. It certainly makes my business and pleasure trips to Dublin occasions worth looking forward to! Well done to all involved in the Sandymount Hotel.",5,2014,12,01
247,Warm Friendly Hotel,The front desk staff and management of the Sandymount are excellent.  From the moment my family arrived we were warmly greeted and treated excellent.  We had a meal in the restaurant which was excellent.  I highly recommend the Salmon.  The hotel was nicely decorated for Christmas and is close to the Dart and all attractions.  Thanks again to John and Beatrice for treating us so well.  We would definitely return next time in the area.,5,2014,12,01
247,Nothing to get excited about..,"I arrived at the hotel after a long flight. At the front  door of the hotel was a marquee with a pub pumping out loud "" republican songs"". A not too pleasant experience which I was told was "" normal"" when a match is played in the nearby Aviva stadium.

The price I got on my app was €30 cheaper than what the hotel quoted me on the phone. So go explore your app before staying here.

The hotel itself is chaotic in lay out. I kept getting lost and meeting other lost souls along the way.

BUT to my horror when I was checking out I inquired about a future booking date.. The receptionist quoted me almost €200.. For an average 3star hotel .. She said the "" owner always increases the price for special events.."" Be careful folks and avoid being ripped off for a mediocre hotel.. ",3,2014,11,25
247,Excellent Once Again,"We stayed in the hotel as we were attending the Toy show in the RDS. From the minute we checked in, we were made feel very very welcome. Beatrice recognised our little man from the last time we stayed. He was delighted and even more happy when the tub of lollipops was shown !! 
I cannot fault this hotel at all. Everything from the rooms to the breakfast is fantastic but the real icing on the cake is the staff. Especially the front of house staff. 
The hotel was very busy as the Ireland vs Australia match was on in the Aviva (literally a minutes walk away), but this did not stop Beatrice from taking the time to talk to Jamie and even gave him a hug goodbye when we checked out. Its the little things like that that really made our stay there so enjoyable. 
We will definitely be back. The hotel is very central for everything in Dublin, from the Bord Gais Theatre to the museums. Would highly recommend this hotel and thank you Beatrice from us and your ""favourite customer"" Jamie. PS: He is praying he wins the Gingerbread competition !!",5,2014,11,24
247,Comfortable but nothing special,"The Sandymount Hotel is OK, but not spectacular. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, but the bathrooms are tired - and small! The hotel is in need of some general TLC. Free wifi throughout the hotel but reception was sketchy in places. The bar is nice - and not massively expensive. Breakfast was adequate, with a good selection. Staff friendly and accommodating. All in all a good solid 2 star establishment in my view. If you want a little bit of luxury, then the Sandymount is not for you. If you want clean and friendly, and are not fussed about modern renovations and amenities, then you'll be fine here. Easy access to the city centre...2 minute walk to the train and 3 stops from all the popular tourist attractions; or alternatively about 20 minutes on foot. If you are there for rugby, then the Sandymount is ideal - literally about 200 metres from Aviva Stadium (Lansdowne Road).",3,2014,11,23
247,Very Nice,"Lovely hotel, very clean large rooms, nice staff very helpful. Having said this if its your first visit to Ireland wouldn't recommend as its too far out, the reviews said 10 mins walk not true we are 4 fit people in our 40's and it took us a good 25 mins to get to the city centre.  Taxi cost us around 15 euros. But everything is over priced in Dublin.",4,2014,11,23
247,Very Happy,I have to say great staff more than helpful makes a lovely hotel even better. I will defiantly be back great location and super value for money clean and so friendly .Thanks to all in the hotelfir a great couple of nights stay.,4,2014,11,21
247,Patrick_and_Maura,My husband and myself stayed in the Sandymount Hotel for two nights in November.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  The Bar Menu was delicious also Breakfast was excellent.  We were on the 3rd floor and the room was spotless very comfortable and quiet - we will be back.  Sweets at the Receptiion my husband enjoyed them.,5,2014,11,20
247,value for money!,"Stayed here with my 12 year old son as we had traveled up to Dublin for the Ireland v USA match, its location is great for the Aviva Stadium, however due to the match the roads around and to the Hotel had been closed off, so it was a bit of a nightmare trying to get into the Hotel, and after a 4 hour journey and  not having stayed here before, i was sent on a bit of a wild goose chase when i asked for alternative directions!! The hotel itself is nice, there was a great atmosphere due to the soccer match,the breakfast was really good and plenty to choose from, however the rooms are very basic, which doesn't really bother me considering i got a good BnB rate, the downfall was the noise from the other rooms, the walls are pretty thin so i could hear people upstairs and next door to us as well, so needless to say i didnt get much sleep,but everything else was fine and staff were really good and very pleasant.",3,2014,11,20
247,Good family stay,"Stayed here for a long weekend with the kids, staff were very helpful the whole time, especially when we'd just arrived and our son had been hit on the head by the taxi boot (he's fine now, btw).  Room was nice & large, comfortable beds.
As others have said, it's perfectly located for Aviva stadium and with a DART station nearby, easy to get to the city centre.
Breakfasts were good, all you can eat for not a lot and the quality was above average.
Would stay again :)",5,2014,11,18
247,Can't be beat for location if going to the Aviva!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night over the weekend as we were going to see the Ireland vs Georgia match at the Aviva the next day. This hotel is perfectly located 100m from the Aviva so we didn't need to worry about car parking the day of the match! Also, there is a dart station opposite the Aviva so getting into the centre of Dublin is quick and easy. Our room was fairly basic but it was clean and warm and there was ample room for the 2 of us. The breakfast buffet was brilliant :) Unfortunately we had to change rooms in the middle of the night as there was someone with a snore akin to a walrus in the room next to us!! However, we were moved straight away without any problems. Would definitely stay here again if coming back to the Aviva.",4,2014,11,17
247,Great hotel,This was the 3rd time my husband and I had visited Dublin so it was nice to be staying outside of the centre.  The Sandymount Hotel is a lovely friendly hotel and is ideally located for the Aviva stadium.  The DART station is only a short walk away with the city centre about 2 stops. ,4,2014,11,17
247,Great location and staff but needs updating,Myself and a work colleague stayed in the Sandymount hotel in October. Firstly I must say the location was fab as we had a conference in the aviva stadium and it's literally a stones throw away. Upon entering the hotel it seemed nice and first impressions were good and the staff were really friendly. Checked in for our 4 night stay and off to our rooms.. Leaving reception we were pointed in the direction of the rooms and I noticed that the standard had dropped greatly - it seemed we had taken a step back into the 70s from the decor and smell. We each had a cosy room and were on the same floor.. 500s. My room had a single bed and a double.. Bathroom and the usual storage facilities. Oh and fruit flies and a window that didn't close properly and reported to reception who said it would get sorted but it didn't.. I bought some fly spray and sorted that issue myself. I suppose it was a base to stay and we weren't there that long. Nice bar area and food was good - it's right next to the dart station and 6 mins will get you into Dublin centre. It's also in a lovely location within walking distance of ballsbridge where there are some gorgeous restaurants- lovely Italian and lovely Thai both reasonably priced too! We booked this hotel on location so was pleased with that but the decor and dirty windows etc need a major update. A bit disappointing all in all - oh breakfast was good :-),3,2014,11,16
247,Lovely helpful staff,"It is what it is. We were very happy with this hotel for the price and location.
Sadly the first night we didn't get much sleep due to noise from the people next door (room 304) I complained first the next morning and the staff were great and changed our rooms without a fuss. The second night I had a very good sleep. Customer service is excellent and we were impressed. Would stay again. Thank you Sandymount!",4,2014,11,16
247,Lovely hotel!,"Me and my boyfriend were pleasantly surprised with this hotel! The hotel is big, the location is great and the staff was nice. Our room was the best surprise! It was spacious and warm and just renovated. The hotel is definitely a good value for the price you pay for it. The only minuses we could think of was that for any extra, for example borrowing an adapter for a minute ,as mine broke, would have costed me 5€. Also the walls were quite thin so you can hear the people in rooms next door taking a shower etc. However this didn't affect our sleep at all! All in all this is a great and rather cheap hotel in a lovely area of Dublin!",4,2014,11,15
247,Smoking,"Very nice hotel,good food,friendly staff.But I was disgusted after I had left the hotel to receive a phone call saying that I had been smoking in my room. That of course was not true. I smoke in my vehicle and naturally smoke gets into my clothes. This was presumably what was smelt in my  room. They have a charge of 200 euros for anyone caught smoking but I get the Impression that they push this to make extra money from customers. I do not recommend this Hotel to anyone who Smokes. Alan Tangui from Nottingham",3,2014,11,14
247,Good location,"Stayed here for an Autumn international weekend and for the price was very good value, room was good and tidy and bathroom okay. Loads of parking room round back and is in great vicinity for any events at the aviva stadium and not far away from the restaurants and nightlife in the ballsbridge area. They also have a very good setup for rugby weekends with good bar and outdoor tent areas, which helps add to the atmosphere of match day. Would def use again",4,2014,11,11
247,Come in from the Cold,"A labyrinth of passageways and grubby carpets, shower curtains that smell of mildew, yet I return here every year, like a swallow seeking a familiar warm overhang to nest in. Staff  are warm and friendly, and there is ample parking.Good breakfast and a very tasty lunch and bar service is consistently good. I love the little wood fire that burns in the reception room in the autumn and winter months, a refuge from the cold, it offers a cosy place to meet friends or conduct a business meeting.
The hotel’s proximity to the DART and of course the Aviva Stadium and RDS make it a popular venue for ruby fans, and the RDS draws event organisers and attendees. I stayed there during the Irish/South African rugby match and the hotel was packed, yet my large room was well insulated and surprisingly quiet.  If you are not a sports fan, be sure to check the calendar before you book. The hotel fills to capacity and room rates soar when there is a match or an event at the RDS. I would recommend this hotel for its homely feel and the great location.",5,2014,11,11
247,Location and friendliness,"Excellent location very welcoming and friendly lovely atmosphere and excellent breakfast .bedroom while comfortable and very clean was quite small , definitely would not put me off visiting again though.",4,2014,11,09
247,Nice hotel,"Stayed here last Tuesday night for an event at the Aviva, picked this hotel due to the lack of availability at the usual haunts, this was due to the web summit.....

Pleasantly surprised, good rate considering the demand.

Ample parking, rooms are basic and could do with some updating.

Nice bar, had the rib eye steak which was great, very friendly bar and waiting staff, they know how to make a proper Irish coffee ( believe me this is now quite rare!)

Breakfast was good and served in nice surroundings.

Overall I was quite pleased and would now consider staying here again for leisure..",4,2014,11,08
247,Brendan Borg,"Visited this hotel when attending the web summit. Its a hotel that exceeded my expectations in terms of food, staff efficiency and location. It is ideal forbpeople attending any evebt at tge RDS or stadium since it is only a stones throw away Would totally recommend it.",5,2014,11,08
247,"""Great location and pleasant staff""","Our family stayed at Sandymount Oct 25-27, 2014. We were very happy with our stay. The location was outside of Dublin center but within walking distance 2 Km or a short walk to the DART station.   The staff recommended several delightful restaurants at Sandymount Green which is a short walk from the hotel and a perfect way to end a day of sightseeing.  We also were able to catch the Hop-on Hop-off Bus in front of the hotel which brought us to into Dublin center for tour.
The room was clean and ample size. There was early morning noise from the back parking lot which our windows faced but otherwise it is situated in a quiet neighborhood.",4,2014,11,06
247,"Comfortable, Great Location, Quiet","The Sandymount is ideally located near a Dart station which makes for a very easy trip in and out of the center of Dublin.  The room was clean, comfortable, though perhaps a bit on the small side.  The bathroom was clean, maybe a bit dated.  All in all for the price, this hotel was an excellent bargain and I would certainly recommend it to anyone traveling to Dublin who does not need to be in the very center of the city.  Excellent and very helpful staff.  Very good food for room service.  Nice and quiet during my stay.",4,2014,11,06
247,Not a bad place at all,Stayed here for a couple of nights. We had our evening meals in the hotel on both nights and the food was excellent. The staff were very friendly and efficient throughout our stay. The room could have done with some modernisation but was very clean so that's not a major complaint by any means. You could do a lot worse than stay here. Oh and it's very handy to the Aviva Stadium if that's what you need.,4,2014,11,04
247,Location is the best thing about this hotel.,"I stayed here with my partner as we had an early start in Dublin city centre and so needed a bed for the night before.  The Sandymount Hotel is fairly close to the city centre and thus the location was perfect.  Walking into town is quite doable from here if you are fit and willing, and the DART station is close by.  We opted to take a taxi into the city centre, which cost about ten euro.

The reception staff are friendly - we asked if we could leave our cars parked at the hotel until the late afternoon, even though we would be checking out at noon.  The staff were happy for us to do this, which we appreciated.

The room itself was small, but presentable.  The bed seemed to be comfortable at first but it was soon apparent that it squeaked with the slightest movement.  There was additional noise from the occupant of the room over ours, whose bathroom noises were quite audible (a little frustrating when trying to get to sleep).  However, there was no traffic or street noise.

The bathroom was perfectly adequate with a nice shower, and no lack of hot water.

Breakfast was plentiful, and typical, with a selection of Continental and Irish breakfast foods.

After we checked in, we dined at the hotel's own restaurant (search for Sandymount Hotel Restaurant) - this is not recommended.  The service here was very poor.  Go elsewhere for your bite to eat!  Similarly, the bar was very noisy, possibly due to a match at the close-by Aviva Stadium.  Not a place for a quiet drink!

Overall, this is fine for a bed for the night close to the city centre.  The location is the best attribute.",3,2014,11,04
247,Great hotel & great location,My wife and I went to Dublin on Nov 2. We went mainly to see the FAI cup final at the Aviva stadium but we lost - different story! Anyways hotel and staff anre very good and accomodating. Room was excellent and despite number of guests it was very quiet. If you are going to an event in the Aviva this is an excellent location. The DART is 5mins walk away to you can get into central Dublin in 10-15mins. The hotel also has free car parking which is a great benefit. Only downside is that there is now restaurant at night but they do serve bar food.,4,2014,11,04
247,Dublin Delight,My wife and I vacationed in Ireland for our 35th wedding anniversary.  We spent 7  days in the country and 8 days in Dublin.  We wanted a hotel that was in a quiet area and found the Sandymount.  Tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood yet close to the DART and Aviva stadium this hotel was perfect for our needs.  Only a five minute walk to the DART and then 3 stops (10 min.) to downtown was a great transportation plus.  The hotel breakfast was good however there were several places nearby for a fun local flavor (Patrick's).  The bar food menu was nice and the food was actually pretty good.  The staff were friendly and helpful and they were kind enough to arrange an early check-in for us when we arrived.  All in all a great place to stay.,5,2014,11,03
247,"Grand but, not great.","I stayed here for the dublin marathon for location. The hotel was okay, fairly clean and my room was a a good size. Everything was slightly below average, decor, breakfast and staff in the bar were all only okay.  Location was good and the price for that I got was good.",2,2014,11,02
247,Great Hotel.. Very Comfortable!,"We decided to stay another night in Dublin so we made a booking in this hotel and we are so glad we booked in this hotel. Parking was free, Wi-Fi was free and fast, and it’s in a good location.
The hotel reception and lounge are beautiful! Staff at the reception were welcoming, friendly and helpful. The rooms are excellent; clean and very comfortable. Only one complaint however, the remote for the TV was not working properly. At first I thought it was just the volume control that wasn’t working, but then when I was trying to turn the TV off, it just wouldn’t turn off so I had to unplug it from the wall. Other than that, excellent!
We also had lunch here the next day. The food was nice and the staff gave great service. I would definitely stay again in this hotel in the future and recommend it to friends and family.",4,2014,11,02
247,"Very nice, but not close to city centre","Very nice hotel, staff are lovely. But it was to much time and effort having to get the Dart train in and out everyday to the city centre. Also water for the bath is terrible, it was all brown so couldnt have a bath, probably cause ireland has crappy water supply ha",4,2014,11,02
247,Very nice but bathroom could do with an upgrade was a bit dated,"Bathroom could do with an upgrade as it was a bit dated, room lovely otherwise, location was good as we were going to RDS only 10 minutes walk. Staff were helpful when checking in and drew on the little map for us to go and have a coffee in town . ",4,2014,11,02
247,Love this hotel,"I visit Dublin a lot on business and when I can I stay in the Sandymount Hotel.  

The staff are really the best thing here. No matter what my query they are always happy to provide a solution. 

It feels like my home from home and that is hands down thanks to the staff. 

A bonus is the great location, free parking and Wi Fi.  

I highly recommended the hotel. 

 ",5,2014,10,31
247,good location,"Stayed here for two nights in an executive room. We chose this hotel as it was convenient for visiting relatives in Sandymount. The room was very comfortable and quiet. The breakfast was as good as any buffet breakfast I have had elsewhere, plus they will cook eggs to order.
The location was great for Sandymount, but better than I expected to access the centre. It was about five minutes walk to the Dart Station. The train takes less than 10 minutes to get to Pearse Station. All in all it was a good hotel, in a great location, especially for the rugby. We would definitely stay again.
",4,2014,10,29
247,Reception staff not too helpful,"We stayed twice, one week apart. The first stay was fine, room was not far away, facilities looked nice and restaurant food was good. Located in a nice central location to the DART rail service. Second stay was not pleasant. Room was about as far from the reception desk as could be. Hotel is very chopped up, steps/ramps and long curving hallways. The floor in the bathroom had several cracked tiles, because the subfloor was spongy (frightening) and in need of some work. The Dublin City marathon was the next day and the street in front of this hotel was to be closed. The reception staff knew this, and confirmed it,if asked, but did not know the time the street would be closed. For persons driving in an unknown city this presents a real challenge for someone to get to the airport at a specific time.",3,2014,10,29
247,"Friendly, convienent, relaxing","We stayed here for a one night stay, while at a function in the city. Location is perfect, close enough to city centre (by dart or taxi) and also close to Sandymount Village and a stroll by the sea. Staff had the right balance between friendly and lettiny you mind your own business. Room pleasent, comfortable and clean. We will be back, again.",5,2014,10,28
247,Only people in Dublin that didn't smile!,"Stayed for one night in September. On initial arrival the man behind the desk seemed uninterested and hardly looked at me once as I checked in, this was summed up when, after telling me he didn't need me to spell my name, he checked us in as somebody else and we went to a room with somebody else occupying it, and their belongings already there. When we returned a much more helpful woman checked us in properly, I think she was a manager, and we went up to our room. The room itself was very nice, an iron, kettle, teas and coffees, an extensive room-service menu, everything you need. The bathroom was a little dated but was pleasant nonetheless. That evening, we sampled the restaurant, I tried a pint of Guinness, whilst my partner had a glass of wine, both reasonably priced as far as a hotel bar was concerned. The food was also standard, nothing special but nothing to complain about either. We were served by a waitress called Laura, who was particularly helpful with getting together a starter of breads, oils etc that wasn't on the menu and generally being one of the few people in the hotel that smiled!",3,2014,10,27
247,Great budget hotel,"I was very pleased with the Sandymount hotel.  The staff was very friendly, the rooms were both affordable and comfortable, and the hotel itself was conveniently located.

The next time I'm in Dublin, the Sandymount will be my first choice.",4,2014,10,26
247,Great value with parking included,"This hotel is excellent value for money.5 mins walk to Lansdowne Dart station for easy connection to city centre.
The hotel is old but well maintained.Comfortable beds and if you go for Executive rooms -spacious.
Breakfast is a bit basic.
I have stayed here a few times and would highly recommend it.
If you have time for a leisurely breakfast ,go for room only and stroll into Sandymount where Brownes offer a wide variety of breakfast dishes.
The breakfast in the hotel is adequate, just not my kind of thing.
Staff are excellent.Also no charge for car parking.very safe location.",4,2014,10,25
247,Wonderful stay and great staff! Very customer focused!,"We chose Sandymount based on Tripadvisor reviews when we could not get into Ariel House. It was an excellent decision all around. We try to avoid staying in the center, as it is too touristy and very expensive for what you get. We like the Sandymount/Ballsbridge area and specifically wanted to stay in the area again so we could repeat a wonderful meal we had at The Chop House last year.

The hotel itself is in a beautiful neighborhood and a very easy walk to the water. Not a bad walk into the center either, though it is very near a DART station so very easy either way. The rooms are very large and nicely done. We love the fact that it is a set of terraced houses - the circuitous route to some of the rooms is a consequence of that, but it did not bother us at all. And as noted previously, planning restrictions on older buildings won't allow you to tear down walls and rearrange the layout.

The standout experience for us was the staff at Sandymount and the owner John (who I believes responds to each review posted here). We were headed to Chop House for dinner and asked for directions at the front desk. The woman at reception said that the night manager would be happy to give us a lift in the shuttle (which is, incidentally, available to pick up guests at the nearby bus stop from the airport on advance request). We gladly accepted and were then told by the manager he had one more passenger (his boss) that would be on his way shortly. His boss turned out to be the owner, John. We had a very congenial visit with him in the shuttle. He told us about the history of the hotel (his family has owned it for 60 years), and he asked us about our stay. When we asked the driver to drop us off at Slattery's (a great pub across the road), John laughed and said he was headed there too, to meet his daughter and friends before dinner at the Chop House. When our drinks came, we were told John had picked up the tab for them himself. We had another nice visit over at the Chop House, meeting daughter and friends and talking about Dublin. It was really like meeting up with old friends rather than chatting with a hotel owner. 

That experience really stuck with me as exceptional, and to me speaks worlds about Sandymount Hotel, its history in Dublin, and way they treat and value customers. I have found in my business dealings that the culture and values of a business and its staff reflects the culture and values of the owner and upper management. That certainly appears true of our visit to Sandymount - the staff were universally friendly, accommodating, and customer focused. 

We will always return to Sandymount on our visits to Dublin.  Thanks again, John for the warm welcome and wonderful hospitality! We love Dublin and Sandymount. If you are ever in Washington state, the next round is on us!   Lisa and Jim",5,2014,10,24
247,Mr & Mrs Kelly,"We stayed in sandymount hotel on the 20th of october for 3 nights had a fantastic stay, staff where really friendly and helpfull, food was great, hotel was lovely and clean, would recommend it to anyone, cant wait to come back 5 stars.",5,2014,10,23
247,"A five star experience,","Having stayed recently for the first time at the Sandymount Hotel, I was impressed.  We were greeted with a warm welcome & all my many queries were dealt with in an efficient & polite manner.  I was pleasantly surprised by the bedroom which was bright, fresh & spotlessly clean, as was the bathroom.  As we were attending a function elsewhere that night, we didn’t have an opportunity to dine in their restaurant, however we did have breakfast there the following morning & again the staff we met were courteous & professional.  The variety on offer was excellent & the hot food was freshly cooked.  Another huge bonus for us was the free parking.   The DART station was just a short stroll from the hotel & we were in the city centre within minutes, without having to worry about city centre driving & parking.  Without a doubt, we enjoyed a five star experience at a very affordable four star price.  I look forward to my next visit to Dublin.",5,2014,10,22
247,"Confortable, right location, nice staff","I had an wonderful time in the Sandymount hotel.
I stayed in the hotel for 5 days and had the opportunity to check everything.
What it was good:
- Staff: Friendly, Reception had all the information about where to go by bus, train or even walking. Restaurant had excellent service.
- Food: I had the chicken hamburger and a pasta. Very good. Not french cuisine but came as I like it.
- Room: white and clean sheets. No bad smell at all.
- Nights: No disturbing noise even with wood floor. Some noise about 10pm and 8am because of wood floor but nothing that disturbs.
- Location: close to Lansdowne Road station and close to Sandymount stores where there is a Tesco and others usefull stores.
- Lobby area: nice rooms to chat.
- Wifi: always available when I needed. Free

What it was not that good:
- TV on the room. I would like a bigger one and not such in that position. It was too high
- No freezer in the room but they can keep in a freezer whatever you need.
- Furniture looks old.
- Window needs fixing but nothing bad.
- Curtains looks old but clean.",4,2014,10,21
247,Lovely staff but a bit awkward to get around,"We stayed in this very well situated hotel, just beside the Aviva Stadium, for a weekend break. The staff could not have been kinder or more obliging and we really felt welcome. The room was clean and tidy, if a little dated. The breakfast was excellent with an ample supply of good food and not too much choice. Too much choice can be a bit of a mistake, it's better to get the basics right and this they certainly did. Coffee and tea hot and fresh. Freshly fried eggs, none of the scrambled ones that might have come out of a packet. The hotel has free parking and plenty of room for cars. The one thing that got to us was the fact that the property consists of a number of buildings that have been incorporated into a single entity. This meant that finding ones room took a little ingenuity at times, overall, we would heartily recommend this as a comfortable place to stay.",4,2014,10,21
247,Second stay - staff excellent again,"This was our second time at this hotel having stayed there two years ago, We availed of a very reasonable rate and found it good value. Once again the staff were most friendly and very willing to help. Breakfast was excellent with good choice. We ate in the bar one night and although the menu is limited the food was delicious. One negative about our room was the wafer thin walls. We could hear every noise next door including happenings in the bathroom. I notice other reviewers have mentioned this also. 
The location is lovely and quiet yet near enough to the city by train or bus. Certainly a good base to tour around the city or south suburbs i.e. Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock.",4,2014,10,20
247,Nice Hotel on the outskirts of Dublin,"I have just recently returned from a city break to Dublin with my friend staying at Sandymount Hotel. The hotel is ideally placed for the Aviva stadium but a good 30 minute walk into Dublin but the Dart railway station is less than 10 minutes walk away which just under 4 euro return is ideal as within three stops you are in the centre.

The hotel itself was very pleasant clean and comfortable nothing special but then we didn't go to spend our time in the hotel. Ideal if you want to be away from all the hustle and bustle.",4,2014,10,20
247,Alright but nothing special...,"My partner and I stayed here for a night to see a concert, the location is easy to find and within walking distance of everything...

For this hotel you have to take the good with the bad, I had booked online but had paid more for the room than I had booked it for as it was on card which was not taken until the stay. The lobby is quite active and busy but that's not really a problem, I was arriving early so I had requested an early check-in and received confirmation that this was ok, but when It had arrived there was a younger male staff member at reception who seemed quite rude, he noted our request but after a three hour drive from Northern Ireland he told us we had to wait until three as there were no rooms available despite the foreword of the early arrival. We asked if there was a bus to the concert as it had said on the website but he had said he hadn't known and would find out... He didn't.

After waiting around for a few hours we re-entered the hotel for our check-in, a blonde woman with glasses was on the reception and was PHENOMENAL and very friendly, going out of her way to help each guest with queries. She booked us onto a shuttle bus for €3 each which was great and dropped out to the 3arena, the driver was fantastic and gave us directions on how to get back safely if we were walking back to the hotel. The food in the hotel bar was delicious and I would have liked to try the restaurant but had to keep to a tight schedule.

The room was standard if not a bit smaller than what I am accustomed to other hotels, I have stayed in better rooms for a lower price and it was a bit cold but overall served the purpose for our stay. Free parking is also a bonus and Free Wi-Fi is picked up all over the hotel, the room was clean and fir for its purpose, their was a small toilet problem with a broken handle meaning you had to flush it a few times before it would work.

I would like to praise the food, the blonde women on the staff and the amenities but overall the hotel was just alright and I would perhaps look for another if I was staying again as you can get better for less.",3,2014,10,18
247,"Nice hotel, not too far away from town.","Nice hotel that isn't too far from town. There is a dart (train) station which is 10 mins walk away from hotel, which leads to the centre of Dublin. You can also walk along the canal from the hotel to town, which took about 45 mins to walk.

It was a nice hotel. We stayed on a b and b basis. The breakfast was always tasty and fresh with loads of variety (full cooked, smoothies, juice, fruit, continental, cereal, toast). If you want porridge, (like my sister did ) be warned it takes soo long to be brought to your table. I think it was made fresh, hence why it took a long time.

We were thinking about eating at the restaurants but we sat down and saw the prices and decided they were way to expensive and then walked out again.

One day we went on an early morning tour and we weren't sure how it would work out with breakfast. However the hotel were great. You order it the day before and on the morning you need an early breakfast, you collect the breakfast goodie bag from reception.

Nice clean, spacious room. We booked a twin room, which had a double and single bed in. The only down size was the size of the bath. Both my sister and I had a bath and we had to have our feet out of it, as it was too short. I am 5.4 and my sis is 5.6, so it's not like we are soo tall.

As soon as we arrived we were greeted by friend staff at the desk, who were happy to show us maps of where we were and how to get to town, sandymount and more if we needed. The hotel also has some computers for guests to use, which were free!!! We also had access to printers, which were also free to print from. As well as having free wifi through all the hotel.

Would def stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2014,10,18
247,Great Experience,"A friend and I stayed at the Sandymount when we were visiting friends in Dublin for two night. The hotel is situated in a lovely area, with great pubs and restaurants around the corner. The staff were very warm and accommodating; they helped us with any questions/queries we had. Our room was ideal and we enjoyed the delicious food the hotel has to offer. Definitely will be returning again on my next visit to Dublin!",5,2014,10,18
247,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. It is such a lovely hotel, with the nicest of surroundings and really lovely people, who were warm and welcoming. The food was great and the girls were very helpful with helping us to get around the city. We look forward to returning next year.",5,2014,10,16
247,Excellent Service!!,The reception staff are a credit in this hotel! I was on my way to a match in Croagh Park when I realised I locked my keys in the boot. The reception staff insisted that I go to the game. They looked after my car and organised someone to retrieve the keys. I am so grateful I saw Mayo win that day!! Thanks again ladies :-),5,2014,10,16
247,Pretty good,"Probably more 'good' than 'average' just not 'very good'.

The place is in a good spot if you're going to the Aviva Stadium at the top of the road. Having arrived on a ferry at Dublin Port it was a 15 minute drive to the hotel. We were much earlier than we had expected but the reception staff were able to find us a couple of rooms that were ready. Much appreciated after an early start.

My room was pretty big, modern and clean. There's a tv, a kettle and a small safe. No complaints.

The bathroom was also quite large with a bath/shower, although the shower curtain did give off a damp smell.

Didn't eat anything other than breakfast as there are loads of restaurants and bars about 20minutes away near the American Embassy. The breakfast was the usual choice of cereals and hot stuff. Could've done with a better selection of fruit as there was only a bowl of fruit salad left. The breakfast area is pleasantly large and the staff were good at offering coffee/tea refills.

I didn't need to go into the centre of Dublin but you might find it's more of a taxi ride than a walk",3,2014,10,14
247,Convenient to RDS,"Stayed here for one night with my sister as we were attending conference in RDS. Rooms & service was v good. Rooms are small but clean & comfortable. Walls are v thin, can hear conversations as people walk out on corridor. We arrived late but restaurant still served us happily. We were met by one member of staff who was reluctant to help when we were checking out. We had asked if we could leave our car there while we attended conference when I booked and I was told I could..but male member of staff was quite rude saying ""well I don't know who said you could..If you'd asked me I would have said no! However he did agree to let us leave car there for the few hours we attended conference Saying my car wouldn't get clamped.This was the only smudge on a perfect review. Would  stay here again as it was convenient to RDS and Aviva!     
",4,2014,10,12
247,my stay,"Myself and my husband stayed in this hotel for 1 night on 10th October 2014as we were meeting up with family members. I was really disappointed with my stay, room was small, no fan in the bathroom,  so when a shower was had, the whole mirror steamed up. We had dinner in the bar, I asked for steak MED-WELL and it arrived rare-med, no pepper sauce on menu, but it came with a sauce and was so over powered with  vinegar I couldn't eat it so I gave it away and went hungry. The bar is a nice area and very clean. Staff are really nice too, but I don't think I would rush back.",2,2014,10,11
247,Hotel with a lot of Character,"Stayed in Sandymount hotel for 4 nights back in august. Hotel was very nice, it's got a lot of character to it. The breakfast is good. Unfortunately I didn't have dinner in the bar so I can't comment. The bedrooms we're always spotless when I came back from work. Will definitely stay again
",5,2014,10,09
247,Great Hotel - Would stay again!!!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel while we were attempting at the time to find accomodations in the area.  The Director and his staff took very good care of us during our stay.  The Director would personnaly chat with us about our ""flat hunting.""  My wife's hand was aching at one point and he had the kitchen staff bring up some ice to soothe it.  We enjoyed the food available to us in the restaurants and house keeping never disappointed.  The staff went out of the way even to recover my lost laundry bag.  We will be sure to encourage all those going to Dublin to use the Sandymount Hotel during their stay.

 

Thanks again for everything,

Brendan Greene",5,2014,10,08
247,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed here two weeks ago fo the first time. I found the hotel suitable for all my needs, it's a short walk to the lovely village of Sandymount, a two minute walk to the dart station.
The hotel shuttle dropped us to theatre.
The rooms are clean, and spacious and very well equipped with tea and coffee making facilities, and free wifi. Food in the bar was really good, and not over priced compared to some places in the city. Try their seafood chowder, it's the best I have ever tried. I would stay there again for sure.",5,2014,10,07
247,Not very good ,Luckily I was only staying one night. If it's a restful night sleep you want this is not the hotel for you! From 7:00am it sounded like some one was dragging something up and down the floor on the level above us. The walls are paper thin so you can hear people's conversations as they walk up the hallway.  And the rooms aren't exactly pretty ether. ,2,2014,10,07
247,Dubliner in Dublin,"I won tickets to a rugby match in the Aviva and a stay in the Sandymount Hotel, and so ended up staying the night even though I live in Dublin anyway. As such, my experience may be somewhat uncommon.

The staff was absolutely lovely, despite being harried by the match day crowds, and took time to check that the kitchen could accommodate my companion's food issues. 

Dinner was delicious, with massive helpings. Again, the staff were lovely.

The bar was atmospheric and not as overpriced as many hotel bars.

The bedroom was very clean and the bed clothes clean and soft.

The only complaint would be that the curtains failed to block out the light, and so I had some difficulty nodding off - when that's the worst you can say, you're doing well.

Breakfast was great, brilliant selection and a nice buzz in the room.

Overall, I would recommend it to visiting guests, particularly if they were taking in a match.",5,2014,10,06
247,Cold and Miserable,"Stayed in room 336 at Soundy Mount Hotel and found it of a considerable low standard to what I had expected. The room itself was up a couple more steps off from the other rooms of that floor leading us to believe it was probably a more luxurious standard bedroom. However, it appeared it was more like entering up into an attic as the room was like an ice box with no heater apart from in the bathroom. The bedlinen was mouldy when I opened the covers and the room did not even supply teabags with the kettle and milk, so I could try warm myself up. ",2,2014,10,05
247,Quality experience,"I stayed here with my sisters for a concert. Thought the hotel was class. The welcome from the receptionist was unreal and she had me told all information I would have needed to know about hotel, the area - and transport. Dart is just around the corner to bring you to the City in less then 10 mins. Sandymount village is just a 10 minute walk and has some lovely non touristy pubs. 
The full buffet breakfast was gorgeous - and eggs any way u like.  Staff in all areas - bar, breakfast and reception were fantastic  and very helpful. I will definitely be back. ",5,2014,10,05
247,"Irish holiday, September 2014","The hotel was larger than I expected, looking at the brochure.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Although the hotel was just outside of Dublin, it was close to the Dart train which could get into the centre in 10 mins. A bus could collect you from the hotel to take you to the stop where the Hop on Hop off bus started. I would rather stay at this hotel and travel in to Dublin city centre than be in a city centre hotel. The food was good although we only ate in on arrival.
Definitely would stay there again.",5,2014,10,04
247,Decent hotel,"Stayed here for  5 nights back in May 2014. The hotel was clean and they have a room with information on things to do in Dublin which was handy and will book things at the front desk for you. We found the front desk was pretty helpful with arranging taxis and wake up calls for us ( though the wake up calls were usually 5-10 min late) It was about a 5 min walk to grocery stores and restaurants and about a 5 min walk to the dart which is convenient but at night the walk is pretty dark. The only problem we found was when we were leaving to go to the airport we had pre planned to take the aircoach to the airport. We asked the front desk where it was and they could only tell us the general location of it, not exactly where to find the stop and were frustrated with us when we asked for more specific details. Thankfully we planned ahead and left the hotel early enough that we could ask another hotel that was closer to the stop where the actual stop was located and they were able to direct us. Overall it was a good stay and would stay here again.",4,2014,09,29
247,Always worth a return visit,"I've been a frequent stayer in the Sandymount over a number of years and I look forward to returning for a couple of nights again next week. There is always a great welcome from the staff at reception, the dining room and bar. Very convenient location, particularly if travelling from the North via the M1 and the Port Tunnel. The DART is very convenient for trips into the city centre. Alternatively, it is a very pleasant 25-minute walk if that is your preference. John Curran",5,2014,09,29
247,Very convenient hotel!,This is an excellent hotel with very friendly staff and excellent facilities!  It is also very convenient as it is close to the city centre (5 mins via the Dart railway) and has free parking.  I would certainly recommend it and we will definitely stay there again - thank you!,5,2014,09,29
247,Nice hotel,"We stayed here on a Thursday night for one night. Nice hotel. Not over-priced. Clean. Room was clean, non cluttered, nice bed linen, lots of toiletries, tea, coffee in the room, hair dryer .. practical and very clean. Beds were a bit small. The room was a little warm however as it was a very 'clammy' night. Didn't seem to have any air con. Met 2 friends in the bar later and had a meal there. It was very nice and very reasonably priced.  It's about 10 mins walk from Sandymount prom/pier which is worth a visit if you are into walking and some fresh air. Free car park which is an added bonus. Great breakfast. Good value all round and well located.",4,2014,09,29
247,Overnight stay with hubby,We stayed in this hotel on Saturday night after the all Ireland Hurling Final. Found the staff very friendly and we asked for a room above the ground level and were given a lovely fresh room facing front of the hotel. It was clean and airy. plenty of parking at the back which is a great bonus to city visitors. The breakfast was excellent and I was very pleasantly surprised at the amount of Irish staff working there. But not taking away from the other friendly staff.,4,2014,09,29
247,Excellent location for Dublin,"Stayed at the hotel for the All Ireland weekend and had a fabulous time. Staff very friendly, breakfast and Bar food excellent and room very spacious. The location of the hotel is fantastic. Parked up the car in the free car park and was able to walk to get the Dart to the city centre in 5 minutes. Will certainly be back as the hotel is located beside the Aviva, (150 yards away) and within walking distance to the RDS and the 3 Arena. The hotel is simply a "" gem of a location"" to all the city amenities. Arranging my next stay already:):)",5,2014,09,28
247,good quality city centre hote,"Off the beaten track except on Rugby International days this was a very comfortable well run Hotel with excellent helpful staff.The food is very good and reasonably priced in the bar .Breakfast was good with plenty of coffee and tea . The rooms are not large and the beds a bit small but plenty of storage space and a good shower.The Hotel is well placed to get into Dublin centre or to walk to the coast.Dublin itself is not that interesting once you have done the Castle,Trinity College ,river ,Guinness and Wiskey tours. It is a young persons city full of bars and cafe and lacks the character of some of the old English Cities",4,2014,09,28
247,Solid,"Spent four nights here on a business trip. There was nothing really that stood out for me, nor was there anything really disturbing. The fact my avg room rate topped €160 made it average value for me realising Dublin has expensive hotels though.",3,2014,09,27
247,Great location,"We stayed for Two nights for the All Ireland final football match,  the area is lovely just a short walk into village which has everything, Bar food was excellent ,  &  A  great buffet breakfast ,
Service was top class,  great nights sleep beds were great,  we only had to walk 5 mins to get dart into city which was excellent , We are looking forward to staying here again.",5,2014,09,26
247,short break,"excellent base for city centre break with added bonus of friendly helpful staff and free parking,would certainly return but would prefer one of the updated rooms next time,stayed in the older wing and although it was fine a little dated",4,2014,09,26
247,Outstanding Experience,"Brought my team for an extended stay over two weeks. Hotel staff were excellent and on top of every request. The surrounding neighborhood is very pretty, easy walk to the office as well as the tram for heading downtown. I wish the trip had been for fun rather than work ... would have spent more time exploring the area. Definitely want to come back. Beatrice was very helpful getting everything sorted and pointing us in the right direction once the weekend hit.",5,2014,09,25
247,Excellent location and good value,"Walking distance of many attractions in Dublin - Aviva Stadium, 3Arena, Bord Gais Theatre, RDS and more.

On the doorstep of DART station for very fast trip into city centre and elsewhere.

Good value, comfortable room with good size bathroom. Bar food excellent.

Free adequate size car park.

Bullseyes sweets on reception counter to bring back childhood memories.

Only downside is that hotel is made up from a number of old houses, so there is a bit of walking to get to your room, but this was a minor issue.",4,2014,09,25
247,Great Dublin hideaway,"We stayed here because Dublin centre was full. But it is only 2-3 stops on the DART to the centre. Staff were helpful and pleasant - especially Emma at reception. Food was good, the garden is lovely, and great atmosphere. Family owned.  Close to Aviva stadium.",4,2014,09,23
247,Wonderful experience with our first hotel in Ireland,"First let me say that this review is coming in late, as we stayed in 2012 and am just now remembering our stay was worthy of some praise.
My cousin recommended the Sandymount to me in part because her daughter went to school in America with the owners daughter. Needless to say that alone is not going to guarantee a good experience, but being in Ireland for the first time, a trusted relatives prompting was good enough for me.

We arrived to a friendly front desk staff of Siobhan and another lady who's name escapes me, but it started with an S as well. 
We were instructed how to get to everything in the city, and this hotels proximity to the train(Dart) was just a couple minutes walk away. The room was a little different than we are use to in America, but it was roomy, clean, and had all the niceties such as TV, internet, etc. 
The beds were comfortable which is important to us since we are all tall and like long roomy beds. The furniture was the right size for the room by not being to cluttered with a couch, coffee table, small desk with chair, etc., and it had a decent sized bathroom. 

We decided to eat breakfast there every morning, and aside from some unusual things like sliced tomatoes(must be an Irish thing), the food was very good. The sausages were absolutely the best I have ever tasted, and my apologies for having eaten as many of them as my 6'7"" frame would allow for. 
There is also a cozy bar to get a drink and relax, and there is also a room in the back with a decent sized TV. My son was eager to watch his favorite sports team but the channel was uncommon over there, and not in the rooms. So the staff suggested he come to that room and watch it in the early hours of the morning, and he was thrilled for the kindness.

On several occasions we asked for directions and the staff was always helpful and made sure their Yank guests did not get lost. Of course in Ireland the worst thing to happen if you get lost would be you get stuck in a bar drinking Harp & Guinness. 
Oh, the horror. 

Anyway, we stayed for several nights and thoroughly enjoyed the place as a centrally located hotel in a nice area. There is some type of large stadium (maybe Hurling or Rugby) a block away so I guess the local roads might get crowded on game day. Several recommendations were made by the staff like Roly's Bistro down the road that turned out to be spot on. 
We met the owner and he seemed to be genuinely interested in making sure our needs were being met. Being family owned, he took a sense of pride in making sure we had a good time. The only bad thing to happen was we left postage and some postcards with the front desk for back home in America, but no one ever received them. However I cannot blame the staff at the hotel because it might have been either countries postal service.

The bottom line is that this hotel delivers everything a traveler from across the pond might need and more. I highly recommend it, and if ever we are back in Dublin, we will stay again.

247,Most excellent,"We really enjoyed out stay here. Rooms were clean, and roomy. Loved the Bar and restaurant area up and down. Enjoyed a lovely dinner on the deck outside, small but comfortable. Mostly there I think for smokers, but they took very good care of the six of us for a delicious dinner. We were lucky and had great weather. The Staff is excellent, very professional but friendly and helpful.",5,2014,09,22
247,Hidden Gem,"Myself and my partner stayed in the Sandymount hotel for the first time and were pleasently surprised. The room was spacious and clean and well appointed.
Free wifi and free parking which you dont get in alot of Dublin city hotels.
The warmest welcome Ive ever received in any hotel. The reception staff are very attentive. You can tell its family run from the minutes you walk in the door. Food in the bar was excellent, great portions and moderately priced. We did not include breakfast in our booking but, none the less, were informed about its times and price if we wished to avail of it. Would definitely stay again.",5,2014,09,20
247,Great stay,"I spent a few nights in the Sandymount for the second time - the first was a couple of years ago.  If anything, it is even better than it was.  The staff are fantastic - always helpful.  The room was well appointed.  My only gripe was with the coffee in the room which was poor although in the dining room and bar it was fine.  Great value for money.",5,2014,09,20
247,A lovely experience,"The Sandy mount is a lovely, unpretentious collection of several houses put together as a marvelous elegant hotel. The staff was extremely helpful. We had one of the newer rooms, with a totally new bathroom and updated interior. It is very quiet here, something very helpful for those trying to catch up on sleep. The breakfast includes everything that one can want, sausage, bacon, cold and hot cereals, a variety of fruits and juices etc. We enjoyed the proximity to Sandymount village, which contains both bistros, ATMs, etc. Lovely atmosphere and neighborhood. Highly recommended if you want a low-key stay.",4,2014,09,15
247,"Nice food, thin walls!","Hotel situated in a nice area and very convenient for the Aviva stadium. 

Had some great food and ended up eating there every night for 4 nights. 

My room had an adjoining door which I guess was a great idea in the 1970's but not great nowadays. I could here the guy next doors TV, he turned it down at a respectable time which was fine but then he fell asleep and I could very clearly hear his snoring. That was the first two nights. The following 2 nights I could overhear 2 separate couples conversations. You try not to listen but you can't help it! I tried clearing my throat loudly hoping they would here me and realise they may be shouldn't be discussing there private lives! 

The room I was in looked out to rooms opposite me almost like a horse shoe shape. As it was August the windows were open as it was a bit warm and I could here a woman crying at 3am and then some sort of domestic about 5am. A fan in the room (or Air Conditioning) would of been nice and then I could of shut the window and hopefully not heard the problems the couple were having with their son and his affair with the neighbor!!

Staff were pleasant and the room was clean. Great shower, loads of power.

Despite the noise the food was good and i would stay again.",3,2014,09,15
247,Overnight stay,Stayed in the sandymount hotel last night for the ant and dec Saturday night takeaway live form the 3 arena have to say the staff from check in to evening lunch to late evening and the fabulous breakfast this morning I would rely recommend this hotel for anyone going to a match in the aviva or concert or just staying for a few days I will definitely book again,5,2014,09,14
247,Poor value,"Initial impressions were good, but the actual experience was poor.  Got executive room and quite spacious, bright and clean.

However the bed was narrow 4' 6"" for executive room, very poor sound proofing from the corridor outside, very hot even though heating was off and towels were very small.  We did not sleep well at all.

On the plus side, we did eat in the bar and it was very tasty and good value.",2,2014,09,14
247,Great hotel,Great hotel based close enough to the heart of Dublin. I've stay here many time and always found staff very helpful and accommodating. The bar food is always good and a vast selection. Breakfast  always  has plenty of different items for every appetite. Highly recommended hotel .,5,2014,09,13
247,A little Gem beside the Aviva,Recently I stayed in the Sandymount hotel while in Dublin on business. I have to say it was a very pleasurable experience from the warm greeting i received on arrival to the very comfortable bed in my spacious room! It's a short walk to the dart station which is perfect for anyone wanting to head into the city (2 -4) stops depending what part you want to go to. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel or with staying there again which i inevitably will. The staff are the real icing for me on this one tip top notch! Free parking too which is a massive plus,5,2014,09,12
247,Great location,"Stayed here for one night at the end of a trip to Ireland before flying back to London. Perfectly located in a quiet part of Dublin, the hotel is very close to the Aviva stadium and Lansdowne Road DART station. We got a good room rate that included breakfast, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the bar prices were a little on the high side, and the rooms could do with an overhaul.

The staff were very helpful and helped us with bus tour tickets and printing boarding passes. Would stay here again, since it's a short walk in to Ballsbridge for evening drinks and food.",4,2014,09,11
247,"Good location, helpful staff and free parking","We've stayed at the Sandymount on several occasions in the past.  It's close to Lansdowne Road DART station and has ample free parking - both real plus points in Dublin.  It's also only a short drive from the Dublin car ferry terminal.  On our most recent stay the room assigned to us didn't quite suit our needs, and the reception staff were happy to find us an alternative.  Yes, some parts of the hotel could do with updating, but we've never found anything to be in unacceptable condition.  Breakfast is fine - we usually ate elsewhere in the evenings.  It's an informal and relaxing place, an ideal base for visiting Dublin, and I expect we'll continue to use it.",4,2014,09,10
247,disapointing,"Lovely Staff but run-down tired bedrooms and interiors in general.  The place need a serious overhaul. Every corner of the place needs to be painted and updated. The rates are too high for what they are offering. The food was also over priced for what they served in a dismal over-lite bar with no atmosphere. The week after I stayed in The Sandymount, I paid €12 more per night in another hotel close by and got a room that was about 70% better. 
As an Irish person, it makes me cringe to see an Irish business like this, charging too much for something so grim.",2,2014,09,10
247,Time for a makeover,"The Sandymount occupies a nice position in a quiet residential area just outside of Dublin city centre. A 5 minute walk takes you to the DART. A short journey into the city centre, either Pearse street or Tara. We booked a triple room, tho' room was actually quadruple...and one bed looked as if it was just squeezed in as an afterthought! The decor & furniture is tired & dated & in need of a makeover. However on a more positive note, the Staff were helpful & very pleasant, the breakfast was adequate... tho' the dining area would benefit from another toaster! The Sandymount would suit travellers going to the Aviva stadium..due to Hotel's close proximity & is fine for journeys into city, but for perhaps the younger tourist who wishes to sample the nightlife, a taxi is the only option back to the hotel, as last train is 1130pm. The Sandymount is only a 5/10 minute walk to either Ballsbridge, which has several good restaurants...Roly's, not cheap but food excellent, & Sandymount where you can have a stroll along the strand.",3,2014,09,08
247,disappointed,"our room was dated and gloomy.  stocks of toiletries were poor; soap, shower gel and shampoo. The bathroom was tatty and old;  plug cover missing,  broken/chipped floor tiles,  bits of loo missing, extractor fan didn't work and no razor socket.  Two of us but only one cup on day one.  day two still only one cup,  dirty milk jug still in room and no tea/coffee/sugar supplies replaced. Two calls to reception left me feeling like it was my fault and after day one I'd hoped not  to have to repeat my request on day two - but I did.  breakfast staff gloomy and not seeming to want to smile at you.  gosia and emma on reception were happy,  pleasant and helpful. .. The only staff to acknowledge us at all.  a planned special weekend for my partner was not met by this hotel I'm afraid.   ",2,2014,09,08
247,Lovely stay at Sandymount Hotel,Six family members traveling to Ireland. We arrived two days before the start of our tour. We booked three rooms for two nights. Accommodations were very pleasant. We enjoyed two meals-dinner on the porch outside the bar and breakfast in the restaurant. The waitstaff were very patient and pleasant as we asked questions. They were extremely helpful in shuttling us to our next hotel where our tour was starting. It's a nice stroll to catch the DART and get to the city center.,4,2014,09,07
247,Best ever hotel experience in Dublin,"My daughter was beginning college in Dublin and I wanted a hotel near UCD,somewhere quiet with parking. A friend recommended the hotel and she was so right ineverything she said. Location was residential with a spacious car park. The staff were efficient and friendly. My room was spotless and everything provided. Overnight stay was priced well below the other hotels in the area. I will definitely stay again.Well done to provide such a gem in Dublin.
",5,2014,09,07
247,Great service,A last minute decision to have a night in Dublin for my birthday was completely justified the minute we walked through the door.We were greeted by Beatrice at check in and she completely made us feel welcome and couldn't do enough for us.we will be booking to stay here again for sure and have already tried to check availability for the Irish rugby matches in November! We couldn't recommend the place highly enough. If your looking for value that comes with all the trimmings well this is the place. But as they say you can't put a price on comfort so whatever the rate came to we would have gladly paid it,5,2014,09,07
247,Great staff..nice place...needs AC,The staff was friendly and we had a few snags but they sorted things out and gave us a free breakfast buffet for free...the buffet was amazing. ..would stay again...if you use the Red Bus tour it drops you off out front,4,2014,09,06
247,Ok stay,"Location is great, spotless room, just a little disappointed by welcome, the girl on the desk(glasses and long hair in pony tail) seemed more interested in her phone and was quite rude. But the hotel itself was charming and as before super location",3,2014,09,06
247,Sandymount  - so close to everthing,"This is my first trip overseas. We stayed at a couple of places around Ireland , mainly in the city centres. We lucked upon this hotel and could not have been more happy with it. It is not a new facility and it rambles across four connected establishments - but it works.  Staff are friendly, rooms are big,  parking is great and access to the city by train is just up the road, as is the newly completed Lansdowne Rd Stadium - worth the visit in itself. The village of Sandymount is a short walk away and the food selection there is excellent.

Breakfast eating area was superb with lovely views of the ample well kept gardens that surround 
the hotel. We ate in one night at the restaurant and it was good as well.

I think the majority of travelling folk will be more than happy with their stay at this hotel . I will definitely be recommending it to my friends and on my next visit to Ireland will make a be line for Sandymount",4,2014,09,05
247,Can not fault it,"We chose this hotel, due to it's location beside the Aviva Stadium. What a find, old style hotel with old style.. values. We had a twin room at the front of the hotel, which appeared to be part of the old section. The room was huge, one double and two single beds, with space for two more beds, yes the on suite is a little dated, but very clean and the bath/shower had plenty of hot water and great pressure. We had the pre match meal in the bar for €10 euro, great value. The breakfast was of a very high standard, with plenty of choice/selection The Hotel has lots of staff and all are very friendly and helpful. This is a family owned hotel and it shows, the staff appear to be happy at work and care about their job.
Will certainly stay again, very good hotel and good value.",4,2014,09,05
247,Perfect hotel for the Aviva,"We chose this hotel, due to it's location beside the Aviva Stadium. What a find, old style hotel with old style.. values.

247,Nice stay,"Me and my family stayed here as we had an early ferry back over to holyhead. The hotel is in a good location.only 10 mins drive from port and close to city centre and also aviva stadium. The staff was very friendly and helpfull, the room was ok. nothing to fancy but ok for a stop over. The TV in the room could of been a bit bigger i think. There is a restaurant in the hotel which again was nice food, but a little bit pricey. All in all a good place to stay if you after a place to rest your head. i would stay again if i was in dublin.",4,2014,09,04
247,Hotel close to arena,"This hotel was close to the Dart (train) so easy to get to the Dublin city center.  We took the red bus for tours.. stops at all the attractions like Guinness factory and Jameson, etc.  There was no a/c but the temperature was not too bad.  Two nights we ate at the hotel bar restaurant and enjoyed our meal and a pint :)",4,2014,09,03
247,Great stay for great price,"We recently stayed at the hotel during a trip to Ireland.  Of all the places visited, this was definitely the best value for money.  Good facilities, good location, good food.  Not in the city centre but close enough to walk and you don't have the noise of the city.  Staff were very friendly and helpful from arrival.  I forgot two jackets in the room and they were very helpful to help me get them back to South Africa.  I would definitely recommend staying there.",5,2014,09,03
247,"Excellent Service, Extremely Friendly and Helpfull Staff","Excellent staff who were very helpful. I was staying for 3 days to get my PRES examinations done. Staff made sure I was at the exam on time and personally took me to the test center. Hotel was only a 5 minute walk away fom the train staion ""DART"" that took me down town in less than 10 minutes. Excellent location, excellent staff. This will be my go to place when Im in Dublin",5,2014,09,02
247,Nice hotel and wonderful staff!,This was a wonderful hotel!  The only negative thing would be it was quite a walk from where the airport bus dropped us to where the hotel was actually located.  Other than that it was a quick ride by cab to city centre and under 10 euros.  The staff were extremely helpful and very nice!  I would definitely stay there again!,5,2014,09,02
247,Bad choice,"Stayed 3 nights in June at the beginig of a 10 day tour of Ireland. Miserable experience. Drag bags up stairs to reception. Surly receptionist. Given room 337 at back. Lift did not work. Finally got help with bags: Miniature openings in windows. Stifled all night. Only eiderdown no sheet. Pluming in bathroom was antique and stank. Room changed next morning. Slightly better on ground floor with opening windows. Although receptionists changed non was really pleasent.
Not a good experience to start touring with 6 hotels ahead!",1,2014,09,02
247,"Fantastic price, fantastic hotel!","The hotel was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Only minutes from the Aviva stadium and two stops on the DART to the centre of town! The receptionists were lovely and catered to our every need be it knives, forks and plates for our Chinese take-away to directing us to the local shops... The rooms themselves were clean, tidy and well furnished. Services such as dry cleaning, room service and the like were offered at reasonable prices. Ultimately, this is a truly high standard hotel and is such excellent value for money that I have trouble to find fault with it. Would definitely stay again.",4,2014,09,01
247,Ideal for visiting Aviva Stadium,"This is a lovely hotel, ideally situated if your reason for staying is to visit the Aviva Stadium.  However it is not convenient for sightseeing around Dublin. There is a long walk to the main attractions or a short train ride, making it unlikely that you would return there throughout the day. It was also a long walk from the Aircoach stop for anyone arriving at Dublin airport and wanting to complete the journey by public transport.  Ok for those prepared to pay for a taxi or driving themselves.",4,2014,08,31
247,Unwelcoming and grubby.,"Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights as we were in Dublin for a concert. After booking 1 double room online, On arrival we were offered a twin room....I can only assume this is because we are both female. If I wanted a twin room this is what I would have chosen at time of booking. The room was very small, no air conditioning, dirty cups, spill marks down the wall and overall felt grubby. Our bathroom was also not replenished with toilet paper daily, which led to us having to call down to reception to request some. All in all we were both unhappy. Very nice reception and dining area....if only the rooms were to the same standard...! Misleading and dissapointing. Would definately not use this establishment again.",2,2014,08,31
247,Lovely property,"A great hotel and just perfect for the rugby fans as Aviva is within 5 minutes walk from the hotel and the Dart right beside the Aviva takes you in to the city.  I have had numerous stays at this hotel and it has always been a pleasure to re-visit each time.  The staff are extremely friendly offering a warm welcome.  The hotel has no facilities for gym/spa but has plenty of seating areas and a friendly bar with a dining area.  

The main restaurant downstairs is used for breakfasts rather than offering fine dining each evening - but The Line-Out Bar in the hotel offers evening meals and nearby (walking distance) Sandymount Village has some lovely restaurants.  It is a popular hotel so would recommend earlier bookings, especially if any main International Rugby matches are on.",5,2014,08,31
247,Great Value for Dublin,"The hotel is ""very good"", but considering the price, it's ""excellent"".

The hotel rooms are fairly basic, a bed, a desk, a chair, nothing fancy; but everything was very clean and comfortable.  The hotel layout is a little unusual (basically a couple of houses connected together).  The wifi worked great most of the time, but there were some soft spots in my room.  The staff is super.  They probably all deserve a raise.

Sandymount is a quiet, residential area, and there's really nothing in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.  There are a couple of areas with ""shops"", near Ballsbridge and Sandymount Green, both about a 10-minute walk.  DART is very close by and offers an easy way into central Dublin.  If you walk to Ballsbridge (Northumberland / Merrion Rd), there are a lot of buses there.  If you walk even further to Pembroke Rd, there are more restaurants.  It's about a 30-40 minute walk into central Dublin, but it's a very nice walk.

The AirCoach passes near the hotel.  There are two routes, one along the Strand (by the beach), and one along Ballsbridge (702 and 703, I think).  They are about a 20-30 minute ride to the airport.  However, it should be noted that the buses often run late, and if the bus is filled, you may not get on the bus at all, and they run only once an hour.  Yikes.

Anyway, if you're looking for something less central and a little more quiet and relaxing, then Sandymount is a great choice.",5,2014,08,30
247,Great Place to stay in Dublin,"Located in a very pleasant quarter of Dublin, convenient to Landsdowne Rd - oops  the Aviva stadium -this hotel is comfortable, clean and is staffed by friendly people and managed by a welcoming  and loquacious owner. This ensures patrons enjoy a memorable experience. Its location convenient to Sandymount beach and Herbert Park allows for easy exercise and the DART and Dublin Bus will bring those who want to avoid  the gentle 20 minute stroll into central Dublin. The breakfasts are excellent. I have not dined in the hotel but there are excellent restaurants nearby at Sandymount Green and Ballsbridge. It really is a gem among Dublin Hotels.",4,2014,08,29
247,Good value as this is an expensive part of Dublin for acommodation.,"Stayed for a one night stop in Dublin as we were attending an event.We got a large double room, which appeared to be recently refurbished to a high spec, very comfortable and quiet even though it was overlooking main road. The staff were extremely friendly & helpful. Gave us excellent directions & a handy map. We had a very pleasant walk to St. Stephens Green which took us only 35 minutes. Only a few minutes walk to Sandymount village & along the sea front. A few nice cafes in the village also. Breakfast was excellent, good variety & hot food. Sandymount Hotel is great value considering it is situated close to a range of venues & offers free secure parking which is very limited in Dublin Hotels. Would definately recommend this Hotel & look forward to returning when next in Dublin.",4,2014,08,28
247,3.5 stars if I could,"We stayed here for 2 nights recently, room was basic but functional and bed comfy, noise of people walking about in room above was annoying at night. Great help yourself breakfast choice and very tasty. Staff very accommodating in ordering taxis and owner was very friendly in having a chat with us. Would definitely have no problem staying again as long as noise from floors of rooms above was looked at",4,2014,08,27
247,Sandymount - a welcome return,My wife and I had no hesitation in returning to the Sandymount Hotel (originally there a few years ago) for an end of summer weekend break and we will have no hesitation in returning. The Hotel is reasonably priced in the affluent and very peaceful and elegant south side of Dublin and within walking distance of Sandymount village and Dublin Bay. The room was average sized with all we needed for comfort. Bathroom light and clean and staff at reception very pleasant and accommodating. Only down side was a few noisey neighbours in middle of the night (slamming doors and shouting). Expected some night staff to intervene but I guess if no one complained no action would be taken. Otherwise we had a great stay. Ate out mostly (breakfast not included in deal) so can't comment of food. We will be back.,4,2014,08,27
247,A nice location outside City Centre.,"This was the first hotel that we stayed at on our two week family vacation.  We booked two rooms.  One for my 80+ year old mother and a room for my wife, daughter and myself.
The hotel is south east of Trinity College.  The hotel is walking distance to Landsdowne DART stop and Aviva Stadium. The hotel is also walking distance to Sandymount Green. A lovely area that has restaurants and other smaller stores.  Ask the front desk staff for information on places to eat that are walking distance of the hotel. 

The hotel looks lovely on the outside, getting into the hotel can be a bit of a challenge if you have a lot of luggage or trouble getting up steps. As the hotel at one time was a house, the front steps are bit steep.  My mother had to take her time getting up and down the stairs(in photo below you can see the steps).  I had to make a couple of trips with our luggage. As they don't have staff to help with luggage (if they did, I did not see anyone).  It also was a bit congested at the front desk area, as there other guest with luggage and you have to go thru the front desk area to get to the rooms. Our rooms were on the ground floor(facing the parking lot) and we had a bit of a walk with our luggage to get to our rooms.

The common areas are very nice and there is a very large living room off the front desk area.  There is also a small room that has a couple of computers and a printer. There is also a dinning area(hot and cold breakfast in the morning, very simple).

Rooms 222-234 (we were in Rm 226) face the parking lot and during our two night stay, at times it was loud (people parking or loading up their car).  Also, it seemed like we had a bright light beaming into our bathroom.  In our room we had a queen size bed and a single.  Over all a good size room for the three of us. The lighting was not that great(all overhead and Fluorescent) and could have used more light in the bathroom(I know, I said there was a bright light beaming into the bathroom). The shower/bath was fine.  As this was my first trip to Ireland, I was surprised to find a tap for hot water and a tap for cold.  Also, don't forget to bring a couple of plug converters for you electronics.

Overall, a very basic hotel, nice staff, good location to the DART, in a nice neighborhood that is walkable to places to eat.",3,2014,08,26
247,Superb Hotel!!!!!,"This was our third visit + we hope to call in again next year. Excellent stay throughout. Lots of free parking + free wi-fi. They also have 2 computers free to use but always busy when I was there
Large bedroom + TV. Free tea/coffee in the bedroom. Great breakfast with all the food regularly
topped up. Toaster needs upgraded but no real problems. Hotel is easy to find + very close to the Dart. Well worth a visit. We will return!!!",5,2014,08,26
247,A Little Disappointing,"The Sandymount is OK, but I don't think I would return. I mainly booked this because they have a family room that comfortably accommodated our 3 teenage daughters and the prices were reasonable. The staff was very welcoming and helpful, but the location is not ideal. It is a 35-45 minute walk to the Temple Bar area (and we're fast walkers). If you are going to an event at the Aviva Stadium, it would be ideal. My biggest disappointment was the bathroom. It was in need of a refresh - loose toilet seat, rust on the tiles and shower rod - just not great. The room itself, was nice and clean.",3,2014,08,24
247,"Friendly, good location","Stayed 1 night in the Sandymount while in Dublin for the Pro 12 rugby final. The hotel was in a great location, within easy walking distance of the ground (RDS). Also great for the Aviva and the DART train, which are just round the corner. It's a little way out from the centre of Dublin (although we did walk in, which is nice if you've got the time) but the surroundings are quiet and there is good parking available. 

Staff were friendly and helpful. Hotel is a bit of a maze if you're in one of the rooms further out, could do with better signs in the halls. Room size is ok. Both the room and bathroom were a bit dated and could do with freshening up, but they were clean. Nice hotel overall",4,2014,08,23
247,"Friendly, welcoming comfort","Sandymount is a pleasant, welcoming hotel close to the Dart for easy access to Dublin. Triple Room was clean and of a generous size and all staff were very friendly and welcoming to my young daughter. Breakfast was a hot and cold help yourself buffet with a great selection of cereals and pastries so ideal for every appetite. Would definitely recommend for a comfortable stay with easy access to Dublin.",5,2014,08,20
247,Weekend break,"We enjoyed a two night stay here last weekend. Very friendly & helpful staff. We were informed on check in restaurant/bar food times as it was late. We availed of bar food and it was delicious. We both really enjoyed the background music.. Our era .. !!! 
Room was cosy & spotless. Only missing a table as we order breakfast to room and although it stated there was safe in the room .. We couldn't find one. But this didn't upset our stay. 
Location perfect for Aviva stadium and close to sandymount strand 
Taxis available outside the door  
All in all a very pleasant stay and we would return again!  ",4,2014,08,20
247,Nice restaurant,"The hotel is a very strange mix of old and new. The outside of the building gives you the impression you will be staying in a traditional hotel, but the rooms are quite modern and soulless. 

The corridor floors squeak like crazy and make the rooms very noisy. The views from the back of the hotel are on to a car park.

One of the rooms we hired was a triple room, which was absolutely huge!

The bar area and restaurant are very nice and the hotel serves a very nice breakfast.",3,2014,08,19
247,Mediocre room but the staff were friendly.,"Clean hotel room and en suite. Basic room, functional but could do with a bit of colour or decor. Neutral to the point of characterless and sterile And more importantly this hotel could do with some serious sound proofing. I could hear every footstep on the floor above, not too mention footfall in the corridor. 
The TV was on top of a wardrobe and the reception was very bad and kept losing both picture and sound.",3,2014,08,19
247,off the trourist track in a quiet area,"Big double room, bathroom dated but clean, restaurant large enough to accommodate crowds, but still cosy,  clean and comfortable, outside of the center but easy to access by DART, close to the foot ball arena",4,2014,08,19
247,Perfect location for an easy city break!,"I stayed here in a twin room for four nights in September of 2013! On arrival before check in the staff allowed us to check in early and made no fuss at all. The staff gave great tips on what to see and do and couldn't have done more for us. 

The rooms are very clean and are some of the more spacious rooms that I have stayed in. The hotel itself is very quiet, I had a great nights sleep every night. We ate in the restaurant a few times which is fairly priced for some pretty good food. 

By far the best part about the hotel is the great location to the dart station, making it really easy to get in and out of Dublin for cheap. 

Definitely stay here for a relaxed and hassle free break!",5,2014,08,17
247,Back again !,"My usual hotel for the Dublin  Horse Show.
Once again I can highly recommend this hotel. The location is excellent as it is near the Dart  station but yet quiet and a short walk to the main road to get bus into the city centre.
A 15 minute walk takes you to the R.D.S grounds.
Very good, self service,  hot and cold breakfast with fresh bread, rolls and croissants.
Room was comfortable and clean with en suite,  tea and coffee facilities and tv.
There is on site car parking which is a bonus.",4,2014,08,17
247,A excellent hotel,A very clean and comfortable hotel.bedroom was very spacious and bright .well situated for eating out and close to balls ridge and sandy mount village.it is in a very quiet and upmarket area.i couldn't have picket a better hotel. Ticked all my boxes.would recommend.,5,2014,08,17
247,Great for Aviva!,"This is a nice hotel in a lovely location in South Dublin absolutely perfect for the Aviva and the RDS. Some of the rooms are a little dated but still adequate, however, all public areas are well appointed and the staff are professional and polite also free parking so just jump on the DART for 5 mins and you are in the heart of Dublin City Centre.",4,2014,08,16
247,Nice hotel in a good location,"Firstly contrary to website advice the easiest way to this hotel is the 747 Airlink Express into the city then the DART from Connolly Station to Lansdowne Road (4stops) followed by a 5 minute walk.A 72 hour LEAP card is available from the airport for €19.50.
The hotel itself looks impressive in and out and we were given a warm welcome from the receptionist so were hoping for great things with the room but sadly this was rather disappointing. Situated right at the back with not even a garden to look onto and being able to hear other guests meant not even being able to have a window open which made sleeping difficult as the room was too warm. Clean and tidy but the bathroom needs some TLC as it was looking tired and neglected. The hotel provides guests with access to free WiFi which is great. A buffet style breakfast is served in the restaurant with a good choice of hot and cold food to cater for everyone's taste, including some Gluten Free options.
Finally if I had known we were going to be at the back in the room without a view I would probably have paid a small extra to be upgraded, maybe this needs stating on the website.",4,2014,08,16
247,Needs renovation,"The Hotel has a nice bar, quiet neighbourhood and good connection to the DART railway. 
The rooms we got where in an older part of the hotel and the really need some tune up. The bathroom in one of our rooms #233 was extremely small, the complete room worn out and poorly maintenanced. 
The service was good and friendly, the bar nice. 
Just the rooms.... ",3,2014,08,15
247,"Central Location, Excellent Food.","Very well located, just a short stroll from Sandymount Village with its numerous bars & restaurants. Good plentiful secure car parking. Staff very friendly, knowledgeable and from what I could see multi-lingual. Rooms modern and spacious with free WIFI which was a prerequisite for us as we were staying with two  teenagers who believe the internet is more important than running water. The food in the Line Out Bar is excellent, which is why we ate there both nights of our short stay. Breakfast is also probably as good as I have encountered anywhere with delicious choices to suit everybody. Will definitely stay again next time in Dublin.",5,2014,08,13
247,Wonderful,We moved to Sandymount after a few days in inner city Dublin - a great improvement and vastly superior to the expensive hotel we had in Dublin. We were impressed by the friendly and helpful staff. The close proximity to the DART station makes daytrips to surrounding villages very easy. We enjoyed walks around the hotel and on Sandymount beach. Good breakfasts and comfortable rooms.,5,2014,08,13
247,Really a place I would always come back to,"Having had many bad experiences with hotels, we were very much positive surprised here. Starting at the reception the two ladies were really competent and helpful. Much needed information was given to us and all our questions kindly answered. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The one was maybe a bit small but the other one we had was almost like a suite. Bathroom very spacious, ok maybe here the shower curtains could be changed with the glass protection now a days used. IF I had anything to complain ;) this would be it. Breakfast is fantastic. Again we would stay there again, even without looking at other options!!! Loved the stay there.",5,2014,08,13
247,Very nice and wonderful staff ,"Hi Ireland Travelors 
This hotel may not be for folks with any walking challenges it is a wonderful quaint and a great location. The owner john and his staff are very accommodating. The Train Station is two blocks away so no need for a car:  you can connect to city locations as well as commuter locations throughout the  country. You are also only 3 blocks or so to the sea!! Also the on/off bus stops daily so you can jump a ride to central Dublin in 20 min. Also the village of Sandymount is charming with great restaurants and shops! Highly recommend it!! Will stay there again on the next trip! PJoiner ",5,2014,08,09
247,Very cool !!!!,"greetings from Germany , I am American and my sweetie is German .  We stayed a week July 31 thru Aug 7 ...never mind the bad reviews , as I have stayed all over the world in Hotels, Motels and dives !  staff is Excellent , Rose , Beatrice , Emma, and many others whose names I did not get..sadly.  I met with the Owner on our last day and he is very engaging and open and friendly.  I spoke to locals, taxi drivers , and our own experience :)  The Sandymount does not pretend to be a 5 star or fancy, but 1st class with its charm and staff and equally warm accommodations .  Hog wash to anyone who says they got dirty looks !  I have tons of tattoos and wear my Biker vest and no one gave me any dirty looks, in fact a woman who worked in breakfast area took a picture of me one morning :)  Directions, advice, helpful, pleasant ...Rose even wheeled our suitcase down the steps to our taxi !  and they do have a lift outside to lobby for the older folks .  The hop on hop off bus picks you up in front of Hotel , Dart is around the corner , and they will gladly order you a taxi and it will be waiting for you .  our room was clean , maids were friendly and never bothered us.  I would gladly recommend the Sandymount and would definitely stay there again !!!  Cheers or as we say in Germany Prost !",5,2014,08,09
247,Nice area next to the Aviga rugby stadium,"2 min away from the DART station and 10min from the sea, Sandymount is a nice area, far from the electricity of Dublin. The staff is very professional (they spoke French), and the food was really nice even in room service. The hotel is build on the place of an old Haig's whiskey distillery, and it is a family business today. Sometimes not very quiet when you are sleeping on the 1st floor. ",4,2014,08,09
247,hotel not very suitable for disabled,"Booked two nights stay with breakfast. Staff very pleasant especially waiting staff at breakfast and restaurant. Food in restaurant was nice but a little expensive. The breakfast was very well laid out and lots of choices. The room we had was very comfortable and the bedding spotless. I only have three complaints all the carpets need replaced especially the hall ways they smell very musty and stained badly in some places. Also the access for disabled very step ramps and narrow corridors.  The disabled entrance into the breakfast room via the conference rooms in the basement was very dirty, dark and smelly.",4,2014,08,07
247,Hotel with some stairs to climb,"There is no other way to enter the hotel, but by climbing with your luggage a number of stairs and no help from the staff is offered. Once this hurdle surpassed, the guest faces a maze of narrow hallways and further stairs to climb to reach the room. The floors have wall-to-wall carpets, some of them looking very old, used-up and stained. Same goes for the rooms, which have wall-to-wall carpets and smell of moist. Because of the smell, and the view to a wall I asked to change the room. The second room smelled of smoke, so I got a third one with a lighter smell of moist and same view to the backside of the building. The receptionists were very kind and provided help whenever asked. The building badly needs a renovation, to get rid of the musty smell, change the old fashion, probably half century old appliances in the bathroom and build at least a ramp at the entrance to easy the pain of carrying the luggage up the stairs.",3,2014,08,05
247,Lovely place to stay,"Myself and my partner stayed here for one night b&b. When we were checking in they were doing a special upgrade to a junior suite for €20 so we went for it. The room was fab. The bed was absolutely huge. The bathroom was also big and everything was spotless. There was free WiFi, a CD player and a good selection of TV channels. I found the room a little chilly but I'm a cold person and my partner found it perfect so I think that's less to do with the hotel and more to do with preference! The breakfast next morning was very, very good. It was the usual buffet style but there was a huge choice of stuff and the food was very good quality. All the staff we dealt with were very nice and helpful throughout our stay. There's free parking and it's right beside the Aviva stadium. I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2014,08,03
247,Ideal Dublin Location,"It was past 23.00 when I approached the hotel, but recognised the area from a previous visit, lets face it Landsdowne Road is not a venue you can miss. I had a booking made earlier in the day, something had come up and I needed to drop some display units in Grafton Street early next day.
I was attracted by the price, central location and the parking.
Even with the late check in I managed a couple of pints at the bar before the staff knocked off.
The room was great value, bed comfy and wifi free. Would stay there again without question.
Went looking for an ATM in the morning and discovered lovely streets with those wonderful coloured front doors the Irish are famous for. No time for breakfast, which was a shame as I had a good feeling about it. Helpful and friendly staff. Thanks",5,2014,08,03
247,Excellent stay..,"Returning for a third stay, never fails on the welcoming front! Rooms great and clean, powerful shower and a great Guinness in the bar!! Also, left my favourite pair of jeans in the room, quick call to housekeeping and they are now winging their way back to me!! Highly recommend!!",5,2014,08,02
247,Great hotel,"From the outside it was really nice to look at and as you walk in it doesn't get disappointing feels very fancy but you don't feel out of place with very nice staff, the receptionist was very helpful and was glad to show us how to get to places around Dublin. The room was very well kept, clean and tidy. There was a TV, free wifi ,an en-suite and of course a bed. I personally could not fault the hotel or staff. There is a bit of a walk from the hotel to the city centre but I didn't feel as though that was a problem and I was informed that there was plenty of public transport, although I didn't use any transport, I did see a tram nearby the hotel to bring you into town.",5,2014,08,01
247,Wonderful hotel,"We booked this hotel last minute as we fancied a we break to Dublin. It's far enough from the city centre to be quite but at the same time it is extremely accessible to the centre. The staff are very welcoming and the food was delicious. They have lovely gardens for the guests too.The rooms an en-suites are clean and the beds comfortable. Parking and WiFi were free (Bonus!). Our only down fall was there is quite a bit of noise inside the hotel at night, we could hear other guests walking and chatting outside our door.",4,2014,07,31
247,Nice hotel and friendly staff.,"A very nice hotel, idyllically situated in a peaceful neighbourhood and only 10 min from the city centre. I stayed there 3 different times and every time, the staff has been very friendly and helpful. Even the owner takes his time for a talk with his customers. 
Comfortable rooms. A full and varied breakfast in the morning. A good quality price for a stay in Dublin.",4,2014,07,31
247,Learned to love it!,"At first, I was a little annoyed at the narrow halls, lack of air-conditioning on a warm day, lugging our luggage up the tall front stairs.  After a 5 day stay, I was sad to leave!  I learned to love this hotel.  The location is great, short walk to the Dart.  Wonderful area of Dublin.  Fantastic breakfast buffet.  The nicest and friendliest staff.  I would definitely stay here again, quirks and all!",4,2014,07,28
247,40 years!!,"We have been visiting the Sandymount off 7 on for the past 40 years and we would not consider using any other venue for our stays in Dublin so I feel that I can speak from experience. I must admit that we have a smile when we read comments such as squeaky floors, fluctuations in water temperatures, etc. We have never had any negatives experiences in any of our stays. The reasons we use the Mount Herbert/Sandymount are location, value for money, friendly atmosphere, personal supervision of the owner and his sons - I could go on & on. We have just returned after a short 3 day break and found everything ""as usual"" - just the way we like it. And on the point of squeaky floors - is this more a matter of inconsiderate guests? We look forward to our next break.",5,2014,07,26
247,Great location but needs some aircondioning,"Stayed here two nights with the family. While at first glance it seemed far from the center, it was very easy to get a cab or take the train downtown.  We had no reservations but the clerk not only got us two rooms but also adjoining ones for the five of us at 0030 and for two nights on top of that.  Hotel had a great breakfast buffet and a bar at night for drinks.  I would stay here again. ",5,2014,07,22
247,The hotel needs some physical improvement,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a total of seven nights. It was in a great location with easy access to transportation. Also, the hotel staff was excellent and extremely helpful. Unfortunately, two things stood out in a bad way. First, the only heat in the room was from an old radiator style heater located in the bedroom. This meant that each morning the bathroom, which was not heated at all, was cold. Second, on three mornings out of the seven that we awoke there, we had no hot water. The shower reached only lukewarm at best after allowing it to run for several minutes.",3,2014,07,21
247,Lizanne,"I always chose this hotel when in Dublin. Staff very friendly. Very clean hotel and feels homely. I love sandymount, the strand and easy access to city. It always feels like a little holiday even though I am only coming up from Cork to see family.",5,2014,07,21
247,Conveniently situated hotel with good links to city centre...Nice area,"We found this hotel many years ago while under it's former name of the `Mount Herbert` and after a very pleasant stay have returned quite a few times.
On the first visit i was walking in from the `spacious` carpark and struck up a conversation with an elderly gentleman whom i thought at the time was just another guest only to discover later that he was in fact none other than the proprieter himself, the late `George Loughran!`
Needless to say this chance meeting with George along with the great hospitality we received played no small part in our subsequent return visits.
However our recent visit last month to the `Sandymount Hotel`, as it is now known, fell somewhat short of our expectations. Staff where good, but not great, with fewer local accents, and the food was just ok but didn't match our previous visits. The room we got was very clean and functional but very small and on departure i don't think we even got a `thankyou` or `Hope you enjoyed your stay`
On the plus side the Sandymount remains a good well run hotel and  deserves the benefit of the doubt. It is in a very convenient location, not in the city centre, but close enough to avail of the excellent rail (DART) connection just round the corner which is about a 10-15mins journey to Tara Steet/ Connelly stations.
It's perfect for the Aviva Stadium (at the end of the steet) and a pleasant 10 min walk in the evening to the village of Sandymount where there are a variety of pubs/restaurants and cafes.
If you are arriving by car then it's hard to beat, particulary if you are coming off the Ferries.
---From the docks cross the River Liffey via the East toll bridge (just under 2 Euros) and you're there in 10 minutes. You can leave your car at the Hotel all day and use the DART for quick, cheap access to the city centre.
WIFI is free.  
Try and get a room at the front if you can as the outlook is better and I believe you have a better chance of a bigger room.",3,2014,07,19
247,"Nice hotel, good location","We have stayed in this hotel a few times for the rugby. It is walking distance to Aviva. This visit, we had a private party. It was fabulous. We had a barbeque in the gardens which was fantastic.Food was great. The bar has a veranda looking down into the gardens.It is surrounded by an array of beautiful colourful flowers. It was heaven sitting in the sun reading the papers sipping cappuccino, surrounded by such beauty. The hotel has quite a few rest areas around reception and on the way to the rooms. They have really nice modern furnishings and provide plenty of chill out space. It is a pleasant short walk to the quaint village of Sandymount and 15 minute walk to the beach. It's a ten minute taxi ride into Dublin City. This hotel is really good value for money. My only gripe has always been that the beds are too small. Everything else is really good.
",4,2014,07,19
247,Neville EM,Overnight stay. Very close to Aviva stadium and Dart Station for easy access to City and Bray and Greystones. Staff very friendly and efficient. Food excellent and breakfast was beautiful and great variety. Very quiet the night we stayed but we were told it is very lively when events taking place in the Aviva.  Would definitely stay again.,4,2014,07,15
247,Gorgeous Hotel!,"My partner and I decided to stay at this hotel based on the location and price. It was in the most beautiful area of dublin 15 min walk to Sandy mount beach and the local village.
We had the most perfect room spacious and clean. 
The staff were so helpful in fulfilling any help we needed, with out question. 
We would definitely stay here again!",5,2014,07,14
247,We Keep Coming Back,"Since the previous review on this hotel we have again stayed for a long week-end.
 We stayed this time as room only as opposed to Bed and breakfast. The reason - Their breakfasts are too good and 3 of their breakfasts would not do my waist line any favors .
I have found on every visit that the staff are always happy and make you welcome and will assist you in every way they can.This visit was no different.
The hotel is very busy and the grounds and the interior are kept updated and clean.

I had a couple of minor issues on this visit but  by talking to the staff at the time they were sorted without problem

I find that no matter how big the hotel is and how good the infrastructure is issues do arise but if you sort it out at the time it's better than moaning about it after leaving. 

Would we visit and stay again............ of course we would ...

 Would we recommend the hotel.........of course we would",4,2014,07,14
247,"Great value, but some shortcomings.","We stayed in the Sandymount Hotel for one night recently.  The room rate was very good value, as it included parking.  The staff were v friendly.  The room was grand, but the bathroom was pretty damp and the ceiling/walls in the bathroom were stained.  But I think I would get over this, to stay in such a great location at this rate.  However, I would hesitate in booking this hotel again due to the risk of disturbed sleep due to noise from the corridor and other rooms.  The night we stayed, I would suspect that a lot of rooms were empty but it was still very noisy during the night.  It was a rare night away from small kids for us, so the broken sleep due to noise was not appreciated.",3,2014,07,13
247,Excellent Choice,"We love Dublin and usually stay in the centre but decided to have a change and stay a little way out and travel in on the Dart ,it was an excellent decision.
There was such a warm welcome at reception telling us about the local area. In fact we spent far more time in the local village than we intended to, such good pubs and restaurants and an easy walk back to the hotel. 
Our room was lovely, the decor was immaculate, it was clean, modern, light and airy. There was no waiting for the room to be cleaned, every day it had been done while we were at breakfast.
No going back to an unmade bed, much appreciated.
The breakfast was delicious, everything you could want, as much as you wanted, lovely and fresh. Only one very small niggle every morning I waited and waited for a cup of tea at breakfast, the waiter would pour my husband a coffee immediately we entered the room, I would ask for tea then wait, then ask again and wait, and I do like tea with my breakfast not afterwards. This is so minor but it happened on three consecutive mornings and became really irritating. Having said that I'm sure it was just bad luck.
We had a brilliant time and next time we visit Dublin we wouldn't stay anywhere else now.",5,2014,07,13
247,Unbelievable Value for a lovely stay,"Got a 2 night stay for just €75 per night...wasn't expecting much but was pleasently surprised!! From check in everything was just great! Reception staff so friendly & couldn't do more to help us!
Matress was the thickest, comfyest matress I have ever in my life slept on! Room was lovely and modern...maybe a little small. 
Food in the bar was gorgeous...and again staff in there were so accomodating (letting us order off the evening menu at 12.30pm!!), another evening we got back to the hotel after 10 and were looking for food but service had finished but staff insisted on making up sandwiches etc.
Hotel is located next to Sandymount village...lovely spot for a meal and walk.
Also the hotel is right next to the dart which takes you to Connoly station in just 5mins.
Must say great hotel & staff...will definatley be back!!!",5,2014,07,13
247,Plesant stay,"I have stayed in this hotel a few times, so that must say something about the place.
It is a bright well maintained establishment.
The rooms can be small though. This last time I stayed, it was a decent size room. Mostly I would travel for work and be on my own, so would be booking a single room.
It is always clean. the Bar is spacious and as can be expected in Dublin, dearer than the rest of the country for drinks.
The location is in the east side of the city and this location happens to be a preference for me. It is very close to the AVIVA Football / Rugby stadium. (Good luck truing to book a room when anyone is playing...)
It is however quite a walk into the city centre, but there is a DART station within 400m of the hotel - this will take you a few stops into the city centre area.
I usually keep an eye on the hotel comparison web sites for deals and generally get a good price when staying there.

I would recommend the hotel and will stay there again.",4,2014,07,13
247,Clean and Great Beds,Great location if you have a car or is willing to walk to down town Dublin. Right beside Aviva stadium and the Irish trainline down the coast. Very clean and secure and comfortable. We stayed in a room with a queen bed and a single bed.,4,2014,07,08
247,just the ticket for dublin,"We booked the hotel through Irish ferries for two nights at the start of our week in Ireland and for one night at the end. Our first stay was in room 121. A double which was rather small, the couple we went with were more savvy and booked a twin which was much larger.
That being said the hotel was very nice and clean, staff were polite and helpful .The  food in the bar and restaurant was varied and offered gluten free options.
The hotel is situated in a quiet street a few yards from the train station and half a mile from the the village of Sandymount  , well worth a visit.",4,2014,07,08
247,Nice hotel,"Stayed here a while back for a concert, Hotel looked nice on the outside, free parking was a plus, but the rooms, and the corirdors are old and very small. we were on the third floor and the way up to the hotel looked very dull! However staff are lovely, and even organised a mini bus for us to go to the O2 which was very handy and cheap!! Bar is nice and the balcony view of the garden is georgous!! Overall a nice total, just the corridors looked dull and boring!!",3,2014,07,06
247,Good Location -Where is my room,"Nice location, very central for Ballsbridge and Sandymount village. But you need to be very patient when looking for your room, resembles a rabbit warren. Up one stairs down another, where are we going.",3,2014,07,04
247,Mixed Bag,"I only stayed here the one night, arriving relatively late.

Good points:
Friendly reception staff
Good location around the corner from Aviva Stadium

Bad points:
Tired & outdated bathroom
Thin walls. Woken by an alarm in the next bedroom.",3,2014,07,03
247,Touring Ireland,"Recently had 14 days touring Ireland last 3 nights we were booked in at the Sandymount  Hotel Dublin, could not fault it in any way, the staff were polite and helpful  the food was excellent, Plenty of secure car parking at the rear of the hotel, if you want to go into Dublin City it's only 5 minutes walk to catch the trams(Dart) just opposite the Arrival Stadium or use the Blue or Red Bus a 2 day ticket will cost you 19 Euros from the Hotel Reception desk well worth it. Mick,Pam and Martin.",5,2014,07,01
247,May 2014,"Good hotel well worth the price in a peaceful part of Dublin.
Helpful friendly staff. Comfortable rooms .
The breakfast was good . On the Dart or a  taxi is about !2 euro or if you walk to the village there is a bus into the centre.",4,2014,06,30
247,Good value for Dublin 4,"Stayed here a couple of times for both business and leisure. Rooms are to a good standard - especially thanks to a free upgrade on one occasion. The hotel is obviously a few houses joined together, so the corridor and lift system can be a bit confusing - rooms numbers starting with 1 are down in basement, but good size and well lit. Breakfast fine, though they suffer from that common affliction of hotels - ""Let's save 2c by only putting one tea bag in the pot"". Staff very friendly. Nice location, just 5 mins walk from Lansdowne Rd rail station. ",4,2014,06,27
247,Highly recommend it,Stayed here in June 2014 and was very satisfied with the Sandymount. It was clean and well serviced and all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is close to the DART train service (only 2 stops to the city centre) and within 500 metres of Sandymount village with a few pubs and shops. Parking was plentiful and the food in the restaurant was great. Will definitely be staying here on my next visit to Dublin.,5,2014,06,27
247,Great Hotel and fantastic Staff,"It's been a long time since I stayed here but it won't be as long again.

This Hotel is a little gem. Rooms are a good size, very clean and comfortable, fantastic value for money.

Excellent food selection both at Breakfast and for bar food in the evening, an extensive menu and specials each night. There is a real buzz about the bar but not so loud that you can't relax.

My favourite part of the Hotel has to be the deck overlooking the garden. Sitting out with a lovely pint, it's perfect.

A special mention has to go to the Staff who are so friendly. From breakfast to evening, everyone had a smile and I truly felt like a valued guest.

Will be back and spreading the word.",5,2014,06,26
247,Quiet and comfortable,"Warm reception with helpful staff. Room and facilities fine. Minor problem with bathroom which was sorted out quickly. Breakfasts good with plenty of choice. 

Five minute walk to train station and 10 minutes to local restaurants. Would recommend.",5,2014,06,26
247,Absolutely amazing staff,"I attended a Customer Service Workshop on the 25/6/14 in your hotel. From the moment I stepped foot in the hotel I was made feel so welcome. After the workshop I spent an hour or two sampling the Guinness in the bar. As a fellow bartender I must admit that I was very impressed with Parvesh.  He was so friendly, talkative and he was very enthusiastic and passionate about his work. He kept up conversation with me the whole time I was there. All in all I had an amazing experience and I would definitely return. 5 star service from a three star hotel. ",5,2014,06,25
247,Like and old friend,"Again - great stay, and absolutely no complaints at all . This is a good honest hotel and it does what it does well. The fact that my reviews are constantly positive is evidence of this. 

i will be back.",4,2014,06,25
247,"2 nights, absolutely brilliant service","I was a female traveling alone for a brief visit to Dublin. The Sandymout was recommended by local colleagues. They could not have done a better job. A short walk to the villages of Sandymount or Ballsbridge, everything is at your doorstep. 
Staff at Sandymount are wonderful. Welcoming, friendly and helpful. My room was a fair way away from reception and upon check out, the lift in my wing was out of order. My bags were swiftly collected and delivered to my cab, no questions asked and no hassle at all.
The bar is lovely, sitting on the deck overlooking the garden is a terrific way to see out the day. 
Room service was 50/50. Chowder was the best I'd ever eaten. Nachos were atrocious. 
Rooms are spotless. Housekeeping did a great job each day.
I would absolutely stay here again. This is a top hotel where everyone is there to assist.",5,2014,06,23
247,"Sandy mount Hotel, Dublin","Brilliant hotel, must emphasise how polite and friendly the staff were, the customer service at this hotel was brilliant from all staff members!!  
The hotel itself was lovely, very clean and tidy, comfortable rooms and in a great location next to the Aviva Stadium.  A nice walk into the town, or there is a station within 5 minutes walk that gets you to the centre of Dublin very quickly.  The breakfast was great aswell with a great selection to choose from. Would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2014,06,21
247,A Fun Night out,"I went with a group of friends to this hotel last Saturday.  I wanted to say what brilliant staff they have in here.  We got an upgrade on our room and we just had the best time.  The receptionists were fantastic and really helped us enjoy our night.  The breakfast was also great.  The service in the dinner room was second to none.

I will definitely be recommending this hotel to friends and family.",5,2014,06,20
247,Good Value Hotel nice and helpful staff,"I give this hotel a rating of 4 stars because the staff are very nice and helpful. The hotel has a relaxed atmosphere. It is a bit sprawling, in that you might have to go for lift A or lift B and/or go up or down stairs and walk for a bit in order to get to your room, but the room we had was very nice, bed was comfortable and the shower was great - very powerful and plenty hot! Although you will most likely use taxis to and from city centre, it is not really that far and there is plenty of free parking in the hotel grounds.  Sandymount village and Ballsbridge are very near too (short walk). I would stay here again.",4,2014,06,19
247,Just right!!,"Whenever I need to stay on this side of Dublin for business I stay here. Nice rooms, good food , brilliant location and a very friendly staff. Beatrice always looks after us whenever we drop in. Some day I'll get to take in a match at the Aviva, it's right nextdoor!!",5,2014,06,18
247,Another fantastic experience,"I recently returned to this hotel for short business trip and was again very impressed. The staff were so friendly, helpful and accomodating to my request for a quiet room. The breakfast and bar food were of a very high standard, with quick and friendly service after a long day at work. I could not recommend it highly enough for the location, right next to the Aviva stadium and Lansdowne Dart station or a quick, cheap taxi to the city centre. It is always my preferred choice in Dublin.",5,2014,06,13
247,Friendly family run hotel,"A friendly greeting awaits you when you enter this family run hotel set right in the heart of Dublin. Set right beside the Aviva stadium and 5 minutes taxi ride;or make use of their courtesy bus; from the O2 we found thatit is central to everything. Our party of 4 had stayed in 2 spacious rooms- each had a double and a single bed on a Friday evening to attend a concert in the O2. (my husband had forgot to bring the tickets- but that another story!) We had our evening meal in the restaurant and I have to say, my duck with noodles in chilli lime dressing was superb! My husband settled for the homemade burger and chips which he promptly devoured. Our friends also enjoyed their meals. After an enjoyable evening at the concert it was back to the hotel for a nightcap in the bar before a comfortable nights sleep and back on the road home. We will definitely be using this hotel again!",5,2014,06,10
247,You will not be disappointed,"This is my favourite Hotel in Dublin. The location is excellent, only a step away from the dart station, the Aviva Stadium and very close to The O2 and city centre. But that's only a location and while that is excellent, what I love is the warm welcome, the friendly staff, especially Beatrice who is a gem, beautiful food, ease of parking, the lovely family run feel and best of all a good nights sleep.",5,2014,06,09
247,Unexpected,"This is a lovely hotel.The staff were very friendly and helpful. A very good base in Dublin for concerts,matches etc. Easy access to the O2,Aviva stadium,or RDS.
I travelled with my elderly parents and my son,my parents enjoyed it so much that they are going back in 2 weeks to visit more of Dublin.",4,2014,06,09
247,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed here for the second time. Rooms are a decent size and bathrooms have shower, bath, etc. tea/coffee in rooms and wifi via bitbuzz vouchers, which works just fine. 
Across from Aviva stadium and a short walk to Sandymount green (Mulligans great pub and good food) or Ballsbridge. 
Nice enough hotel, no frills, but then again you're not paying normal high Dublin prices. Would stay here again for the value for money. ",3,2014,06,08
247,Such a special place,"I was able to be pampered by the incredible staff for almost 2 weeks.  The hotel is lovely, quaint, charming and quiet. The staff are attentive and so helpful.  Delicious meals and drinks and impeccably clean rooms rounded out my experience. It's obvious that this is a family business because everyone is committed to doing their best for the owners and guests. I can't wait to return.",5,2014,06,06
247,B&B without rest,"We stayed here on weds night for a concert (we had stayed before for a concert in the O2 and as they offered a free shuttle bus to the venue we chose this hotel again). 

Firstly when we arrived to check in we inquired about the shuttle to the O2, this was still an available service, although now not free and cost €3 per person to arrive at the concert 1.5hrs early, so we walked... We got back at about 11.30 that evening and had a drink which was very comfortable and served by friendly staff. 

The following morning we were woken by a knock at the door and a member of housekeeping coming in at 8am. When I went to the door after making them aware that we were still in the room I looked down the corridor to see the person trying to hide down the hallway, I asked why she knocked and she just said oh sorry. Then unable to get back to sleep I got ready and called reception asking what time check out was and was there a reason we were being woken to leave early. I was simply apologized to and that's it. Didn't quite make up for the lack of sleep ...

We didn't have breakfast included but went to the restaurant and paid €10 each for a full irish buffet. Unfortunatly it seemed that €10 wouldn't even buy you a slice of toast - after standing at a 6 slice toaster for nearly 10 mins I gave up trying to get my toast, it seems that the couple that I had put mine in were broken with no signage to tell people. So people were using the other slots as I was waiting for mine, there was never a chance to use the working ones. I approached the lady who seemed to be in charge (short blonde hair) and asked her why there wasn't a label or something on it to tell us that it was broken and all I got was a dirty look while she ordered someone else to get something for a sign. No apology. 

No sleep, no breakfast without attitude, I don't think we'll bother again for our future dublin trips. And on a side note, the day ahead was to be enjoyed with a little shopping whilst in the capital, unfortunatly due to the lack of rest, it was mostly filled with sitting around resting. Waste of a day....",3,2014,06,06
247,Great location,"We stayed here on Saturday night may 31st 2014 as we were in Dublin for our visit to the bord gais energy theatre to watch singing in the rain. Over all it was a very pleasant experience. We arrived at the hotel on Saturday evening. We had booked a double room but on arrival were allocated a twin. We phoned reception and we were immediately allocated a new room. The room itself was clean, with a very comfortable bed. As we were late arriving and were in a hurry to get to our show we decided to eat in the hotel bar. The service was quick and friendly, the menu offered great choice and the food was a treat. The map of the area provided at check in was a great help to find our way to the theatre which was only a twenty minute stroll away. The hotel is also a great location for events at the aviva stadium and the rds.

Breakfast the following morning was also very good, with all the usual trimmings, my one complaint being that the coffee wasn't great. On the way back from breakfast we bumped into the owner, John, who introduced himself and asked how we were getting on. After a quick chat we packed our bags and were on our way. Overall, a pleasant stay, friendly staff and I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,06,06
247,Had a wonderful stay!,"I stayed here whilst travelling alone with my baby, and the staff were incredibly helpful. I hadn't realised it was right beside the stadium, so I would highly recommend this as a perfect place to stay if you are attending an event. The room was perfect for our needs, with a queen and a single. I also really enjoyed walking to the local shops on a sunny evening, as it is such a nice area and there were lots of kids out playing, people having after work drinks, and I felt very safe. I was also glad that the clientele were mainly couples in their 30's and above, as I really didn't want to be in a hotel with all the stag and hen parties (I was there on a weekend). I think the only slight negative were the 2 staff working in the breakfast room pretty much ignored me and were pretty surly. All in all I would highly recommend this place as a quiet but very handy hotel.",5,2014,06,04
247,Sandymount Dublin,We stayed two knights in this wonder full hotel. It is a nice Quaid hotel on a nice location in the suburbs of Dublin. When you want to go the centre off Dublin the train station is just a walk off 3 minutes a way and with the train just 3 stations and off you go into the centre.,5,2014,06,04
247,Handy for the rugby ground and the Dart,"Bought as part of a deal through Irish Ferries, we ended up in a very basic room at the back of the hotel. The room was very cool - apparently the central heating doesn't come on until 7pm even if it's only 12C outside! WE had very narrow twin beds and had a little trouble keeping the duvet on it.
The hotel is a strange amalgam of 4 large Georgian houses so you may well  find that you have to go upstairs to go downstairs for breakfast. The food is well worth it though - full Irish.
It's not just popular for spectators, the hotel is BIG on BIG weddings and these can go on late. Expect kids running in the corridors.
We had one evening meal in the bar which was an excellent (huge) spread washed down by the blackstuff.
Hotel pro's definitely outweigh  the few con's we had. Good value for your Euro.",4,2014,06,03
247,Relaxing Family Holiday,"We have stayed at The Sandymount Hotel numerous times over the last few years and every time we are reluctant to leave it. We live in the Middle East and are well travelled but to arrive at the Sandymount Hotel is a pure joy for us.

The Hotel itself has a quaint character of its own, not a set of boxes that you come to expect of the modern hotels. The staff are warm and welcoming and give freely of their time and they genuinely want you to enjoy your stay.

The Irish Breakfast you need to try for yourself............our son becomes the Bacon King for two-weeks!

We are looking forward to our stay in July.",5,2014,05,30
247,Great location for the aviva,"Four of us stayed here for the Leinster v Ulster match at the RDS. Whilst not as handy as the Aviva, it was a pleasant stroll to Merrion Road and the pre-match revelry. The Sandymount is clean and comfortable with a decent breakfast. It's not particularly cheap, but you will pay that bit more when there's rugby or a concert",4,2014,05,29
247,Excellent,"Great value hotel. Lovely helpful staff,nothing too much trouble  Situation of hotel in nice quiet area   with nice walks around it.Bar excellent for drink or food. As converted from a row of houses it has good parking and nice garden Just be aware steps up to front reception but way in at ground level if needed Also because of conversion has lots of staircases but lifts available. Will be back",4,2014,05,29
247,Home away from Home,"Great Hotel, Great people at the reception, Friendly services and a homely atmosphere.  Budget hotel at corporate rate.  Like hotel shuttle bus to and from office.  Even the bus driver is extremely friendly!!  Would recommend to any friends",4,2014,05,28
247,Wonderful Hospitality,"We so enjoyed our stay at Sandymount. The rooms are basic, but large enough and spotless. Bedding is not luxury, but very comfortable. Breakfast buffet was varied and tasty. What makes this spot worth a five-point review was the hospitality -- wonderful friendly desk service, and despite being booked solid the night before, the staff went out of their way to set up a room for early check in for my husband and me, when we were dropping with fatigue after the overnight flight from the US. They called cabs, housed luggage, gave local directions and advice, and all with sincere kindness and obvious pride in running a business well. 

Would return again and recommend to friends. ",5,2014,05,28
247,"Fantastic Value, excellent barfood, very pleasant staff","Stayed here on the lidl breaks offer for the 1D concert.I have to say, not having stayed here before, that I was really suprised as to how nice the hotel was.The family room (which is not always the case) was very spacious & clean with two full single beds & a double that weren't squeezed  in to facilitate a family.The staff were very friendly & courteous and the  bar food and breakfast in the morning was excellent.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel when on a visit for shopping trip/match etc, & I would /will definitely be 
returning at another stage.",5,2014,05,27
247,It's the people that enrich the experience.,"The staff, especially at the front desk were warm, charming and extremely helpful.  They helped me make best use of my limited stay and facilitated many arrangements.  I will stay there on my future visits.",5,2014,05,26
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Have just checked out of The Sandymount Hotel.  I was staying their with my mum, sister and nieces we went to the 1D concert at Croke Park
.  
The food was lovely.  The staff helpful and friendly.

Atmosphere brilliant The Under 21s Rugby Team stayed here as well.  So needless to say my niece was delighted between seeing 1D and the under 21 team it made her weekend.

We would recommend this hotel it is spotless,s staff friendly and convenient for the City Centre.  

.  .",5,2014,05,26
247,Great stay!,"I actually don't bother writing reviews myself, but have to say how delighted I am with this hotel: very friendly and helpful reception staff and really good bar and breakfast food. Plus the room I stayed in was spotless and serviced every day! Very quiet neighbourhood and DART station just a few steps ahead if you need to go anywhere in town during the day.
Will recommend to all my friends and family and will definitely come back.
Keep up the good work!",5,2014,05,26
247,Small - but - Perfectly formed,"This is a very nice small hotel.  There is a nice feel to the place.  The hotel is located about 2 miles from the city centre.  The DART train station is just up the road and you can get you in and out of the city centre in quick time.

The Aviva stadium is about 500 meters away.  If you are going to a match, this is the spot to stay in (book early).Breakfast was the usual fare and nicely done. 

The service was excellent.  My room was small, but, very clean and filled with sunshine.  I normally am a terrible sleeper , but, I had the best nights sleep in a hotel when I stayed in the Sandymount. 

The city centre hotels can be very expensive, but, if you look just outside the city centre there is some good quality hotels with reasonable rates.  The Sandymount is one of these type of hotels.",4,2014,05,23
247,Fresh,I stay here with my mammy sometimes when we go to Dublin. I like the breakfast here because they give me sausages and rashers (you wouldn't bate a real irish rasher.). The room that we stayed in was real fresh too and the man that talks to us is lovely too. I cant wait to come again you what i mean.,5,2014,05,22
247,A lovely relaxing hotel!,"Myself and my husband had the pleasure of staying here for one night last weekend. It was very relaxing and the atmosphere was very welcoming. We visit Dublin a lot and this is definitely going to be our 'go to' hotel anytime we are staying overnight in Dublin again.  The girls at the reception we extremely warm and attentive and for a small price we upgraded our room to a Junior Suite.  This room was lovely and spacious and extremely quiet during the night, even though it faced out onto the main road.  The quality of the breakfast was great the next morning and the fact that the hotel is within walking distance of Dublin City Centre is an added bonus.  Looking forward to going back!!",5,2014,05,22
247,Adequate,"This hotel is a bit cheaper than others in Ballsbridge,  but not worth the small saving. On the plus side, couldn't fault the bar food or the service in general.  It was pleasant and efficient. However, this hotel is all over the place,small endless corridors, stairs everywhere, it was a workout! The rooms are basic but clean, but the bathroom is a horror.  Dirty grouting, ancient fittings and no heating. Think the guests deserve double ply toilet paper in this day and age,seems miserly. The breakfast is of a poor standard but again the service was good.  I stayed here because Bewley's was full and I'm in Dublin 2 nights a week.  ",3,2014,05,21
247,A special hotel,"I have been spending 2/3 days a week in Dublin for the last 7 months and having stayed in the Sandymount hotel on my first trip, I have not looked elsewhere. This is a real hidden gem! The hotel is located about 3km from the city centre and is well served by buses and the dart which are within a very short walking distance. The staff have a personal approach that is now rare in this industry and the food (particularly the full Irish) is as good as I have enjoyed in some of the top Dublin hotels. The rooms and bathrooms are clean, simple and very comfortable. This review is easily topped off by the fact that the hotel is very competitively priced. For the business / leisure traveler with a budget, I would look no further than the Sandymount Hotel.",5,2014,05,21
247,very convenient,"My husband and I stayed at the Sandymount hotel last night following a gig in the city centre.  When we arrived at the hotel I realised that I had stayed there many times in the past on business in its previous life as the Mount Herbert Hotel.  The hotel is quirky as it is a series of houses joined together.  This results in a maze of corridors with the room numbering difficult to figure out.  Luckily my husband had checked in earlier and knew how to find our bedroom as I would have been totally lost otherwise!  The room was very spacious with a double and single bed - we would have preferred a room with just a king or queen sized bed, we find double beds just too small.  However we both slept very well indeed.  I didn't partake of breakfast, my husband did and pronounced it ""OK"".  The hotel is very conveniently located being within a very short walking distance of Lansdowne Road Dart station for a train service into the city centre.  It is also very good value for money.  We will definitely consider staying there again next time we need to overnight in Dublin city.",4,2014,05,21
247,Average Hotel,"Our room was comfortable. The room was clean. Serviced daily. The staff were friendly and helpful. The passages, lifts and public area could do with a upgrade. Carpets were old. Passages had a strange odour.",3,2014,05,20
247,Comfortable and well located,"The Sandymount is a very pleasant hotel. I stayed here in November for three nights and it was a perfect base from which to explore Dublin. The rooms are comfortable and relatively standard. The bar is nice. The area immediately around the hotel has a number of nice cafes and pubs that are great for lunch, an afternoon drink, or a nice traditional dinner. It is also an easy train ride into the city, or a cab is typically only about 10 EUR. 

The service was also exceptional. I arrived very early on the first morning, well before check-in and the staff worked hard to find me a room that I could get into right away (needed after an overnight flight from Washington DC!). On the first night, we went to the Billy Joel concert and the hotel provided a shuttle for a minimal charge, which was really helpful. 

All in all, a nice mid-range hotel.",5,2014,05,19
247,Best hotel in Dublin,"Have been staying here for  many years. Excellent all over, bar staff, chamber maids. Reception staff excellent, very helpful and nothing is a problem for them. Spotless hotel and excellent food.
Lovely friendly owner John who mixes very well with all the guests making sure they enjoy their stay.

Looking forward forward to my next stay here with my daughter Katelyn!",5,2014,05,19
247,Excellent Service,"Recently stayed at the Sandymount Hotel and inadvertently left my phone charger plugged in by the bedside. I phoned the hotel and they said as housekeeping was closed they would ring me the next morning. They phoned next morning, had found the charger and arranged to post it to me free of charge - they wouldn't accept my offer to pay postage! It arrived within 2 days. I've stayed at the Sandymount a few times and the staff are always friendly, the hotel is comfortable and they serve great food in the bar, I would certainly recommend staying there.",5,2014,05,19
247,Great place,"Spent a couple of nights here and had a great time.  Staff couldn't have been more helpful.  The bar was great - fantastic atmosphere.  The only downside - a really small gripe - was the coffee in the room.  It could have been better.  All in all, I'd thoroughly recommend it.",5,2014,05,18
247,Very friendly hotel,"My friend and I stayed for two nights at the Sandymount and couldn't fault the friendly staff on their helpfulness. Easy access into the town using the dart station which was just a few minutes walk from the hotel.

We bought a two day pass with the red hop on bus which picked us up from the front of the hotel at 8.50am.

Our rooms were clean and fresh but needed upgrading especially the bathrooms. Breakfast was very good as was the food in the bar.

The only negative was the football match which was on the Wednesday night and the hotel was overrun by supporters making it difficult for residents to find a place to sit at the bar or lounge area or get a table at the restaurant that evening.",5,2014,05,17
247,Great for a match at Aviva,"We stayed here for the Liverpool v Shamrock match last week.The staff were very nice,especially in reception,very helpful.The room was a family room,very clean.Would have loved if there was two double beds in a family room,maybe the next time we go back there will be.Breakfast was self service which was good but could have abit more variety with fruit and cereal options, but otherwise  it was good.",4,2014,05,17
247,"Great hotel, accessible, friendly staff","Stayed in the sandmount recently and was very happy with my choice yet again.  My partner and I have stayed several times and are always reluctant to go anywhere else as this place just ticks all the boxes for us, its affordable, close to city centre, rooms are modern quiet and clean, and the staff are always ao friendly. Highly recommend if in dublin!",5,2014,05,17
247,Would highly recommend..great stay!,"I stayed in the Sandymount Hotel the weekend of a big match in the Aviva and had a great experience. The staff are super friendly, the food is great, and everything is withing walking distance. It's also great value and I will definitely be back!",5,2014,05,16
247,Real nice place,"We stayed at the Sandymount for 1 of our nights in Dublin and found it very accommodating.The staff was exceptional-very nice and really helpful with directions.The hotel is only a short walk from the train station which will get you anywhere you need to go.The rooms we had were old,but updated and very spacious and clean.The secure and free parking was nice and the breakfast was good.We'd recommend the Sandymount to friends for sure!",4,2014,05,16
247,What a letdown!,"Checked in to a smelly, dull room. Requested a change and was denied. Told food was being served until 9.30 but was later told kitchen had closed even when we arrived before. Reluctantly served but got all our courses together.Our deal was to include tea and coffee but the waitress declined this. Slow dissatisfying service. Wouldn't recommend. ",2,2014,05,15
247,Great Hotel,"We were a group of friends who stayed in the hotel, Location was perfect. Rooms were bright and clean. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Parking is fee and secure. We ate in the Bar, we had the 8oz homemade burgar- it was so tender and tastie and the whiskey relish was a great touch to it. For dessert we had the cookie monster pot -this is heaven in a jar. It was by far one of the nicest desserts i have ever had. I am still deaming about it. It is a must have if you are staying in this hotel.So big compliments to the chefs.  
Eilish Doherty Murphy",5,2014,05,14
247,Delightful location,"The staff were most helpful and kind. They told us about interesting things in the vicinity, how and where to catch the DART, and were always pleasantly mannered. The food in the restaurant at breakfast and dinner was delicious too! We would definitely recommend this hotel!",4,2014,05,08
247,High stars for the great value for pricing,"Clean rooms, quiet (but no activities were at stadium in our four nights), and in a location that was perfect for us: Ballsbridge is a village with a starbucks, pubs, good cafes.  Sandymount was an even tinier village, and both close walking distance. The Dart train is a two minute walk and two fast stops to downtown.  Front desk staff was informative and cheerfull.   The only 'miss' was the 'tour-bus quality' breakfast.",4,2014,05,08
247,impolite and unhelpful staff,"We were a group of singers (a choir) who stayed at the hotel at the beginning and end of our tour in Ireland. Two of us forgot some clothing at our rooms during the first stay but when we came back to the hotel a few days afterwards the people at the reception refused to help us locate the clothes, didn't agree that we look at the lost and found or see the person responsible and in general behaved in very unprofessional and not pleasant manner.",2,2014,05,06
247,Perfect hotel for a weekend away!!!,"Stayed in the Sandymount for 2 nights at the end of April with my boyfriend. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. There was a brilliant shuttle bus service which the hotel operates, making travelling into Dublin extremely easy! Had breakfast one morning and there was a great selection. The rooms were extremely clean and sheets/towels were changed every morning! This is an excellent location, right beside the aviva stadium, 5min drive from the O2 and a 12 min drive to the city centre!! The free wifi is also a bonus! Will definately be staying here again :-) ",5,2014,05,06
247,Nice hotel at a great price!,"Recently stayed here 2 different nights in 2 different rooms.  The hotel is nice (it's an older hotel), and the rooms are both spacious and comfortable.  We ate at the bar one night, and the food was very good.

While the hotel is nice and the price is very affordable, the location puts you far away from a lot of the nightlife action.  You will most likely be taking a taxicab to a lot of Dublin's highlights.  I knew that before I booked, and it's not a huge problem.  The front desk will gladly call you a cab (which arrives in 2 mins), and cabs in Dublin are rather inexpensive.  Less than 10 euros gets you almost anywhere around the city center.",4,2014,05,06
247,#quiet,"Hotel rooms are a little dated but very clean. Bathroom spotless. Iron/ ironing board and safe in room.  Right on the doorstep of the Aviva Stadium, if you were going to a gig there, this is the hotel for you!  We stayed on a quiet night, i.e. no gigs on.  Hotel was quiet, what we were looking for though, a quiet night away from the hustle and bustle. Grounds are beautiful, food was DIVINE, waiters were friendly. Bar staff not so friendly but you cant win them all!  Parking in the hotel is free and plentiful.",3,2014,05,06
247,Fantastic Hotel !,"We - myself, other half and our 6 yr old son - stayed for 2 nights. Cannot fault the hotel at all. From the minute we arrived to the time we left, we were made to feel very very welcome. Beatrice on reception was one of the nicest receptionists I have ever met. Our little boy loved chatting to her about what he had got up to etc. She greeted us with a smile everytime we arrived back to the hotel and was very helpful when we inquired about tours of Dublin. 
The hotel is an ideal base for anyone attending the RDS. It is literally a ten minute walk away and about 5 minutes away from Lansdowne Dart station, which is brilliant for travelling into Dublin. 
The Dublin Sightseeing tour bus leaves outside the hotel at 8.50am, I think every morning. Tickets for this can be bought at hotel reception for 19 euro each and kids are free. It does not drop back to hotel though so you will need to get the Dart or bus etc. 
The food in the hotel is excellent. Portions are big, food is very tasty and restaurant was busy anytime we were in there - both at lunchtime and in the evenings - which is always a great sign. 
Breakfast was again excellent. Staff very attentive and great selection of food on offer. 
We stayed in room 101 - one of the family rooms. It is right beside the lift but we did not hear any noise at all the 2 nights we stayed. Rooms were very clean and bathrooms also. They have been described as small in previous reviews but  in fairness people do not generally stay in a hotel because they have huge bathrooms !!!! 
Al the staff seemed genuinely happy in their work and were fantastic with kids. To me that made all the difference. 
Overall I would highly recommend this hotel as a family base for exploring Dublin and it's sights.
Thank you Beatrice and all the other staff. I'm sure we will see you all again in the near future.",5,2014,05,04
247,Excellent value for money,"Stayed one night, staff were very attentive on arrival and also very helpful during our stay. Rooms are clean, adequate & comfortable, though en suite bathrooms are best described as 'bijou' to be kind.  It's a family-run business, so there is a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.  The location in Dublin 4 is excellent, and close to the Aviva Stadium DART station for quick access to the city.  Free parking round the hotel is straight-forward. Wi-fi was free, and easy to log onto.  Also, RDS & Herbert Park are nearby, so a nice side of the city to stay in. Overall, we would definitely come back again for another short stay in Dublin.",4,2014,05,03
247,Good stay location can't be beaten.,"Stayed here for one night recently while attending something in the Aviva.

Location cannot be beaten 2 mins walk to the Aviva and 3 mins walk to the dart station.

Staff all very friendly and accommodating. They all seemed happy in their work.

Bar area clean and open, cannot comment on the food as we did not eat bar food when staying.

Room was on minus 1 level at the back of the hotel.

Room was clean and modernized with a flat screen tv, bathroom was slightly old looking with old fixtures and fittings but very clean. Only issue was the temperature. The centrally controlled heating seemed to be turned off in this building at approx 11pm and I was freezing/icy when we returned to the room as a result later that night.

 It had been ""cosy"" earlier. I rang down to reception and the night porter offered to hunt down a portable heater and bring it to the room but I declined as it was very late at night and I would have had to get up out of bed get dressed etc to take the heater into the room. I sorted myself out with some extra blankets that were in the room.

The next day on leaving I did mention it to the girl in reception she was very apologetic about this. We were offered a free upgrade to an executive room on our next stay. I would definitely request this the next time or pay extra to have it.

Breakfast was the usual fare and staff worked well considering the breakfast room was full to capacity. Would love to see some healthier options for breakfast in Ireland. We are far too obsessed with the full Irish. Gluten Free bread/soya/almond milk and more fruit/nut selections would be great. 

Will stay here again if I am attending something in the Aviva.",3,2014,05,01
247,Perfect place for a overnight or a longer stay,"Not my first stay here, at not my last. This is a venue with assets of a hotel but the informality and relaxed feel of being at home and welcome. 
Its just minutes from the city, yet in a peaceful area with its own local restaurants and bar. A place to experience the real Dublin.
As a guest they seem to care, not the case with all hotels in the city where you are just another number. So I recommend you choose the Sandymount.",5,2014,04,28
247,"Clean, convenient and friendly","Clean, convenient and friendly hotel in a good location with reasonable rates. It appears to be recently refurbished. I would recommend for a quiet stay in Dublin or if attending an event at Aviva stadium you couldn't get much closer.",4,2014,04,28
247,Great hotel,"I'm only  just home after staying at the Sandymount from Tuesday 22 april 2014 until yesterday. This is my 3rd time staying here and booked again for July 24th and St Patricks for next year.
This hotel is 110% better than any other hotel ive stayed in Dublin.
Its right on the door step to the Aviva Stadium and a couple of minutes walk to Lansdown Road dart station to take you into the city centre. 10 minutes along the water takes you to the o2 for concerts. The hotel does do a mini bus to the o2 but on a lovely night you could walk which I done for the Jeff Dunham show.
Staff are very friendly and give you the best warm welcome you could ask for. They will go out there way to answer any questions. 
Beds are the most comfy you could ask for. Housekeeper is very good and would go out of her way to help you with stuff for your room. We had our room cleaned every day and got clean towels everyday
Food is off amazing quality and very reasonable. Bar staff are very pleasant and so is the reception staff. Couldn't fault the hotel in any way and I think that's why we are going back.
I cant wait to stay here again in July for the 4 nights we are over for the Garth Brooks concert.",5,2014,04,27
247,Distinctly average,We stayed here over Easter weekend the hotel was very average. The room was not particularly clean we had what looked blood stains on the carpet and tea stains down the drawers. Location is OK for the train station. ,3,2014,04,27
247,Great stay close to the heart of Dublin,"We stayed one night after arriving on the ferry.  It couldn't have been much better: easy to find on the satnav; welcoming and helpful staff, friendly throughout our stay.  Our room was clean, quiet and comfortable; breakfast straightforward buffet but fresh and full with fresh and dried fruit.  We would definitely stay here again if we were visiting Dublin.",5,2014,04,26
247,Great Value Hotel,"A full service hotel with a surprisingly good restaurant and full bar. 

The rooms are a reasonable size and are clean and fairly modern. Wifi is free (top marks for that) and fast.

Breakfast is pretty good for a hotel. It is a buffet, but there is a good selection, including black and white pudding.

A nice little extra is that the hotel has a small garden, which is very pleasant to sit in if the weather will allow.

The only negative is that it is 2 km or so out of the centre of Dublin. It is walkable in 30 minutes or so. The Dart train is only 3 minutes walk and that will take you into the centre too.

I've given this hotel 4 stars, because I think it is worth 4 stars whatever price you pay. We got it for 55 Euros a night and at that price it is worth a full 5 starts.",4,2014,04,23
247,We'll be back!,"Stayed here for 5 days in April during the week before Easter.  We arrived by way of the Dublin port and took the bus into the middle of town. From there you take the #4 or #7 bus and get off just past the ballsbridge stop,  next to the AIM banking center on the left. Or the easier route is to take the dart train and get off at the Lansdowne stop. Turn right outside the station and follow the sidewalk and the hotel will be on the right hand side. The staff at this hotel are very friendly and helped us with everything from directions into the village of sandymount to get a few groceries to bringing us a washcloth. The room we stayed in was a triple - room 216. Very spacious for a European room and a good size bathroom as well.  It was kept very clean each day for us - they brought new towels and everything.  It was quiet and just what we needed after long days of travel and sightseeing.  You can also buy tickets for the hop on hop off bus at the front desk which picks up at the hotel at 8:50 each morning on a seasonal basis.  Breakfast is served in the hotel restaurant for €10 per person.  We loved this hotel and got a great rate for our stay - we will be back on our next visit to Ireland! ",4,2014,04,22
247,A fantastic 2nd visit.,"This was our 2nd stay at the Sandymount Hotel and once again we were not disappointed. Our room was lovely, very clean and it had everything you needed. The breakfast was amazing, lots of choice and it was very fresh. The staff were very helpful and kind throughout our stay.

On our first day we flew into Dublin very early (7am), however our room was ready by the time we arrived. It was very much appreciated especially when we had been up since 2am and we needed a rest! We did eat in the restarant the first evening we were there and the food was fantastic, although a bit pricey but the portions were generous which made up for it.

Once again, you made our stay in Dublin all the more enjoyable and we can't thank you enough.",5,2014,04,20
247,Lovely hotel ,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and we had an excellent time. The bedroom was perfect, the house keeper came everyday to make the beds and change our towels. The breakfast was very good too, eat all you want. The hotel is near a DART train station and the trains go into town very frequently. The staff at the hotel are very friendly. A stay to repeat. ",5,2014,04,19
247,Solid value and location,"I had a really pleasant stay here - the location is brilliant.  It's in a lovely, safe and atmospheric neighbourhood, and just a few minutes from the city centre.  Plenty of great restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood and this place would be ideal if going to the Aviva stadium.  Canal is close by and herbert park for walks, though there is a small amount of construction on the canal itself.  The hotel was just what I needed on the night, good price considering the location and the standard.  Parking was safe and secure too. The room was clean and had all the usual needed, tea/coffee, TV, etc.  Staff were all pleasant and unobtrusive. Handy options for food and drink there too if you didn't want to venture beyond the hotel doors. The main downer was that it did get noisy at one point during the night - i think there was a wedding reception that night - and some guests were loud as they returned to their rooms.  I also got a telephone call from another guest in error and  that woke me too. Overall though I'll definitely be back for a good value and comfortable stay in a really lovely location.",4,2014,04,18
247,Wonderful,My wife and daughter stayed for night. Outstanding service. Fantastic breakfast. 5 min. Walk to rail and 2 stations from the city centre. How a hotel reacts when things go not quite right is a mark of a quality hotel. Highly recommended.,5,2014,04,15
247,Family friendly excellent hotel,"Stayed 3 nights with 4 young kids exploring Dublin. The staff are fantastic, location is very good and the hotel is clean and well presented. I highly recommend this hotel for young families traveling to Dublin.",5,2014,04,15
247,Excellent location,Stayed at this hotel recently Very enjoyable experience friendly staff free WiFi free parking excellent location and free shuttle bus Great bar food and most comfortable room I will definitely stay on my next visit to Dublin,5,2014,04,14
247,Fantastic staff & Hotel,"Myself and my new husband absolutely adore this hotel, we had our Wedding here this week!  A Special thanks to Clare Lawless-Molloy who went above and beyond in helping us plan the wedding, her help on the day and even after, she is a credit to the Sandymount Hotel - as are all their staff who are so friendly and helpful, all our guests commented on them.  A great central location but in a quiet area, period building with a modern feel and lovely rooms. Fantastic food too, I couldn't recommend highly enough for business or pleasure, and of course for the perfect Wedding Day (we had our ceremony and reception here). Thanks again!",5,2014,04,12
247,Home from home,I stay in the Sandymount hotel most weeks and I couldn't recommend it highly enough.  It is the perfect blend of Price and Quality with the added bonus of super friendly staff who go out of their way to ensure that your stay is a really positive experience. ,5,2014,04,10
247,"Very good value for money, caring, helpful staff","Hotel with some interesting character.  Very comfortable, clean, good size room and comfortable bed.  Full marks to the reception desk for taking the time at a busy period to talk us by telephone through the access to the hotel, and staff seemed generally very attentive and committed.  Late dinner in bar, good choice.  Good breakfast in pleasant restaurant.",4,2014,04,08
247,Fantastic We will be back highly recommended,"First thing i noticed when i entered the hotel was a welcoming open fire in the reception area !I recently stayed at the Sandymount hotel for two nights in 227 a family room, the room was bright airy and very spacious the beds were very comfortable excellent facilities ironing board hair dryer,tea and coffee making facilities,large tv and wifi that the 4 of us could log in,  the room was spotlessly clean. The breakfast was superb plenty of options and everything cooked lovely not burnt like some places. The staff were extremely attentive and even drove us in the shuttle bus to the show venu Bord Gais which for me on a crutch was brilliant.  Overall i will be back any chance i get i would like to say a big thankyou to all the staff especially siobhan at reception for making our stay so comfortable and relaxing !! Thankyou all again see you soon",5,2014,04,07
247,Pleasantly surprised,"Pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Stayed for one night, at an excellent price in a huge room, one of the largest I have stayed in too date.  Free parking and wifi were also an extra bonus.
Rooms clean and well heated -  and although we did not eat in the hotel, the dining areas looked well presented with a modern decor.  
Very close to the Aviva - excellent location which will be considered again in the future.
Only negative is that the room phone did not work - however this was no major issue.

Will definitely visit in the future, so long as standards remain.",5,2014,04,07
247,"Good hotel, Good Location recommend!","Went on a night out in Dublin for a friends birthday. Rooms were lovely, clean and very spacious. Food was great in the bar. The hotel let us check in early as we travelled at 9am and check in should have been 3pm. 3 people sharing a room was extremely - £75 per night. 

Only think I would say is some (and I do mean some) of the hotel staff were a bit moody and unhelpful. But apart from that would definitely stay again!",4,2014,04,07
247,Very pleased with stay at the Sandymount Hotel,This hotel is very central for starters and the room was clean and suited my needs. The staff was helpful and friendly but what really stood out for me was the huge amount of parking and the wifi connection both at no extra cost. I have to say I am very impressed with this hotel.,5,2014,04,06
247,Absolutely fab stay ay Sandymount Hotel.,"My husband and I booked and stayed at this wonderful hotel and we were delighted with the welcome we receiced, the ambience, the character of the property and friendlieness of the staff. We had been given a gift voucher for a night at 'the dogs' in Harold's Cross and the receptionest even booked us a taxi. Breakfast in the lovely dining was plentiful, with fresh fruit, breads and first class hot buffet. Thank you to everyone at the Sandymount Hotel for making our stay so enjoyable - we'll be back.",5,2014,04,05
247,Exclusive hotel,I have stayed in many hotels on business in Dublin and was pleasantly surprised with Sandymount hotel. All the staff were friendly and welcoming on arrival and I was quickly assigned a room even though the hotel was busy. Had dinner on the bar terrace overlooking beautiful gardens and the food was excellent. Had a great nights sleep and was delighted to find that the hotel provided a shuttle bus that took me to clonskeagh on business. Sandymount village is a five minute walk away and the city centre is a five minute dart trip. All in all a great stay and this will be my preferred hotel in Dublin ,5,2014,04,04
247,fantastic hotel!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at here for a concert in the O2, we were looking for somewhere cheap and cheerful and never expected to get the quality and standard this hotel provided for the price we paid. I couldn't recommend it enough, the hotel is modern and tasteful and the rooms are warm and comfortable. Everything is kept immaculate and the receptionist who greeted us was welcoming, friendly and very helpful! 
The only thing that I would say is that the bar closed rather early, but it is a quiet hotel and there are plenty of other bars around so its not a big problem.
Absolute gem of a hotel and we will definitely be back!",5,2014,04,03
247,Wonderful hotel with lots of character,"Stayed here for only night lately with my girlfriend as we were going to a concert in the o2. From the minute we arrived we were greeted by warm, friendly staff who were also very helpful, they even organised a coach to the concert which helped as neither of us knew our way around Dublin. The hotel itself was lovely with a nice bar and outside seating area. The rooms were great and more than enough for anyone having an overnight stay. I can't recommend this hotel enough and I can't wait to stay again.",5,2014,04,03
247,"A cheerful, convenient and clean hotel and great value.",This is our first time to stay at this hotel and We are extremely pleased with it. It has all the qualities a good hotel should have and the staff are always cheerful and helpful. We stayed an extra day and will come back again. ,5,2014,04,02
247,All round great hotel!,"Just needed a cheap hotel for 1 night so booked here. £51 for 3ppl sharing. After I booked it I looked it up online and was surprised at how nice it looked. Upon arrival I was even more surprised at its appearance, really lovely! The staff couldn't have been nicer and the food was beautiful. All round great experience and I will definitely be back.",5,2014,03,31
247,Another enjoyable stay,"​I've just returned from an overnight stay at the Sandymount Hotel. I've stayed there on a number of occasions - on my own, as a couple and now with my family in a family room.
Firstly, the free parking is a great bonus - the carpark is at the rear of the hotel so you have peace of mind that the car should be safe.  We went to a rugby match in the Aviva so the location was perfect. Its near enough the dart, to have a quick trip into city for some shopping. The atmosphere around the hotel, before and after the match was brilliant.  They had set up marquees outside where they had an extra bar - and where they were roasting a pig.
The staff in the hotel are really welcoming and friendly. They are never too busy to say hello and give attention when required. ​
​
​ The family room had a double bed and 2 singles with plenty of room to move around - my children are 13 and 7 so can be quite boisterous but we felt the room was plenty spacious for what we needed. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone. ​",5,2014,03,31
247,Would not stay here again,"I don't usually write reviews as I am normally happy with the hotels that I choose to stay in and generally cannot add anything that has not been already stated by previous reviewers. However, on this occasion, I feel that I must comment on the Sandymount Hotel.

We stayed here for one night on Friday 28th Feb in an executive double room.

Positives:
The room was spotlessly clean.

The bar food was tasty and was well priced.

The bar staff were friendly and efficient.

Negatives:
Check-in (on Fri night) and check-out (on Sat morning) were both completed by the same female receptionist. I did not get her name but she had shoulder length fair hair and wore glasses. She was uncommunicative to the point of being rude. We were not asked if we had enjoyed our stay or if everything had been satisfactory. She did not utter a word at check-out other than telling us the balance  that we owed. Bear in mind that this was not preceded by any type of complaint from us - I dread to think what her response would have been in that case. 

The room, although it was an executive room, was tiny. We barely had room to move around even though we had only one overnight bag each. I do understand that the building is old and obviously they have to work with what they have.

I had work to do in the room on Friday night and found it quite cold while sitting at the desk. The radiator was fully on but the heat just disappeared up behind the floor length curtains. 

Neither of us slept well as a lot of noise could be heard from adjoining rooms and from the corridor.

While going for breakfast, I was taken aback to see that the housekeeper had clean bedding laid out on the floor of the hallway for each room that we passed. I don't leave clean bedclothes on the floor of my own house let alone on a hotel floor where God knows how many people have walked. 

All of the negative comments mentioned above probably would not have annoyed us as much if we had been dealt with in a more friendly way and we left the hotel with a bad impression.",2,2014,03,30
247,Large party visit,I recently visited Dublin with a party of 80 people and we stayed in the Sandymount Hotel. Excellent communications and organisation made for a very pleasant stay. Meals were served on time as planned and were of a good standard. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Friendly staff and excellent service.,4,2014,03,27
247,Home from Home when on Business,"I stay at the Sandymount Hotel every other week as my work takes me to Dublin frequently. The hotel is in the south city in a quiet leafy suburb about 15 minutes drive from city centre.   Car parking is plentiful, safe and best of all free. The DART station is close by also and it is adjacent to the Aviva stadium.   The staff are always welcoming and helpful.  From time to time there have been very kind personal touches when checking in very late they have sometimes upgraded me to an executive room with extra ""creature"" comforts which is a thoughtful way of acknowledging frequent stays. The rooms are comfortable and the breakfast is very good. There are also dining facilities available and the meals are always tasty. Free daily newspapers are available at the Reception.  I would recommend this hotel to any business travelers.",4,2014,03,26
247,Best yet,"Lovely hotel! close to dart five minutes from city, Great for getting to the O2 we were here to see the wanted loved it! Reception staff very helpful breakfast was yummy room was bright and very clean.
can't wait for our next stay bringing mum back to see dirty dancing in the grand canal in September can't wait",5,2014,03,26
247,Sandymount Never Disappoints,"I have stayed in the Sandymount Hotel on several occasions in the past.  I love everything about this family-run hotel - the great location (beside DART station), the friendly staff, value for money, great service.  I'll be back!!",5,2014,03,26
247,Tettible customer service,"I am writting this review because i sent a complaint 2 weeks ago and i havent hear anything from your hotel.
I supposed to stay at your hotel .
I made a booking with Expedia and when i called to the hotel they did not have my reservation.
I was dealing with Siobhan who was the most unhepfull person i ever dealed in my life.
She told me that i didnt have a reservation when Expedia confirmed that.
As i result of it , I dedided to stay in another hotel.
I will never come back to this place.",1,2014,03,24
247,Really lovely hotel!,"Stayed here when attending a concert in the 02! Not a great choice as it is a bit of a journey but thats nothing to do with the hotel! Free car parking is a major plus here when travelling a long distance. The staff are very pleasant and the hotel is well keep and very clean. Rooms are basic but all you need for a short stay. Only problem was the lack of hot water, had to run the tap for about 20 minutes just to get hot water to get a shower but if not in a rush this isnt a problem. Also had staff at the door twice in the morning as early as half 8!! which is not expected in a one night stay but nothing to put you of the hotel, Very reasonably priced would definitely stay again",4,2014,03,19
247,Attending Concert at 02,"Booked my room through an online booking company and realised I had booked for wrong date as soon as I got confirmation. Working in the hospitality trade myself I know it can be difficult to adjust the date and room rate through a third party booking company, but the booking company phoned the hotel for me and happily changed my date and room rate to when I needed to stay free of charge, Was very grateful.
The hotel is situated in an ideal location for the Aviva, Lansdowne road and the 02. 
Staff in the hotel are very friendly an helpful and wouldn't pass by without saying hello. Bar an terrace are great and staying for bar lunch now.
Room was good although some of windows didn't open. Housekeepers knock the door and come in at 11 to clean room when we hadn't checked out, wasn't a big problem but found it odd that they don't wait until after check out time or have communications with reception to know who had already checked out. 
But all in all a lovely hotel and good stay, will definitely use here again when needing to stay over in Dublin.",4,2014,03,19
247,Actual hotel alright but some issues..........,"The actual hotel itself is ok, we got a good deal so was not expecting anything fancy. Check in was quick and not very informative, we weren't told breakfast or dinner times, we weren't told how to access WiFi and directions to our room were a bit vague! When we arrived to our room it was still being cleaned and the cleaner asked us to wait 10 mins while she hoovered.....so back to reception and we were given another room after a short wait. We had breakfast one morning but it was a bit chaotic, lots of staff and no one really knew what was going on! Everything else ok, the WiFi was a bit slow but night porters very friendly.......only other issue, after returning from breakfast, we were going to check out after picking up our bags and as we were walking up to our room the housekeeper knocked and entered our room. When I informed her that we were leaving in 10 minutes she asked if she could clean the room now, and was not happy when i asked her to wait 10 minutes until we've gone....I don't understand why a housekeeper would be entering our room before check out time and when we clearly had not checked out yet. Anyway.............it was alright but probably won't be back.",3,2014,03,15
247,Highly Recommended,"I would happily recommend the Sandymount hotel. I have stayed here many times and return due to the excellent customer service, comfortable and spacious accomodation, food and location.  Free parking is also an added bonus.",5,2014,03,13
247,Good,"The stay here was very much quit relaxing, I enjoyed my stay as I had a lovely dinner and lunch the soup here I lovely along with the breakfast very filling and the waiters and receptionist are very kind and nice",4,2014,03,12
247,Love Love Love,"I've stayed here three times and will be staying here again at the end of march! 
The Hotel is situated 2mins walk away from the AVIVA Stadium and Lansdown Rd Station. 
The Service here is top standard!i have never had any problems whilst staying here. 
Staff are lovely and friendly and very approachable for any matter.
They have a shuttle bus service that will bring you to the 02 Arena in North Wall Quay at €4 Per Person. 
Overall lovely place and surrounding areas are too.
I will only stay here on my trips to Dublin and will continue to do so for many years to come.",5,2014,03,11
247,Highly Recommended,Very charming hotel in a great location. I would recommend the Sandymount. The service was great. I was late to get to the O2 for a concert and the taxi was taking too long to arrive so i was offered to be taken there by a member of staff free of  charge. The room was spacoius and the comfortable. I will definately be returning on my next trip to Dublin.,5,2014,03,11
247,Meeting a friend,"Exceeded expectations. Warm friendly greeting from the receptionist Siobhan who gave us helpful maps of Dublin, and the local area. It was our first time in Dublin and Siobhan gave us lots of hints and advice on making the most of sightseeing attractions. Room was immaculate with lots of complimentary goodies including a bottle of wine. Perfect meal in bar area at the end of a busy day. Staff all so attentive and personable; nothing was too much trouble. We will be making a return visit. Thank you all so much. Barbara and Ted",5,2014,03,11
247,"Always a good experience,",We always stay in the Sandymount. It is a lovely hotel. Staff at reception always attentive and helpful. Rooms pleasant and comfortable and quiet.  The beds are perfect. TV and wifi very handy Parking always available. We got a very nice offer on this visit. B&B and evening meal. It was beautiful. Service in restaurant is excellent. Mr Loughran(owner) spoke to us whilest we were in the bar. It is a very personal kind of hotel. As usual we enjoyed our stay and will be back again.,5,2014,03,06
247,Highly recommended,"I stay at the Sandymount Hotel whenever I am in Dublin. It's very conveniently located and has great facilities, but the same can be said for other hotels. What can't be said for other hotels is the  the atmosphere and the welcome you get at the Sandymount. Prices are very competitive, the rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable, the bar menu is varied and good value, WiFi is free and it works everywhere. But most of all, the staff are so friendly, welcoming, and helpful. I would recommend it to anyone without hesitation.",5,2014,03,04
247,Charming,"Ideal location for  city break, excellent staff and very relaxing atmosphere.   Good value for money. Had bar food Sunday evening late when our might be anticipated that standards could drop but coups and service were both exemplary. Check in is very efficient and friendly with plenty of information provided in a warm and genuinely friendly manner. ",4,2014,02,25
247,Excellent,"I have stayed here regularly over the last 6 months.  The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly.  All the elements work well, the bar, restaurant (they have specials each night) and room service.  The free internet in the rooms is a big plus.",5,2014,02,24
247,My best dublin hotel,"Used to live in Dublin but now visit regularly for business and always stay at the Sandymount - its personal, friendly, free parking and is a great business venue to meet colleagues. No other hotel compares for service and comfort at this price range.",5,2014,02,24
247,Sandymount hotel,"Very very good, lovely food, staff couldn't be more helpful all very nice, rooms./bar/restaurant are to a very good standard. We also saw the owner while on our stay here, he spoke to many of the guests. Hope you enjoy your stay as much as us.",5,2014,02,20
247,Rude Young Receptionist,"Met by an extremely rude young receptionist at 5.45pm on Saturday 15th Feb 2014 who did not make us welcome but merely snapped ""Surname"". Room was small. Carpet was dirty. WiFi was OK. Breakfast was OK. Location is quiet.",2,2014,02,20
247,Great Hotel,"I stayed at the Sandymount on different occasions from October to January and I must say the staff have been excellent on each occasion, a special mention for Beatrice who is always very pleasant, courteous, friendly and professional. Rooms are always very clean and  the breakfast very tasty.
Situated next door to Ballsbridge and only a 25 minute walk to the City Centre I would recommend the Sandymount to anyone whether it be a business or pleasure stay.",5,2014,02,16
247,Excellent,"A party of us stayed a the Sandymount hotel for the Ireland v Wales Six Nations match.  The rooms, service and staff were excellent.  John should be very proud of the atmosphere he manages to create, with his staff, during a hectic period.  Would recommend the hotel to anyone.

Thank you.",5,2014,02,14
247,best staff ever,"stayed here for weekend, the location is super 1 min from stadium, spotlessly clean rooms, great food,  all during the stay we felt special, but reception is what makes this hotel shine, all the girls especially stephanie and Beatrice make you feel so welcome, we had great fun with them, will definately be back",4,2014,02,14
247,Brilliant hotel for the corporate traveller!,"I stay at the Sandymount three nights a week while working in Dublin. What a friendly warm welcome from Bea and Steph and all their colleagues on reception. Help with Ryan air online check in,   not a problem. Fruit on the run if you have an early start, sure. A chat about the delicious soda bread or the juicy oranges at breakfast. Not a problem. A real home from home.  Fiona",5,2014,02,13
247,Perfect for the Aviva,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights on 1st February and attended the 6 Nations Ireland match. Location was perfect for the aviva stadium which is literally on your doorstep, there is a small village within walking distance (about 10mins) for shops, off licence and a few bars and the stop for the dart is right around the corner a couple of minutes walk. Couldnt have been closer to everything we needed and the area was well to do and quiet, felt safe walking to the village at night.
Rooms themselves were modern and clean, not the most spacious but this wasn't an issue for the 2 of us. Tea and coffee making facilities and tv, comfy beds!
We were in a room down the corridor from reception, a higher room would have had a lovely view of the gardens!
Great atmosphere for match day, there were outdoor tents in the hotel garden serving beer and chippy vans just outside. The bar inside is nice with modern decor and plenty of sofas to sit on. We ate in the bar before heading home and the thing that stood out the most was the friendliness of the staff. Very chatty, recommended and made me a great cocktail even though there was no cocktail menu. Food was good old pub grub, we didn't eat in the restaurant however during our stay.
Another nice touch was the owner himself coming around and meeting the patrons in the bar. We actually talked about Tripadvisor and I promised this review as I think it is important to support local this family run hotel!
Overall I would return, it was actually quite nice to be out of the way of the hustle and bustle of Dublin city centre and if you are going to the Aviva you wont get better.",4,2014,02,12
247,One of Dublin's finest!,"This hotel is a special treat. It is dublin at it's finest. Great warmth and welcome is evident the moment you walk in the door from great staff, particularly from all staff in reception headed up by Beatrice and Stephanie. The hotel's georgian character is something really different which is not replicated in too many other dublin hotels. Food is excellent also . Rooms are perfect. Great location in a very nice part of dublin and only a 20 min walk to city centre. You won't be disappointed! Highly recommended.",5,2014,02,12
247,Excellent hotel option in south Dublin,"A great hotel in a great location - especially if you are a rugby fan or attending an event in the Aviva Stadium
Staff were very friendly and accommodating, the rooms were cosy and the breakfast was good
Nice bar and restaurant menu too
Relaxed atmosphere, good location and almost a boutique feel
Highly recommended",5,2014,02,11
247,excellent hotel with fabulous staff,"After a stressful day out in Dublin with my two young children, i was dreading trying to settle my children in a hotel room. I should not have worried. From the moment i arrived, the very friendly and helpful reception manager, Beatrice, must of sensed my stress and helped me and the kids to the family room. The rooms are spacious and modern and very suitable for families. As i couldnt leave the room with two very tired children, room service was delivered by the very nice Beatrice!! God send, the rooms were so nice and warm that the kids had no trouble getting to sleep. In the morning we had breakfast and all the staff were very nice and friendly. Food was plentiful and delicious. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as its so personal and friendly, great atmosphere, delicious food and just general greatness!!! Looking forward to getting away again.",5,2014,02,11
247,An Excellent Night,"I visited this hotel with my wife and two kids recently and the whole stay was fantastic. It was very busy due to a match taking place in the Aviva but we were dealt with straight away at the reception desk. The receptionist, Beatrice, seen to us as a priority as we had a young child and quickly checked us in before showing us to our room. The atmosphere was great in the hotel with all the match goers. We ordered room service and the food was delicious. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, we will definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone planning a trip to Dublin.",5,2014,02,11
247,Love this place,I regularly have lunch here and I am never disappointed!  The staff are helpful and very pleasant and the service is great.  It is an oasis of calm when you have spent your day sitting in Dublin traffic.  Lots of free parking here also.  Food choice is great and  very tasty...keep up the good work Sandymount Hotel!,5,2014,02,06
247,Always excellent,"I visit Dublin a lot for business and the Sandymount Hotel is like my second home. I always get a great welcome and find the hotel very comfortable. 

Food is also good (deserts especially). 

I will continue to be a regular customer and can highly recommend the hotel and it's staff. 

",5,2014,02,06
247,Excellent Hotel in great location,"Stay regularly in this super hotel which is in a very good location, is extremely comfortable and very clean. Staff are very friendly and helpful - you will notice the difference from some of larger hotels as Sandymount is much more personal. Free parking and food is of a high standard. Overall an excellent hotel.",5,2014,02,04
247,Friendly hotel,I have stayed in the hotel many times and each time I have been met by friendly staff especially Beatrice who goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and is extremely helpful and knowledgable about the area and city. The rooms are comfortable and stylish. Location is good as you can miss out driving through the city to get and then walk or use dart to get to the city. I will definitely be staying here again,5,2014,01,31
247,More wonderful Sandymount hospitality.,"My wife and I have recently spent yet another enjoyably relaxing week-end at the Sandymount.We have been regulars at the hotel for more than 20 years and in all that time have been treated with consummate courtesy,kindness and in a manner which makes you feel  that you are indeed sincerely  and genuinely welcome.The entire staff exuded a willingness to be of service at all times during our stay and no request is  ever perceived as unreasonable.we always look forward to our trips to Dublin and would never consider staying elsewhere.Beatrice and the staff know how to make us feel at home and who can ask for more than that!Keep up the good work.",5,2014,01,30
247,Charming staff,"I am a regular guest at the Sandymount Hotel.  It is a very charming hotel in a beautiful, quiet location beside the Aviva stadium (& Dart station) and within strolling distance of Sandymount village and Ballsbridge.  The hotel is very clean and comfortable with free parking but it's best asset are the staff who are exceptionally warm, friendly and welcoming.  Highly recommended!",5,2014,01,28
247,Perfect,Great place to stay for a nice and quiet trip. I was traveling alone and felt safe walking to and from Dart (which was a 2min walk). Also very close to lots of great restaurants and pubs. The hotel staff was knowledgable and very helpful. I will stay here on my next trip to Ireland.,5,2014,01,27
247,Very friendly staff and a great location,"The Sandymount Hotel staff were incredibly helpful to us during our stay - facilitating an early check-in, advising about travel to the airport & help regarding future bookings. The hotel layout is slightly quirky as there are many buildings connected together and, being older, there is a certain amount of noise along and between floors - this only bothered us a little on our first night before we became used to it. The location within walking distance of Sandymount and Donnybrook was brilliant in terms of dinner options",4,2014,01,25
247,Glad to be back,"Just returned after being away for a while and delighted to see some rooms recently done up and much improved free internet connection provided. Reception staff - Beatrice, Steph, and all the others are so welcoming and helpful. Keep up the good work. ",5,2014,01,23
247,A very enjoyable stay at this family friendly hotel,"I stayed at the Sandymount Hotel with my husband and young daughter on Friday 17 January.  The Reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  Our room was perfect for us with tea and coffee making facilities and very comfortable beds.  We went into the bar for a meal, which was so delicious and the portions were large, which pleased my husband! The waitress who looked after us was so friendly and helpful.  We were going to a wedding Saturday and it was raining heavily and, without us requesting it, one of the receptionists gave us a large golf brolly.  That brolly saved us from getting soaked!  That was so kind and thoughtful - it's these little touches that makes a stay special and makes the Sandymount Hotel stand out for us.  Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness.  Would love chance to stay here again when back in Ireland.

We would be very happy when next in Ireland, to stay again in this lovely, friendly hotel where   staff care about their guests.",5,2014,01,22
247,Excellent Value,"This family run hotel offers excellent value in the lovely area of Dublin 4. Particularly well situated for the Aviva stadium and RDS it is also close to the DART making it a serious choice for central Dublin.

We were two couples and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rooms are clean and the breakfast very good. The staff are pleasant and exceptionally helpful. The only downside is a fairly small TV.

I can thoroughly recommend this hotel.

I have attached some photographs.",4,2014,01,21
247,Friendly Family Run Hotel,"Just returned from a lovely overnight stay at the Sandymount Hotel. Check-in was smooth and the staff were so friendly, nothing was too much trouble. After check-in my sister who had come to meet us for lunch decided she would also like to stay. We were switched from a triple to quadruple room without any difficulty and this was quite spacious easily accommodating 3 adults & 1 teenager. The bathroom was a little dated but more than adequate with plenty of hot water & all toiletries provided. There was an iron & ironing board, safe and a foldaway room service table in the room. The hotel was a little way out from the City Centre but easily reached by DART and the station is a few minutes walk from away. We had a peaceful night's sleep on the firm beds. Good selection for both cooked & continental breakfast which we paid for separately although the only egg option was fried. Lunch was also very tasty even if the selection a little limited - bagels/wraps, omelette, burgers, fish & chips but having said that the options for bagels/wraps was impressive. Think gourmet fillings. The staff were also very knowledgeable about things to do in Dublin. Overall we were impressed with the Sandymount and would definitely return.",5,2014,01,20
247,Young Scientist,"Teachers and students from our school (Kinsale Community School) stayed in the Sandymount hotel for the Young Scientist competition. We had a very enjoyable stay in the hotel. The staff were ever friendly, good food that was student friendly priced. I would 100% recommended this hotel to schools that are attending the Young Scientist competition and we will definitely be going back in Jan 2015. S. Holly",4,2014,01,20
247,Great Value Hotel,"Stayed in the Sandymount Hotel for two nights this week.  Excellent hotel, staff very nice and friendly, breakfast and dinner great.  Room and bed very comfortable.  Very quite location. Great value and I would highly recommend.",5,2014,01,17
247,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL,"We were extremely happy with our stay at Sandymount. We were there for New Years and it was probably one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. Friendly greeted upon arrival, even though we only booked a double room, we were given a triple which just meant more space and was really handy. Room service was brilliant, really decent food. Hotel in itself was gorgeous. Reception were incredibly helpful. Little bit out of city centre, 30 minute walk or 10 minutes on the train, but we didn't struggle with this at all, really happy with our stay!",5,2014,01,16
247,Very comfortable stay,We stayed here for 2 nights in December  when our daughter was returning home from Melbourne  for Christmas. As usual the staff were very friendly and accommodating. We had 2 rooms and in one of the rooms there was a difficulty with the water but we were instantly moved to another room. We had a little difficulty getting the temperature right - it was too warm. The food in the bar was very tasty and the staff very helpful and good humoured.,4,2014,01,08
247,Brilliant family hotel,"We stayed one night at this hotel and enjoyed our stay so much.For families with active kids who love walking, this is a great hotel as you can stroll into the city centre and you're near a lovely playground in Herbert Park, as well as Sandymount Strand and the Green. The room was spacious, warm and comfy and the brekkie was great! We have stayed here on numerous occasions and at this stage wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else when in Dublin. The staff are so friendly and courteous too.All in all, we're looking forward to our next trip already!!",5,2014,01,07
247,Cold room and complicated WIFI access,We stayed 3 nights in the Sandymount Hotel at the end of December. Our room was spacious and clean. Decoration was dull but the greatest problem was the temperature. There was 1 small radiator in it. We left it turned on all the time but it failed miserably to heat the room. Worse still was the bathroom. There was a constant draught coming through the window. Access to WIFI was unnecessarily complicated. We would not stay here again.,2,2014,01,03
247,Great Hotel!,"We were recommended this hotel by a friend and weren't disappointed when we spent a 3 night stay at the end of November. We were made so welcome. The room was very clean and comfortable, all the staff were so pleasant and helpful, and the food was grand. Easy to get to from the Port of Dublin, and excellent access to the city centre via the nearby DART or bus service. We enjoyed our stay so much we are hoping to return in the spring for a longer visit.",5,2014,01,01
247,Hidden Gem!,"We stayed at the Sandymount between Christmas and New Year and can not speak highly enough of the hotel. Clean, friendly and excellent value for money. 
Rooms are well fitted and large (In our room we had a double bed, single bed and cot and still had room for the pushchair and room for our 2 year old to play!) 
Service at the hotel is excellent on all fronts from reception through to house keeping. 
We enjoyed two meals within the hotel bar and both times were left more than satisfied, again service within the bar is prompt and polite and the prices match or even better the local bars. 
Overall an excellent stay and when in Dublin again will definitely be staying at this hotel. ",5,2013,12,31
247,"Nice hotel,easy to get to the city centre","We've spent 2 nights in this hotel,it has nice & clean rooms & bathroom&Very comfortable beds,(however,we stayed in the basement & we could hear people banging doors & walking on the corridor,but it wasnt that loud)
The staff is helpful & polite.It is in a really good location as the train station is for 5 min walk,and its in the citycentre in another 5 min.They serve full Irish breafast,joghurt, croissant,the only thing I was missing was ham,cheese,fresh tomatoes&cucumber.You can have filtered coffee & tea,and some juices as well.If you are looking for a quiet hotel to relax,but you want to get quickly to the city centre thats a good place to stay @.",4,2013,12,20
247,Home from home,"I have been staying in Dublin on average 3 nights a week for the past two years as part of my job. In all my two years of staying at the Sandymount, I have always been treated as if I was their best customer, paying the highest rate in the hotel and of the utmost importance. The girls on reception are extremely friendly, recall my name when I come in and always give me the best room available on the night. I have cancelled late, arrived late, left early, gone out at night to do a night shift and never an issue, never a problem. Equally the staff on the breakfast bar are friendly and remember my order and are lovely.  The bar is comfortable and it is quite easy to sit in there to watch a match without anybody thinking it strange to be alone. It is like a sitting room.  
The rooms are spacious, always clean towels, beds are good firm beds, TVs and whatever you need.  If you need anything, just ask and it is supplied. It has made being away from home easier when you know that you are staying in a hotel where they care.",5,2013,12,19
247,well worth a stay,"We stayed here on a 3 night B&B + dinner and it was great, - great hotel, great atmosphere and great value.
Food here is top class and the staff were genuinly friendly.
Good location, aviva a 1 min walk, close to the dart and about 20 mins walk to baggott st and 30 mins to grafton st.
only area to improve on in my opinion was the water supply to the en suite. It seemed the cold supply was on a pump that seemed cyclic in pressure, so when you went under the shower, alternating hot and cold water arrived which tested your timing ability.
hotel was lovely overall though. well worth staying.  rugby match was on the weekend we were there and the hotel seemed to have everything organised so that there was very little interference with the guests and yet you could be part of the atmosphere  if you wished. so overeall 8/10",4,2013,12,17
247,Great as usual.,Stayed here last week in November. As usual it was great. They are even in the planning installing an electric charging point for cars soon. Will continue to stay here with this new addition. very close to the Dart or train station which takes you into city in 5 mins,5,2013,12,14
247,Fab hotel :),"We stayed here last night and I just hadrons write a review.. This hotel is a Hidden Gem :) just lovely it's in a fantastic location about a 20 minute walk into town along the lovely river dodder (...I hope spelt right ...) 
The staff at the hotel were so friendly from the check in the girl was so friendly :) 
The Food was amazing 5 Stars the whole way thank you sandymount hotel :))) we will so so be back ",5,2013,12,11
247,Fabulous 2 nights stay,"We arrived at the Sandymount Hotel at 10.30am on a Friday morning thinking that we would just have to put our bags behind the reception to wait for the usual 2pm-3pm check in and the very friendly receptionist said that our room was ready!!! A big massive gold star for them already. The room was spotlessly clean with a double and a single bed, coffee making facilities, TV, bath and great shower with loads of hot water.
We ate in the restaurant on our second night and the meal was beautiful and the staff were excellent.
The beds were very comfortable with more than enough sheets, covers etc.
I will be definitely staying at this lovely friendly hotel again as it was very good value for money and was no more than 10 mins walk to Landsdowne Road, RDS, Aviva Stadium. I would give them 4 stars",5,2013,12,09
247,Great service and great Location,"Service not only with a smile but with real eagerness to help! This goes for both the reception and restaurant staff. 
The reception staff genuinely could not do enough for us. 
The location is within 20 minutes walking to the city centre and that's your exercise for the day.
Lots of transport links nearby.
The hotel is also a stones throw from Sandymount village or Ballsbridge with lots of shops, pubs (recommend O'Reillys in Sandymount or Crowes in Ballsbridge) and restaurants. 
Definitely will stay again.",5,2013,12,09
247,Excellent Service,"I stayed in this hotel recently & could not recommend it highly enough. Very central to all amenitites. Hotel is lovely, the rooms are spotless & comfortable. But the best thing about the Hotel in my opinion is the staff, it is a very busy spot but nothing was a problem, they were so friendly & helpful. Always greeted warmly. Special mention for Beatrice, Diarmuid & Remus - friendliest staff that I have come across in the Hotel industry in quite some time.",5,2013,12,09
247,The Only Place to stay in Dublin.,"Myself and partner just back from third stay at Sandymount. Free and safe Parking real Bonus. Perfect Location for O2 and theatres which have been our reason for visit each time. Ten minutes drive out of Port Tunnel. Super Welcome in Reception, even though we arrived early room ready for us. We had treated ourselves to a Junior Suite this visit and well worth it; beautiful room and the comfiest enormous bed. Had a quick lunch on arrival and a lovely evening meal; Both very Comprehensive menus; possibly one of the best Seafood Chowders Ive had and Ive had alot and at Dinner the Kangaroo Tornedos was exceptional washed down with an excellent Australian Shiraz at a price that wasnt a rip off as so many hotels are! Breakfast in bed excellent delivered at the exact time specified. The staff in all departments were an absolute delight. I would recommend Sandymount to anyone visiting Dublin. I hope our next visit is not too far away.",5,2013,12,09
247,Lovely hotel with great staff,"My mum, sister and I stayed in this lovely hotel when we came to Dublin Christmas shopping ! We were tired after a long day and the hotel was lovely to relax in. The staff were very welcoming and the restaurant was lovely - we just wanted sandwiches which weren't on the evening menu and there was no problem ! ",5,2013,12,03
247,Excellent stay,"Have stayed here on a number of occasions while on business in Dublin. The staff continue to be warm and welcoming, the rooms never disappoint and the food in the bar is always of the highest standard. As always, Siobhan at reception, meets us with a smile and makes us feel right at home!",5,2013,12,02
247,NICE STAY!,We only stayed one night in this hotel on our travels back from the South. The hotel appears to have been extended over the years and we had quite a walk through the corridors to our room (224) but the place was clean and tidy and the staff were all lovely and were really helpful with directions and advice. My client booked the hotel so I cant complain about its location as it was handy for their offices but you are a cab or a DART ride from the city centre. That having been said the DART station is only a five minute walk away.,4,2013,12,02
247,Pleasantly surprised,"Stayed here the night before the Ireland -v- All Blacks Rugby Match. We were pleasantly surprised. We haven't been in this hotel in many years and has changed for the better. Stephanie, in reception, had a great welcome for us. I thought our room (234) would be noisy as it faced the front of the hotel and was on a busy corridor, but it wasn't. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. Although the room wasn't 5 star standard, it was clean and comfortable with all the essentials and plenty of hot water in the bathroom. The bar is lovely and the food superb, the pizza was delicious! There was a good variety of well cooked food for the buffet breakfast and plenty of everything. The best thing about this hotel is its staff - they were friendly and helpful and made us feel as if we were more than just a number on a busy weekend. Of course, the price was good too. The hotel is convenient for town as well as for the Aviva, RDS, Bord Gais Energy Theatre and the O2.  I will certainly stay here again and recommend it to my friends.",5,2013,11,26
247,My favourite Hotel in Dublin,"Once again, back to my old favourite hotel in Dublin. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough and it's all about the staff interaction, customer service and the ' homely feel'. We had a beautiful meal in warm comfortable surrounds and once again Beatrice ( and she never forgets our names ) was on reception to greet us with a lovely warm welcome and smile.",5,2013,11,25
247,Absolutely recommendable cosy place to stay,"Thanks to the warm and friendly staff and the welcoming and cosy look of Sandymount Hotel I was lucky to experience a pleasant 2-day-stay in Dublin. The place is great and the food served at its restaurant is tremendously delicious. In a nutshell, the Sandymount Hotel is a perfect choice for your trip to Dublin.",5,2013,11,21
247,Best spot,"A pleasant surprise to find this Hotel on the city edge with everything you need and at a very reasonable price considering free parking included.
Reception staff were amazing and even phoned once settled into the room to make sure everything was to your liking. I believe it is family run, and I think this is why you got extra personalised treatment to ensure a happy stay.  If you need a Hotel for  Aviva Stadium events you are right there.
Dublin city is walkable or just two train stops away.  Best value Hotel on our trip.",5,2013,11,21
247,Céad Míle Fáilte,"A short stroll to the banks of the Dodder River and the little village of Sandymount, the enormous Aviva Stadium, the RDS, the O2 concert venue, and the DART, this hotel is a great find in terms of location and high quality of service. I so appreciated the relaxed and very professional greeting at reception (what a refreshing change to be warmly greeting by native Irish at the front desk) and the spacious and comfy room. Not opulent or luxurious but certainly comfortable with adequate cupboard space, tea and coffee making facilities, comfortable bed. My room had a bath which was wonderful. The hotel has a homely feel enhanced by a wood fire in the reception room. My request for a double adaptor was met with a gracious smile and one was provided for me to use in my room. Another thoughtful touch is the airport shuttle and there is an airport coach to the airport. Praise to the management and staff on a high standard of service and a sense that you genuinely care. Here I received a warm Irish welcome!",5,2013,11,19
247,A lovely weekend,"We stayed Friday & Saturday night and we had a great time. We had an executive room which was loevely and clean. It was very spacious and the furnishings modern. The only disappointment was the size of the bed. It was a small double bed and I would have expected a kingsize in an executive room. There was no noise from the outside so it was lovely and quiet.
The food was really nice, Breakfast is nicely presented with hot food, cereals, fruit etc. The service in the restaurant is very good and the staff are really friendly.
Reception is very helpful and they will give you a map and help you get around the city. The Dart train is literally 5 minutes walk away with regular trains into the city and elsewhere. They are very regular on a saturday but there is often 30 mintes wait on a Sunday.
A walk in the other direction takes you to Sandymount village where there are a couple of restaurants and some pubs.
On the nights we stayed, there were matches at the stadium which is right next door. The bar was manic but the atmosphere was great so even if you are not there for the football or rugby (as we weren't) it doesn't effect the quality of your stay.
We had a great time and can't wait to go back",4,2013,11,18
247,Great place to stay in Dublin,"We stayed for two nights in this hotel. The staff was very friendly, always ready to give you a hand with anything.
The room was clean and spacious, we booked a double room and they gave us a triple one. The bed was firm and comfortable, and there was no noise coming from the outside nor the inside of the hotel thus, a good night sleep.
The hotel is located in a suburb of Dublin, right next to the AVIVA Stadium, but the DART station is 5 minutes away, and there are several bus lines within walking distance that take you to the city centre. However, public transport is one of Dublin's weaknesses, so you may want to check the schedules before leaving the hotel.
Overall, a nice hotel in Dublin, I would stay there again.",5,2013,11,14
247,Really friendly staff,"We had a lovely stay at this hotel. We arrived 6 hours early for check in but the staff were extremely helpful and more than happy to find us a room so we were able to check in at 9am. The restaurant staff were happy to allow us to stay for breakfast even though we had arrived after the 10.30 finishing time and the manager also came over to greet us. The hotel is a very short walk to the nearest Dart station making getting around very easy. The room was clean and spacious. The only problem was that our room seemed to be situated under a communal area and we could hear loud footsteps late at night and from around 6am above us. However, the staff were so accommodating that I'm sure if we had asked to be moved they would have been happy to do this. Would happily return.",4,2013,11,13
247,Simply the Best in Dublin,"We visited this hotel for a mid-week break very recently. As a regular visitor to Dublin we decided on our last trip to change hotels because we felt that our usual hotel was falling very short of the mark indeed so we decided to trip down the road to the Sandymount Hotel which is very close to the Aviva Stadium. On arrival we were greeted by the lovely Beatrice at reception who made us feel very welcome indeed and set to work making sure that all our needs were catered for. Our room was second to none, no expense spared, very comfortable indeed and great attention to detail. The food was scrumptious (I highly recommend the brie and the luxurious seafood chowder) main courses were all equally lovely and tasty, well cooked and nicely presented by probably the best trained restaurant staff I have ever seen. I think this is one aspect (of many) that sets the Sandmount hotel apart from other Dublin hotels; the staff make you feel so special without crowding you out. The bar staff only needed to be given the initial drinks order because they remembered after that so one could stand by the counter and they would ask politely ""same again""? this is the true mark of a good barman/woman and apart from our local in Kerry we have only ever seen it in the Sandymount Hotel. I noticed during the time we spent there that the hotel is always busy the restaurant and bar was almost always full with a mixture of business people, passing trade and holiday makers both foreign and Irish and I am not surprised. The staff, however, were more than able to cater for everybody in a professional yet discreet manner and the atmosphere was quiet and calm and comfortable. Sandymount hotel is a healthy walk to Sandymount village which had enough lovely shops to satisfy my insatiable appetite for browsing and also a pharmacy, and at least 2 supermarkets. Further on there is a lovely beach front where we took a walk every day if for no other reason except to justify yet another night of fine dining back in the comfort of our hotel.  I could write another couple of paragraphs about this hotel but instead I will recommend to anybody who intends visiting Dublin to give it a try and if you feel like splashing out a little more (not a lot)! treat yourself to a junior suite which is where we stayed however a peek into a double room confirmed to me that the standard was equally good there. Will we be back? most certainly ! and we are both looking forward to meeting all the staff again especially the lovely Beatrice who we would like to thank most sincerely for the attention and for the assistance as we chose a gift from the jewellery stand for a very special occasion!!.",5,2013,11,12
247,Hotel let down by reception experience,"I’ve stayed at the Sandymount a number of times over the past few years, however I’m regularly disappointed and frustrated by the check-in experience which I’ve received. 

Overall I do like the Sandymount as a hotel, it is in a good location, the food is generally good and the bar/restaurant staff are very helpful & friendly, however the hotel is currently let down by its reception experience. On my last three stays I’ve had to return to reception each time after check-in, due to issues with the initially allocated room.  

On my latest stay, it took me three trips to and from reception (this can be quite a hike), over the course of approximately an hour, to finally get allocated the type of rooms which we had booked. Each time I returned to reception I do not feel that my grievances were taken that seriously or dealt with professionally by the reception staff.  Overall this proved to be a very frustrating and time consuming experience which lets the hotel down overall. 

When I did eventually get to speak to the Duty Manager at check-out to point out the persistent issues faced, and explaining that I had a future reservation, he did promise me a call back within the next few days after investigating the problems - I still await that call back almost two weeks later…… 

Therefore if you enjoy returning to reception multiple times at check-in and don’t mind your complaints not being taken seriously, then the Sandymount is a great hotel for you !",3,2013,11,12
247,nice location,"We spent 3 nights at Sandymount. It is a family run hotel (the owner kindly greeting us!) in a very nice location. The dart is only few minutes away, and it takes only 3 stops to reach Tara srteet (Temple Bar).
The irish breakfast was good, but we were surprised to have pay for extra to get our capuccino!!
The room was nice and clean.",4,2013,11,11
247,"Brilliant service, lovely hotel","We couldn't have been happier with our choice of the Sandymount Hotel in Dublin for a family (2 adults, 1 child) weekend in Dublin. We originally selected the hotel based on the excellent rate (considering we were were there on a weekend of an International rugby game at the stadium) and the availability of WiFi. We will definitely go back again, though.

Our room was a good size with comfy beds. The bathroom had a shower (GREAT water pressure!) and a bath. The room and bathroom were both very clean and well presented.

Service was outstanding. We were provided with extra towels, a selection of books when I realized I had brought nothing to read within minutes of making a request to the front desk. Papers are provided at the front desk, as well. The breakfast was lovely with a nice selection of fruit, cerels, yogurt, juice as well as hot foods.

And while the location is not the handiest for city centre, it is ideal if you have a car to get around the city or are planning on an event at the Avivia stadium.",5,2013,11,11
247,Great location,"Nice hotel in a.great location, next door to Aviva stadium. Looks a bit dull from outside but nice rooms inside. The bar is ideal for a few drinks before heading to match at Aviva. Service was good with quick service. ",4,2013,11,11
247,EXCELLENT Hotel,The hotel and staff were very good the hotel was very close to the Dart station would definitely use again. There are some smaller areas with in walking distance which also have some shops and pubs where you can eat and drink.  Worth getting the Dart around Dublin bay.,5,2013,11,11
247,"Lovely hotel, would recommend","Stayed here for 2 nights, room was spacious, clean and tidy. Lovely power shower in the bathroom! The bar and restaurant were really nice, enjoyed food in both although the menu was relatively the same for both...thought it was a bit limited to be honest. Breakfast in the restaurant area was nice, plenty of choice and the hot food was actually hot...only issue is that where the food is served is a bit small. All the staff were really friendly.

Hotel is next the aviva stadium and there was a game on the Saturday night we stayed, couldn't hear the crowd so don't let the location put you off.  Dart station around the corner, only 3 stops away from city centre and costs €3.50 each return. Run every 15mins.

I would recommend this hotel as somewhere to stay outside of the city centre and would definitely return.
",4,2013,11,11
247,Would definitely stay again,Really nice hotel great location for the aviva stadium. Hotel was spotless really clean as were the rooms. Nice friendly staff cannot fault them at all great service. Breakfast area maybe needs to be a bit larger as there was a queue. Really great hotel would highly recommend it,5,2013,11,10
247,nearest hotel to aviva stadium,went to watch Ireland play samoa and stayed here found it easy to find using the port tunnel cutting out all the Dublin traffic on a busy Saturday well worth the 3 euros to use the tunnel the hotel itself had ample parking and was literally just down the street from the stadium the staff were very helpful and friendly the rooms were clean and comfortable the only complaint would be the limited menu that was on because of the match but the breakfast the next morning was fantastic and plenty of it would definitely stay here again when going to the aviva,4,2013,11,10
247,"Quiet suburb in Dublin, near the RDS","For my first visit to the Web Summit conference in Dublin, a colleague booked the nearby Sandymount hotel for the three nights that we were attending.

The hotel's website promised an unseen special rate but as we were worried about availability during the conference, with more than 10,000 attendees in the Irish capital, my colleague wisely phoned the hotel directly to enquire. We got two twin rooms for around 60€ per night which was exceptionally good value. Even with breakfast at extra cost - the full Irish breakfast was a 10€ option, with a continental style a few Euros less - this was a very cheap place to stay.

With such a low price for a hotel, principally I guess because it's located in a quiet, fairly well-to-do suburb of Dublin away from the city centre, it was hard to be disappointed even if Sandymount had proved a disaster. Which, I'm glad to say, it wasn't; the hotel was great. The communal areas were pleasant, nowhere was too far to walk and breakfast was excellent. They had a very good bar area with Guinness on tap as well!

My room was 513, situated well away from the reception areas and down one staircase at the end of a corridor, which meant it was all but silent. The usual features were available, including tea/coffee making facilities, Wi-Fi and in my view, a very comfortable bed. The bedroom and bathroom were of a reasonable size and clean and tidy, but lacked any real quality touches. Some of the finish was poor too, with some noticeable paintbrush overruns on the door jambs and skirting board, plus the odd patch of darkened silicon sealant in the bathroom. Nothing serious at all, but like the bathroom fittings and fixtures, it just felt a tad workman-like.

During our stay, there were temporary signs in reception warning of a water shortage in Dublin, which might explain why on two of the mornings during my stay it took a few minutes for the hot water to come through to the shower. I was just about to give up when the warmer water started to flow. I doubt this is indicative of a more serious issue however and quite possibly one beyond the hotel's control at that time.

If you're attending a conference at the Royal Dublin Society (RDS), then you have an easy 10-minute, level and safe walk across a neighbourhood to reach it, although there is one level crossing (with safety barriers) to negotiate. Note that you're a long way from the city centre, although a taxi ride takes no more than 15 minutes and cost around 10€, with cabs booked from reception.

I would certainly stay at Sandymount again. If TripAdvisor allowed, I would score the hotel 4.5 instead the 4 it gets here. If the rooms' ambience could just be improved a little, it's a five-star rating.",4,2013,11,06
247,"Great staff, great location, warm welcome","Given the choice of where to stay in Dublin, I always choose the Sandymount, and am a regular visitor there. I have stayed both on business and traveling with a young family, and in each case the welcome has always been excellent. It's certainly not your standard corporate hotel, and the layout can be a little confusing on first visit, as it is spread across interconnected buildings. It has however, personality-and this starts from the minute you arrive, with the people at reception being quite exceptional (take a bow Beatrice, Stephanie and Rose in particular!). Breakfasts are generous, and the bar food is of surprisingly high quality for a hotel. There are downsides-the lighting in the rooms is a bit too bright for my liking, and the carpets are coming to the end of their days, but this is a great value hotel in a great location,and has personality and character (and free parking!) for those who don't just want a bland, ""corporate"" hotel. I have probably stayed there over 100 times at this stage, and keep coming back, because for me it just works.",4,2013,11,06
247,A good place to stay...,"I stayed at the Sandymount Hotel for 1 night during my last visit to Dublin. The hotel is located in a very strategic position and you could reach all the close-by facilities by walk. There are 2 DART stations that you can go to. In terms of quality, the room was not super new (scratched surfaces in the wardrobe, the bathroom was not super new, a broken pillow on the bed) apart from these it's comfortable and clean.",3,2013,11,04
247,Great be be back.,"The fact that we returned here should say something. Again - little to grumble about bar the room location where our view was the bins for the empties from the bar. Still - we arrived in the dark so it didnt cause too much grief. Room was clean & well appointed as was the bathroom. We ate in the bar that night - my pasta was delicious however I was envious of my sons chicken goujons & chips ... they were truly delicious (esp for a childrens meal). The ambiance of the hotel is nice, staff most pleasant and the location is also hard to beat. The only gripe was with breakfast where I felt that the cooked food could have been a bit warmer. Overall - grand stay & we'll be back.",4,2013,11,04
247,A hidden gem.,"We had a wonderful stay at the Sandymount hotel.From the moment we arrived we were dealt with very quickly, the ladies on reception were lovely and polite. They recommended tourist attractions for us and they were very knowledgeable.

Our room was clean, quiet and the decor was modern and very nice. A big room with lots of storage space.

The location is fantastic, it's just 3 stops away from Tara street station, lansdowne road DART station is just a couple of minutes walk away from the hotel. It is also opposite the Aviva stadium, which is included in the Dublin pass. A great tour around the stadium which even I would recommend, and I'm not a sports fan!

The breakfast was always spot on, all of the staff were happy an willing to help. There was something for everyone and we never left with an empty stomach!. It was always fresh and it was topped up constantly.

Overall we had a wonderful stay, we have already recommended the hotel to family and friends who are wanting to visit Dublin. We were not disappointed!. 

Thank you very much for a wonderful stay, I hope we will be back someday.",5,2013,10,30
247,Great hotel,"The folks at Sandmount were amazing. They treated my family like royalty. The room was clean and nicely furnished. The breakfast was great and the pints were perfect. It was a busy weekend there but they still took the time to make us feel welcome. Thanks
",5,2013,10,29
247,An excellent stay,"Absolutely no complaints. A clean comfortable spacious room with good en-suite bathroom facilities. All the staff were very attentive, courteous and helpful and always prepared to go the extra mile. Good start to the day with an excellent breakfast if slightly expensive. Hotel positioned well for the Dart, the city, the Aviva stadium and coast. We have stayed many times and will continue to do so.",5,2013,10,29
247,13 - 15 July 2013 & 16 October 2013,"As Trip Advisor only allows you to post about the same hotel, every six months, I have included my two trips into one.

Saturday 13 July: We arrived early to the hotel, after 10.30 am, as asked could we leave our bags and we could go off sightseeing. The receptionist had a better idea. She checked to see if our room was ready (214) and of course it was, so we were able to make ourselves comfortable first. When we returned from our fabulous day in Bray, Siobhán and Beatrice were there at reception. It always feels like a home from home here in the Sandymount. We had dinner in the hotel which was superb.

Sunday 14 July: We had a fabulous breakfast and went to mass at the nearby church. We decided to go down the Sandymount Strand. The weather wasn't as nice as the day before, but we still enjoyed it. I even went in for a paddle into the water. The was the Munster Hurling Final: Limerick vs Cork and Siobhán gave Dad tips where to see the game. The village is within walking distance of the hotel and it is lovely to be able to sit in the Green. Back again to the hotel for some food.

Monday 15 July: We found out that the red Sightseeing bus leaves from the hotel and picks you up to go into the city centre, so we decided to do this. Well worth doing and the ticket is valid for two days, we'll know that the next time! Back again to the hotel for dinner.

Tuesday 16 July: Going home day. Dad met Rose as he hadn't met her at all during the trip. The hotel organised a taxi to bring us to the bus station, as we had to make a 10 am bus to Knock. Very happy with our trip.

16 October: We were coming up to Dublin to see Jessie J in concert in the O2. The rain was awful all day, but we were lucky when we were out and didn't see much of it. Got to the hotel around 5 pm and checked in, and went to get dinner and a dessert. It was lovely. The Dart is very handy and we were able to get the Luas to the concert and we were in plenty of time to get the last Dart back to the hotel. Our room was handy (221) and easy to find. 

17 October: We got up for breakfast at 8.30 am and even at the time, it was busy. Siobhán and Beatrice were on the reception again and very chatty and friendly. Even wishing us a Happy Christmas. Thanks for everything and looking forward to finding an excuse to visit the Sandymount Hotel soon.",5,2013,10,27
247,Good value city centre location,Had cause to stay here last week. Booked at short notice and was very happy with price. Clean room. Plenty of features. Good bar area. Complimentary papers. Good central location with plenty of restaurants within easy reach. No issues or complaints.,4,2013,10,23
247,A perfect stay,"My daughter and I stayed in this hotel for a couple of nights and found it absolutely delightful. The location is ideal, near all the main attractions in Dublin and next door to the amazing Aviva Stadium. Very quiet and relaxed settings, good food and very helpful staff. Lovely spacious and comfortable rooms with en-suite bathrooms and tea and coffee facilities and also free Wi Fi.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a nice pleasant stay in Dublin. First class hotel with services to match and reasonable rates. I will definitely book at this hotel again.",5,2013,10,22
247,Wedding venue,We had our Wedding in the Sandymount hotel in September 2013.  I cannot rate the experience highly enough.  The staff are so friendly and we got so many compliments about the food from our guests.  The rates are also very reasonable.  It really was the perfect day thanks largely to the team at the hotel.,5,2013,10,22
247,Dump,Got room 611 and had to ask to be moved. I swear there was a smell of cats pee in the room. Cobwebs on the ceiling broken toilet seat and dirty carpets. Pure filth! We had come from a two night stay in the Pembrooke in Kilkenny which was heaven.. Would never stay in Sandymount again even if I was given it for free! Oh yeah got a show from the couple staying above us once before we went to sleep and once when we woke up! That was the highlight..,1,2013,10,19
247,Our Perfect Day in a Perfect Hotel,"When we 1st booked this hotel we wanted somewhere close to the City Centre, but quiet as well, we also wanted a Hotel that could accomodate a wedding  and give us the perfect day and also a comfortable stay as we were there for 5 nights. As we live in Wales all the booking and setting up was basically done by e-mail and phone calls, Did this work out? It did. What an amazing time we had. The Hotel was everything we wanted, relaxing, friendly, clean and as for the wedding, we had our perfect day. The room set up was amazing, the food was excellent and the staff from reception to bar to kitchen were brilliant. I  want to mention a few names. Marie and gang that fed us for Breakfast and did an amazing job looking after us for the wedding. Daniel and Syivia that looked after us  in the bar and also the girls on reception especially Siobhain. And a BIG thank you to all the other staff that worked in the back ground that we never saw and the people that I´ve forgotten to mention. Last but not least Gail. I must have driven her mad with all the phone calls and e-mails. But  she helped organise our perfect day. Regardless of the reason for travelling to Dublin. This is the hotel that I think will cater for you time in Dublin. 5 days that my wife and I will always remember and for All The Right Reasons. Thank You Sandymount Hotel",5,2013,10,18
247,Lovely hotel in great location with friendly helpful staff,"Made to feel really welcome by reception staff. The room was comfortable and spotless providing all we required. The restaurant for breakfast was very attractive and the breakfast itself was good. Unfortunately wedding guests on our floor kept us awake singing and shouting from 2.00am until 5.00 am. The night manager did his best but really the guests were totally unreasonable and had drunk too much. I have to say that the following morning the reception staff were very apologetic and dealt with our complaints in a very professional manner. As a result I would think that our unfortunate experience was a one off and I would return to this hotel, but maybe ask for a quiet room. It is a family run hotel and they really do aim to please their guests .",4,2013,10,15
247,Value for mobey,Would book again. Very friendly clean and value for money. Location very good. Made my stay there very welcome. Home from home rooms very clean and well equipped . Very busy when we stayed there in October.,5,2013,10,14
247,Perfect for Business,"I always stay in The Sandymount when in Dublin. Its perfect quiet location and the staff are very helpful, especially Beatrice at reception. The rooms are good and the Food is excellent in the bar. Someday I hope to stay for a long weekend for a leisure not just work. The hotel is right next door ti the Aviva stadium, so tying a match to the trip would be excellent.",5,2013,10,13
247,Always a Smiley Welcome,7 week stay on business.  Couldnt have asked for better.  Extremely helpful staff. Always very friendly.  Rooms kept clean. Good food.  Nothing was too much trouble.  No hesitation in recommending this hotel for business or leisure.  In fact I'm going back on a leisure trip next month.,5,2013,10,12
247,Great location,"This hotel is just two DART stops from central Dublin, but in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood with restaurants and shops within walking distance. Might be noisier when event going on at Aviva Stadium. One wonderful thing was that they let us check in early, about 10 a.m. We were totally jet lagged as it was about 2 a.m. in California and we were able to go to sleep rather than waiting till check in time at 3 p.m. The rooms are a little spartan but comfortable. Staff very helpful and friendly.",4,2013,10,12
247,Very helpful and friendly!,"Myself and my wife have just come back from a long weekend at the Sandymount where we had a great time.The hotel was spot on, staff were really helpful and polite.
We arrived at the hotel at about 11am and were checked into a room by 12 (check in was supposed to be 2pm). Rooms were very clean and decent size for the two of us but didn't really stay in there too much as we wanted to see the sights, bathroom could maybe have a little upgrade but not an issue to us at all. Location was good, Landsdown road dart is about 5 min walk if that and bus routes into the center is about 10. Food at the hotel was great and Guinness went down well too! We went on a bed and breakfast board and were really impressed with it, cup was always getting topped up with coffee when empty and all food was nice and fresh. I would recommend this hotel to friends and would happily stay here again, thank you",4,2013,10,11
247,Superb hotel and friendly staff make this a great place to stay!,"I frequent this hotel often and it is a fabulous place to stay. The staff at reception Beatrice, Siobhan, Stephanie, Emma and Rose will give you a warm and friendly welcome. The hard working Jack the porter is always on hand if you need anything done. Breakfast lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed at the quality and variety of food. Great location. So close to dart station, shopping sporting and concert venues. Well worth a visit.",5,2013,10,10
247,Very friendly and well situated hotel,My sister and I stayed at the Sandymount for the weekend and were very happy with the location as it was a 5 minute walk from Lansdowne Road Dart station as well as being close enough to the city centre to walk there too. Being close to the Dart also meant that we could get out along the coast quickly and easily. The staff were friendly and the bar food was excellent. The only tiny complaint I had was that the bathroom could do with a bit of a makeover but that certainly didn't detract from our stay. I would definitely stay there again.,4,2013,10,09
247,A great hotel - well worth a stay!,"After an extremely busy day comprising meetings in various parts of Dublin, it was such a relief to arrive at this hotel. Best of everything really: warm hotel staff, lovely room, peace & quiet, as well as a spacious internet room, accommodating lounge and bar area. The stay was really a first class! In fact, I have stayed in this hotel many times and have always been more than happy with it. The breakfast particularly should not be missed - its cooked to perfection. Well worth a stay!",5,2013,10,08
247,Great hotel for trip to Dublin,"We loved this hotel. The location is great - a quick stroll to the dart to get into Dublin. We stayed there for 2 nights. We attended a concert in the O2 - from the O2, we got the Luas to Connelly Station and the Dart back out to Landsdowne road. The location allows you to see different aspects of what Dublin has to offer as we were just a 10 minute stroll from Sandymount village & Ballsbridge,  The staff at the hotel were really friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere at the hotel overall was very amiable. The corridors to the rooms seem a bit higgildy-piggildy but this adds to the atmosphere of the hotel - I'm sure this was originally a number of houses which have been converted into one building so there is bound to be a lack of symmetry to the place. We will certainly return to this hotel when visiting Dublin again",5,2013,10,08
247,Yet another great experience @ Sandymount,We were a group of 7 staying in Sandy mount for my sisters 40th Birthday! Siobhan and Bridget on reception could not have done anymore for us. My sister and i got upgraded to a Executive suite it was lovely. Plenty of space in the rooms very clean and tidy. The housekeeping staff are very good and very approachable.  Everyone a the hotel is lovely. The breakfast is very good also. I would definitely recommend this hotel to stay in. A+++++++,5,2013,10,08
247,Loved it !,"Spent 5 weeks there on business, agreat hotel, well furnished clean rooms, superb parking, reasonable bar prices & more importantly a warm welcome from superb staff on return everyday.
Will stay there again next time I'm in Dublin.
Only downside was baffling free wifi which was fine once set up properly.
",5,2013,10,08
247,Sandymount Hotel,"Smoked smelling room - uneven floors. Clean beds & room. Food & service ok. 
I can't say anymore about this hotel just do not ask me to make a review with so many words. This puts people doing surveys.  
      
      ",3,2013,10,07
247,above expectations,Just home after a fabulous stay in the sandymount. The staff especially Siobhan and Bridgette couldn't have been any more helpful. The room was spotless and well equipped. The breakfast was really good. We were made feel really welcome by all the staff. Couldn't recommend this hotel enough it's really good.,5,2013,10,07
247,OK HOTEL,We stayed here one night after arriving from Edinburgh.  There was a wedding party finishing up taking pictures outside.  This hotel has many rooms connected by long hallways on two floors that weave around with arrows showing the reception and room numbers.  We had to have someone show us to our room a couple of times as we got lost and I saw other people looking for their rooms as well. We stayed in two rooms that were adjoined by a door that we had requested. The rooms were clean. We had breakfast there and it was a very good buffet. We ordered room service desert and it was very good. The people at the reception were very friendly and helpful.,4,2013,10,07
247,"great stay, extra helpful staff","Very big rooms, comfortable and very clean. Very helpful staff who sent on my watch I left behind. Plenty kf nice restaurants in ballsbridge. Not inthe centre  of dublin but dart station 2 mins away and easy walk to city in around 25 mins. Only negative inconsiderate noisy people across from us but when we requested staff to intervene thdy did so.",5,2013,10,06
247,Great staff,"Stayed at The Sandymount for 3 nights, while over to watch the rugby at the RDS, which is an easy walk. The room was clean and comfortable. The reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly. There is a complimentary mini bus service available at certain times, but the DART station is only a 5min walk, and takes you straight into the centre (Tara Street), The hotel is in a quiet location with very little road noise. Do use your 'Do Not Disturb' sign as the housekeeping do like to start early and are very efficient. We will definitely be using hotel again, on our next trip to RDS or Aviva Stadium. Thank you for a great stay!",4,2013,10,05
247,Amazing place helpful staff,"Everyone we came across were so helpful, they go beyond what they supposed to do to ensure your stay is perfect. The bar food is amazing! It is a great location the hop on and off tour bus that does a loop around Dublin city picks you up from the front of the hotel. ",5,2013,10,05
247,Superb Hotel !,"I stayed in this hotel last night and I must say I was so impressed by the quality and class I found inside. The staff were super friendly and accommodating and the room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.  The decor was modern and very appealing on the eye, yet still held charm and warmth, resulting in the perfect balance for a new guest such as myself.  The food and bar service was delightful, quick and efficient.  It has been the nicest stay in a hotel I have had in a long time and will most definitely be paying a second visit, and more, to this wonderfully charming hotel !",5,2013,10,04
247,Great Hotel,"This was the last stop in our tour of Ireland we had the pleasure of staying at this hotel,
 Room was very spacious clean and well presented would recommend this hotel , the staff including the owner made us feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble.",5,2013,10,04
247,Patricia Burke,"Had the pleasure of staying in this Hotel last night while attending a concert in the city. From the moment we arrived at Reception we were made feel extremely welcome , Got to our.    Room  very quickly & what a lovely room , very spacious Room 131 , spotless clean, large bathroom , loads of towels which is most unusual in a lot of hotels. Went to bar for a drink met again with very friendly staff. Had dinner in bar , fab food & very efficient service. Had courtesy coach to our theatre. Lovely breakfast this am. Would highly recommend this Hotel if visiting Dublin for efficiency , friendless & brilliant value for money . Thank you again I will recommend this hotel to all my friends. Patricia Burke. ",5,2013,10,03
247,Amazingly Helpful Staff,"We flew from Australia to Dublin, and this was our first stop. And what a great place to start our Ireland touring. The reception staff were  amazing! Nothing was too much trouble.They were friendly and totally professional.The hotel is well positioned, being in a quiet area, but only 5 minutes walk to a train, to go the 4(?) stops to the centre of the city. Good value for money, and good to eat and drink in if you don't feel like going out in the evening. Highly recommended.",5,2013,10,02
247,Friendly and helpful staff.,Stayed here for my first ever night in Ireland after a long flight from Australia and it turned out to be a good choice for a much needed good nights sleep. The hotel is located in a quite residential part of Dublin but just a short walk to the local train station and then only 3 stops to the central part of the city. The rooms are simple but clean and the beds are comfortable. The full Irish breakfast was a great way to start the day but the most impressive thing about this hotel was the staff. They were always helpful and genuinely friendly and they have left me with a great first impression of Ireland.,5,2013,09,30
247,"Friendly, clean and family run!","Stayed at the Sandymount in the beginning of August, just myself and my boyfriend for my birthday. Arrived at the hotel very early and we sat in the bar for a while until we could go to our room. The staff at reception were busy but happy to try and get a room ready for us quickly. 

We went to our room and met a housekeeper who was just finishing, she was extremely friendly, I think she was Romanian. The room was very clean with no problems. The whole hotel is aged, but it says it in the history and it adds a little bit of charm. The rooms are average size, we were put in a room for three people but I wouldn't want to squeeze more than two in. The hotel resturant and breakfast area are very nice, as is the lobby and the toilets downstairs.  The garden looked nice but it was a wet weekend for us so we didnt sit out there.

We ate breakfast twice during our 4 night stay and we enjoyed it each time. Bit of a help yourself and get on with it but sometimes thats nice. We ate dinner once but we were not too impressed, nothing to do with the service though. 

The hotel is close to the dart station and it takes about 10 minuets to get to Dublin city. We done all the usual tourist attractions. Would recommend Dublin zoo, the leprechaun museum and Finnagans to eat and the ghost bus tour, well worth a few screams for the laughs you will have and the history of Dublin you will learn. If you go on the bus, please say that 'Kerry the screamer' said hi ;).

We enjoyed our stay and the hotel family staff couldnt have been more friendlier :) ",5,2013,09,29
247,Peaceful value for money,"We found the Sandymount via TripAdvisor, booking only a short while before travelling to Dublin. I'd noted how expensive Dublin seemed for hotels, and had noticed a lot of complaints about other hotels (mostly nearer to the city centre) being noisy - given the prices for hotels in Dublin, I wanted to be able to get some rest, thanks. Turns out we were lucky the Sandymount had a room available, as it was an instant hit with us. The area is a lovely quiet suburb within walking distance of the city, with great places to eat and drink not far away in either direction, and a close-nearby DART stop for trains into the city.Sandymount itself is a lovely 'village' area near the beach (yes, you will like it) with cafes if the hotel breakfast doesn't appeal. It probably will. The reception staff were excellent and typically charming (bit biased as I love the Irish). The family run bit does count greatly, and I hope the owner keeps up what he's got going on here - if he does, I'll see him and his staff for breakfast and a nightcap whenever I am next in Dub. Lovely place, recommended without reservation. Cheers all.",5,2013,09,28
247,Friendly Staff @ Sandymount Hotel Dublin,"We stayed with friends at the Sandymount Hotel in Dublin.  The hotel is comfortable and conveniently located, short walk to the station and 5 minutes from the city centre.

The hotel has great ambience, nice bar and restaurant with good food at a reasonable price.

The highlight of our stay was the friendly and helpful attitude of the staff!

You will not be disappointed if you decide to stay at Sandymount

247,A perfect Choice for your Dublin Stay,"My friend and I were in town for the All-Ireland Football Championship last weekend, and had an absolutely wonderful stay thanks to Beatrice and the staff at the Sandymount Hotel.  Sandymount is a lovely and picturesque beach side village about a 5 minute taxi ride fro Dublin's City Centre, so it's an ideal place for your Dublin visit.  It has all of the amenities within walking distance, such as pharmacy, coffee shop, bank, and pubs.   The hotel staff showed us the best of the world-renowned Irish hospitality, evidenced by their getting us situated in our room even though we were a few hours early in arriving.  The hotel room was clean, bright and airy.  There was a fun buzz to the dining areas and lobby but our room offered us the peacefulness we needed when we came back from our activities.  

I would absolutely recommend the Sandymount Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.

247,Home from Home !!!!,"The Sandymount Hotel was found by myself when I was looking for a hotel with parking close to the city, i stay here every month (on business) for 3 to 4 days at a time, and have done so for 4 Years !!!!!!!!!!

I love it here, the staff are very friendly, nothing is too much trouble and although not far from the city it is located in a relativly quiet area so excessive noise has never been an issue, the rooms are always clean and tidy also FREE WiFi is available throughout the building, also FREE Parking on site is a very rare thing in Dublin,

The Bar serves nice food and again the staff will do anything they can to help, I have food allergies and they always have assisted me with modifying the menu so as not to casue me problems, I stay in alot of hotels this kind of service is ""gold"" to me, but if you don't want to eat on site you are not far from good old Irish fayre in the local area.

This is not a boutique hotel, but if you want a warm welcome, from helpful people, for a reasonable rate, in a quiet part of town put the Sandymount on your list of places to stay",5,2013,09,25
247,Great location,I stayed with a friend for two night Sept 2013 and I found the location excellent for City and very close to the lovely village of Sandymount. You can walk to city or take the Dart. The staff are reception were very helpful and pleasant and friendly.The plus side you get free parking.This was my second time staying at hotel and have recommend to lots of my friends.,5,2013,09,24
247,Ideal for visting Aviva Stadium,"Me and my son spent 2 nights at The Sandymount. A very pleasant experience overall.
The staff were very friendly at all times and could not have been more helpfull.
The food was good and the room we had was huge. It was very busy the  nights we stayed as there were a lot of people going to the same concert, Roger Waters The Wall  which made for a very friendly atmosphere throughout our stay.
It is only about 200yards from The Aviva so could not be any handier if you are visiting for an event which is on there.",5,2013,09,24
247,Every bit as good the second time round.,"We first stayed at Sandymount Hotel in June 2012 - when we went over to see a concert at the O2 in Dublin.

Having really enjoyed ourselves then, we had no hesitation in booking Sandymount Hotel again this year when we were looking for somewhere to stay while celebrating our wedding anniversary. We are delighted to be able to report that we were not disappointed in any way with our return visit. 

Having caught a morning flight to Dublin we arrived well ahead of the usual check-in time so we were quite prepared to wait in the bar/restaurant area until our room would be ready. However, the reception staff kindly said that it wasn't a problem as our room was ready and they allowed us access to it straight away. This was much appreciated. Better still, when we had originally made our booking (online) we had asked to be allocated a room in a quiet position if possible and that was precisely what we were given. Excellent !  

As before, we found all of the staff very welcoming, friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We were also impressed by the fact that the hotel's owner/manager, John Loughran, recognised us, remembered our names and made time to chat to us.

Just as last year, we enjoyed relaxing in the Hotel's bar/restaurant and lounge areas and, thankfully, this year the weather was kinder, therefore we took the opportunity to explore the surrounding area on foot (well worthwhile) and get to other areas of Dublin (including its excellent zoo) via taxi.

So we had a most enjoyable break away. Our thanks again to everyone at Sandymount for making our latest stay another very happy one. Here's hoping it won't be too long before we next return.",5,2013,09,23
247,Footballer hotel with parking in Dublin,"This sprawling hotel is next to a ruby, soccer stadium in SE Dublin, 8-10 euro taxi ride to Stevens green with free parking on site. Service was pleasant and room small and spartan. Getting around hotel was a challenge with two different elevators and number on entrances.",3,2013,09,23
247,Well located hotel at a reasonable hotel,"The hotel is pretty well located,close to the DART and buses to town. Generally it's reasonably priced unless there is some event on.I see some people have problems with the warren like nature of the building but I suppose that's inevitable with a hotel created from four town houses. Breakfast was fine and rooms are clean if a little tight on space.",4,2013,09,21
247,Well positioned for Aviva stadium but a bit tired,I stayed for two nights last week for the first time in this hotel as I was attending an event in the Aviva Stadium. It's well positioned and easy enough to get to with ample parking. The reception and bar areas are very attractive and the breakfast restaurant (and breakfast) were good. The rooms however were a different matter. There were 8 of us staying and we all had the same view - the rooms were very tired and in need of upgrading. The bathrooms were also basic. All functional - just tired and in need of a facelift.,3,2013,09,17
247,"Homely, courtesy and professionalism","Delighted with every aspect of the Hotel. The people make it!. Beatrice and Ciaran good not have been more helpful, you are given excellent persnal attention
Location excellent with the DART rail system to town 2minutes away, or a beautiful 20 minute city walk.Rooms very comfortable and fanatstic value for money, tyr getting a London hotel for half the price and you will be very lucky!",5,2013,09,17
247,Gem of a hotel,"We arrived in from the US and spent 4 nights: Great staff, good food, comfortable and convenient to the DART, the train, Sandymount Village, Ballsbridge, and the Dublin Bay.  Nice bar/lounge.   This is not the Merrion or the 4 Seasons.  This is a place to stretch your dollars and enjoy yourselves.  Relax and enjoy!  You will be well cared for.",5,2013,09,15
247,Disgusting Accommodations,"We did not book this hotel, but was the lodging provided as the last night of a tour.  First look, was through the door from the parking area where the elevator is located.  The entrance was filthy and the carpet was worn, which dismayed me right away.  The room was tiny, and the bathroom was so tiny two people could barely fit, but that is neither here nor there compared to the condition of room - 1) no hot water, just warm for evening shower (hotel did post a sign that one may need to let the water run for awhile which I did), 2) the carpet was laid directly on what felt like pieces of plywood, 3) the furniture was old (not antique) but severely outdated and the desk had cigarette burns, 4) the hair dryer was dirty/dusty and I cleaned it before I used it  5) the walls were extremely thin, 6) the whole experience was so creepy that I didn't want to even put my suitcase on the floor.   The hotel was located in a residential area, so no shopping or restaurants nearby.  In the interest of fairness, the dining area was acceptable, the food was okay (evening appetizer and breakfast), and the restaurant staff was pleasant.",1,2013,09,13
247,Homew Away from Home,"I have been staying at the Sandymount for over 10 years (typically 1 night per week).  It is a great hotel with some fantastic staff including Beatrice and Stephanie on reception.  It is a clean, comfortable hotel and has a great location.  After the many years, I continue to recommend to friends and colleagues which reflects my very postive view of the hotel.",5,2013,09,12
247,Lovely find!,"We stayed here last weekend for the first time, as opposed to Bewleys Hotel. Nice to see a facelift happening as realistically that's all that was needed. Superbly located behind the Aviva Stadium and 5 mins from Landsdowne Road Dart Station. Ample parking while the reception is up steps and lower wheelchair access is visible but would need to be requested...i presume! 
Rooms are spacious and all the usual trimmings. Service was excellent and breakfast first class. Take note,there is no residents bar (for those wishing to party),however this should suit alot of people as the allows for a good nights sleep!!:-)
A pick up point outside for the hop on/off bus.We will definately be back.",4,2013,09,12
247,Again a lovely experience!,"I stayed here a few years ago when going to the O2 for a concert and decided to stay again last night with my mum as we were going to the Leonard Cohen concert and it was definitely the right choice. Lovely friendly welcome and the same hotel charm as a few years back. We had a few drinks and a lovely meal before leaving for the concert and they had great value specials on which seemed to attract quite a few locals in too which is great to see! Shuttle bus provided free of charge for concert goers which was a nice touch and a great atmosphere back in the bar afterwards. Lovely waiting staff, a girl named Anna was particularly helpful and a fab breakfast set up the next morning. I will definitely return and would recommend this hotel to anyone going to the O2 or Aviva stadium or any Dublin trip with the Dart station so close by. 10 out of 10 from me......",5,2013,09,12
247,Good but.........,"Just seen a review that mentioned spacious rooms. What? Ours was tiny, as opposed to the room across the hall which seemed to be much bigger when we could see in as it was being cleaned. Anyway....The hotel itself is quite nice...lovely reception staff...the only issue I have with this and all other hotels really is the way they try and rip you off with over excessive prices in their bars and restaurants. The hotel is well positioned. Right next to the Aviva stadium and the Dart station. Just 2 stops away from the city centre. So good for that. The other thing is the lack of sleep...Doors in this hotel tend to slam at all times. Please fit something to stop this happening. Best hotel for events at the Aviva though. ",3,2013,09,11
247,Excellent,"I've stayed here for over 20 years, every stay I have always had excellent service, impeccable rooms, friendly staff, high quality food and services and a very convenient location with great parking. 
I would highly recommend this hotel anyone 
Karamat",5,2013,09,11
247,"Spacious rooms, helpful staff","We stayed at the Sandymount hotel on the last two days of our trip around Ireland. We had a family room which was really spacious, clean and quiet. The location of the hotel is excellent, not far to the DART. The staff is very helpful and nice and gave us good advice where to go with the kids. The nearby Herbert Park with the great playground f.e. was a very good recommendation for our last hours after check out. While picking up the taxi to the airport our daughter forgot her jacket in the hotel lobby: not a problem for Sandymount - they send it to our home adress in Germany on the other day on no cost .... I was positively surprised about such a perfect service. Thank you very much for this once again, Rose.",4,2013,09,09
247,"Great hotel, excellent staff","Great place to stay. Staff excellent. Beatrice, Olga, Rose, Stephanie, Gerald, Parvi.and many others. great service. Very friendly and helpful.  Good for families, breaks or business stayers. Owner always on hand making sure guests are happy.

Lovely location. Close to amenities and services. 
Breakfast marvelous. Bar food average. 

Overall a great all-round hotel. Happy to recommend to anyone.",5,2013,09,09
247,"Friendly, polite and efficient service","I have stayed on many occasions over the last 5 years, at the Sandymount and I have always, always found the staff polite, efficient and helpful. The rooms are clean and well presented, as are the staff! The location is great, not too far from the Strand for an evening stroll or access to the city and its many sites; the Aviva, just minutes walk away! Checking in is always a pleasure.",5,2013,09,08
247,Consistently Good,"As a family we are regular visitors to the Sandymount Hotel, staying here for over 30 years. Firstly 1970's with my mother who liked to stay here ( it was called Mount Herbert Hotel at that time) because it had no bar and she was assured of a peaceful stay! In the late 1980's and early 1990's(still the Mount Herbert), we came as a family with a young son who had regular visits to a Dublin hospital, and we were assured of great service and attention. In the 1990's and 2000's it was our destination for any visit to Dublin - business, pleasure, concerts, sport, or medical appointments. The staff are extremely friendly and efficient, the rooms are spotlessly clean and well maintained, the bar and dining facilities are very comfortable and offer a very adequate menu. Great taxi service which can be booked at reception. We have never been disappointed at the Sandymount Hotel and our most recent stay on Sept 4 th (on the eve of our sons graduation) was no exception. Our adult daughter has also begun to stay here while visiting Dublin - the third generation to do so! I look forward to many more visits. Well done the Sandymount Hotel and staff - you are a home from home!",4,2013,09,07
247,Great hotel,"Have just spent 2 great nights at this hotel after being let down by the Grant Canal Hotel.  Everything about this hotel was excellent - lovely clean, spacious room, great breakfast, friendly and helpful service.  The owner even came over to chat to us and ask if everything was OK - a great personal touch.  Excellent parking, about 3 minutes walk to the Dart to get into the centre of Dublin and to the England/Ireland cricket in Malahide.  Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return.",5,2013,09,05
247,Wonderful family run .,"Over the past 7years I have stayed twice a year,the staff offer a wonderful personal touch making you feel so at home,the comfortable accommodation grand choice of food in the dining room and breakfast buffett is a real treat so much choice.So central to the Dart and many other
Buses,the village and even a 10min walk to the sea and going to the Aviva its just a stone through away,my second home when in Dublin.Thank you to all the dedicated staff many have been their for many years.  Marian.A.",5,2013,09,04
247,"Great Location, Great Hotel","We stayed here after there was damage to the original hotel we booked due to a horrible flood in the area, and it turns out we got the best possible place.  Its a short walk from Aviva Stadium and in the Ballsbridge area.  Room was nice size and daily breakfast was excellent.  Staff was great and common areas were all very clean and nice.",4,2013,09,04
247,Pleasant Surprise,"Having to overnight in Dublin I asked Amex to book a hotel for me that had secure parking and was within easy reach of Dublin Port. I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. All the basics were covered, rooms were a good size, clean and comfortable but what left a lasting impression was the charm and courtesy of the two ladies on reception. They were both excellent and Siobhan made such an impression that the hotel is now firmly on the list of places to stay in Dublin. Polite, welcoming, helpful, funny and the perfect ambassador to greet a weary traveler. Thank you, you made the difference.",5,2013,09,04
247,Comfort in Dublin,"The room was lovely, the bar is a reasonably priced supper destination, and breakfast in the dining room are tough to beat. There is a convenient bus route to central Dublin (Trinity College) and the Hop On Hop Off Bus will pick you up mornings. You need to find you own way back, but the bus from Trinity College makes the return easy.

Friendly staff and a very nice facility.",4,2013,09,03
247,Sandymount Hotel is definitely a Dublin gem.,"We stayed with our family including 3 young children and an infant and were very impressed with the beautiful and comfortable accommodation, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and the ample buffet breakfasts offered in the dining room.
The hotel is family run, offering a personal touch,  and the owner was available and most helpful.",5,2013,09,03
247,Average hotel in a good location,"We stayed one night prior to going on a ferry to Wales. The hotel is in a good location just near the train station, 2 stops from the centre of Dublin. Pretty good bar area and bar food etc. Parking was easy and the staff were friendly.
The only issue we had was that we had to get up at 6.00am to get the ferry and when trying to have a shower we couldnt get any hot water even though we let it run for 10 mins. We would probably stay there agaim.
",3,2013,09,03
247,Nice Hotel in a Good Location,"When we arrived, we were allocated a room which turned out to be interconnected to the adjacent room via a locked door - we could hear every word of the conversation there! We requested a different room and were promptly allocated one. Our subsequent stay was quite pleasant; parking is free, as is wifi (although it is only accessible if you open an account with Bizzbuzz and get daily vouchers from reception; all very fiddly). Breakfast is expensive, at €10 per person. The double room we had was small but comfortable and clean. The hotel is located a short walk from the Aviva Stadium and a nearby DART station, with trains running into Dublin quite frequently. Sandymount Strand is a 15-minute walk.",4,2013,09,03
247,Amazing time because of Siobhan.,"We arrived at the Sandymount hotel after discovering our car was stolen near the Guinness Storehouse with all our possessions in the boot. Considering the state of despair we were in Siobhan could not have made our experience any better. She provided us an upgraded room, toiletries, and a meal at the bar for our troubles. Before speaking to the Guarda my (then) boyfriend asked me to marry him. Later that night we got a call that our car was found with the boot untouched. My fiance told Siobhan our positive end to an emotional first night in Dublin, and she provided us strawberries and champagne as a congratulations for our engagement. We are completely impressed and grateful for Siobhan's attention. She really helped our moment in the good times and bad. Thank you Siobhan. When it comes to the hotel it was great, very clean, and so convenient to the DART. The restaurant/bar had genuinely good food. The rest of the staff was also friendly and very empathetic to us. Siobhan just went above and beyond. Thanks again so much Siobhan. You made a horrible situation as good as it possible get.",5,2013,09,03
247,"Sandymount Hotel - Dublin, Ireland","The Sandymount Hotel was quite conveniently located although it isn't in the CBD.  It is still a walkable distance to most areas of Dublin and to the CBD.  For those that don't want to walk, it is less than a 10 minute walk to the DART Lansdowne Metro station and 2 stops away from the CBD.  
I was initially disappointed with the service because I complained that our room did not have a room safe as advertised and nothing was done to compensate for that omission.  But the service did improve towards the later part of our stay.  We were able to get the shuttle to drive us into the CBD for dinner one evening.  The room was ok but I feel the bathroom needed counter space and some of the grout needed to be replaced.  There is free Wi-Fi throughout the property.  Breakfast was 10 Euros and it was adequate but nothing extraordinary.",3,2013,09,01
247,Quick break,"Stayed in this hotel for one night, having found an excellent offer on room rates! Although it's not in city centre it's well serviced with transport links and it's right beside the aviva stadium. Hotel was clean and friendly staff, nice bar and rooms were adequate. We didnt spend much time at hotel as we headed into city at night to enjoy city night life but would stay in this location again as good price for a handy enough location! ",4,2013,09,01
247,Dublin Break,"Great hotel for the price not far from the Dart train so handy for getting in and out of city centre. Good hotel friendly staff clean and well located, only down side is the thin walls, I could hear the guy next door go to the toilet undo his zip and pee thought he was doing it on my head it sounded that close lol",4,2013,09,01
247,Will definitely be back,"Myself and my hubby stayed here for 2 nights this week.  I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.  The staff, the room, the food - absolutely everything was top notch.  And the pressure in the shower was great (not always the case in hotel showers).  I stayed here approx 5 years ago when it was the Mount Herbert Hotel and the hotel has had a brilliant refurb since then.  Seriously,the next time we're in Dublin, this is where we'll be staying!  It's a great quiet location but not too far from the city centre at the same time.  And there's a car park :-)",5,2013,08,30
247,Near Perfection,"For us as a family this is the perfect place to stay in Dublin, close enough to the city but far enough away to be at home.
The welcome and service from all staff members can only be considered as exceptionally good expertly led and guided by John.
If you are looking for a place home from home, close to the DART with the city and main sporting and musical venues on the door step this is where you should be.
Liz on reception and Sylvia in the dining room stood out with their professional approach.",4,2013,08,30
247,only one night,This little place was sort of out of the hustle and bustle of Dublin but right outside of all the action. Simple and clean with no frills sandymount provided a quiet night of rest for only one night. I stayed at other nicer hotels in other parts of Ireland so this was a letdown of  sorts. But for the simple traveler this would be a quick stop.,3,2013,08,29
247,Central Hotel in quiet location,"We have stayed in this hotel before and found it very good. It is convenient to the Dart train into Dublin, near the Aviva stadium. It is also only a short walk to Sandymount village and strand. The village is lovely considering it is so near to Dublin.
Free parking, the room was in good condition, and the food  selection for breakfast  was good.we had a family room with three beds but would have been better if the double was 5' rather than 4'-6"".
We went to Kildare village and it only took 55 mins so it is very conveniently located.",4,2013,08,29
247,An enjoyable stay!,"my friends and I had a lovely time in this hotel. We were going to a concert at the Aviva so was great to be just walking distance away. Also very close to the city centre by use of the DART. The hotel itself is lovely and the staff were very helpful and welcoming, especially Emma on the reception desk.",5,2013,08,28
247,Very nice and comfortable,"We stayed in the Sandymount Hotel for three nights in August 2013. The hotel is large and spacious and the room was very nice. The bar and the terrace are very pleasant. The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. We had a small problem with our first bedroom but it was quickly solved.

The hotel is very close to the Dart station which was useful since Dublin buses were on strike... The hotel is about 200 meters from Aviva Stadium so it may be more hectic and difficult to get around when games are on.",4,2013,08,28
247,Wonderful place,The staff at the Sandymount are wonderful. They couldn't do enough to help us. The owner of the hotel even drove us to the ferry terminal himself. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. The train station is just around the corner for trips in to the centre of town and Sandymount Village is only 10 minutes walk away.,5,2013,08,27
247,Overdue Return,"I had neglected to return to this hotel as I had changed to Bewleys about 10 years ago but due to the deterioration in standards in that hotel I decided to re-visit the Sandymount and I was reminded of what I was missing. I booked online yet when I arrived the hotel had retrieved my details from my visit 10+ years previously. The Reception team were fantastic, helpful, efficient and yet devoted whatever time was required to check me in. I needed a document printed of about 20 pages and they printed it for me exactly as I requested, and later when a courier brought documents at 11pm they were delivered to me within minutes. The room was clean and comfortable, the Bar food was very tasty and served with a smile in a comfortable ambiance. From check-in to check-out the hotel and its staff extended a welcome that each and every 4 star hotel operator should sample, they might learn something.",5,2013,08,24
247,Sandymount Hotel came up trumos,We did an overnight on a flying visit to Dublin last Wednesday.  This is probably the 6th or 7th time we've stayed here.  Having had some difficulties whilst staying in a 6... something room back in April we were upgraded immediately to a suite and offered a free nights accommodation with breakfast for our next stay which we availed of June. I phoned the hotel late on last Wednesday evening to book. Arrived around 9.30 p.m. What a lovely surprise to be upgraded to a fabulous refurbished modern suite. The bed was at least king size plus and very comfy. Fab TV. Such a pity we could only stay for one night. We keep coming back to the Sandymount and are always disappointed when they are booked out. Only once did we have a negative experience which was addressed and attended to so quickly that our impression remains positive. Staff are lovely too. Well done to the Loughran family and staff for a running a great hotel in prime location and great value. We will be back soon,5,2013,08,23
247,Good Value,"The service and friendliness of the staff at the hotel was excellent. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Lots of nice sitting areas throughout the hotel. Very good Irish breakfast included.

Hotel shuttle included, to take you to the trains or Dart stations.",4,2013,08,23
247,Very good for a business stay!,"This is a very efficent, no nonsense place to spend a night near the RDS exhibition centre.

It is very reasonably priced for a Dublin City hotel.

Clean and quiet room, very good breakfast, I will come again!",4,2013,08,23
247,Great hotel in a lovely location,"As a regular visitor to Dublin the Sandymount is always my first choice. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The bedrooms are tastfully decorated and very comfortable and the breakfast is second to none. The hotel is situated in a lovely quite area of Dublin, convenient to the Aviva stadium, the RDS, the O2 and Bord Gais Theatre. The is free cark parking and wi-fi.",5,2013,08,20
247,Dependable and excellent value,"I stay in the Sandymount regularly on my trips to Dublin. It is excellent value. The front desk staff are very friendly and very efficient. Its location is perfect as it is a very pleasant walk along the Dodder River from our office. The walk takes in views of the new Aviva Stadium just across the way. The nearby Sandymount Beach is very pleasant for an evening stroll and Poolbeg is also within walking reach. There is a free car park for hotel users which is also very handy.

The rooms are always clean and well kitted-out, making for a comfortable stay. Breakfast is in a lovely room with big windows overlooking a garden full of flowers. Again, staff are very helpful. The breakfast buffet contains fresh fruit, cereals, juices, breads, pastries and a well presented hot food counter from which a full Irish breakfast can be selected. Very nice and peaceful all round to give a good start to the day. 

In the evenings, there is a fine menu served in the bar which is useful when I am too tired to venture out. Again, i is very good value.",4,2013,08,20
247,"Fantastic Location, Great Weekend!","I recently stayed in the Sandymount on the recommendation of a friend while visiting Dublin for Horseshow week. I was impressed by the wonderful warm welcome we received from Beatrice on reception....a little unsure of exactly where we were going she was exceptionally helpful and kind to us, recommending some local places we could see during our stay and kindly getting us a table in the hotel restaurant when we arrived late on Friday evening.

I would definately recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Dublin for the weekend, especially for its proximity to the Aviva, O2, Grand Canal Theatre and the Horse Show!",5,2013,08,20
247,A must for rugby fans!,"Brilliant hotel, the staff were extremely friendly, even met the hotel owner in the bar when he introduced himself and offered our 2 year old a lolly.

The hotel has plenty of car parking, and is large and spacious. The bar area is warm and friendly with a small terrace, from which you can just about see the Aviva Stadium. There is plenty to do in the surrounding area, and you are only a minute or two walk from the Stadium.

The food portions in the bar are absolutely huge, my wife had the scampi, this included 20-24 pieces of scampi, chips and a small side salad. It was all reasonably priced as were the drinks.

The room was a good size, with a bathroom (that was clean, but could have done with modernising).

We will certainly be staying here again if with ever return to Dublin.",5,2013,08,19
247,"So much potential, too many oddities","If location and/or price is what you are looking for, this place has it.  If you want a place that will take your breath away and add to your enjoyment while touring Dublin, this place is NOT it.  

What went wrong: We were excited to stay here after reading many positive reviews, and were happy not to break the bank for a 3-night 2-day stay.  When we showed up, our room (#609) had a horrible musty smell and the sheets felt damp.  Never mind the Shining-esque feel to the place, there were a handful of other not-so-great things about this place.  The toilet flusher was weird--you had to hold it down for a while. The room could use for an update.  The carpet covered an uneven floor.  The phone was not plugged in at all.  We asked the front desk the next morning about that and they said they would get it fixed, but did not before we left early Saturday morning for our flight.  Also, we asked the nightly front desk staff when the hop-on hop-off bus stop was in the morning, and the response we got was, ""I am not sure.  Maybe 9:50? Ask the desk during breakfast.""  The two stops were 8:40 and 9:40 and were listed in the pamphlet even!  We asked the same front desk about a conference that seemed to be happening that weekend, and again the answer was unhelpful: ""I don't know. We have a lot of conferences here.""  Note that the breakfast is extra (10 euros) and you can find better alternatives in the center of the city of Dublin.     

On the positives, the location was great (near the train station, a short cab ride from both the airport and the city, and a hop-on hop-off bus stop in the AM to get into the center of Dublin).  The room was somewhat clean and the bed was comfortable when not damp.  

Would we stay there again? Possibly, just because the price and location were good.  I would certainly be inclined to trying other options, however, given our mostly negative experience.  

PS-We are pretty sure the maid pooped in our toilet and didn't flush after we complained about the damp smell in our room. (A nice ""present"" to come home to.)  We were too flabbergasted by the incident to inform the front desk.",2,2013,08,18
247,Fantastic hotel in a great location with AMAZING staff!,"We booked this hotel at the last minute and we are so glad we did! The staff were so friendly, always ready to help and couldn't have done anymore to make our stay any better! The hotel manager was also really nice and took the time to advise us on some places of interest and generally make sure everything was going ok and the lovely reception staff gave our son a lollypop or two which kept him happy! Our room was a great size for us and our little one, they have a great breakfast and a lovely bar area that does nice food! 
The hotel is 2 mins around the corner from the Dart and either 2 or 3 stops to the centre of Dublin. Heading out of the centre on the DART to the Sealife Centre in Bray is 20 mins along the coast which only cost 5.80 euros return! 

We will definitely go back!",5,2013,08,15
247,Will definitely return for a third visit,"Stayed here a few years ago with my husband and for a recent trip to Dublin in July 2013 we decide to return. Absolutely delighted that we did. its a fantastic hotel and we had a wonderful stay. 

We arrived early and didnt expect a room to be ready, were only going to leave our bags in luggage store and head into town but not only was there a room ready they gave us an executive room which was a wonderful bonus! Check in was fast and staff very very helpful. The room was lovely, very clean, comfortable and well appointed. Not much of a view from the window but that didnt bother us. The mattress was very hard but nothing we couldnt live with. The only thing I would mention is that they have no air con. In normal Irish weather this probably wouldnt be a problem but in the freak heat wave the heat was unreal!

Our stay coincided with the recent heatwave that Ireland had so we were able to have lunch on the balcony off the bar. They also have a lovely garden at the rear of the premises with lots of tables for eating outdoors. Lunch was lovely.

headed into the city centre then, there is a  DART station about 3 minutes walk away. that coupled with the free parking the hotel provides guests make this a gem of a location. If you are heading to a function in town, the aviva, anywhere near ballsbridge or to shows in the O2 etc etc this location is fine.

Didnt have dinner in the hotel this time, we strolled up to Ballsbridge and had something there (lots of options for food and drink there). breakfast the next morning was fine - not a huge selection but it was fresh, fine and timely served.

All in all would highly recommend.",5,2013,08,15
247,nice,"Far to walk to downtown but the BART's just down the block.
The neighbourhood's quiet and we felt safe wandering the streets after the sun went down and the lamplights came on.

Comfortable basic room with maze-like hallways to navigate (annoying when you've been on your feet all day wandering the city - but really cool when we weren't so tired considering the history of the building(s).

Staff at the front desk and restaurant were top notch.  We got extra help when we discovered the rental car we'd arranged for had more than tripled in cost.  The front desk helped us find another solution - Thank you!!!",4,2013,08,14
247,Handy spot to stay,"The Sandymount is close to the Dart and so easy to get into the city centre.  We travelled easilt into the city centre.  The hotel is a favourite with rugby supporters.  Good value, we'll will stay again.
      ",3,2013,08,14
247,Comfort and caring staff,"I have stayed in this hotel many times and the reason is..........
Comfortable clean bedrooms
 Breakfast of juices, cereals, bread, rolls, preserves, hot food and tea, coffee etc
Informative, friendly and very helpful staff
A short pleasant walk by a river to bus service to the centre of Dublin
Quiet location
Extensive safe car park in the hotel grounds for guests only.",4,2013,08,13
247,"Great location, comfortable amenities","We were introduced to this hotel through our travel company, Exploring Ireland.  It was our last night of the 7 day tour and at first, seemed a little less than what we were used to.  But when I inquired about my last two days here (I waited till I got to Ireland before I picked the last two nights, I was relieved to discover my stay here would be considerably less than any other hotel I found on several internet booking sites, so I booked my last to nights here.  When I came back three days later after the rest of my family had left, I discovered it is in a very quaint neighborhood which includes Ballsbridge and Sandymount, which also includes the U.S. Embassy.  The hotel consists of 8 interconnected Victorian houses which were originally constructed in 1866, and were built with bricks from an old distillery that manufactured the first Scotch Whiskey in Ireland.  It is located only minutes from the DART Station for the local stadium, and it is only three stops into downtown Dublin.  I am amazed that consolidating 8 former homes into what is now 168 rooms, each with its own en suite bathroom, works so well.  The bar and restaurant area have a private little back yard perfectly suited for weddings or other social functions.  The  staff were gracious with every question I had, and I would rate this hotel, for the price I paid, Excellent.",5,2013,08,12
247,Fantastic,The room we stayed in was room 607 Myself and partner and two kids stayed for two nights from 10 august.we came to watch the liverpool v celtic game.the reason we stayed at the sandymount was location.the aviva is a two minute walk and train station/dart is next to the aviva.the staff at the sandymount were top class. from the desk staff to the foreign porter who delivered the travel cot for baby who noticed we didnt have enough bedding in wardrobe for baby and in his words not acceptable.he came back with bedding within minutes which i was very inpressed with considering how busy hotel was with everybody checking in.a special mention for the female asian waitress with glasses who seen us standing trying to get a table in the bar to no avail who went out of her way to finally get us a table for food prior to the match kicking off and was very freindly with my kids especially with baby never stopped working anytime we saw her very inpressed.will be back at sandymount hotel very soon,4,2013,08,12
247,best hotel in Ireland,"WE have just spent two  fantastic days in this hotel and can honestly say we believe it to be the best value for money hotel in Ireland We travelled for the match between celtic  and liverpool without realising that the Dublin horse-show 

was taking place at the same time,BUT I have to  say that all  the staff were fantastic in dealing  with the extra  guests for the duration of our stay; In particular I must give a special mention  """" ROSE """"  who seemed to be on hand morning noon and night at everyones  beck and call  . Nothwas too much trouble for her and indeed  she seemed  to be able to see problems in advance ;many thanks for a great  enjoyable week-end and we will be back as soon as possible ; BERNIE and DES",5,2013,08,11
247,Suited me perfectly,"I stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting the Dublin Horse Show in Aug 2013.  The foyer and reception areas are all very modern and tastefully decorated - I must say a lovely bright comfortable place to sit with a glass of wine with another smaller room just off Reception also.  I agree with a previous review that the bedrooms are a little less modern than the hotel reception areas however my room (545) was perfectly clean and whilst maybe not as modern as the reception areas it was far from dated and served my purpose perfectly well.  The breakfast choices were the usual full cooked or continental and the food was excellent.  I didn't have dinner there but if the breakfasts are anything to go by they'll 100% fine.  The Hotel is exceptionally close to the Aviva Stadium (2/3 mins walk) and about 5 mins walk to Landsdowne Dart Station so very handy for commute to the RDS or into the city centre.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and more than happy to store my expensive camera equip in a secure location until I collected it.  All in all, I was very happy with my stay in the Sandymount Hotel and yes I will definitely be back.",4,2013,08,10
247,Great Hotel for exploring Dublin or doing business.,"Stayed here on a short business trip to the city recently. The hotel is conveniently located next to the Aviva Stadium and a short taxi ride from the new modern docklands business district (in fact, we walked from the hotel to meetings most days). The reception and bar area are modern and good on the eye - I got the feel that the hotel has been recently modernised and has a boutique feel about it. There are lots of nice quiet areas dotted around the hotel and we had a couple of meetings with clients here which was an added bonus. My room was much larger than I expected and offered great comfort at the end of some long days. My colleagues were also equally impressed by the level of service and friendly smiles from staff who looked after us very well. I had a great lunch in the bar area on the day of arrival and Beatrice on reception informed me of the history of the hotel and it's rugby heritage. They have a pretty cool large bronze statue out the front of a ""line-out"" that they seem very proud of! I'll definitely be back when next in Dublin.",5,2013,08,08
247,Lovely location,"On our first trip to Dublin, my husband, daughter and I stayed at the Sandymount hotel.  We were pleased with the comfortable beds and overall cleanliness of the room.  I did find the Wifi arrangement strange though.  You have to request a new password paper at the desk each day.  Couldn't a universal password be shared with guests?  Just a minor inconvenience though.  Staff was accommodating, but I would have appreciated a warmer reception when we arrived before check-in after a long flight from Philadelphia.  Overall a nice experience.",4,2013,08,07
247,Functional at best - Will not stay again!,"Once you get past the well appointed entrance and stylish reception area/bar and restaurant you are greeted with tired corridors leading to even more tired looking rooms. Our room 541 (avoid like the plague if you can) was on the first floor next to a noisy lift and the cleaning team's cupboard which they would bash open and closed at 5am every day while you where trying to sleep. The rooms styling minimalistic to say the least barely had enough space for a table and tiny tv. We were somewhat disappointed with the grotty bathroom which was littered with broken tiles leaking fittings and was too small to use. While we were offered free wifi it was through a partner which meant registering with them and imputing a code from reception for every 24hrs that you wanted to use it. The only thing going for this hotel is its location which was 5mins into the centre on the DART and had the hop on hop off bus stop right outside.

I imagine if you where in town to see the rugby and just wanting somewhere cheap to crash this would be suitable but I would't be staying here again even for that!",2,2013,08,07
247,Short family break,"Stayed in the Sandymount from the 29th-31st July.
As we had landed into Dublin early in the Morning, we were able to leave our luggage with reception which was pretty handy.
The hotel is very close to the Aviva stadium and the DART is about a 2-3 minute walk. 
We were able to purchase a family all day ticket for 15 euro's which can get you into the centre of Dublin 
We got checked in at 3pm and the room we were given was very spacious and clean. The room also had tea and coffee facilities. 
One small criticism would be that there were insufficient towels for a family of 3, however we were supplied with clean towels every day so its not to much of a problem.
Free wifi was available which is very handy when you have 14 year old who is constantly on  social networking sites ;)
There was ample variety of breakfast provided at a cost of 8-10 euros pppd. All very fresh and good quality.
First morning of breakfast, John the owner introduced himself and asked about our trip. This was a nice personal touch which i'm sure everyone appreciated.
All in all I would highly recommend this hotel, comfy bed, clean sheets, room serviced daily and good food. 
Until the next time! :)
Keep up the good work Sandymount!!",4,2013,08,01
247,Lovely break,"Came across this hotel when looking for a zoo package.  Booked a two night stay which included a family pass for the zoo.  The trip was for a family of four so was excellent value. Our room had a double and two single beds which was good because some of the other hotels wanted me to book a second room or the kids would have been on a sofa bed. There was a good choice for breakfast and all the staff we had contact with were helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is near the aviva stadium and is 2 or 3 stops on the dart from the centre of town depending on where u want to go. The hotel seemed to have plenty of parking and what i liked most was it was nice and peaceful.  There is no leisure centre but there is a school nearby and i believe guests of the hotel may be able to avail of there swimming pool. We did eat in the bar which has basic bar food such as fish and chips, burgers and chips etc and these were reasonable enough. Overall a good trip and i would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2013,07,31
247,I would stay here again!,"We really enjoyed our stay. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel had everything we needed. It was a good location to the city with easy access to public transportation, or free parking if you have a car. Great overall experience!",5,2013,07,31
247,"REVIEW OF SANDY MOUNT HOTEL,DUBLIN","The Sandymount Hotel in Dublin was a good experience, in a fine part of Dublin and  an impressive exterior as a building.  However inside was complicated and confusing.  The building had obviously been extended several times and the floor plan was difficult to find your way around.  The room was a neat,tidy and clean but a little too small.  The dining room was adequate and the meals served of reasonable quality.  The overiding impressive factor at this hotel was the friendly, co-operative and helpful nature of the staff.  They were excellent and duly accommodated our need to rise extremely early to catch a flight at Dublin airport.  An impressive hotel with fantastic staff to tend to your every need.",4,2013,07,31
247,It was all right,"Me and my partner stayed there recently, for 2 nights. It was quiet hard to find a hotel, but probably because we got off at the bus stop, which was kind of far from the hotel. We arrived 2 hours before check-in and had to wait around 1.5 hrs for our room to be ready. At first we got a room number 142, which was definitely not looking like at the photos - a poor shelf with kettle on it, too big wardrobe with really small TV on it, pretty old bathroom and just one seat - I asked for another room, which wasn't a problem at all. At the end, we got a room that we wanted, which was far better, but I still think that bathrooms could do with some updating. The whole 142 room was the only one minus really. The hotel is located literally 3 mins walk to the train station (6 mins on train to the city centre), free wi-fi is good, the staff is friendly and helpful and the food in their bar was amazing, really really good! Overall I think I would consider staying there again, because the price was fair, however, as I said, bathrooms could do with some updating.",3,2013,07,30
247,Great location but small room!,"This is a decent hotel with a large reception area and some very nice seating sections for relaxing. I only had breakfast in the hotel and it was fine. The staff were helpful and friendly. I was disappointed with the room however. I was staying on level 1 and my room was tiny! There was just enough space for the bed and cabinets and it was a little cramped. Perhaps rooms on other floors are larger so it may be worth checking this when booking. We did have a problem on our first night as a group on our corridor decided to party into the wee small hours, including playing music! We got very little sleep. Security did eventually deal with it and there were no problems fir the remainder of our stay. This is a clean and serviceable hotel at a reasonable price.",4,2013,07,30
247,Could be better,"Friendly and helpful staff. Good location. Free parking. Nice bar and lounge areas. Let down by the room which was a bit tired and had a very small bathroom. Room very hot, even at night and difficult to cool even with window open. Overpriced at EUR 107 per night for the room.",3,2013,07,28
247,Lovely stay at Sandymount Hotel,"I had a lovely stay at The Sandymount Hotel. Staff were very friendly and accomidating. Nothing was to much trouble and they were always will to help. 
Rooms were lovely, room service was good. 
Lovely location, close enough to the city centre. 
Beautiful hotel and surrounding. 
Would reccomend to everyone and anyone planning a trip to Dublin.",5,2013,07,26
247,Perfect for O2 arena and aviva stadium - out of the way for main attractions,"Stayed here for one night to see Michael Buble. 

Hotel was ok for price. 
Found medication (not ours ) on carpet upon arrival and papers under the bed. Also the shower was cold in the morning - however warmed up by the 3rd person in out party using it. Kettle did not work either, had loose connection and had to sit cup on top of kettle for it to charge.

Location is ideal for visiting the O2 or Aviva stadium although it quite out the way for city centre dublin. About 10 minute walk from hotel to bus stop. However we walked from hotel to city centre which took about 30 minutes. 

Hotel provides 02 shuttle bus however its 3 euros per person and we got a taxi for 10 euro so depends on your party size. 

We did not have breakfast as it was too pricy - instead we had brunch in Temple Bar area. 
All in all, its an ok hotel for short stay when visiting the O2 or Aviva stadium.",3,2013,07,25
247,"Nice hotel,Friendly service, reasonable price","Myself and my wife stayed at the Sandymount hotel between the 21st and 23rd July and I was pleasantly surprised by the personal friendly service we both received. The room was a decent size and the beds comfortable. A bath was included in the en suite which was welcome, the room was clean and tea and coffee provided. The hotel was a short distance from the Dart and is close to the Aviva stadium. Thanks to the staff for a personal, friendly and efficient service.",5,2013,07,25
247,A decent hotel in Dublin at a reasonable price,"Stayed here recently and I have to say I was really impressed, given that the price was so reasonable. This hotel is in the leafy Dublin suburbs and yet it is convenient to the city centre, stadium, transport links etc. The parking facilities in this hotel really impressed me for the following reasons:
1) FREE private parking
2) Loads of parking spaces
3) Secure parking
Ate in the hotel also and the food was superb, would highly recommend this hotel as alot of hotels in Dublin are overpriced and charge for crap parking!",4,2013,07,24
247,Wonderful experience!,"The Sandymount Hotel was a wonderful part of our trip to Ireland.  It is located in a quiet residential neighborhood within a short walking distance to the Dart.  Also the ""Hop on Hop off"" bus made pickups there in the morning which was very convenient for access to the various tourist attractions in Dublin. The staff at the Sandymount were all very welcoming and helpful with anything that was needed. They arranged ""Take Away"" breakfasts for us on the two mornings that we needed to leave before the breakfast hour.  One evening we returned from a tour a short time after the dinner hour and they fixed us a delicious meal in the Bar/Restaurant. The rooms were neat and clean.  We would highly recommend the Sandymount to anyone traveling to Dublin.",5,2013,07,24
247,Great experience!,"I stayed at the Sandymount Hotel July 12-21, 2013. I am greatly impressed with the customer service. The ladies at the front desk (Emily, Siobhan, Beatrice, and a few others who's names I was unable to attain) were all extremely helpful and very personable. They were quick to provide anything I needed and even offered to have Tea and Toast brought to my room before service hours because I wasn't feeling well. Their knowledge of the area and tourist information was abundant and they were always giving of their time to help draw me a map of where I was needing to travel.  The service staff in the dinning room was excellent. Everyone was very nice and had great customer service. Although I was a little confused when it took a long time to bring the check, I soon realized the cultural difference and was able to adapt to asking for my check being that they are not rushing you out the way it is in my home city.  If ever I return to Ireland I would stay with them again.",5,2013,07,23
247,A warm welcome,"I have regularly been using the hotel over the last 3 months and have to say the reception team are fantastic.  Indeed, a special mention goes out to Beatrice and Siobhan, they are welcoming, warm and efficient; nothing is too much hassle.  After a long journey into Dublin it makes all the difference.

Thanks",4,2013,07,23
247,Well managed hotel in a safe area,"Just stayed in the SM hotel on a Saturday overnight stay.

The hotel is lovely. First impressions are, FREE PARKING, clean grounds, friendly reception staff, clean room and good restaurant. 

It's really good to see a hotel that actually works properly. Beatrice in reception and Sylvia in the restaurant are the two obvious ones to take a pat on the back every day they go to work as they are ""front of house"", but you get the feeling that from the top down, the staff of the Sandymount Hotel are thoroughly professional. 

The (inexpensive) food comes out of the kitchen with a 10 out of 10 rating, the bar staff keep the bar in a gleaming condition, and interact well with the customers, the beer garden is a manicured lawn, and elsewhere the lobby/corridors are immaculate etc etc. 

They could give lessons to many other places I've stayed.",4,2013,07,22
247,It's the best for business and pleasure,"This is a delightful hotel. The reception is managed by Beatrice and she looks after your every need from newspapers to taxies to recommending a good restaurant. This is the type of service I like but seldom get in other hotels. As a businessman I travel a lot and wish this service could be replicated in other hotels but its not. The trick here is that's a family run establishment. I recently arrived on an early morning flight from New York, Rose who looks after the rooms had one arranged for me within ten minutes. Just superb service and excellent prices .... Long may it continue.....and let others learn from the Sandymount..",5,2013,07,21
247,Perfect,"We stayed here for a concert in O2...without actually realising how easy it is to walk to the O2.
We walked there and back. Easy.

The hotel is well run. We ate on the Terrace before the concert, in the sun. It was great... and the Cookie desert was superb. One other customer even came over asking about it, due to the glass jar presentation. My wife had the waffle, and loved. The main courses were also great.
Overall the stay was very enjoyable & easy. The staff were great. Handy parking. We'll be back.",5,2013,07,21
247,Business Meeting and BBQ,"I recently booked the Sandymount Hotel for an internal business meeting followed by food and drinks. Our budget was tight, we had only 2 weeks to book something and it had to be local to our office in Dublin 4. 

I had never been to the Sandymount Hotel before, but I asked for a quote from them as well as some of the more well known venues in this area (Herbert Park Hotel, Four Seasons etc). 

The hotel is set on a quite residential road close to the Aviva Stadium in Dublin 4. It has a garden to the rear - unusual in Dublin and ideal for parties, BBQs, communions etc. - and free parking. Another rare commodity in a city hotel. 

The decor is to a high standard at the entrance and main reception areas. The room to the right of reception is impressive and would be perfect for a civil ceremony if you were so inclined. The bar has a 70's retro feel to it which I wasn't that keen on.. and the garden stole the show. 

My meeting was held in the largest room they had (I had 50 people in the meeting), and met our needs perfectly. It was a very warm day, and the air conditioning struggled to keep temperatures lower than 25 degrees, but the hotel staff brought in extra fans which helped a little. There wasn't any more they could do. 

Tea coffee scones and biscuits were the refreshments on offer during the meeting. And a BBQ in the garden followed. The hotel had everything well organised with plenty of staff and attention to detail. I felt we were important to them and nothing I asked was too much. That gave me a warm feeling that they would work as hard as me to have a successful event. And they did. 

There was plenty to choose from on the menu when making the booking, and my guests complimented the quality and range of the food at the BBQ. 

Costs were more reasonable than other Hotels in the area and the location was perfect for us. The high standard of service and food will make me look at the Sandymount Hotel for similar events. 

My only reservation in using the hotel for customer events, is that the quality of the large meeting rooms is not as high as I would like. It's not 5 star, and therefore with the exception of the garden doesn't offer anything terribly special. There isn't a wow factor. It's a functional,  practical and pleasant environment for meetings. The food is good and costs are reasonable. 

I would use them again and would recommend you have a look at what they offer before booking your next event.",4,2013,07,21
247,Sandymount hotel Dublin,"Excellent family run hotel. Welcome and service second to none. Super base for exploring Dublin, going to concerts in O2  - hotel supplied bus to venue - also close to Sandymount village and sea front. Food very good and well priced. We will definitely be back for the rugby as it is 5 mins from the Aviva. Well done to all at the Sandymount.",5,2013,07,21
247,'Stayed here for Buble in the o2',"The hotel is spotless clean, bar food is very good and staff very friendly & efficient. My wife & I were out for a long overdue good night out with the Buble gig and a stay over in the hotel & were disappointed that there is no residents bar after 12.30pm.. not that we would've had the energy to stay up 'til dawn.. but a couple of cold beers after walk from the  O2 gig would've been a good end to the night.. good value for the location, but might try another hotel if lucky enough to have the opportunity for a similar night away again.",3,2013,07,20
247,trip to michael buble,stayed here on the 19th july for the michael buble concert an absolute joy from start to finish the staff were very helpful and the setting absolutely fantastic . a lovely spot to stay in dublin the beer gardens were immaculate and the food was gorgeous .. on return to the hotel from the concert we decided to order a takeaway to the room the night porter who i neglected to get his name was so helpful and made it a pleasure for us .. many thanks to all involved and i would highly recommend this hotel as we will be using it again on our visit to dublin ...,5,2013,07,19
247,Excellent Hotel for Events,"We recently stayed at the Sandymount whilst attending a concert at the O2, it has an excellent position for events 5 minutes walk to the Aviva and 20 minutes walk to the O2. With the Dart only 5 minutes away and 2 Euros single fare to Dublin City centre it couldn't be easier. Sandymount village is 10 minutes walk away with village green, pub and restaurants, 5 minutes further and your at Sandymount Beach. Will definitely stay again",5,2013,07,19
247,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is probably one if the nicest I've stayed in. It was my first time and definitely not my last. I booked the hotel for myself and my mum, we arrived after a long drive from the north and were greeted with friendly staff who made us feel welcome. The receptionist asked if we were attending the Michael Buble concert and informed us of the complimentary shuttle bus they were running to the O2 arena which we thought was excellent customer service. Later that evening we had dinner in the bar followed by a few drinks and again the customer service was great, the staff couldn't do enough for us. Whilst waiting for the bus, we were approached by John the owner of the hotel who introduced himself and took the time to welcome us to his hotel.

Thank you so much for your great hospitality, we will definitely be back to stay in the very near future :)
Hannah & Finola",5,2013,07,18
247,Charming with excellent service,"I recently stayed with my partner at the Sandymount Hotel. This was our first time in Dublin and so we really did not know what to expect. We were not disappointed. 

Our first impression of the hotel was very positive when they allowed us to check in several hours before we were scheduled to arrive. The buffet breakfast that is offered is well worth the additional 10 euro. The food is tasty and a great cure for jet lag. It is also all-you-can-eat, which was most appealing to my hungry travel-companion. 

The Sandymount Hotel is located an easy walking distance from the local DART station. From there it is quite easy to get to the city. The hotel staff were very helpful in pointing out the different options for exploring Dublin from the hotel. The hotel provides free access to wifi, which conveniently also works in a few places throughout the city. 

The building is fairly old- we had a minor issue with the plumbing in our bathroom- but the service was incredible and the hotel staff were very quick to answer questions and fix problems quickly and without fuss. 

Ultimately we found the Sandymount hotel very comfortable and accomodating.",4,2013,07,17
247,Nice hotel but remote from town,"This hotel is just two steps away from the Aviva Stadium so good choice if you attend an event there. Hotel was nice enough even if this is an old building, it is quite charming actually, I arrived very early in the morning and staff was very friendly and upgraded me to a nicer room as well. Free wifi, food at the restaurant and breakfast is good, beautiful garden. 
Note this hotel is quite far away from city centre.",4,2013,07,17
247,home away from home,"The Sandy mount hotel is the prefect place for a break or a weekday work stop over. The staff are friendly and relaxed and the bar and resturaunt food is delicious with a lovely varied menu to suite all tastes. Its location just minutes walk from Sandymmount strand makes for a pleasant outdoor walk, often hard to find with most city hotels. Its a lovely hotel to return to after a long day at work and the bar and food is a lovely welcome treat at the end of the day!",5,2013,07,15
247,A fine hotel,Although the rooms were small the overall experience was good. Staff were helpfully and polite. Common areas were spacious and well appointed. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the DART and Sandymount village. I would definitely stay here again.,4,2013,07,14
247,Great place to stay,"This is my 17th visit to the hotel.  From the days when it was the Mt Herbert.

The name changed, but the hotel/ service didn't. It is a wonderful hotel.

Staff is most friendly, service is efficient and prompt, food is excellent.  After a busy day, the bar is a great place to relax.

Location so close to DART is most convenient, and it is one of a very few hotels in Dublin offering free wi- fi and free parking.

I rate it most highly, and would never stay anyplace else in Dublin",5,2013,07,14
247,"Great location, lovely place","So this was our first trip with a toddler and we wanted a hotel that met all our needs. This was the place. It's located in Sandymount, Dublin 4, 15 mins away from downtown Dublin by train or a nice walk of 20 mins. Big hotel with friendly staff. Lovely bar with good food and a nice terrace. Good quality-price ratio. The room was big enough with one big bed and a single one (and a crib), a TV (a bit small for the size of the room), table and chairs and a bathroom with a bathtub. Easy access to the hotel, as I said by train, taxi or walking. We didn't try the breakfast buffet because there is plenty choice in the Sandymount village nearby (less than 10 mins walk, lovely place with great cafes). Reasonably quiet at night (but be aware of the Aviva stadium, literally next door, because if there is a concert, (which happens a lot) it gets loud and busy as well). Has free wifi on a 24h renewal of password basis which works quite well, even outside. It is reasonably priced, compared others in the area. 
Info for parents: we asked in advance for a crib and they delivered it for us along with sheets, pillow and a blanket for it. Also asked in advance for a room on the ground floor and they did give it to us. Its entrance comes after a frightening set of stairs, but don't worry, it has an elevator by the parking lot outside that takes you upstairs with your pushchair. They will heat up anything you need for your baby and they are quite friendly with them. Only thing, the bar has a set of four steps and no ramp so you will need help getting pushchairs up to it. And also, ask for a room on the ground floor, it's a big place with lots of corridors and elevators and it's not easy to manouver with a child. I found it a good place to go with a child. If we come back, this will be our first option.",4,2013,07,13
247,"Comfortable stay and a close walk for work, train and stadium","I had the great opportunity to travel to Dublin for work recently, and the company we were meeting with recommended this hotel as we could actually walk to their office. What a great, quirky hotel. You can quickly tell it is comprised of several once detached but now attached buildings, and there are many twists and turns (and stairs) to find your room. Once you have the path to your room figured out, don't deviate from the plan or you might not find it again!

Understanding that rooms are a bit different than what we are accustomed to in  North America, I can definitely say the room provided everything I needed. It was clean, though relatively sparse furnishing wise. Hair dryer, coffee maker, cable tv - check, check, and check. 

We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning, and the full Irish breakfast buffet was a great start to the day. The speed of the service for coffee was a bit to be desired, but we were able to get out of the hotel on time each morning. We ate dinner in the hotel a couple of nights as well, and have no complaints about the food quality or service. Even on our final night when a concert was taking place at the nearby Aviva Staudium and the place was totally overrun, we were able to get served quickly. 

The management of the hotel has a family like feel to it. If I ever had the chance to get back to Dublin to visit the same client, I'd stay here again with no concern.",4,2013,07,12
247,Quirky but individual,"We stayed at The Sandymount because the hotel has a substantial car park for guests and it is close to a Dart station for easy travel into the City Centre. It takes time to get acquainted with the interior lay-out, but the staff are all very pleasant and the hotel has some Irish charm in a city where most hotels are ""international."" Breakfast was very good.",4,2013,07,12
247,Sandymount,"I visit Dublin regularly and always book into the Sandymount.  It is all I want  from a hotel, clean, good food and the staff are very helpful and friendly.  Having stayed at other hotels I now always book the Sandymount.  A very happy customer.",5,2013,07,12
247,"Pleasant staff, but not what I expected","This was our first stop after coming in from the states at 5am, and not having had any sleep in 36 hours.   We arrived at the hotel and asked if there was any chance that we could have an early check in.  The staff was extremely pleasant, understanding, and very accommodating.  My daughter was a bit ill, and we were very thankful that they provided us with a room to rest.   They were also very helpful in directing us to various areas, allowing us to remain parked in their lot after checkout, calling for cabs -- just very helpful.  We also had the pleasure of meeting the owner when we were checking out the following day and he was very friendly and wanted to make sure that we had a pleasant stay.    I will say that the reason for the average rating had quite a bit to do with the quality of the breakfast/food, and the room.  We happened to pick the one week of the year where it was in the 70's-80's.  The room was quite hot with no air conditioning.  Now, I will say that Ireland seems to never get heat like this so I can completely understand why the hotel would not be equipped with A/C.  However, the availability of a fan or two would have made all of the difference.  I will say that this was the norm during our stay in Ireland, but I will be providing that suggestion across the board to all of the B&Bs that we have stayed I also found the tub/shower a bit dangerous.  Thankfully, there was a handle, but the slip guards on the floor of the tub had been worn and the result was that the tub was quite slippery and dangerous.  Another issue that we had was that this  location was too far off the beaten path for our liking.  I did not consider the location with this rating as I was very clear with the travel agent what we were looking for and this didn't really meet our request.  However, not the fault of Sandymount!    Overall, our stay was pleasant enough and I have to say that the people made it enjoyable.",3,2013,07,11
247,Very comfortable,"Spent one night and enjoyed the stay.  Room very clean and reception staff friendly and helpful.
Even though we had a car it was just as easy to leave it parked at the hotel and catch the train into the city centre.  The station was only 5 minutes walk away.

The place had a cosy feel to it.",4,2013,07,05
247,Sandymount,"Our family of 3 stayed there twice, at both ends of our journey. For this price range, this hotel was above the others: clean, modern and comfortable. The staff were friendly and efficient, helping us with other connections, and there is a restaurant and bar onsite. A bonus feature was the location: away from downtown, but a 5 minute walk to the Dart station, from where the whole of downtown was easily available to us.",5,2013,07,04
247,Success at last,I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights.  It was clean with the bed and bed linen was of good quality. The hotel is quite and the staff friendly and helpful.  The dining room was well lite and inviting and the breakfast was very good.  This was my first time to stay there and I would return,4,2013,07,04
247,First visit,"Excellent location, hotel breakfast is excellent also dinner menu, rooms cleaned regularly and staff are  all very pleasant nothing is to much trouble to them, as I was working in the Aviva stadium it only took approx. 4mins which was great, woulf definitely recommend this hotel and I also would return.",5,2013,07,02
247,First visit with our 5 month old,"Friendly service from all hotel staff, good clean spacious room and close to the RDS. We ate in the bar area for dinner, food was good and reasonably priced. Breakfast was adequate. Yes I would return.",4,2013,06,30
247,2nd visit,"Just back from an over night stay at the Sandymount Hotel after booking with Lidl breaks, great value. We've stayed here before when it was the Mount Herbert. We were heading to a show in the Olympia Theater to see The Real McCoy,if you get a chance to see it, it's well worth it, great laugh, great acting. With the dart station near by its a great facility & lovely way to travel into the city. Free parking at the hotel is always a great plus.
 
At check in was asked if I wanted to pay now, I said no that I'd pay at check out. She took my credit card details etc. I wanted to see what the room was like first. Never been asked to pay like that before.  Our room was Executive 406 very nice, crisp white linen, dressing gowns, bottled water, lovely toiletries + disposable razor and shaving cream nice touch. No view but didn't mind that.  I didn't sleep well, I could hear snoring next door,It was like it was in the room with us, only thing I wish I could have told them to shut up.

We had evening meal before heading off. Seafood Chowder & Caesar Salad were lovely. Had battered smoked fish + chips. Didn't like the wooden plate it was served on, but that's  me, I would always prefer clean white plates. Deserts were lovely. Daniel & Jessie were very nice in the bar.

Breakfast was self service, which was very nice with plenty of choice. Would have liked a pot of coffee rather than filling the cup at the table.

we will be back.",5,2013,06,29
247,Sandmount Hotel Dublin,"Hotel staff were very friendly, food in bar excellent breakfast was included which again was excellent hotel was clean near to Dublin centre, Dart railway was around the corner from the hotel
which goes to Bray and Howth",4,2013,06,29
247,Lovely stay,"I went for a weekend break with my husband , my siblings and their  spouses . I can honestly say there is nothing bad I can say about our stay. The rooms were lovely and spacious  . The staff were all very helpful and the food  was  great.  I would definitely stay here again. The location was also very suitable as it was in a nice quiet area but still within walking distance of the train station .",5,2013,06,25
247,absolute delight,Hotel staff wer very nice and helpful bar was great crack only complaint room could have been a bit nicer i think the carpet in the hall and room wer a bit old fashioned. Overall great stay would definatly be adviceing this hotel to friends.,5,2013,06,25
247,very plesant stay,"stayed here for the concert of robbie Williams, we had booked this hotel a very long time before we knew he would give a concert so we payed a very good price for the rooms. the hotel is very close to the aviva stadion and also close to the train station. The rooms are very nice and you have everything you need. Reception were very nice and helpt us well with all the questions that we had. we will return to this hotel",4,2013,06,25
247,RIP OFF REPUBLIC,"Hi just cancelled my stay here for sat 29th June, as I stayed here in September  to attend lady Gaga concert, it cost 179 euro, Now they have put the price up to 249 euro per night ,for the Rod Stewart concert... GREEDY, TOTAL DISGRACE,AND A MAJOR CASE OF RIP OF IRELAND ....The hotel itself is of an ok  standard ,You are paying 5 star prices for  2 star accommodation, is in a great location, if attending Aviva stadium....But by know way worth the money..Much nicer places to stay in the area  or get the dart from the city...would not recommend !!!!!",3,2013,06,24
247,Okay but there is better in the area,"First time I've stayed here, and I was quite impressed by the exterior. Unfortunately the interior doesn't quite match up, with staff on check-in 'distracted' and quite offhand. The room I stayed in would be best described as 'tired' with a little more attention to cleaning needed, particularly in the bathroom. Overall, it's okay for a night or two, but there are vastly superior hotels in the same price range in the area, so this was a bit of a let down.",3,2013,06,24
247,4th stay here!!!!,I have stayed in the Sandymount Hotel 4 times now. The hotel is in a lovely part of the city and very close to the center about 10 euro in a taxi. The hotel offers a shuttle bus when various events are on for a very small fee. I walked down to Sandymount Village within a matter of minutes. Highly recommend the hotel. Reception are lovely and very helpful.,5,2013,06,23
247,Stayed over with my 3 kids,"Hi,

I cant sing the praises of this hotel enough.  Without a doubt you would know it was a family hotel.  The staff are absolutely amazing and so helpful. My daughter had broken her foot a couple of days before we arrived and they literally couldn't have done enough to help us.  Food is divine and rooms are beautiful   The staff in this hotel is an absolute credit to the owners.  I would highly recommend this hotel everyone

thks for a great stay.",5,2013,06,22
247,Great hotel,"Weve now stayed in this hotel 3 times, it's based in the lovely location of sandymount, very close to the Aviva stadium and  road dart stadium. It's roughly 30 minutes walk to st Stephens green and grafton street, however if you want a quiter night it's just ten minute walk from sandymount village including Marios restaurant and the (well worth a visit) Ryan's pub. On our most recent visit we were based on the lower floor, the room was clean and had all the basics you would expect. The only  criticisms I have were when we arrived the receptionist was friendly but weaid in cash and she didnt give us a receipt we had to ask. the hair dryer which looks like it hasn't been updated since the mid 90s (it was very slow and if you put it on a higher temp it cut off after 2 minutes and took ages to cool again) I only have short hair but if you've got longer hair I'd suggest bringing your own or allowing an hour or so to dry! Also the 2nd night the hot water in our room didn't seem to work which was a shame as the shower when it did work was excellent! Despite these three minor things highly recommended!",4,2013,06,20
247,Disorganized,"Disappointing stay, characterised by inefficient and disinterested service.  Check-in took 5 minutes while the only receptionist dealt with a customer on the phone.  Hot food service stopped at 9:30, and at 9:35 I was offered no alternatives.  Nasty keg Guinness and peanuts for dinner !  An argument at breakfast as to whether it was included or not - it certainly wasn't worth paying for, and the service was downright chaotic. ""That man needs a cup ... remind me, was it coffee you wanted?""  Oh, and the lift was broken.  I won't be back.",3,2013,06,20
247,warm welcoming,"Stayed there recently with a group (Wikinger) from Germany. Hotel staff very efficient and friendly. Room clean and quiet. Beds and pillows guaranteed excellent sleep. B/F very good, although buffet area can get a bit crowdy when several groups are staying. Staff, however, very helpful to sort it out.
Location of hotel in quiet sorrounding, not far from beach but very handy for Dublin City with railway in short walking distance",4,2013,06,19
247,Good Value,"Nice little hotel, good location.

The good:  Very close to DART (rail) station to take you into town.  Close to the arena.  Nice quiet neighborhood.  Parking on site.  Friendly and helpful staff.

The bad: Room was a bit run down.  Breakfast was sort of a buffet style, with the coffee coming a bit slow.

Overall this is a lower price hotel, and what you get for your money is a good deal.",5,2013,06,18
247,Good hotel for short stay in Dublin,"The hotel is a conversion of 5 buildings next to each other.  So it is fairly large but with a maze of corridors.

Room was large and clean with average comfort. Breakfast was really good value.

Location is next to Aviva Stadium and a short walk from the Canal Dock area and also the RDS exhibition centre.  Dublin city centre is a short train on the DART from a nearby station.

Ideal hotel for a short stay in Dublin especially for any activities in the Ballsbridge area.

Prices varied a lot depending on when you book and what day you need.",3,2013,06,18
247,"Great Location, Pity the Hotel didn't cater for Concert goers","Booked tickets to Robbie Williams and managed to book a triple room in the Sandymount Hotel on the same day.  Was delighted that we got a hotel so close to the stadium at a reasonable rate.  Check-in was fast and friendly.  Room was compact but clean and served it's purpose.  After checking in we went to the bar for a drink and waited for a friend to arrive to join us for food.  We managed to get a table however when we asked for menus we were advised that bar food had finished for the day. This was 5.30pm  - the day of a concert?? The only option available was the Restaurant which did have a menu for €14.95 for two courses however the queue was up the stairs with a wait to get in and didn't really fancy getting in line.  There was Robbie Williams music playing in the background but you would have to strain to hear it so didn't really create a pre-concert atmosphere.  Left the hotel and had to make do with a burger in the Aviva.  After the concert we went for drinks in Sandymount Village and when we returned to the hotel we thought we would have a night cap however to our dismay the bar was shut and there was no ""Residents Bar"".  We asked if we could order drinks to our room and were advised that there was no room service! We were also hungry so asked about ordering sandwiches - again we were told that there was no room service available.  We were offered take away menus for pizza or chinese which we took.  The night porter was very accommodating as did get us one drink to take to our room but this was after much persuasion.  Great location but not really servicing the concert goer!",3,2013,06,18
247,Good Value Hotel,"This hotel was a good price, Handy for RDS and Aviva, Good breakfast - small double bed. Probably same as at home but have come to expect slightly bigger in hotels. Basic but adequate accomodation. Very handy to LUAS however while nothing to do with the hotel, worth mentioning that we wanted to take the train to town and walk back but only return tickets are available at 7 euro each. Could comfortably have walked both ways",3,2013,06,18
247,Friendly and welcoming,"Great value and service for what I paid for 1 night b&b. 
Check was quick and very professional. Staff could not have been more helpful or 
friendly. 
Rooms were spacious and clean. 
Breakfast was good, hot buffet and continental b/f catered for. 
Could not fault anything
",5,2013,06,18
247,Keep going back,"We stayed here for a night for a concert at the Aviva, loved it staff couldn't be friendlier, rooms clean and tidy, nice flat screen on wall.We ate in the resturant and the food was lovely. Ideally situated 2mins away from the Aviva. This is the third time we've stayed here and I'm sure we will be back again and again ",5,2013,06,17
247,Perfect for Aviva,"I stayed at the hotel to go see Robbie Williams at Aviva the hotel is perfect location literally 3 mins walk to the stadium, Parking was free, the hotel food was excellent and the bar had a great atmosphere, staff were extremely helpful and remembered you name when your went to reception, I stayed in one of the older rooms which was grand, though it was starting to look like it needed a little tlc and it was quite noisy throughout the night, from talking to other guests staying they were in newer rooms that sounded lovely.....Id highly recommend this to all friends and family making a trip to the Aviva stadium!!",4,2013,06,17
247,Lovely Hotel,"We spent a long weekend staying at this hotel. It is perfectly located for the Aviva Stadium and the city centre. The staff are friendly, helpful, polite and efficient. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The bar and restaurant serve good food at reasonable prices. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,06,16
247,100% Quality Service,"Stayed in Sandymount Hotel Friday 14th June , rang on the Wednesday before as very last minute was going to Robbie Williams and spoke with a very kind woman Beatrice who was so helpful but unfortunately the hotel was booked out due to the concert, she kindly advised that if any cancellations she would contact me back.  That very evening she did and was more then helpful advising she would leave my contact details with security driving down to Landsdowne Road so they would let us access by car.  Not only that when we arrived all staff were so welcoming at reception this was an hour before the concert, the hotel was packed and I watched them make time for every customer at the counter, we were upgraded to an Executive Room which was beautiful.  When we returned from concert they even gave free sandwiches to guests in the bar, I travel to Dublin a lot and by far the best service and standard even better then some 5 star Hotels we have stayed at.  Thank you so much Beatrice for topping off great weekend , will highly recommend and stay here in the future.  Well done to all staff.",5,2013,06,16
247,Always top class,"We were in Dublin for Olly Murs/Robbie Williams concert at the Aviva (which was so close to the hotel). The hotel was full to the brim with people, but thankfully were not waiting long for check-in. The check-in staff were so kind and friendly. 

Had dinner in the hotel and then headed to the concert which was amazing!

Back to the hotel about 12 am and headed back up to our room. We were in (524), very close to the reception. We heard a little bit of noise, but nothing much to disturb my sleep.

We got up for breakfast at 8.30 am. There wasn't too many down, so we had quite a selection of seats and items for the breakfast. We asked reception how to get down to the Sandymount Strand and they were very helpful. We had a lovely 5 mile walk.

Back to the hotel for a shower and then unfortunately time for check-out. We decided instead of rushing to Dublin City to look for some place to eat that we would have our lunch in the bar. My sister and I had the Caesar Salad which was yummy. I'll be back in July and I'm looking forward to it already.",5,2013,06,16
247,Fab stay!,"Stayed here with 2 friends for a concert and what a diamond it was, just 100 steps to the Aviva Stadium! The staff were brill (esp Beatrice and Siobhan on reception) and the room were big bright and airy
I will definitely return as it was a pleasure to stay there!",5,2013,06,16
247,"Great, super, lovely....","A great location almost next to the Aviva Stadium and close to a Dart station, we arrived after an early morning flight and asked if we could leave our luggage until check in time, this was swiftly arranged and we were offered breakfast which we declined but accepted the coffee which was served in the pleasant room off reception. On finishing our coffee Beatrice, the lovely receptionist informed us that she had managed to get a room available for us, so before 9am we were in the very nice, clean room that had everything we needed. We regularly stay in five star hotels and whilst this hotel may not be this standard it has many things going for it that lifts it above the three star rating it has. The breakfast at 10€ was super value for money with lovely choice of food and very pleasant service. We would return without hesitation when we come back to Dublin.",5,2013,06,15
247,Top notch service,"The Sandymount hotel is staffed with people that care! Arriving quite early, exhausted and in need of a short nap the staff found us a room hours before the official ""check in time"" . The hotel had many quiet places to sit and chat either in the pub or other common areas; this was nice as the rooms were wonderfully functional for sleeping and relaxing, but not for socializing with family. The local Sandymount Village is worth the short walk to enjoy the community spirit and friendly atmosphere. Getting to and from city center was quite easy.",5,2013,06,13
247,Great hotel for the city and the suburbs of Dublin,"I have stayed many times now at the Sandymount Hotel. It's a great place, staff are really friendly and helpful, it's bright and clean and ticks all the boxes I need from a hotel. Located close to public transport making access to the city straight forward. Meals in the bar and restaurant were good, perfect Irish breakfast to start the day.",5,2013,06,13
247,Truly a hidden gem!,"Situated in the shadow of the Aviva stadium in a quiet suburban street just 5 minutes walk from Landsdowne Road DART station and with ample car parking facilities this quirky hotel oozes character expertly blended with modern facilities.  A row of Victorian dwellings have been linked together to give it a quirkiness which makes finding you room sometimes an expedition into the unknown.  (We got a bit lost and returned to Reception where a friendly girl insisted on carrying our cases and taking us directly to the room).

The real jewels in the crown are the staff.  Ever helpful and polite they are a credit to the establishment.  It is fair to say that I have stayed in many hotels but have not found one with such high standards amongst its staff.

We stayed for six nights and had a spacious room overlooking the front of the hotel (556).  The room was bright, clean and welcoming packed with kettle etc and loads of toiletries.  There is also free WiFi throughout the hotel.  You need to get the codes from reception.

We were there on a room only basis so purchased vouchers for breakfast at 10 euros each.  Hot and cold food was available, as much as you want.  There was only scrambled eggs on the buffet but when asked the staff were only too ready to fetch you fried or poached eggs.  Tea and coffee are served at the table.  The food was perfectly cooked and tasty.

We dined in the evening a couple of nights and the standard of the food was good and plentiful.  Service was quick and friendly.

We are slow walkers so it was a 10 minute walk to Sandymount Village (turn right outside the hotel then first right then left at the mini-roundabout and follow the road) or 15 minutes to Ballsbridge (turn right outside the hotel follow the road past the level crossing at the Dart staion and turn left at the next set of traffic lights).   There are good pubs and restaurants at both places and Reception will give you all the advice you need.

You can book trips and excursions at the hotel and the Dublin Sightseeing bus will pick you up outside.   A taxi to Dublin Airport booked by the hotel will cost 24 euros.

A train from the Dart station will take you into the city in 5 minutes or you can go to Bray, Howth or Malahide directly.  AA 3 day unlimited ticket for travel by bus, Dart or suburban rail costs just 24.5 euros at the Airport or City Centre Bus Office in O'Connell Street.

There is a swimming pool etc in the Marian College a few doors away which you can use if you want.  The hotel will give you all the details.

Our only regret is that I cannot give the hotel 6 stars.  They know the true meaning of Cead Mile Failte!",5,2013,06,13
247,Again we return to the Sandymount,We again visited Dublin and again chose the Sandymount to stay at. I suppose we keep returning due to the fact that although a busy hotel ( a Stones throw from the Aviva Stadium ) the staff always have time for you and are very helpful with their local knowledge and the hotel and it's grounds are clean. We leave our car in the hotels car park and we use the 'Dart' to get us around (It's a five minute walk from the hotel  to the 'Dart ' so no hardship ( 2 Euro single  from Aviva to Tara to get you to the shops ). A taxi from the hotel to the shops is about 10 Euro. If you do visit the hotel just relax and enjoy your visit. Remember this is my opinion and experience.,5,2013,06,10
247,best hotel in a small beautiful suburb of dublin_15min walk to the center,"we had a perfect trip. go to the restaurant ""juniors paulie's pizza"" 10/10! ...and check out sandymount with it's beach and restaurants. howth is worth a trip, too. the green dart train is just 5 minutes walk away!",4,2013,06,10
247,Great people!,"We loved the people at the Sandymount. The girls and guys at reception were wonderful  - friendly and very helpful. The owner, John, visited with us at breakfast and then arranged a ride in the hotel shuttle to our rental car. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,06,09
247,Lovely Hotel,Whenever i go to Dublin I stay at this hotel and this was my fifth visit.It is situated in a great location(just around the corner from a Dart station).The staff are very friendly and helpful.Service in restaurant exceptional.Overall a very pleasant stay.,5,2013,06,09
247,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my husband.  Hotel was in a great location, (Dart just around the corner) 3 stops from city center  Area is very safe, and about 5 minutes walk from Ballsbridge, where there are a couple of pubs and café's.
Staff were very pleasant in all areas of hotel.  We stayed in room 334, which had a lovely big bed,
lots of toiletries, was spotless, and couldn't fault anything.
We didn't have breakfast, so can't comment on that, but we had a meal in the bar, which was excellent, and very good value for money.  No problems with parking at Hotel, we just parked the car, and took the Dart everywhere.
We paid a bit more than we would normally for a midweek break  (€198 for 2 nights, without breakfast) 
Would definitely stay there again.",4,2013,06,07
247,Great quiet hotel near the action,This is a nice hotel with stylish decor and compact but functional rooms.   its 3 train stops away from the town center and right next to a stadium (which didn't have any events when we were staying).   It had complementary wireless (big plus) and parking (big plus).   Staff was great and food was excellent.   the neighborhood was very nice as well - very residential which is surprising given the stadium.   We did get a weird room that had one double (full?) bed and one twin bed.  The twin bed was a little awkward to sleep on.,4,2013,05,30
247,Thank you Beatrice!,"on a recent EFCollege tour, we had the pleasure of staying at the Sandymount Hotel.  It is a beautiful hotel in Dublin.  food was excellent, rooms were large and comfortable.  they were able to accommodate a huge crowd (87) on our tour with ease.  I want to give a huge shout out to Beatrice who truly went above and beyond to accommodate my sister ,  best friend and myself by putting us in a room together.  everyone one of the front desk people were great....but Beatrice , you were the best.....Thank you.",5,2013,05,30
247,Group of 9 friends,"We had booked this Hotel for 1 night (Sat 25th May ) which included breakfast and dinner plus return train journey from Belfast and ticket for The lion King show. When we arrived at the hotel the reception staff were very courteous and got our luggage stored safely as our rooms weren't ready but we were early arriving and this wasn't a problem at all. We checked details for booking a time for our dinner and the girl on the desk (don't know her name) said we didn't have to book a time but we told her we would like dinner for round 5.30pm as we were going to a show and we were getting collected at 7pm, she said that time would be fine and off we set on the Dart to Dublin for a bit of retail therapy.   We came back to the Hotel and proceeded to our allocated rooms after collecting our luggage from storage, we had 3 twin rooms and 1 triple room booked, my friend and I were in room 530 and we had a dbl and single bed which were very comfortable indeed, the only complaint in the rm was the b/room door lock was broke.  We went down to dinner at the time we said and were slightly disappointed to see there was food still on the floor were we were being seated but we didn't complain and just took to our seats, apparently there had been a large number of communion diners in but they were nearly finished by this this time. The lady in charge of the dining room came over to us with the menu which was the communion menu which we didn't want and she wasn't very nice at all when we told her this, she then proceeded to tell us we were too early and the Chef wouldn't be starting to cook anything until 6 o'clock and that he didn't know what he would cook as he hadn't printed off the new menu, well by this stage we were not happy and told this lady that so we asked for the Manager. This very handsome manager came over and we told him we just could not believe that the Chef didn't know what was on his menu for the night and we explained the whole story again bout the dinner time and the show and he did apologise and went away and a short time later came back new menu's.  Well, it was the same menu but wrote out in a different order. After all this we gave in and ordered our meal hoped this was the end of it.  We received our drinks and I think the young staff were nervous serving us as we had ordered a bottle of wine and the young man just handed it over to us and told us to open it ourselves. Our starters were very well presented and we tucked in and everyone was a bit happier until I discovered an Elastic Band in the middle of my salad, I was flabbergasted and 1 of my friends called out for the Manager again. He couldn't apologise enough and said this was unacceptable and took my plate away to show the Chef, he came back to let me know the band must have came off some napkins and fell onto my plate, he asked if I was alright and if there was anything he could do so we said he could at least waver our drinks bill which he did. We got our main meal but weren't too happy with that either, some of the girls wanted no sauce over there beef which the lady in charge said that would not be a problem but then brought them out covered in sauce which got sent back, our beef in Guinness pie had the hardest pastry ever made, but the desserts were gorgeous. All in all this was a disaster that could have been avoided if there was more communication between reception and dining room about what time they start there dinners. This morning 26th May we had a lovely breakfast and the staff serving were very good. Check out was quick and easy and the girls on the desk were lovely. ",3,2013,05,26
247,Traveling with a group of 80,"This hotel was able to manage a large group of us on a cultural tour. I was in a single room, downstairs, small by American standards, but clean and otherwise acceptable. Accommodation varied amongst our group. We were provided a cereal, toast, juice and coffee for our breakfast which was adequate- toaster did not work well so it took a while to get people through. The staff is commended on their patience in dealing with a large group in a helpful manner. I will return  when I make my next trip.",4,2013,05,24
247,Sandymount,"very nice people, good service, vey kind reception and good food. Room clean and cleaning every day. When we will return to Dublin we will go to the Sandymount. One minor point the hotel lies about 20 minutes cycling from the center of the city. Onthe other is is very quiet.",4,2013,05,20
247,Business Stay,"Two night business stay with use of conference rooms on the second day. First day meetings were at the Aviva Stadium. I was lucky and got one of the top floor rooms within the main block, which overlooked the car park at the rear. No disturbance from other residents. Bed was comfy and there was enough facilities such as iron, hairdryer etc. Could have had more power sockets for charging phones and laptops. Free Wi-Fi was good. Bathroom OK. 
Did not have breakfast but had bar meal on first evening which was excellent value and good portions. Conference lunch was well presented too.
I can understand what the other reviews say about the mixed standards of rooms from comments from some in our group, however my room was fine and the service very good.",4,2013,05,19
247,Excellent value and super staff,"I stayed in the Sandymount Hotel for 4 nights from May 13th to May 17th and the pleasant and friendly staff helped to make it a very enjoyable stay. While rooms are not luxurious they are more than satisfactory with comfortable bed, tea making and free Wifi access ( get Code from Reception) and very clean. Bar food is very good and service excellent. For its location in Dublin 4 it is one of the best value hotels.",4,2013,05,18
247,Good for a short business trip; british embassy or to visit aviva stadium.,"We spent one night to go for an interview in the british embassy, we went to a nearby beach. It was satisfactory overall and would return if doing anything around Dublin4. Easy check in and check out. Thanks to everybody @ reception and service.",4,2013,05,10
247,Excellent value for money,"Good location, on outskirts of Dublin in a nice area.

Reasonable price, and included a good-sized room, excellent shower, choice of toiletries, iron etc

Both breakfast & evening meal good and tasty. Evening meal very rapid serving!

All staff friendly and helpful, particularly Beatrice on reception.

Definitely worth a return visit.",5,2013,05,09
247,Great value hotel with friendly staff,"This was my 2nd visit to Sandymount Hotel in 6 months.
This hotel is approx a 20 min brisk walk to city centre but is served by the"" Dart"" which is the commuter train service and takes about 5 mins to city centre.
The hotel is a series of buildings and this accounts for the number of corridors at different levels as you get to your room. It is both quaint and modern but above all it is friendly and clean..
Breakfast is buffet and is very good and again friendly staff are there to assist with anything you require.
Overall it is a good hotel and great value and would recommend.
It is about 5 minutes walk from the very attractive village of Sandymount",4,2013,05,07
247,Great Hotel in Dublin,"Group of four were attending a function in Dublin. Wanted to stay in this area in Dublin as it was convenient to the place the function was being held. Lovely hotel. Great location, spacious rooms, delicious meal and breakfast.  Staff were very efficient and friendly. Very good value for money and it was nice to be away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.  Will certainly go back and recommend. This is a family run hotel with warmth and hospitality in abundance. Met the owner and he was such a lovely gentleman giving advice and travel tips. Thanks John.",5,2013,05,06
247,Good for the price,"We stayed in the hotel for the weekend to attend a family function in Dublin. The room was perfectly adequate and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom had a slight smell and was surprised that as it is internal there was no form of extractor fan. We purchased vouchers for breakfast and were disappointed with the food. Breakfast is the one meal which should be easy to produce well. The full Irish was not a good experience. The bacon was undercooked and the scrambled egg appeared to have been made from powdered eggs as it had a gelatinous consistency and was almost in edible.
On the whole it was a pleasant place to stay and the staff were most helpful
",3,2013,04,30
247,Excellent Hotel in Dublin,"Whenever I'm in Dublin for work or for family trips I always use the Sandymount Hotel. It's ideally located near the city centre but is set in a very peaceful neghbourhood. The value for money is excellent  - even though the price is low it still has that big ""city hotel"" feel.

Rooms are clean, modern, warm and well-lit, whether in the older Victorian or more modern part of the hotel. Breakfast is an good buffet served at garden level.

Service is at just the right level - attentive to your needs without being too much in your face like some of the more expensive hotels. The front-desk staff really look after you well",5,2013,04,29
247,Welcome Back,"We stayed at the Sandymount for a few days during April; this was our fifth or possibly sixth visit to the hotel over the past few years which I think in itself is a personal recommendation. Travelling by car from the UK by car we find that the hotel is perfectly placed only about 30 minutes from both Dun Laoghaire and Dublin Port ferry terminals and has the added bonus of ample free parking, which is extremely unusual in this area. If you feel the need to go out in the evening there are plenty of bars and restaurants a short walk away in Ballsbridge and for days out it is only a five minute walk to the local Dart station and then a ten minute journey into Dublin Centre. The hotel itself is well staffed and everybody is exceedingly helpful, my one gripe though, over the past few years a lot of money has been spent on the hotel, decorating and upgrading so it is a shame that any ongoing maintenance of the rooms seems to be lacking with a few minor problems visibly beginning to surface in quite a few areas but so long as it doesn’t get any worse it certainly will not put us off returning here on our next visit to Dublin.",4,2013,04,24
247,great location/consistant,"i have stayed here a few times both alone on business and with the family the rooms are clean and up to standard, food is good, the location is probably the best feature close to the o2,Ballsbridge,East link bridge and is a nice walk approx 25mins into the City centre also NO parking fees.Staff are friendly although when i called looking for a comercial rate the receptionist was at best abrupt so i now book on line better value.",3,2013,04,23
247,Good Clean 3 Star,"Hotels fine and service is friendly however, suggest you check your room before moving your luggage. I was in a rush when I arrived and just left my bags in the room and ran out for dinner. returned later to room with leaking bathroom ceiling, ground floor room with window opening onto drive through to hotel car park, TV located on top of wardrobe. Also suggest you request top floor rooms, noise from room above..",3,2013,04,23
247,Good standby,"The Sandymount has served me well for overnights for quite a few years. Fairly close to the city centre on the South side, it is two minutes from the Aviva Stadium and jam packed on international weekends and big game days. Having said that it, I have always found the staff helpful, if occasionally fraught. Rooms are adequate and breakfast is reasonable and well priced. An upgrade to an Executive room allowed me to appreciate the slightly better quality. Had a basement room once - didn't like it too much. It seems to be favoured by budget conscious travellers and serves that market well.",3,2013,04,22
247,Enjoyable,"Spend a night here with my husband as we were going to a show in the O2, the room represented great value for money and the hotel is very nice for what you pay for. Staff are friendly especially the receptionist on duty the day we checked in . Good value for money and includes free car parking which means a lot for Dublin. As the hotel is obvisoulsy an old building and appears several buildings joined up you end up with a bit of a journey to your rooms on uneven floor boards !! The rooms are standard and a bit dated and different parts of the hotel are more modern than others . Location is good and the hotel was quiet with no night time noise , i really could not fault the hotel for what we paid for the room B&B and parking and i would definitely consider staying here again . You do get what you pay for and once you know what to expect - by reading the reviews , you will not be disappointed.",3,2013,04,22
247,Basic motel...,"This is a very basic motel/hotel, rooms are pretty small, hardly any room for work. It's clean and does the job on a budget. Stay away on the weekends unless you like to listen to techno dance music all night!",3,2013,04,20
247,Great place to stay for events in Aviva Stadum,"I took a group to the Notre Dame/Navy football game in September 2012.  This hotle managed to exceed expetations on all fronts.  Will the hotel was full, they helped you like you were their only customer.  I had a problem as one of the travels in my group broke her leg and we need to change romms and dates around plus arrange transportation to the hospital.  

I couldn't ask for a better staff.",4,2013,04,20
247,Quite surprised when we got there,"Considering we have read all the great comments before, we were expecting a lot from this hotel. Sure, taking into consideration the rates- which are much lower than the average in Dublin- one could argue that you really shouldn't get your hopes up. However, it is not ideally located (reasonable of course, but not in the middle of the action) and having this in our mind we were sure the hotel would be lovely.
I will start with the bad side of our stay there: we had a late arrival and were checked in by a very nice and courteous front desk clerk (Francisco, if I'm not mistaken) in room 504. Now. to get to this 504 you have to walk through a very long hallway, take an elevator (and press 1-how on earth is this possible if the room starts with 5?), pass through another hallway, take another elevator, and finally walk along a third and last corridor (which looks really dated). Room 504 was no reason to get ecstatic either: two really small single beds that looked ancient, walls that clearly needed painting and to top it all: a bathroom that looked worse than one could imagine (a trace of rust in the toilet, hair in the bathtub and dust in the sink).
Next day we asked to be moved to a double as we have actually booked and they actually dealt with our request very professionally: they have explained that they were fully booked but would move our luggage as soon as they will have an available room.
We were moved to 204, which was much better: the furniture was in good state and walls looked . However, still had a major issue with the bathroom as they seem as not having invested a lot in this area. Again, the bathtub was chipped, everything had a yellowish hue and looked cheap and dated (more like the type of bathroom for personal use). I must admit, though, that it was clean. 
Another aspect I have disliked is that they re-use toilet paper from previous guests, which is really a shame. As your valued guest I don't want to notice any of the traces left by the ones who stayed in here before. I really don't need three toilet paper rolls, from which two are halved, I'd rather have one that was put there for my use only.
All in all, our experience was not that bad- considering their rates, but that was because accommodation is not a focal point of our vacations. However, if you are interested in a flawless hotel experience, I recommend paying some extra money on staying somewhere else.",3,2013,04,17
247,Great stay!,"Great hotel. All staff are extremely helpful and pleasant. Bar/lobby areas were very nice and modern. Rooms were modern and clean, beds very comfy. Great location, city centre only a few stops on the DART train however a taxi was only around €13. Located in a very nice, quiet area.",5,2013,04,16
247,Good value option in a nice part of town,"I had a pleasant stay at the Sandymount.  The hotel used to be known as the Mount Herbert and should not be confused with the Herbert Park which is another hotel close by.

The hotel building is from the Victorian era and some might wonder what to expect inside when they arrive. Before my recent visit I had not stayed here for three or four years and it looked like it certainly had improved in appearance, both on the outside and on the inside. It seemed like rooms had been painted and that the furniture and fittings had been upgraded.

My room was a very reasonable size. I had a good range of Irish and UK TV channels.  The wifi internet was free and worked very well. Tea and coffee making facilities were provided in the room.

I did not eat at the hotel but I could see that there was a bar menu and more formal options available. There are also plenty of other eating choices in the area, with Sandymount village being only a 10 minute walk away. (Some nice pubs there too)

The hotel has a decent amount of parking in its grounds and I think this is free of charge.

This is a lovely part of Dublin, and has very easy access to the city centre on the DART (tram) service. If you are a visitor to the city and want a more relaxed environment than the city centre, this would be a good option. 

There was a time when anything less than 100 euro would only buy a B&B option in Dublin 4. There is now a lot of competition in the area, especially outside the peak tourist period and when there no major events in the area, so it may be possible to get this hotel at an attractive price.",4,2013,04,16
247,Perfect customer experience!,Just back from here was over dir2 nights for pink concert at 02. Airport Bus dropped us off 10 min stroll from hotel. Git checked in a bit early at no charge! Gold star! Room lovely n warm and clean with kettle hairdryer etc and free wifi! Take note travelodge etc this is what u call customer service!! Not a great view but didn't come to stare out window! Had same thought as other poster with barman but no issue. Breakfast was Devine staff really nice at breakfast time. Was impressed havin a chat with the owner lovely man who went round every table chatting with guests again this is perfect customer service and a lot of places should take note. Reception girls and night staff are great too nothing too much hassle and approachable. Dart station shirt walk away or go canal walk into town. Shower in bathroom is amazing great pressure! Iron etc in room. Outside Terrace beside Bar great for Sittin with a drink and bar is reasonable compared to some places. Overall will be back to this hotel at some point forthe perfect irish hospitality and suitable for all age groups as good mix of guests and the grounds great for smaller kids to play in. ,5,2013,04,13
247,Top notch accommodations and service!,"I stayed at Sandymount Hotel for 8 days in March 2013. I was extremely impressed with the accommodations and hotel staff. The rooms were very spacious, comfortable, clean, and modern. The showers always had hot water and great pressure (something not always encountered in Ireland!). The hotel employees, including the front desk; restaurant/bar staff; and housekeeping, were consistently friendly and extremely helpful. They went out of their way to ensure guests' comfort, from calling cabs to allowing me to store my luggage while taking an overnight trip to the countryside.

Also noteworthy was the quality of the food in the hotel restaurant. It was honestly some of the best fare I had while in Dublin, and I ended up eating there several times during the trip. The service and menus were fantastic!

The hotel is situated in a picturesque, quiet area of Dublin. It is just around the corner from the Aviva Stadium, providing a great view of its impressive architecture. The hotel is only a short cab ride from the tourist sites and nightlife of the city, and the DART (Dublin area rapid transit) is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. I frequently traveled via the DART into the city, which was very economical and convenient. Sandymount village (also within walking distance) was a great place to enjoy an afternoon stroll and visit the local shops and restaurants.

Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the accommodations and quality of service during my stay at Sandymount Hotel. I would absolutely recommend it to travelers, and I plan on staying there again during future trips to Dublin!",5,2013,04,13
247,Comfort & excellent bar food- this is it!,"We had a lovely big room front of house with pleasant suburban views, no noise and a double & single bed. I had requested hypoallergenic bedding due to an allergy & for once somebody listened! The bathroom was adequate but a make over may be due soon. All the staff were lovely with the exception of one person in the bar who coming from a different culture perhaps did not intend to offend. I look forward to staying there again.",4,2013,04,12
247,Good Barfood,"My wife and i stayed there recently and our room was on the ""Executive Floor "" for which we paid a €30 upgrade fee, The room was ok but not very big  and was at what appeared to be at the back of the hotel with a no view of anything but a rooftop .
When we went into our room there was a musty smell so we opened the window thinking it would clear it away , We changed and left the room for the evening , When we arrived back in the room at around 12 midnight we closed the window as the smell seemed to be gone, when we woke in the morning the musty smell was back and more intense than the previous evening and it was coming from under the bath, The bathroom was quite old in appearance and looked like it had been refurbished in the last few years at some point but not to what you would term ""Executive "" standards
Bathroom aside the bed was very comfortable and we had a comfortable nights sleep, Breakfast was a buffet which was quite good and the dining room was nice and roomy /bright with a garden directly outside.
The previous evening we ate in the bar and the food was realy nice with prompt friendly service.
We had to leave after breakfast and i reported the musty smell to the lady on reception who was most apologetic and offered us a free upgrade on any future booking in there hotel.

We would stay there again as it is a very nice area close to the Aviva stadium and with lovely areas to walk nearby, The broadband that the hotel offer is quite a complicated arrangement to access and the codes that reception give out are sometimes invalid so it can be frustrating to try to use it.

The Bar area is nice and spacious but be aware that the bar closes at 12 on Thursday nights and they DO NOT OPERATE A RESIDENTS BAR, This ensures a peaceful nights rest for everyone staying there but may not suit others who expect to be able to have a late drink in there hotel bar

We will stay there again when we visit Dublin next",3,2013,04,11
247,Wonderful Experience!,"I could not have been happier with my stay at the Sandymount hotel! Upon arriving the staff was very accommodating and friendly! The rooms were always clean, and the shower was PERFECT! The location to Dublin is great because you are close to the DART, but not a far cab ride away if you prefer that. We ate at the hotel more than once during our stay because the food was so delicious, and restaurant had a nice atmosphere!  

Since we were doing some traveling in Ireland, the hotel had no issue holding our luggage for a couple days while we were checked out. This made traveling so easy. 

Also, free wifi!",5,2013,04,09
247,Sandymount,"My friends and I from York stayed at Sandymount to visit friends who are currently living in Dublin. The staff at the hotel and resturant/bar were excellent and very accommodating throughout our entire stay. We had large size rooms which were very clean, comfortable beds, and great water pressure in the showers! While the hotel was busy during our stay, the rooms were quiet and staff were always very quick to provide assitance as needed. The food and the service at the bar/resturant were excellent! Thank you to the staff at Sandymount for helping us  have a wonderful time in Ireland",5,2013,04,09
247,Overnight stay,"Excellent location could walk to Ballsbridge lots of little pubs and restaurants. walked to O2 via river walk 15min walk, would recommend. Rooms could do with a lick of paint but powerful shower, comfy beds and warm. Beside Aviva stadium.",4,2013,04,09
247,Wonderful for the price,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during the first week of April 2013. The price was great and the staff was wonderful, especially Beatrice from the day shift and Francisco from the night shift. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the train station, and the train is about 2-3 stops (approximately 10 minutes) to the city center of Dublin. It is outside of the main tourist area which makes it lovely and quiet at night, but still close enough to get there quickly. There is also a small town located about a 10 minute walk away (I believe called Sandymount) which has nice restaurants and stores as well.

My ONLY reason for not giving 5 stars was the lack of food and drink items at night. They did have delivery options, which we made use of and were actually satisfied with, but it would have been nice to have a little area which sold snacks aside from the vending machine (which was broken during my trip). The next and following nights we brought snacks back with us which resolved the problem. There is also a bar/restaurant in the hotel, just make sure to go during the hours it is open. I wasn't around during hours it was open so I can not speak to the quality of the food or drinks, but the crowds that I saw suggested that it was a popular place for the locals to come to eat and hang out. Nothing noisy though, never once heard them from my room :)

Overall, GREAT hotel!!! Just stock up on more food options for those of us who are jetlagged and still awake when the restaurant closes :)",4,2013,04,09
247,Near the center,Comfortable hotel. Near the dart (metro) which is two stops away from the center. The staff were especially nice and very helpful. Beatrice & Francisco were great. I'd recommend this place to friends. ,4,2013,04,09
247,Handy hotel,This hotel is very convenient for the RDS the Aviva and the Dart. However it is a little tired in both the public areas and the bedrooms. Everything is clean and the staff are very helpful . We had dinner in the bar which was very tasty and better than most bar meals. Its a bit of a nuisance getting a voucher for the Wii Fi every day even though it is free.,4,2013,04,08
247,Easter Weekend,"Thanks John as usual a lovely time at your hotel.
This time we brought the family and everyone had a great time!
Everything was excellent.
Was good that we could reserve an area of the bar for the family party, on the Saturday night.
Easy to get to town on the Dart. 
Reception very helpful with our return fast ferry - Beatrice was great as usual.
Our 12th visit to this hotel - speaks for itself.",5,2013,04,04
247,Excellent Service,I am a regular at the Sandymount Hotel - staying usually on my own but in some cases with family. It is always excellent in terms of service and comfort. I always sleep very well and breakfast will set you up for the day. It's a great location to get in and out of Dublin,5,2013,04,01
247,"Excellent rooms, soft clean beds and the room was so warm, with lovely staff and bar food.","Found the service in the hotel fantastic, particularly from Soibhan at the front desk who was extremely accommodating. Smoking wing was a plus. Big soft beds with heating at perfect temp all night. On a really quiet road too so no noisy traffic.
The food in the bar was lovely as were the staff.",4,2013,04,01
247,Wonderful first trip to Dublin,"Overall, I really can't say anything negative about the Sandymount Hotel! It is an extremely cute and well cared for family owned hotel that treats its guests like family too. Right when you walk in, there are many comfortable and well designed lounge areas to relax and make plans for the day. The front desk staff is extremely kind and always seemed very happy to answer questions about the area. The rooms are cozy - I slept so well and was never disturbed. While it is not in the heart of the city, I really enjoyed the location, because it was safe, quiet and is only a 5 minute walk from the DART which will take you right into the major part of the city. I also suggest the breakfast  - the buffet was delicious and is offered at a reasonable price. I am extremely happy to have stayed at the Sandymount for my first trip to Dublin.",5,2013,03,26
247,Great Weekend Stay at the Sandymount,"Being the first trip I have ever taken to Dublin, I am extremely happy I chose to stay at the Sandymount hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and I think the Showers had the best pressure I have ever experienced at a comparable hotel. I slept very well in the beds and woke up refreshed the next morning. Aside from the accommodations, the staff is very friendly and willing to help. Although we had to check out on Sunday, they allowed us to store our baggage which we found to be helpful. Also, I would recommend the breakfast  the hotel serves; we thoroughly enjoyed the traditional Irish food. I would definitely stay again at the hotel and would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a great place to stay.",5,2013,03,25
247,The Perfect Irish Experience,"The hotel was a short distance from the Dublin airport, which made taking a cab there very easy!  The hotel is a great location from the new stadium that was just built if you are traveling to Dublin to see a concert or sports event then it's even better.  It wasn't too far from town center but enough removed that you were able to esape the tourism of the city.  The family owned hotel really makes you feel welcome and has excellent customer service.  The owners visit the hotel often to ensure that their guests are having a pleasant and traditional Irish experience.  
The hotel also offers an excellent restaurant where you can get a well-priced Irish breakfast buffet and other meals as well.  The hotel was cozy, very clean and offered an amazing overall experience with a nice sitting area by a fire too.  
The rooms were wonderful with very comfortable beds, which were a nice change from the beds we had been sleeping on lately.  It was quiet and cozy in the rooms so i was able to get a great night sleep before exploring the city.  Every room had a nice tv for relaxing if the city wipes you out and you need to reenergize.  
This was the perfect place to stay in Dublin and i will be sure to stay here everytime i come to the wonderful city!! Thank you for an amazing weekend!",5,2013,03,25
247,Does exacly what it says on the tin,"Situated very close to the Aviva stadium, this is a standard three star hotel.   Physically, it is a bit of a warren with long corridors connecting several nineteenth century houses and lifts in unexpected places.  The rooms are a little old fashioned but fine for short stays and good value for money.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was the standard buffet selection.  It is a hotel that is regularly used by rugby fans attending matches in the stadium.  It is, therefore, best to check ahead to see if there is a match or another event on during your stay.  
The hotel is situated in a Dublin suburb.  It is about a 40-50 minute walk into the city centre although there is a dart station nearby where you can get a local train into the centre.  There is also a good view of Dublin Bay from the Dart.",3,2013,03,23
247,"Good hotel, not a great night's sleep","When we booked, we specifically requested a quiet room.  Maybe they wanted to have some fun with us because we certainly didn't have a quiet room.  We stayed in Room 235 and the floor boards from the hallway must connect to the floor boards to the bedroom (the bed is about 12-18 inches from the wall shared with the hallway.  Everytime someone walked by the floor boards creaked and we could clearly hear everyone's conversations.  No one was ""hanging out"" in the hall causing problems it was just a noisy room on a main hallway of the hotel.  We did not ask to change rooms as I had the flu and just wanted to lay down and be done with travelling.

Since I had the flu while I was there so unfortunately we did not leave the room once we checked in.  When we left (stay in Dublin frequently but usually with family), we realized we were in an excellent location.

We ordered room service for dinner and it arrived promptly and was nice and hot.

They kindly gave us two WIFI codes as we both wanted to be online.  A bit annoying that you keep having to log back in, but certainly better than no WIFI.

We chose the hotel as they offer free parking.

Overall an okay experience... just wish the request for a quiet room had been honoured.",4,2013,03,21
247,good Location,"Reception staff were very pleasant,Hotel very easy to get to from nearby dart station, room was very small but adequate as we were only staying one night, Taxi into town reasonable at €11 to city centre
      ",4,2013,03,21
247,Pleasant experience & free parking is a massive plus,"Stayed here for 2 nights in early december for a night out in Shelbourne racetrack, great location for any event in O2, Shelbourne & especially Aviva stadium as its right on the doorstep. We got a very reasonable deal for the 2 nights with supervalue breaks. The hotel offers free parking which is few and far between in hotels in Dublin where it will probably cost you €10-15 a night so worth taking into account when booking elsewhere. As for the hotel it was very nice & quite cosy, decent bar & staff were very friendly. Breakfast was ok, nothing special & the rooms are clean but fairly small, I would think they would be very warm in the summer, especially the rooms lower down facing the back so would try get a front facing room during the warmer parts of the year. Only negative I would have was that we were inundated with cleaning staff entering the room in the mornings & even on the morning we were leaving we woken 3 times with staff entering the room which was needless considering we were checking out by 12 anyway.",4,2013,03,20
247,Grand !,"Very nice and pleasant Hotel, enjoyed my stay.
Location is very nice, the staff is very nice, and the food there is pretty good !
the atmosphere of this hotel is very quiet and you can work without any inconvenients ! 
Recommanded !",5,2013,03,19
247,"Worth a stay, if you get it on offer","Not bad. Not great, but not bad. Great location for the south city, and having got a special room rate of €40 i was very pleasantly surprised, but then i wasnt expecting much. Free car parking, thats always a good start, and free wifi, although it kept cutting out and had to be logged onto repeatedly. Staff helpful, but nothing special, and the room was warm and clean. Food was good, ambience generally pleasant, and overall it would be impossible to fault at that price. But its rarely at that price, and having stayed subsequently (at a higher rate) i know that if the value is lost, the review loses a star. ",4,2013,03,17
247,Wonderful  gem of a hotel,"Stayed her for 2 nights and have stayed in a lot of Dublin hotels and I have to say this rates as one of the best ones up there .
Room was very clean, Staff at reception and in the bar were very friendly and helpful.  Would recommend this hotel it also has parking at no charge.

On small problem was ordered breakfast for the room and it did not show up.  Receptionist did not seem to bothered  when I told her as did not offer me any thing else  plus it was only 10.15am 
But over all that would not put me off",5,2013,03,17
247,Wonderful First Trip to Dublin!,"Perfect location. Easy walking access to Aviva Statium. Tram & Train, just as easy. Quick trips to downtown. All the cabbies we used were lovely. Nice walks exploring the neighborhood.

Clean, comfortable rooms. Friendly, professional, accomodating staff. 
Very good food in the charming pub. Buffet breakfast was outstanding. All at a great value & price.

Hands down, the best first experience in Ireland.

Looking forward to next visit & will bring the family. Sandymount will be our home away from home. Thank You!",5,2013,03,13
247,A Great Place To Stay,"Small Modern Hotel, Clean and friendly. The breakfast is huge. Great bar for watching sport, if you cant get in to the AVIVA which is 300 meters away. Lovely girl Stephanie on reception couldn't do enough for us. Will def come again.",5,2013,03,12
247,Will definitely go back again :),Stayed in the sandymount hotel because we were going to the Ire v Fra rugby match in the Aviva.. Location is perfect.. Lady on reception was very pleasant.. Our room was on the ground floor and we were pleasantly surprised.. Food was delicious and reasonable priced.. Will most definitely go back again..,5,2013,03,10
247,Excellent place to stay,"Stayed 3 nights during our car tour of Ireland.  Adequate sized room and bathroom and we were pleased that it was very clean.  Comfortable bed.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.
More than adequate buffet style breakfast.  Location was ok as we took the tram to go downtown Dublin.
Met the owner at one breakfast and it was clear that he was proud of his facility and made us feel very welcomed.  
Finding a parking place for our car in the hotel lot was tricky as the widths of the spaces are very narrow but we managed.
Excellent value facility and if we return to Dublin we would stay here again.",4,2013,03,08
247,best kept secret,"We have been using this hotel since the late 70s and we stayed here on 2nd March when going to ""Alone it stands"" at the Olympia. To arrive here is like returning to an old friend with the staff welcoming and always helpful. OK - the corridors area bit uneven but a reading of the history of the building would explain. Extremely comfortable bed in a bright room and a full range at  breakfast - all for a most competetive price. A really relaxing break with an afternoon spent watching Landsdowne -v- Young Munster just across the road - a handy walk to the Dart and back again with a wee Jameson's for a nightcap! Thank you Sandymount",5,2013,03,06
247,Great stay in Dublin,"This was our first visit to Ireland and we were very excited! We had a nice stay in Sandymount!

About the location: Its not in the center of the city. Its more on the east side but there is a Dart (fast train whats going through the city) station in a distance of a 5 minute walk. Its a good thing to catch it and go into the center or reach the Luas or other Train stations.

Rooms: clean, comfortable, and there is a possibility to make a cup of Tee whats always refilled with sugar, milk and different Tees. The bed was good and i had a good sleep every night. The TV has a lot of channels and its working fine.

For Europeans two intresting things:
1. On the sink you find two different sources for water (warm and cold)
2. Have a connector converter if you want to charge your mobile phone or camera

Its a friendly hotel! When you visit Dublin with friends its worth staying here!",4,2013,03,05
247,cosy place,"excellent two night deal, room only - double room was compact and the first
night quite noisy.
We complained and they moved us upstairs. The room we were given
was much superior , more spacious and quiet.
Hotel is in excellent location at the Aviva stadium and beside the Dart,
so Malahide, Bray etc are very easily reached.
Enjoyed breakfast for 10 euro each the second morning.
The Bar was nice also and all staff very civil.
we liked the village of Sandymount and enjoyed a meal in Mario's at the
recommendation of one of the girls at reception.
Have been in many hotels in Dublin and would gladly return to
this one",4,2013,03,04
247,Top Class Hotel.,"What an enjoyable stay my daughter a myself had at the Sandymount. The first thing that strikes you is the friendly and informative staff at  reception. Then on arrival at your room you walk into a light, airy and spotless room. Breakfast served up until 10 o'clock was excelent with the food being hot. We stayed in Dublin for three nights and enjoyed a restful undisturbed sleep. I would like to add that the domestic staff were also so friendly and efficient. Thank you Sandtmount for such a lovely welcome and pleasant stay.",5,2013,03,03
247,Excellent Family-Run Hotel,"I thouroughly enjoyed my stay at the Sandymount hotel, as did the rest of my family. You are garunteed to get a good nights sleep and the staff are always friendly, helpful and welcoming. The food in both the bar and restaraunt is very nice and the hotel is very clean. The value you get for your money is great and the location is very good, with the Aviva stadium just around the corner as well as a DART station.",4,2013,03,03
247,Great Hotel,"I work in Dublin a few a days a week and started to stay in the Sandymount Hotel last June. I had previously stayed in some other hotels nearby but when they were full one night I stayed in this hotel.
Since then I have never gone back...from day one you could sense the warmth of the staff and the hotel. It's so friendly . That's what you want.It's backed up by cleanliness and style . Great to be able to get the internet , paper in the morning and evening and tea/coffee making facilities in the room( not common everywhere) . 
It's a homely , intimate atmosphere that attracts me . Staff in reception are incredible , especially Beatrice and Steph - incredible friendliness and welcome . Food good in the evening. Bar staff super also - overall a great place to stay!",5,2013,02,27
247,"Fantastic, as usal","22 - 23 February 2013:
As you probably can see, it is not my first time to the Sandymount. I travel a number of times to Dublin and since June 2012, the Sandymount Hotel is the place where we come. The receptionist staff and so lovely and helpful and always so cheerful. The bar staff also are so helpful and food is fantastic. We were up to Dublin for The Killers gig in the O2. We arrived in Dublin at 5pm, ate a lovely meal at the bar and back on the Dart again for 6.30 pm to make it for the gig. The Dart is so close to the hotel, only at 10 minute walk (or 5 min jog). 

Breakfast next morning was fabulous too, with porridge and hot chocolate available to order. We were doing the Operation Transformation 5 k Fun Run in the Phoenix Park, so had to leave again straight after breakfast, but the hotel reception staff ordered a taxi for us to the Phoenix Park. I left something in the room, I e-mailed the hotel and they were able to locate my item and they are going to post it to me.

Thanks Sandymount Hotel for more great memories and looking forward to coming again on 14th June 2013.",5,2013,02,26
247,First Class and my First Choice!,"I have enjoyed staying at this hotel for over 25 years and enjoyed it again last weekend. Always a warm friendly welcome.  Great to see a lot of the same staff there after all this time.  Beatrice is a gem! It has been modernised over the last 25 years but still remains a friendly, family run, relaxing and comfortable hotel and with all ""mod cons"". Will always be my first choice in Dublin.",5,2013,02,26
247,Excellent Location and Excellent Staff,"Great family run hotel in a lovely quiet location, close to sea for walks, and close to Dart Station for easy travel into city (2 Stops). Had lunch in bar and really enjoyed it. Free parking also a bonus. We had no problem checking in a bit early after a trip up from Leitrim. Room lovely and clean and a great power shower in the room. Have already booked to return.",5,2013,02,25
247,Never let down,"I have been coming to this hotel for almost 25 years and was up again this week and on each stay I'm reminded why I keep coming back. The staff, the welcome, the 'feel' of the hotel, I can relax and when I'm travelling alone, there is always a member of the staff ( especially Beatrice, who I've come to know so well ) who will have a chat. The food is excellent and I have never found reason for complaint.",5,2013,02,24
247,Best Birthday Ever!,"Stayed Friday 22nd Feb 2013. Reception was amazing. my son and i came from Cookstown, Co. tyrone to celebrate my Birthday at the O2 Killers concert. we were running late but the lovely girl on reception arranged a taxi ASAP! which was there in minutes. She told us to go on and enjoy the concert and she would have our bags taken to our room. I felt really welcome and cared for.
Our room was lovely - Beds were comfy, clean and neat. Made ourselves tea and coffee provided    put tv on - like Home from Home! Bath, Shower and Toilet had every thing we needed and again was clean and tidy and Spacious.
The Staff were Top class. From Reception to Cleaning staff - went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable.
Fantastic value for money. I really want to stay here again. Thank you Sandymount -for the best birthday ever!
ps. Loved the great bronze rugby statue at entrance.",5,2013,02,24
247,Stayed here before,"We last stayed here in 2007 and despite a change in owner we were still on the system.
Our previous stay was so memorable that I looked up the hotel on trip advisor but I was dismayed when I couldn't find it because it used to be called the Mount Herbert.
On arrival the welcome was outstanding. There were two ladies on the reception who were really welcoming and they have the skill of making you feel special. So many places could learn from them.
The room was exactly as expected. It was clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated.
Prior to getting the dart train into the city we had a sandwich in the bar, which was good. The service is also of a high standard.
Following an evening out in the city we caught the dart train back and it was a short walk back to the hotel.
I actually don't want to stay anywhere else when I am in Dublin. The staff make this a fantastic place to stay and there is ample free parking. Well done Sandymount.",5,2013,02,23
247,"Great hotel, great location","Located 2 mins from the Aviva stadium Dart for easy access to Dublin. Lovely hotel, fast & efficient service. Rioom was clean and bright. Food & bar facilities good also. Ticks all the boxes. Will be back.",4,2013,02,21
247,short weekend stay,"Had a really nice stay in Sandymount Hotel. Great location near the beach and dart station, only 5minutes on the dart to the city centre and 10 minute walk to the nearest shops, pubs and restaurants. Our room was very nice and really spacious, I thought we got real value for money. Our friends staying in another room in the hotel however found their room very basic. It is a pity all of the rooms aren't up to the same standard
      ",4,2013,02,21
247,Still the best,"I travel to Dublin on business on a regular basis. I have tried many hotels in the Dublin 4 area and can honestly say the Sandymount is the best there is. Beatrice, Stephanie, and the rest of the reception staff make one feel welcome immediately. Free parking, free wi-fi, excellent food in the bar with specials nightly and waiting and bar staff who are second to none.
I have recommended this hotel to colleagues and friends alike and look forward to staying there again. Keep up the good work.",5,2013,02,19
247,Six Nations Ireland Vs England,"From entering the hotel, until us leaving, the service from front desk to hotel services was immaculate. The staff are friendly, helpful and efficient.
We could not ask for more. They are even just round the corner from Lansdowne Road Stadium... How convenient is that!",5,2013,02,17
247,A great place to stay in a great city,"I visited the Sandymount with friends for the International weekend, 
What an absolute pleasure, the hotel is extremely comfortable, the food and staff fantastic, with the atmosphere unbelievable.
Great 'craic', saw some old faces and made lots of new friends.
A perfect venue to stay in a great City",5,2013,02,17
247,international weekend,"On what was our 8th visit to the Sandymount over 14 years of  visiting Dublin on ""International rugby weekend"" the staff at the hotel continue to provide a warm Irish welcome for its guests, nothing is to much trouble, and the hotel continues to have that feel good factor, well recommended thank you hope to see you next time.",5,2013,02,15
247,"Excellent Hotel, Prime Location for Aviva Stadium","I stayed at this hotel in February 2013 for 2 nights at the time of the Ireland v England game  (supporting England).  It could not be closer to the Aviva stadium (formerly Lansdowne Road stadium until it was completely rebuilt and rebranded).  The stadium, as well as hosting the rugby, also hosts concerts and other sports.  I really rated my stay there, from the welcome at reception, to the bar and restaurant, the service was excellent.

The hotel was easy to get to from the airport, I got an Aircoach from outside the airport towards Ballbridge, got off at the Pembroke Road stop, got on to Lansdowne Road which passes by the great looking modern stadium. At the bridge the road becomes Herbert Street and the hotel is invitingly right there - it was probably about 5-10 minutes walk from the bus stop, so suits a cheapskate like me fine, but getting a taxi would have been as easy!

I was warmly welcomed and had a decent room on the ground floor, with a comfortable bed, bathroom and tea & coffee making facilities and a decent enough tv.
After a few beers in a lively bar, we were recommended somewhere to eat locally (Roly's bistro) and were lucky enough to get a table there  and can highly recommend that.

On the matchday iteself the place was buzzing, literally right from breakfast time.  People were arriving, having a good drink and a chat, we were talking with some of the Irish team's family at one point and there were a few well known rugby faces around the place.  All the stops were pulled out including some extra tent areas out the front,  hog roast and some inflatable rugby posts/ball.  It was a great atmosphere as fans from both teams chatted over the forthcoming game.

When it was time to leave, we only had a very short walk to the stadium, which was great because the weather was awful! After the game, we returned and enjoyed more of the same atmosphere.

Something that struck me on the way back from this trip was that for all the 1'000's of pints of guiness and lager that were consumed here, not once did I have to wait for any long period of time to get served, it was like a slick machine.  And the place was being continually tidied and cleaned which was some effort seeing as how many people were there.

We had dinner in the restaurant that night.  I've got to say I thoroughly enjoyed that too. 

On the day after the game, I took a stroll to nearby Sandymount.  I hadn't realised that we were so close to both the see and the city.  After looking at the coast I walked back to the hotel, checked out, then as I had time to kill decided to walk into Dublin City centre.  It took about 40 minutes to O'Connell street where I caught the Aircoach bus back to the airport (which I could have picked up back in Ballbridge).

I would recommend this hotel, irrespective of whether it is to see the rugby or not.  However, if it is to see the rugby this place is amazing.  On matchdays, it's definitely a place for the fan of the game.",5,2013,02,12
247,"A warm, welcoming hotel in an incredible location!!","I have been meaning to write a review about the Sandymount Hotel  for a considerable amount of time.

Having been lucky enough to stay in many hotels in Ireland and abroad and I can honestly say I have never received as warm a welcome as I do when I arrive to the Sandymount Hotel. I have travelled to Dublin every January for the past 8 years as part of a group and we have stayed in the Sandymount (previously the Mount Herbert) hotel every time. Over this period the group size has grown from ten to 40 people but the attitude of the staff has not changed since our very first night. They are willing to help with anything you might need and everyone from the staff on reception, to the waiters and the cleaning staff greet you with a smile on their faces.

As part of our stay for the past 2 years we have held a function in the main dining room for over 100 people. Every part of the organising of this event is incredible with the restaurant supplying three menu's to accommodate the wide age range of guests attending. The entire night was a fantastic success, and every little need was accounted for.

The location of the hotel is also an incredible plus. Very close to DART links to the city centre and minutes walk from the Aviva stadium, R.D.S. and a whole host of top restaurants and bars in the Ballsbridge area means you are never short of things to do during your stay.

I would happily recommend the Sandymount Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin and I hope to have another happy 8 years travelling to the hotel as a guest.

247,Ok hotel,"Hotel had free parking & wifi,reception/lobby area nice & modern.
We booked a double room that also had a single bed so we would have a bigger room.
However when we checked in we got a tiny double and the noise from hallway was loud,walls paper thin!
The noise from the floorboads crreking as people walked outside our door ment we got hardly any sleep & then we people arrived back from pubs etc in the morning the noise was terrible & you could hear staff asking how many were staying the rooms.
Breakfast is also not the best quality

247,"Excellent Hotel, Great Value for Money","I stayed in The Sandymount Hotel on Friday 8th Feb with my mother and found the place to be extrememly good value for moeny. The room was nice and modern and well equipped. We had a double and a single bed. The bathroom was clean and well stocked. The hotel itself is in an excellent location, a short stroll to either Ballsbridge or Sandymount and right beside Lansdowne DART station and the Aviva Stadium. The staff are helpful and friendly, especially Beatrice at reception. Will definitely stay here again.",4,2013,02,11
247,Excellent service,"Very efficient and kind personnel. Good location. Communal areas very nicely decorated.I left an item at the hotel room and they mailed it to me for free! 
Excellent value for my money. Reasonably good breakfast at good price (EUR 10).
Highly recommended both for business and leisure trip.",5,2013,02,10
247,"Busy, vibrant hotel, close to Aviva stadium and RDS","Stayed here for two nights whilst visiting RDS. This is a friendly and busy Dublin hotel close to Aviva stadium and RDS and within walking distance of Ballsbridge and its Pubs and restaurants .
There is plenty of on site secure parking.
The rooms are typical for this type of hotel,clean and functional with tea coffee,hair dryer,iron etc.
The bar is large and well served by friendly and efficient staff. Breakfast is traditional self service.
A good hotel in this area of Dublin.",4,2013,02,01
247,Pretty good!,"I stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night and was very impressed by the reception and communal areas, after check in I sheared on the journey to my room. As per other comments the hotel is a bit of an adventure to find your room. 

The room itself was spotless, I'd a double & single tv. Small sized plasma on the wall with tea & coffee facilities. Overall it's a good spacious room and well suited for family stays. 

The location is 2 minutes walk from the Aviva Stadium and Dart so if that's what your looking for its perfect. Parking can be a challenge as per mine on a Saturday night, with the usual people parking taking up two spaces. 

Overall I'd recommend for location and room space. Also a little quirky charm that beats the large multinationals.",3,2013,01,31
247,Top Class,"I have stayed at the Sandymount Hotel on several occasions at this stage and most recently in January 2013. As usual the staff were very welcoming and when I booked that morning on the phone I asked could I have a newer room please and much to my delight when i arrived at the hotel I was given a suite for the night...nothing like a bit of luxury. The food is alway delicious at the Sandymount and this visit was no different both dinner and breakfast were top class, all in all a little gem in the centre of Dublin!",5,2013,01,31
247,10/10 for the Sandymount,"I've stayed in the Sandymount a number of times as well as other hotels in Dublin and I have to say it is the nicest place. The staff are extremely friendly and everyone gets on really well, which is always comforting. The staff from managers to porters are extremely helpful. The rooms are great, everything you need and more. They are modern, fresh and immaculate. The bar and restaurant have an extensive menu which is divine. You have to try the fish and chips, best around! Its location is super. Beside the Aviva and the RDS but only a short spin into the city centre. It offers a calm environment away from the city buzz.
I could go on and on but you really have to stay here to see for yourself. I stay there everytime I go to Dublin.",5,2013,01,28
247,"Nicest, most helpful staff ever! Lovely hotel.","I recently stayed overnight in the Sandymount Hotel as myself and my boyfriend were going to a gig in the 02. 

The room rate was very good, so good that when our taxi pulled up outside, I got a bit paranoid that we were in the wrong place! The outside of the hotel is gorgeous, really beautiful building. Very grand looking. 

The room was elegant and comfortable - extremely warm but not overly so. Very powerful shower. All the usual hotel room facilities. Beds were TO DIE FOR comfortable! 

The icing on the cake, however, was when we were leaving to go to the gig. The reception staff offered to call us a taxi, but none of the taxi companies were picking up - it was a Saturday night and they were all busy. So the man at reception offered to shuttle us down to the 02 himself at no extra charge!! (He didn't leave the reception unattended or anything, there was a woman there too). He was lovely and chatty and really went out of his way for us. The woman was there again the next morning and was lovely aswell - chatting away to us asking about the gig etc 

Couldn't recommend this hotel more. Had a lovely stay and will defo be back soon :)",5,2013,01,27
247,A LITTLE GEM,"I have stayed at the Sandymount Hotel previously called Mount Herbert Hotel many times, a hidden gem, excellent location, fantastic staff (particularly Beatrice) on reception.
Well done to all and continued success.

247,Successful,"As a teacher to a group of 38 students who were competing in the Young Scientist competition in the RDS our stay was very pleasent in this hotel. We have been coming here for the past 8 years and have always found the place clean, comfortable with a friendly and hard working staff. The breakfast is excellent and the dinners were always top quality. We will be coming back next year and having won the competition 3 times while staying in the hotel we dont intend ruining our luck.",4,2013,01,21
247,BT Young Scientist,"I was competing in the BT Young Scientist Exhibition in the RDS and stayed in the hotel Sandymount hotel where I had a very enjoyable experience.  Even though the hotel was packed with noisy teenagers the staff were still so friendly and willing to help you, no matter what hour of the night it was! I really enjoyed my stay, the food was brilliant, the service was fantastic and the rooms were unbelievably comfortable. Thank you staff of the Sandymount Hotel and we hope to see you next year!",4,2013,01,19
247,Great hotel with great staff,"We recently brought a group of students to stay at the Sandymount hotel while attending a local competition.  I have stayed here a number of times over the last 8 years, generally with hockey or school groups, and on every occasion it has been an incredibly enjoyable stay.  The rooms, food, facilities, wifi etc. are very good. In particular however it is the staff, from reservations to reception to the catering staff, that have made our stay so pleasant.  They always been incredibly helpful and accommodating, something that is very much appreciated when you are looking after a group.  The students too also consistently comment on how pleasant they find the atmosphere in the hotel.
The hotel is within easy walking distance of the RDS, Pembroke Wanderers, the Aviva and the DART line. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for group accommodation in this area.",5,2013,01,18
247,Friendly and good value but hardly a boutique hotel,"Stayed over one night for a family gathering. Although a bit out of town, the Sandymount is in a quiet, pleasant residential neighbourhood only a few stops south of the city centre on the DART line. Good first impressions - warm welcome, efficient reception, nice public rooms with modern decor (the hotel was apparently facelifted in 2011), free use of computers and printer, and reasonable free parking facilities. Away from front-of-house it's a bit of a rabbit warren - hardly surprising as it has grown organically from just four rooms in a mid-Victorian house fifty-odd years ago to occupy an entire terrace, with modern additions to the rear pushing its capacity to a Tardis-like 168 bedrooms.
Room facilities were clean with comfortable beds (ours was a double + single, though we'd only booked a double), simple but tasteful modern furnishing, an adequate bathroom with powerful shower but desperately cheap loo paper and thin towels (and if the management reads this, the extractor fan in 202 seems to be knackered). No mini-bar though, a minus point when the residents' bar closed shortly after midnight (on a Saturday night? in Ireland??).
Value for money though at just on £80 (95 euros) reserved via a booking site, particularly bearing in mind the generous and unhurried breakfast - and full marks for serving until 11am on Sunday mornings to allow the coffee and tasty 'full Irish' time to fight off the Guinness and whiskey fumes from the night before...
If we stay in Dublin again, we'll certainly consider returning to the Sandymount. The staff try hard to please, it's comfortable, family run and friendly, but they really should check out what real boutique hotels cost before making any claims to be one...",4,2013,01,14
247,Great Hotel all round,"I have been meaning to write a review for the Sandymount hotel for a long time now. My partner and I live in Kilkenny and would often travel to Dublin for rugby matches and nights out. 

We have stayed at this hotel three times now and have never been disappointed. The rooms are modern, clean and the right temperature (a personal issue of mine when hotel rooms are too warm and you have to open a window..total waste of energy!). The staff all around the hotel were really welcoming and friendly. The second time we went up we had gotten a deal online for a restaurante, I had forgotten to print out our voucher but luckily one of the girls from the reception was really kind and printed it out for me free of charge. My partner also loved the breakfasts, they had a large buffet where you can eat as much as you like. The staff were constantly bringing out freshly cooked food so it was always nice and warm. I myself love the continental breakfast - lots of cereals, fruit, youghurts etc.

All in all I couldnt fault the hotel really. It is a little bit out of town but its a 4-5 min walk to the Dart station and the reception have organised taxis for us in the past so its never really been an issue...and you literally cant get a closer hotel for matches in Landsdown. 

All in all its a great spot and I have recommended it to a few friends who have always been happy too so Im confident in recommending it to anyone else :)",5,2013,01,13
247,The prices jump for special events ...,"I was back here for my second visit recently. It's ok value for € 69. But it is a very  old premises. Nearby the old Jury's, Berkeley Court and Burlington hotels are better value.
 What shocked me  here was when I asked to book for a forthcoming event.       Due to a concert in the RDS the rate jumped to           € 199 for B& B. This is a disgrace and smacks of the greed that gave this country the "" Celtic Tiger""...These guys ripped us off in the good times. Now they just wait for the next chance.... They don't learn. I hope we the customers do. I have.",2,2012,12,28
247,Great for business traveller,"I travel to Dublin a lot on business and stay in the Sandymount any time I need a bed for the night. They have a great rate for business travellers and the staff are so friendly and helpful.  The only negative would be the breakfast sausages, not to my liking but that's probably more personal taste than anything.   I will be a regular visitor in 2013. ",5,2012,12,14
247,a long way from....,"The hotel is a little bit away from the city center but you can take the train to get into the city center. Its right next to the stadium, so for people who want to see a game its perfect. The room and hotel was clean and parking was no problem neither. Its just such a long walk to the room and so complicated to get the luggage from the car to the room.. its an ok hotel but next time i would choose one closer to the center of dublin.",3,2012,12,09

What a great location - could walk to the Aviva in less than 2 minutes. The staff were really great and so friendly. Can't comment on them enough. The room was also great - fantastic value with an amazing breakfast the next morning. Can really highly recommend staying here!!!,5,2012,12,02
247,Had lunch elsewhere,"Travelled to Dublin Saturday 24th Nov for Ireland - Argentina rugby match at Aviva stadium.
We got to what used to be the Mount Herbert early as we have done previous years, intending to have lunch at the hotel.We got there about  12 and entered car park which was virtually empty and there was a notices which stated for use of patrons only.We assumed as we were going to have lunch we were patrons but to be sure we enquired at Reception. We informed reception we were going to have lunch and drinks at the hotel, but were informed we could not use the car park but should park on road outside. We knew this was parked up by media vans. After driving around and parking elsewhere we had a nice lunch elsewhere.
At least we will know  not to bother with the Sandymount / Mount Herbert in future.
We have stayed there many times in the past and also parked and lunched there over many years.
I understand that parking is necessary for residents but there did seem to be adequate parking",3,2012,11,30

247,Great value and great service,"We wanted to spend a copule of days in Dublin and so booked in to the Sandymount Hotel.  It offers great value and great service (we had stayed here before) - from the moment we checked in to the time we checked out we felt really at home.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious and it was easy to get a very good night's sleep.  Breakfast was very good with the food kept nice and hot - the restaurant staff were both friendly and helpful.  We had lunch in the bar one day and this was excellent and our evening meal was very good also.  As we don't have a car the location was excellent - very convenient to Landsdowne Rd Dart station and both Sandymount village and Ballsbridge were within easy walking distance for a greater choice of places to eat.  We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to a return visit.",5,2012,11,23
247,"Excellent, Home from Home","I stayed in the Sandymount Hotel for three/four nights weekly for 14 weeks for work purposes.
I found the hotel to be very comfortable, and in terms of friendliness and atmosphere, very much a home from home.
I ate in the restaurant on several occasions and found the food excellent and very good value.
The staff were always very friendly and accommodating.
The location is ideal in terms of access to public transport, and the city centre is a brisk 25/30 minute walk if you have time to avail of the exercise and fresh air.
Overall, my stay was most enjoyable and I would have no hesitation in staying there again or in recommending same to friends/colleagues.

Every single staff member was super friendly and showed genuine concern for how my stay was going, this was a huge plus seeing how I have not been to Ireland before. They gave me excellent directions, recommendations on where to go for various things. Kudos to them!

Room was a slight disappointment for me. While I was expecting the rooms to be smaller than the average hotel in Canada/USA, the pictures shown and what I got were very different. That being said, sleep quality was good and did the job for me for one night and 55euro.

Location is perfect. Right next to the DART and Aviva Stadium. Definitely worth a stay.",4,2012,11,17
247,Much Improved and a pleasant stay !!,"I did return after a disastrous stay in April 2012, booking 2 adjacent rooms (215 & 216, a twin for the kids and executive double for us.) Some goodwill on the hotels behalf after my last trip was well received by my family. The manager Mr Loughran was at reception and took the time to greet us. Great sized rooms, clean, well appointed with a double and single bed in each room. 
We used the Dart again for some retail therapy and enjoyed a family meal in an American Diner called Eddie Rockets in Dublin city. Good fast food, reasonably priced and a busy spot.
Breakfast next morning was spot on, full selection of hot and cold choices on offer. We checked out and headed home pleased with our stay.
Well done Sandymount, and if I can offer one bit of advice after reading a similar recent review: 
Try to manage the sporting event weekends (lucrative as they are) without losing focus on the hotel residents.
I will return soon.",4,2012,11,12

247,One night stay.,"We booked the Sandymount Hotel because it was close to Dublin city centre as we were shopping for 2 days around the capital.
We payed 170 euro for a double room which looked well on the website but did not live up to the online picture as we entered the room. It was tacky and small.
There was a match on at the Aviva stadium the same night, so had we know this we would not have booked in there. At the bar or drinks were served in plastic cups and when the crowds entered the hotel the reception counter soon became a resting place for beer.
There was also no room service because the hotel obviously just wanted to cater for persons who were attending the match.
In the morning the shower could only manage to give close to warm water. 
Looking forward to shopping in Dublin again but I would not stay in this hotel again even if there was no match on and it was at a budget price.",1,2012,11,11
247,Ideal location for Aviva,"Just returned from staying at the Sandymount Hotel and watching the Ireland v. South Africa match at the Aviva.  Was able to get an amazing deal through searching the internet for a hotel close to the stadium (literally 1 minutes walks away) , £68 for a double room including breakfast and only booked three weeks before a rugby international - could not believe my luck!  The hotel could not be faulted, friendly efficient reception staff (kindly getting us a taxi when we found out the DART would not be running early enough for us to get the Enterprise back to Belfast), meals were excellent and very good value for money!  Surprising although we had only paid a cheaper price than usual the room was on the ground floor close to reception and not at all noisy and very comfortable.  Pre and post match atmosphere was great, only downside was the result! Will definitely choose the Sandymount again next time we are down for the rugby.",5,2012,11,11
247,Nice but..........,"The first thing to be noted is that this is an old building.  Therefore things like creaky floors and below par plumbing are to be expected.  I booked this mostly for its proximity to the RDS as we were going to an event there.  The receptionist gave us very clear directions on arrival.  She gave us our key, marked 229 and we headed down to the room.  Unfortunately, as we opened the door we found that this room was already occupied.  It was extremely embarrassing trying to explain that we were given the key to the room and apologising, but thankfully the family understood it was not our fault.  Back to reception where we were met with apologies and were asked if the guests were actually in the room.  We only had a few minutes before we had to leave for the RDS, so didnt look too much at our room then.  To be fair when we arrived back, there was a note under the door apologising for the mix up and offering us a free drink in the bar.  We would have taken them up on this if we hadnt our daughter with us, but she was a bit too tired to be hanging around the bar.  Having read previous reviews, I was expecting a pretty basic room.  It was clean, a lot of things the cleaners wouldn't be able to do much about, such as old worn taps and shower fittings.  It was very spacious, plenty of room for all the shopping we had done that day. The room was absolutely roasting and I have a feeling, again being an old building, that these rooms probably only come in two temperatures, freezing or boiling.  We left the windows open for comfort and were pleasantly surprised that we werent woken by street noise.  It was in the middle of the week, maybe we wouldn't have been so lucky on the weekend!  The breakfast was nice and fresh for a buffet.  Overall we had a nice stay,  its in a great location, but I think for what you get it is overpriced.  As for our room mix up, I wouldnt have thought much of it if I hadnt read 3 other reviews written in the past few months with similar experiences.  They did make a good will gesture as an apology, which was fine by me, but had I been the person in the room with strangers walking in on me, I would have gone absolutely ballistic.",3,2012,11,10
247,Cup Final Weekend,Just back from our 2nd stay at the Sandymount & was excellent. We stayed Friday until Sunday & it was like a home from home. We were down for the FAI Ford Cup Final in the Aviva and the proximity of the Hotel to the ground is just made for such a stay. The room was very comfortable and warm and we had a nice view out onto Herbert Road. The Staff were superb with a special mention to Steph on the reception (an absolute diamond) and Sylvia who looked after us with so much attention in the Restaurant. Going to the Final on Sunday the Hotel let us stay later in our room and then looked after our cases until we returned after the game to collect them. The place was buzzing with supporters before and after having a great atmosphere. Nothing is to much trouble for the staff and we look forward to returning in the near future!,5,2012,11,05
247,pleasantly surprised,"Just back from a night in Sandymount.
Everything was positive incl the price.
Nice big room contrary to other reviewers and very pleasant staff, esp. Sian, Chantal and Curtis.
Good situation near the Aviva - though I'm sure it's pretty impossible to get booked there on Rugby weekends - and five mins to Dart (local trains) which take about 10-15 mins to Dublin city centre. Had a great meal in the bar which was restaurant standard and a great night's sleep",4,2012,11,03
247,Location Location Location,"I stayed at this hotel during the Dublin Marathon, the location was ideal for this event as it was just a short walk to the start line. Also recomended if you are attending any event at the Aviva stadium which is just down the road.
The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. They really catered for everyone taking part in the marathon at breakfast and late checkouts etc.
The room was basic enough but had everything that you needed.

Would Definately stay in this hotel again.",5,2012,10,31
247,A hotel for very short stay,Hotel Sandymount is located just behind the Aviva stadium and very conveniently located. The rooms are very cramped and bath is just enough to squeeze in. The rooms are clean though. Located it in a nice residential locality you can take a good walk through the neighbourhood. The lounge in the hotel is pretty good. It is close to the Aviva stadium station and is well connected.,3,2012,10,28
247,"Nice first impression, doesn't follow through","We stayed at the Sandymount for the Notre Dame vs Navy game this September. It was a late minute booking and we chose the Sandymount due to its location to Aviva Stadium. On first impression the hotel looks great with a stylish lobby and polite staff. It is also in a great location if you are seeing something at the stadium given that it is less than five minutes walk (although it is a good 40 minute walk from Dublin city centre). 

Unfortunately what lets the hotel down is the room itself. We were placed in a ground floor room which unfortunately smelt like damp. The door had been left open for our arrival which was a bit odd but the motive for this (to essentially air the room out) became clear the longer we stayed in the room. Our room was directly below the main lobby which has thin, creaking floor boards so when the hotel is busy, which it inevitably is when there is an event on at Aviva, the noise of people walking is heard constantly in the room. 

We only spent a night in the hotel and it was used only as somewhere to sleep before taking a flight back the next morning. For this it serves its purpose just fine and we were too tired after a long day to mind too much about it but if we had been staying for much longer we would have requested to be moved rooms.",3,2012,10,24
247,Worst hotel experience ever had...,".. and that might be an understatement. After we had to wait for 45 minutes to be able to check in. We went to the bar for a coke, which appeared to be open for quite a while already, as it was not sparkling at all. When we went to our rooms and opened the door, the rooms were already occupied! Never seen that before. We went back to the reception, and they handled it like it was a normal case. ""Whoops, sorry"" was all they could get out. Next step was that we got a ""smoking allowed"" room. ""Sorry hotel is full"" was the statement. After we went a bit mad it appeared that we could go for a business room. ""Enjoy your stay!"" was what they said. At least, we could go for a normal night sleep. When I went for a shower in the morning, no water came out of the shower. Maintenance could not get it fixed, so no acceptable shower that day. When we checked out, we asked for a refund. All they could say: ""sorry not possible. have a nice day. Next!""",1,2012,10,20
247,Good value,"Clean, comfortable.  Friendly, accomodating staff :  let us check in at 6 AM after our all night flight.  Convenient--2 blocks from metro.  Loved the keychain with the hotel name and address ""just in case"".",5,2012,10,17
247,Loved it first time - don't think i'll be going back after the 2nd!!!,"Stayed for the westlife concert in June and after my first stay the previous year, I was happy to return but very unhappy leaving!!!! 
Staff - Reception were great, as well as housekeeping. Even got a free bottle of wine for my first review...but the restaurant and bar staff was another story. I like staff in service jobs to be courtious, funny and helpful, not moody,ignorant and sour. One member of staff even shouted at another staff member in front of us when we were paying one day. Also our first evening caused confusion as we were told we had to eat carvery and could not order from the bar menu..after 20mins of waiting, we were then told we could in fact order. My mother and I ordered steak sandwich in which it came on timber board which i found was extremely unhygienic way of traying up food to a paying customer. 

Rooms were comfortable and clean. Food was ok, but don't think I'll be going back to the hotel!!",3,2012,10,12
247,Ok - reasonable value,"Reasonable hotel that is clean and good value, especially midweek and well located for many things in Dublin. It has free parking but not a lot of it. 

The hotel is a little creaking and the walls quite thin but you will get a night's sleep. 

The food in the bar was poor but maybe I picked the wrong dish. Don't eat risotto and stick to traditional bar food fare and you will probably be ok.

There is free wifi and the staff are both helpful and friendly.",3,2012,10,12
247,Average hotel,"Stayed recently, rooms clean and comfortable. The breakfast was very ordinary, nothing remarkable. The food in the bar was very poor and the seating is extremely uncomfortable for eating, however there are plenty of restaurants in the area, so this needn't be an issue. It was quiet at night which is an advantage.",3,2012,10,10
247,Pleasant - but pricey,"A pleasant stay but strange room pricing: over a 5 night stay the price ranged from 109-260 euro - and different every night! Whilst pleasant it didn't justify the upper price range. I guess being a stone's throw from Lansdowne Park stadium might have something to do with it but I wasn't there to go to a game or concert. The staff were great, breakfast was excellent and the rooms a good size. Gripes: the room safe was so complicated to use that I managed to lock it inadvertantly, had to get help from a porter and didn't bother with it after that. The table/desk was very small and mostly taken up by a large tea/coffee tray so poor for working. And I wasn't very impressed with the bar food. I would score this place higher but it really was very expensive and didn't offer anything to justify this.",3,2012,10,08
247,Fantastic Time at the Sandymount,"Traveling in a Group of 5 Friends from Australia we had Great respose from the staff at the hotel , Michelle Sweeney was our contact , from the very begining 4 months prior to our trip . any questions we had were emailed back to us straight away & also aditional information on getting from the airport & general help on Dublin tours etc. On our arrival we were greeted well , after a 24 hour flight we needed tender care & we got it ! showen straight to our lovely rooms & pointed into the direction of all the hotel services . meals were Fantastic ( Best Breakfast in Ireland & we were traveling around for 18 days ,we know!!) & I was even given Provisions & catering for a impromptue family get together . Check out was Prompte & efficient . Thanks Michelle & all the staff at the Sandymount for a Fantastic stay , looking forward to staying again Cheers Brian",5,2012,10,04
247,Fabulous stay,"I stayed in the Sandymount Hotel recently & had a wonderful experience.
The staff were exceptional I had dealings with Michelle, Rose & many other staff who were very helpful & friendly. The food in the bar was terrific, the rooms were spacious & lovely decorated.
I would highly recommend this hotel & would definately stay here again. I booked on e bookers & got a great deal. Great variety in the breakfast room the next morning.",5,2012,10,03
247,Stranger in my bed....and I'm relocated room late at night,Myself and 4 friends (all female) stayed at the Sandymount for a concert weekend at the end of June 2012. We booked 2 rooms in the hotel (a room for 3 and a room for 2) for 2 nights. One of our party didbt arrive until the 2nd day therefore none of our belongings were left in the room. On our second night we arrived back into our room to find a stranger asleep in the bed... So as not to startle the unaware guest that we were in the room we returned to reception to be told there was a misunderstanding. We were given what could be described as a cupboard for a room for the night (but due to the shock of the situation we stayed with our friends in their room- 5 in a room for 3). This really dampened the experience of the stay for all involved. On departure we expressed our dissatisfaction to the receptionist who was not on duty the previous night. She took our details and said that the duty manager would contact us. We then contacted the hotel on a few occasions and still have not had a satisfactory offer of goodwill or equivalent for this abysmal experience. In my opinion it is poor customer service and the fact that our room (for the second night of our stay) was also rented out causes great concern not to mention the invasion of privacy (luckily our belongings were not in the room at the time) that should be at the forefront of the hotel business. ,1,2012,10,02
247,Good place in Dublin,"This hotel is good value for money. The staff are very friendly and the great bonus is the free car parking facility, and of course the free Wi-fi throughout the hotel. The hotel is situated in a good location and in a quiet area. There are also rooms which allow smoking, a facility which is becoming rare in most Irish hotels.",5,2012,10,01
247,Friendly and quaint,"We stayed at this hotel for the Navy v. Notre Game.  It is a great hotel for anyone going to an event at Aviva Stadium.  It is also a short walk to Ballsbridge and we even walked to City Center and Red Bar area from the hotel.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  They quickly mailed to me (back in Maryland) my jacket I had left in the lobby.  The rooms are on the smaller side as are the hallways but that would not prevent me from going back.  Overall we had a very nice stay in the hotel.
Btw-  the Baked Cod dish served in the restaurant was amazing!",4,2012,09,27
247,quiet and comfortable,"Just what needed for a break away, room was clean and comfortable and had a good few nights sleep. Hotel had a bar and restaurant. Only had the breakfast so cant comment on all the food, but that was good. 
Hotel is perfect if you are going to aviva stadium as it is just down the road. But is also good for dublin centre. It is a nice 20 minute walk into the centre or 2/3 stops on the dart. 
There is not much else around which means it is very quiet so you get a good night sleep unlike being in the centre.

All in all would return if i came back to dublin",4,2012,09,26
247,quaint and comfortable,"Our room was large enough, clean and comfortable.  Bathroom has not been updated, left a little to be desired.  Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful, however.  I contacted them by email when I realized I had left a jacket in the closet, and they quickly mailed both it (and pants my husband had left) to our home here in the U.S.",4,2012,09,25
247,I stayed in a horse box of a room.,"I stayed recently. I was told the hotel was almost booked out when I arrived. It was my first and last time staying here. The room I was given was dark with no real window.The bathroom had rusty rails.the carpet was yucky... The TV must have come from local museum. I asked at reception about a better room. "" no way... We are fully booked...."". I was told with a grin by the "" smart but articulate receptionist. I checked out the following day. I had intended in extending my stay as my partner was due to join me. No way would you stay here with your "" loved one"".  I went to the far superior Burlington Hotel, excellent. I'll be back.",2,2012,09,23
247,A very comfortable & friendly hotel,"The hotel is a pleasant 20 - 30 min walk from the centre of Dublin, and close to the DART for those not inclined to walking, or if the weather is not cooperating. My room was clean and comfortable, the restaurant had very good food, and all the the staff were friendly and helpful. Overall a pleasant stay and good value for money.",5,2012,09,17
247,Great Location,"This hotel is in a great location beside train station and Aviva station. Its just about a 10 Euro ride in a taxi into city centre. There is plenty parking. The hotel its-self is very tired looking as far as interior is concerned. Tiny lifts are dodgy and our one broke down during our stay - they take for ever to arrive at your floor. Staff friendly. We stayed in a Suite on 4th Floor which was a reasonable size but I saw some of the rooms on the other floors and they were quiet small. Rooms are clean.
Breakfast was disappointing  - Buffet Style and only barely warm food.
All in all it was just ok. We were not looking for anything very fancy on this particular occasion so therefore we weren't too disappointment. Its biggest advantage is its location.",3,2012,09,17
247,"Great location, good food, disappointing accommodation","Being a converted row of Victorian houses in one of Dublin's most upmarket residential areas, this hotel blends nicely into its surroundings. It's a very quiet location, at least when there are no events on at the Aviva Stadium a stone's throw away, and within easy walking distance of the RDS, where we were attending an event. It's also only a short bus or taxi ride into Dublin city centre.

The directions to the hotel on its website were concise and accurate, at least from our direction, which was a good start -- it's amazing how many hotels just stick a Google Map on their page and leave you to figure them out for yourself, without even checking that the marker is in the right place.

Once you check in and wander out of the reception area, unfortunately there's precious little sign of the ""boutique hotel"" feel that the hotel advertises. If you're expecting to see unique interior design, colour, lighting, or artistic touches, either period or modern, then this isn't the hotel for you. What you will see is lots of white and magnolia walls, and bland, modern structures thrown up around the back of the property.

We didn't spend much time in our room (210), which was basic but comfortable enough, and by the sound of it, had fairly thin walls. It had both a bath and a shower, which I like, even though I usually end up not using the bath anyway! Tea- and coffee-making facilities were provided in the usual kettle + sachets manner, and followed the Irish norm of not providing any biscuits to go with them -- again, not really what I'd call a ""boutique hotel"" approach. Likewise, the nondescript furniture, magnolia walls, single monochrome abstract print and standard issue bathroom suite made it look and feel like pretty much any other three-star hotel, anywhere.

The deal we booked included dinner in the bar rather than the restaurant. The ambience and decor was pleasant enough there (though again, picture any chain hotel bar anywhere, and you're picturing this one), but the menu could have used a bit more variety -- my wife isn't overly keen on tuna, beef, mushrooms or garlic, for example, and that pretty much wiped out most of the menu for her. If you can find something you like, though, it's good quality fare. My chowder starter was creamy and loaded with seafood, my t-bone steak was perfectly cooked if just a bit on the fatty side, and the toffee and caramel ice cream cake rounded it all off nicely.

Back in the room after dinner, the main problem was the heat. It had been a warm, but not particularly hot day. But even though the single non-sealed window in the room was open all day, it was absolutely roasting during the night, and there was no air conditioning. And since there was a single bed (which we hadn't requested and weren't using) between our double and that solitary window, putting it a good 10 feet away from where we were actually sleeping, there was little chance of feeling any cooling breeze through it at all. That made for a rather uncomfortable night of fitful sleep.

The cooked breakfast next morning was, according to my wife, one of the best she's had in a while. I went for a more continental option myself, but was disappointed to find the choice was basically cereal or toast -- there were no croissants, pastries, fruits or even pots of yoghurt to be seen. That pretty much summed up our stay… some things pretty good, some things really not.",3,2012,09,17
247,""" Another enjoyable stay""",Hotel in a lovely area and close to train station.Enjoyed breakfast and no problem ordering porridge which was not on the menu. Great selection of food  available in bar. Lovely  comfortable clean room. Staff in all sections of the hotel were so helpful and friendly.We look forward to our next visit.  Siobhán,5,2012,09,14
247,This is a hidden treasure but in a fantastic location.,"The location of this hotel is just great, you could throw a stone into Evita  Stadium. Taxis are close and the buses run into down-town every 10 minutes. The rooms are very comfortable with all the right amenities, it has a great bar and a nice restaurant. The staff could not be more helpful, John the owner walked by each table at the restaurant in the morning and asked everyone how their stay was going and if they could help with anything ETC. He took the time to chat with everyone and made you feel totally welcome. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Great value, great location, great management and staff and wonderful old beautiful buildings remodelled into a first class hotel.",5,2012,09,14
247,Return Visit,"Yet again we stayed at the Sandymount and yet again we were made to feel welcome and relaxed. The staff are very professional yet still have the time to have a chat to you. 
The room was clean and tidy and the food was of good quality. Yes we will be returning again.",4,2012,09,11
247,"Nice, clean, friendly !","The Sandymount is quite good ! The hotel is nice, rooms are clean and well decorated. The hotel is located in a quiet location, 2mn walk away from the train station and 2 stops away from downdown (10mn more or less). The only drawbacks : breakfast was not so varied and tasty (for 8euros it's not worth it) and the internet connection was slow. But that's pretty much it, otherwise I really recommend the Sandymount.",4,2012,09,11
247,Website is very misleading!,"We booked this hotel a few hours before arriving in Dublin. I looked at availability and found this free. The price seemed good and it had parking and free wifi. The pictures on its website looked really good. Totally misleading!! I have no idea where/if in the hotel they have rooms similar to those advertised on their website but we certainly had a room that was a poor poor relation. Of their own official photos they are accurate up to the point of showing the rooms. 

The location of this hotel couldn't be surpassed thats for sure. Ample parking and relatively nice reception. Pity that the guy who booked us in forced me to walk away as he continued to 'snort' disgustingly as he spoke to us. Even my husband found it pretty horrible. 

We had a preview of what the room might be like once we entered the lift. This needs some cleaning up. But the room was so dissappointing. It was less than basic. The curtains were falling down in some places, and the tv was a tiny old contraption stuck up high on a press in the far corner. The water in the bathroom is from the mains which I thought would be a concern but it wasn't. The power was great and the temperature fab. However you couldn't open the window and the entire place was covered in steam within a few mins. A number of the photographs on this tripadivsor website showing the pretty yeeeuccckkk nature of the rooms are very accurate. 

The breakfast wasn't at all impressive but enough to get by. I would consider this hotel a 3-star. I am completely shocked that there is a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence on their webpage. 

The wifi was free and was a great service. 

This is the perfect location for the Aviva Stadium, and if you were going to a game/concert and planned on sleeping for a few hours after a few drinks then you would be ok here. Personally I wouldn't return.",3,2012,09,10
247,Ideal.,"Perfect location. Rooms clean, some rooms quiet small but not all.  Staff very friendly and professional. Food is fantastic. Right beside the aviva stadium.  In a quiet part of Dublin.... Well worth the money you pay for it.",4,2012,09,08
247,LOVELY LOCATION,"Stayed here on weekend of tall ships festival. really couldn't fault it. Location is its prime asset, a leafy suburb close to many amenities. The DART rail link is just around the corner and city centre just five minutes away. would advise people to go in the opposite direction also - Dun Laoghaire a lovely place for a stroll along the pier or a coffee in the many bars and restaurants. The Sandymount hotel is a series of houes joined up, well laid out inside. Breakfast was adequate, served in a very impressive dining room. We ate in the bar on our first night and were so impressed did likewise on second night. Lovely meals served with a smile. Overall no complaints and look forward to returning soon.",4,2012,09,06
247,very convenient for Aviva Stadium,This was our 1st stay in this hotel and it was an enjoyable and relaxing experience. Its very convenient for the Aviva stadium and there is a dart station just around the corner. Parking is free in the hotel. The family room was very small but comfortable with a good supply of tea/ coffee making supplies. Complimentary shampoo and bath products are also supplied. All the staff were very friendly and there was no problem in booking in early as our ferry arrived into Dublin at 10am. The receptionist was very helpful when we enquired about the splash tours and she booked us on the 5pm tour straight away. We booked in on a room only rate so we bought breakfast vouchers the following morning. Breakfast was a feast but I thought that €10 for a 9 year old child was too expensive. Overall we had a great stay in the Sandymount Hotel and we would definitely stay again. Thank you to all the hard working staff.,4,2012,09,02
247,"Great Location, Good Looking Front of House, Terrible Bedrooms","From the outside the hotel is very nice. The reception areas are well decorated and gives a very good impression of the hotel, however the same cannot be said about the actual rooms.

The room I stayed in is quite possibly one of the worst I have ever experienced. The showers simply cut in and out, as well as between hot and cold. The room is basic and in extreme need of decoration. The bathroom had a window (not privacy glass) into the car park with no blinds, allowing anyone in it to watch you shower. The desk and bedside tables had a lot of damage and the overall impression of the room was terrible.

Would I stay again or recommend it? No.",1,2012,09,01
247,"Good hotel, great location, good breakfast","Friendly, helpful staff. Clean rooms of adequate size. Great breakfast and it's served up until a civilised time (11am) for those who have enjoyed Dublin's night-life the night before!

247,Enjoyable Stay,"This was our first stay in the Sandymount Hotel and it proved to be an enjoyable experience.  It was just a 15 minute walk to the Grand Canal Theatre where we went to see the show Chicago.  The staff were friendly and our room was tidy, clean and comfortable.  We had a tasty lunch and the breakfast was nice and filling.  The hotel is in a nice quiet area and just a stone's throw from the spectacular Aviva stadium.",4,2012,08,29
247,Home Away from Home,"I'm in Dublin on business and in my third week of a six-week stay at the Sandymount Hotel. I can't say enough about how John, the owner of the hotel, and the entire staff (especially the staff at the front desk) have helped to make me and my colleague feel at home. 

While the standard double rooms are somewhat small and have little storage space, I was able to get extra hangers for the wardrobe which helped tremendously.  The newly renovated bathroom, on the other hand, is quite spacious.  Everything is immaculately clean; housekeeping does a great job.

The food at the restaurant is surprisingly high quality for hotel fare.  While I'm not a big ""chips"" eater, the fish in the ""Fish & Chips"" is excellent; giant pieces of thinly breaded cod, cooked to perfection...and one dish is enough for two people.  They also have curries, burgers, etc.

The modern look of the restaurant/bar keeps it from having a true ""pub"" atmosphere.  But, the hard-working servers are as friendly as in a pub, despite their constant multi-tasking.  Service is ""unhurried'"" (meaning don't come if you're in a hurry to eat and run) and no one rushes me out if I want to sit and read the paper after a meal.  

The place apparently has a great reputation with locals...I've already seen three or four private parties catered in the restaurant (christening, birthday parties, receptions, etc.)  

A Continental and/or hot Irish Breakfast is served buffet style every morning.  If you don't care for the fried eggs that are barely cooked (yuk!) all you have to do is ask and they will prepare eggs to your taste...which do come quickly.  Breakfast begins at 7 am - that was just about 10 minutes too late for my colleague and I to have a hot breakfast before leaving to commute to our office.  We mentioned something to the front desk...and suddenly breakfast is available about 10 minutes earlier on weekdays!  

As good as the food is, it's still difficult to live on hotel food and the same menu for six weeks.  My colleague and I asked if there were any room refrigerators available so we could stock up on a few groceries at the nearby Tesco.  No...no minibars at this hotel.  But about three days later I walked into my room to find a newly-purchased dorm-sized mini-fridge waiting to be plugged in!  My colleague had one in his room as well.  Wow!

Because of a big event nearby, the hotel has two nights during our six weeks that have been sold out for two years.  I opted to visit friends out of town that weekend; John invited my colleague to stay in a private family area of the property if he got stuck for a place to stay.

Some cynics might say, ""Sure they are treating you like that because you are staying so long.""  Maybe.  But my background includes 15+ years in customer service with international hotel chains (which John wouldn't know about unless he reads this review).  I know what it takes to provide service that takes care of you.""...and then some.""  This isn't just something made up; it has to be in the DNA of the property leadership to treat people well.  

The place has some opportunities for improvement (for example, more or larger storage drawers and rotating the dinner menu once in awhile) And people still have their good and bad days..(guests as well as employees)...so, it's not perfect.  But when you are treated well, some of the other challenges aren't that big a deal.

I'd stay here again in a heartbeat whether or not my employer was footing the bill!",5,2012,08,27
247,Great place to stay,We've stayed here on 4 occasions now and would go back.  It's in a great quiet location close to a DART station and some nice restaurants.  The staff are always friendly and helpful.  The hotel itself is clean and modern.,4,2012,08,27
247,Family break,We stayed with you on Sunday July 12th for one night.We really enjoyed our break.Previously knew the Sandymount as the Mt Herbert.On arrival your receptionist was very welcoming and helpful with any queries we had.We were allocated room 214 very clean and comfortable.It was our first time staying at the SH and will definitely be back.Many thanks for sending on my jacket,5,2012,08,25
247,Friendly & clean,"We Stayed 3 nights here, in August 2012.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was basic, clean and comfortable, but with a bit of a stale smell.
The water in the shower kept going hot and cold, and it was hard to get it to stay a constant temperature.
Breakfast was lovely.
Location is good.
There is free WIFI, but a strange system of connecting, which takes a bit of time.
The place has character.
The hotel is huge, and it could be a struggle if you have large luggage.
Overall, we were very happy with value for money, and would stay again.",4,2012,08,22
247,"Great location, great bar food","Amazing value in a central location . Beautiful area to walk through. For joggers I highly recommend sandymount strand, run around the peninsula to the lighthouse and back. One downfall is that the $10 breakfasts were cold every time. Will stay again",4,2012,08,22
247,Fantastic hotel,"Myself and my partner stayed here on August 18th2012...was a busy period with horse show in Dublin...got well looked after when we had a small problem nothing serious..the manner of help we received was fantastic ..the staff are a pleasure ,I will be staying here again",5,2012,08,19
247,For RDS or Aviva its No 1,Stayed at the Sandymount Hotel with my daughter for a Trip to The Dublin Horse Show. The hotel is less than a Ten Minute stroll  to The RDS and Two Minutes from The Aviva Stadium. Car-parking was fine and Reception and Check in were helpful and efficient  The Room we had 205 was an Executive  Room was a good size and clean. My only slight problem walls were a bit thin so when next door came back in the early hours we heard every word but this didn't last long or spoil our stay. The staff were lovely  in the Restaurant at Reception and at the Bar they were efficient and friendly. Dinner and Breakfast were tasty and overall we enjoyed our stay and will return. Thank you.,4,2012,08,19
247,Bank Holiday Weekend in August 2012,"We stayed for two nights in this hotel and got a great bed and breakfast rate. Its next to the aviva stadium and around the corner from the Landsdowne DART station. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the decor is fresh, modern and elegant. It was wonderfully quiet at night and it has free parking. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,08,18
247,I'd definitely stay there again,"Stayed one night at the hotel and got a great dinner, bed and breakfast rate.  The hotel is in a wonderful location.  It's right next to the Aviva stadium and Landsdowne Road DART station which is less than a 10 minute journey into the city centre.  Sandymount village with its strand and Martello tower are just a ten minute walk away as is Ballsbridge and a great choice of restaurants.  The hotel itself has a garden area to the front and rear.  The rooms are comfortable and clean.  Both dinner (in the bar) and breakfast (self-service) were excellent.  The staff are extremely pleasant. The only thing to be aware of is that the reception is accessed via some steep steps; however which might be problematic for people with mobility issues; however, there is a disabled access to the left.",5,2012,08,16
247,One of the Best,"I've had the pleasure of staying in the Sandymount on several occassions now. I use it any time I go to Dublin for whatever (if its available) and its only gotten better every time.

Its close to everything really, its a short taxi ride to the O2, fifteen minute walk from the Bord Gais, ten minutes from the RDS, and you trip over the Aviva on your way into the hotel.

The hotel itself is beautiful, made up of several old houses which add to the charm of the place, its always clean and well presented. The rooms are perfect for a city break and have everything you need. On arrival the receptionist was friendly and welcoming, and they also have free parking (A rare commodity in Dublin)

The staff are absolutely great and can't do enough for you. But on this trip in particular I really ahve to commend the bar and particularly the food. Back when I first stayed here about five or six years ago. The food was okay. This time it was superb. Everything I ate (and I ate a lot) was delicious. The staff were attentive without being in your face. I really couldn't have asked for anymore.

All in all, this was my favourite stay in the Sandymount and I can't wait until I have an excuse to stay there again. I would without a moments hesitation recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2012,08,12
247,ideal for concerts,Ideal location for concerts in Aviva stadium (round the corner) & the RDS ( 8 min walk).Dart just up the road. Very Comfortable hotel with great prices for bed & breakfast aaaand free parking.Rooms are generally quite spacious but are a few smaller double rooms. But all are clean & modern. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Left our driving license in the room and got a phone call from Rose in housekeeping to let us know and she posted it to us at home which we got the following day. Def stay here again and recommend to friends,5,2012,08,11
247,Outstanding Hotel,"We spent ten days at Sandymount in July/August 2012 with ten Suffolk University graduate students. The location is excellent- a five minute walk from the DART which is only three stops from downtown, near the villages of Sandymount and Ballsbridge as well as airport bus.Very nice rooms, great Irish breakfast included, superb internet access, nice bar that stays open late with a good menu. Beatrice and the other staff were very friendly and helpful, attending to the diverse needs of us and our students including getting tix for trips, many good suggestions on places to go. When we were leaving for the bus, it was raining; she used her car to take us to the stop.This is a hotel that has been owned by one family for many years. John the owner was oftern around and very attentive to our needs.

I highly recommend it.",5,2012,08,08
247,Superb Mini Break,"The hotel is ideally, based on the outskirts of Dublin yet close enough to the City Centre, (20 minutes by bus Nos: 4 & 7). The hotel is just a few minutes from the Aviva Stadium and Lansdown Road train station, and in the opposite direction it is an easy ten minute stroll to Sandymount Village, (buses 1 and 47 also run into the City from the village centre), the beach and the Promenade is just a couple of minutes walk past the village.
The Hotel and staff are warm, friendly, welcoming and helpful, the restaurant is comfortable and the food is reasonably priced; the buffet breakfast is a must. 
The executive room we stayed in was spacious, even though it contained: a double and single bed, sofa and coffee table, dresser, table and two chairs. The room was clean, comfortable and although the bathroom was small it was clean, modern and well ventilated. 
We are looking forward to a return visit to Dublin and would definitely stay at the Sandymount again",5,2012,08,07
247,ClareLady,"A very enjoyable and reasonably priced overnight stay at this Hotel. Staff extremely courteous and helpful. Room very comfortable.
Location excellent in lovely part of Dublin. Close to Aviva Stadium, Grand Canal, The Point and Sandymount Beach..
I will definately stay here again and recommend to friends..",5,2012,08,06
247,Concert stay must!!!!!,"I stayed here for the madonna concert! The hotel location to aviva stadium was fantastic-5 mins tops. 
The staff are exceptionally friendly & a credit to the hotel. 
The rooms were small but very clean & comfortable. The Walls were pretty thin - I could hear the guests next door being sick!!!!! But I still had a good nights sleep. The breakfast was very tasty & well organised. 
My only down side was the evening meal. The hotel had not allowed for the amt of people going to the concert, the bar & restaurant were short staffed. We waited over an hour for fish & chips, in fact we watched another couple receive our order & eat it! The staff were very apologetic but it did tarnish our experience. 
However if I had another concert in the area I would book this hotel in a heart beat!! 
",4,2012,08,02
247,Lovely hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for one night in July 2012. Room with dinner and breakfast was part of package at destinationdublin.ie Lovely place, near to city center, Aviva stadium, theaters etc. Very clean and cosy room, friendly and helpful staff, good food. Would absolutely go there again.",5,2012,08,02
247,I'll be back...,"Just spent two nights at the Sandymount and was glad I returned a second time after visiting last year.  The staff are friendly and helpful with rooms that are pleasant and clean.  They also offer room service and free internet.  After a terrible time with another hotel in Belfast, knowing I was coming to Dublin was a relief, as I knew that the Sandymount wouldn't let me down.",4,2012,07,28
247,I Will definitely be Back!,"Next time Scotland play Ireland at Rugby, I will stay here. It's round the corner from the wonderful Landsdowne Road Stadium and the accommodation is first class for the price. We stayed one night and paid €138 in total for two twin rooms. Rooms were clean and beds very comfortable.

Free wi-fi available

It's only 2 Dart stops into the centre of Dublin. Staff were great, restaurant was wonderful.

Definitely worth a stay",5,2012,07,28
247,Great group stay here!,"We had a group of 40 guests staying at this hotel.

Food is very good, reception staff were extremely friendly and were always available to help with any queries or to provide any information that may have aided our plans for the day.

One issue was that the bar staff were quite slow and did not really appear interested in serving our group any drinks in the evening time over our weekend, the barman was not very friendly, reluctant to enter any conversation, outside of handing over change and was unhappy with being asked to change a tv channel to watch a sporting event!  
Drinks are a little overpriced.

The waiting staff were very friendly and the service was very prompt from the kitchen.
Food was reasonably priced, would definitely eat here again.

The location is quite good, very accessible by Dart to Dublin city centre - situated next to Lansdowne Road station and a stones throw from Aviva Stadium.",4,2012,07,25
247,"Lovely hotel, great location, nice food and friendly staff","My mum and I stayed one night at this really lovely hotel while attending a show at the Bord Bais Energy Theatre.  We were checked in by a lovely girl. I couldn't see her name badge but from the receipt, I think her name was Hannah. She was really genuinely nice, friendly and helpful. The hotel have street maps which shows you how to get to all the nearby hot-spots and we found this very handy because we drove to the theatre.
Our room (#232) which was on the ground floor, was lovely, clean and bright and spacious. We were able to open the windows and the room was not too hot because they don't set the heating to come on whether you want it to or not, like some hotels do! The room faced the street but there was no noise at all, it is a quiet enough residential area (although I am not sure if the same would be true had there been an event at the Aviva, which is a 5-10 minute walk away!). The beds were so comfortable and the the en-suite was a generous size with a very powerful shower.  
Breakfast (which was included in our stay as I had booked an online deal) the next day was really lovely. There was a good choice and it was all hot and not overcooked as is the case in so many hotels. You can also order pretty much anything else you want if it is not already there, like poached or scrambled eggs if you prefer. We sat by the window and there is a lovely garden all around outside the breakfast room. 
We did not eat in the restaurant but it looked lovely and had a nice, reasonably priced menu.
We did have a meal in the bar before we left and it was very nice and again, reasonably priced for Dublin! The drinks however are expensive but we had minerals and I think this is the case in most places these days - the soft drinks cost more than the beer! When we came back from the show, 2 Baileys cost €9.00.
They close the bar at 01:00 and do not operate a Residents' Bar because their policy is to respect people who want to sleep, so we didn't have people shouting and stumbling up and down the corridor at all hours which made a pleasant change.
Parking is free for residents and they have an ample car park behind the hotel with a few spaces at the front. The hotel itself is like a terrace of large houses linked together and they have done it very well and nicely. If I had to find something to complain about, and I don't want to just for the sake of it, it would be that the windows could perhaps do with a little dusting and repainting. They are old-style sash windows and are lovely but they were a little dirty, We didn't mind that though, the room was so nice and airy and we were only there to sleep one night.
I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone wanting a nice, friendly, Irish run hotel close to everything! The Aviva is literally a stone's throw away, We drove to the Bord Gais Energy Theatre because it is only a 10 minute drive and there is free on-street parking so why pay a fortune for taxi to take us the long way around - twice! It is also very close to the M50 so it would be a perfect location if you were attending a show one night and then going shopping the following day or just needed to get back onto the motorway easilly. The city centre is of course very close-by too and only a 15 minute drive.",4,2012,07,25
247,good,Husband and I stayed here during our trip to Ireland last March. This was a good hotel with very friendly staff. Would recommend and would stay here again. The location of the hotel was something we both felt was important and this was perfect for what we both wanted.,5,2012,07,24
247,"The more you stay, the worse they treat you","I have stayed here 6 times. The 1st time we thought we found our city home, it was 1st class.They gave us free choc and wine, carried our bags and welcomed us with open heart. 2nd time not as good and progresses downhill rapidly. Last time I stayed the restaurant manager roared and fought with us to pay e5 for breakfast!! As we booked on line, breakfast was not included.  We left the dining area and the receptionist told us to go back and have our breakfast free after that fuss. We went back to the dining area paid the e5 each which we had been asked for and the owner wrote to me afterwards saying breakfast was actually e7. Nobody knows what the other is doing here and the guest is the loser.  We never saw the same staff twice.  No public transport and floors very creaky. Once is enough here............Shame",1,2012,07,24
247,Recent re fit and it has paid off,"Rooms are still basic enough but this is a good functional hotel in a very good location . Rooms are clean and the only downer is the warren of rooms ~ you would need a map to get around the place , it's like a series of houses linked together . The food at evening time is quite good and reasonable and the front of house staff were very friendly and welcoming . Rate at €89 room only was comparable if not slightly cheaper than other similar places but the breakfast at €12 we found a bit pricey for what you got .",4,2012,07,22
247,"Great place, great location","The Sandymount Hotel with its welcoming staff is located in a quiet suburb not to far from the airport express bus top, train station, and is not far from the centre of Dublin. It is also located close to some  good pubs in Ballsbridge. The rooms are clean, service is good, and overall is good value for money. I have stayed here on two occasions now",5,2012,07,21
247,Excellent all round,"Our group of three stayed in June for a concert in the O2. The three of us stayed in the same room and found it very spacious and very comfortable. The room itself was spotless and the food in the hotel was beautiful. Their Hotel/theatre deals are also fantastic offers which we will be taking up soon.
Absolutely no negative's on this hotel. Five stars ***** ",5,2012,07,19
247,great place for a springsteen concert!,"we stayed here for 2 nights to attend one of the bruce springsteen concerts at the RDS.
the location was excellent and only 10 - 15 mins walk to the venue .very nice residential area with a great friendly cafe on way to RDS ( patricks ). also just a short walk to sandymount village which was lovely , or to Ballsbridge itself- both places where there were shops, restaurants and pubs.
the room was fine - a bit small for a double as the desk was next to the bed and only left a small gap to walk around , with 2 people one had to stand aside for the other to move around the room , however it was clean. the 2 bedside lights didnt work but someone came quickly and fixed them - one bulb needed replacing and the other had a loose wire . would have been nice to have some biscuits alongside the tea and coffee though!
the staff were all really friendly and helpful so would definitely come back here if visiting the RDS or Aviva stadium.
also , having a couple of computers and a printer was really helpful as we could print off our boarding cards for the return flight",4,2012,07,19
247,Very Pleasant Stay,"My husband and I stayed here on a SuperValu break at the beginning of July. We stayed for two nights B&B. Having the option of a break here was great as we wouldn’t have necessarily heard of the hotel otherwise. The location of the hotel is a real selling point – close to town, yet in a quiet and pretty residential area with Sandymount Village down the road and a very short car trip to Sandymount Strand. The free parking is a big bonus in the city and took the stress out of parking charges etc. The area is also well serviced with public transport, the Sandymount Dart Station just a short walk.

As described by previous reviewers, the hotel is a mish mash of old and new, but we loved that about it! The Reception area is modern and fresh and there a lovely little rooms off this area where you can just sit down and chill out. Our bedroom was fresh, clean and of a good size. I agree that the bathroom is dated, but it wasn’t a deal breaker as it was clean. Bed was comfortable and we both slept well. We ate in the bar on our first evening – personally I found the food nice. The BLT was very tasty and well presented. However, with the exception of one waitress we did find the service to be a bit poor. On the second evening (having just a coffee) we chose to leave the bar and head to one of the rooms off reception as we found the staff to be a bit frantic. Breakfast was very tasty both mornings and staff very helpful. Reception Staff were very pleasant on each occasion we dealt with them – a real gem for the hotel. 

All in all, we very much enjoyed our stay here and would most definitely return on another trip to Dublin!",4,2012,07,19
247,2nd time here and not disappointed,"My husband and I stayed at the Sandymount Hotel for the second time from 10th - 12th July.  It's a very nice, clean hotel with friendly staff and is well situated in a quiet residential area, right beside the Aviva stadium and close to the RDS.  Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  We were on a room only basis but ate in the hotel bar on our first evening.  The food was fine - not fabulous but sufficient for our needs after a long journey and not wanting to go out to look for a restaurant.  We had breakfast in the hotel the last time we stayed and it was excellent.  An added bonus is that there's free parking at the hotel which is great when staying in Dublin.  

When I got home, I discovered I'd left a pair of gold earrings behind but a phone call to the hotel sorted it out and I have now received them by post.  Thank you to Rose of the Housekeeping staff!

Overall, I'm very happy to recommend the Sandymount Hotel to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable Dublin base with friendly staff and, from our past experience, very good breakfasts.  We will stay there again.",4,2012,07,16
247,Good location for Aviva stadium and ballsbridge,"We stayed in the Sandymount following a wonderful Paul Simon concert in the 02 concert hall. Not an ideal location for the O2 but fine if you are driving. A Sat-Nav will help as it’s a bit tricky to find and also make sure to have €1.75 with you for the tool and. The hotel is located in a quite area very near the Aviva stadium - so great for rugby and soccer matches. The hotel was clean and service fine. Parking is provided and is fine although the spaces are a little tight. The part of the hotel we stayed in has a large number of bedrooms on a ground floor - they are nothing special and felt a bit like being in a cell. We had a very good night’s sleep so no complaints,  although the beds are only average and the thick duvets could prove too hot in warm weather Breakfast was good although it needed to be a little warmer. Overall this is a decent hotel if what you need is a place for a night or two but nothing special.",4,2012,07,15
247,great stay,"Not normally a review writer, but enjoyed our stay so much, decided to give credit, where credit is due, my stay does not reflect the previous recent post, which i was bemused to read, i wonder have the reviewed the correct hotel.
Our greeting was great, good humour of all the staff was infectious, the room was a good, very nicely decorated and spotlessly clean.
We ate in the bar and i found the food lovely and portions good size.
Reception great help with directions and transport options to concert.
Would recommend to any one, great location, good food, great staff, what more could you want.",4,2012,07,07
247,An Irish Fawlty Towers,"Utterly dreadful. Staff have a bad attitude problem, and don't want to solve your problems, rather they want to fight with you to explain to you why you're wrong. You SHOULD enjoy a room that is too hot, you should enjoy nasty food for breakfast and dinner. If you don't like nasty food, no air-con, a poltergeist in the plumbing etc.,  one of the part-time - I'm in college staff - can happily explain to you how your taste-buds are actually at fault and not the food or how you're simply deluded etc.. Gee, maybe they're right? And all these years I've been liking the wrong food when I should have been liking crap! Maybe I should learn to sleep to the sound of a locomotion in the taps and pipes. Still love Ireland though, just won't come back here.",1,2012,07,06
247,"A really stressful, unpleasant stay...","Where do I even start? This hotel was so far off the mark, it really beggars belief in these times where so many hoteliers and restauranteurs in Ireland are going above and beyond to provide excellent service and facilities at good value for money.

To start with our package included a three course meal - my partner and I assumed that this meant in a restaurant. Upon arrival the restaurant was taken over by some conference and our voucher was to be used in a rather grotty sports bar upstairs. Our meal was thus in a noisy bar with some sports channel showing the cricket in the corner - not the experience we intended. The waitresses appeared to be rather disorganised from the start. However, when our meal arrived, my partner knew immediately that there was something unpleasant about his prawn dish - stomach turning, pale and sweaty, he ran immediately to the bathroom. Upon informing the waitress of his unpleasant main, she tried to convince him that it was just his 'personal taste' and the chef had said they were fine. Now, what happened to the fact that the customer is always right? My partner has eaten some rather interesting food in his day (guinea pig on a stick in Peru anyone?), doesn't have a weak stomach and would NEVER have a sick tummy after food. The fact that the prawns were off was bad enough, however, it was the blase, unhelpful 'Oh I don't know what to do' attitude of the waitress that really added insult to injury.

Upstairs so, where my partner eventually came round after a few hours and had a 'delicious' dinner of a banana and a Mars bar from the vending machine. We both had a very disrupted, uncomfortable nights sleep due to two factors (1) The horrendous heat and heavy blanket in our room, which in the middle of the summer made the place far too warm to be comfortable and (2) the rattles and groans coming from the radiators all night long - someone really needs to bleed the bloody radiators, it's not that complex! Terrible nights sleep - very unpleasant.

Breakfast - we had business to attend to in Dublin that day, and were looking forward to a decent breakfast to set us up for what we had planned. Ew. Ew ew ew. Sausages and rashers were barely cooked. Pale, flaccid looking sausages. Rashers with flabby uncooked fat attached. Eggs which looked like they'd been sitting there for hours. Really unappetising.  Insult to injury (again! This hotel was all insult to injury really) - the plates were heated on a plate-type-thing. When I picked up the plate, it was EXTREMELY hot - like I literally couldn't manage it for a second hot and had to drop it straight away so as not to burn my hand. No sign up regarding the vicious heat of the plates. Nothing but for a paying customer to learn in the Native Indian tradition of putting your hand in the fire to learn that it is hot. Again, I reported the danger of the hot plates to a waitress and suggested maybe warning customers. Again the same style of response - 'Oh right sorry' and stalk off like she'd far better things to be doing than her job.

This was a really, really terrible trip. I mean, it was shocking that not only were certain material things wrong, but the attitude of the staff when we reported gone off prawns and dangerously hot plates to them was really, really blase. I find it challenging to identify anything positive about our experience at the Sandymount Hotel.",1,2012,07,05
247,Comfortable and cosy,"This hotel is quaint in appearance and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. We had arrived after an extremely long flight and were jetlagged and exhausted. We went to our room which unfortunately had had a smoker and the room smelt terrible and was causing asthma. We went back to reception who were quick to find us another room and very apologetic (although I don't think it wasn't their fault a guest had ignored the non-smoking room rule, and if no one had told them). It was wonderful speedy service and second room was lovely. 
It was warm, inviting, spacious, very clean and the bathroom was warm and a great size as well. We liked the location, it was a nice quiet area to stroll around, a very quick 2 minute walk to the nearest train station (but not close enough that you could hear the trains running), and 2 stops to the Dublin CBD (It took around 10 minutes). We had trouble with our wi-fi (problem with our iphone) and there is a lovely large office room downstairs with public computers and 24 hour free internet access. 
We were greeted every morning and night by reception staff, and they recommended a lovely dinner venue in Dublin for great stew. We felt very looked after and enjoyed our stay.",5,2012,07,03
247,The Mc Griswalds Irish Vacation,From the moment that we arrived at Sandy mount hotel until we left the staff went out of their way to help us with any questions that we asked of them and even though we only had breakfast at the restaurant the food and presentation was excellent again the staff that was on were polite and very helpful If we ever get the chance to visit Ireland again we would look no further than the Sandy mount hotel for our accommodation,5,2012,06,28
247,lovely stay,"Stayed here as travelling to see Red Hot Chilli Peppers at Croke Park. The hotel is south of the city and not in the immediate area of Croke Park, however staff were very helpful offering directions to the stadium. The dart station is very close and one way ticket is €1.80 into city centre. The hotel is clean and beds are comfortable, although rooms are a little small this was not an issue for a one night stay. the hotel also provides free parking for guests - vital given the high price of dublin city centre parking generally. Staff were polite and the hotel is in a lovely area of Dublin close to Aviva Stadium. At the opposite end of Lansdowne Road there are a couple of places to get something to eat, coffee etc. Would be a great choice for a city break.",4,2012,06,27
247,Lovely Stay,"Stayed at this hotel between 21st June - 24th June 2012. Travelled to see Westlife farewell tour @ Croke Park Stadium. 

Having flown to Dublin from Newcastle, we arrived at the hotel 4 hours before check in, which was at 3pm. When we arrived the hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating, they took our bags and allowed us to sit in the lovely hotel bar while they tried to find us a room so we could check in early, which they did. 

The hotel is in a great location, it’s located in a quiet street away from the city centre so there’s no loud music or road noise to keep you awake at night, however Dublin is only a half hour walk, or 5 minute DART ride from Lansdown DART station located just a few minutes’ walk away from the hotel. This hotel is also ideally situated for anyone travelling to see a concert at Croke park due to its proximity to the DART, however, the last DART is approximately 11.30-12pm, if you miss it, there are lots of taxis from the town centre, however, be warned, they charge for the length of time in the taxi, not per mile, so although the hotel isn’t too far from Croke Park, if you get stuck in traffic, it costs a fortune. 

All in All, this is a lovely hotel, very clean, well kept and in an ideal location. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The bedrooms rooms are very nice and are equipped with ironing board, iron, hair dryer, tv and tea and coffee facilities. The hotel has free wifi and also a small computer room if you need to access the internet for any reason during your stay. There is a nice bar area which serves really good bar food and there is also a restaurant if you fancy a proper meal. Breakfast is served each morning in the restaurant and there was always a good selection of food, inc full English breakfast fruit, yoghurt, cereal, toast and croissants. 

We will defiantly be going back to this hotel in the near future!",5,2012,06,25
247,sandymount hotel,great hotel to stay....friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere with great food,5,2012,06,22
247,IEC 2012 Visit,"We were staying in Dublin between 14 - 18 June 2012 for the 50th International Eucharistic Congress which was happening in the RDS and in Croke Park. The hotel staff were lovely and very helpful. The room where we were staying in 214 was very comfortable. I was staying with my parents and each of us had a bed each which was great. The breakfast was buffet style, and you had a option of getting porridge and hot chocolate also, which were not on the menu. Breakfast was between 7am - 10am. We also ate in the bar each evening and the food was lovely. The chambermaids were even chatty and very professional. We are planning to stay in Dublin again in September and we will definitely be staying in the Sandymount Hotel. We even met the owner John who was very warm to us.

The hotel is about 5 mins away from the Dart station (Landsdowne Road) and only a few stops to Connolly station. About a five mins walk to the Luas (red line) and you are into the city centre. A very convenient hotel and very quiet. I've stayed in Dublin City centre and the noise can be very bad. The bar of the Sandymount Hotel closes at midnight and no residents bar, so no late partying.",5,2012,06,21
247,Splendid again,"My wife and I visited Dublin again this year to attend the Bloomsday Festival. We stayed again in the Sandymount Hotel and as of last year we were delighted by our stay. The staff are as usual friendly and welcoming and could not be more helpfull to us. Our room was perfect, spotlessy clean and nicely decorated and the breakfast was fit for the ""King Of Siam"" . It is very centrel just 2 minutes walk from the Aviva Stadium and a 10 minute from the lovely village of Sandymount. The Dart is just around the corner to go to Dublin or to the lovely Victorian town of Dun Laoighre, We will visit again and bring our friends with us next time, In all a great Hotel",5,2012,06,21
247,thankyou,I would like to thank the staff at The Sandymount Hotel . The staff were wonderful and helpful and friendly. The front desk staff were very helpful from the computer to a glass of water. Rose helped me with my suitcase when i left as did one of the room staff when i couldnt find the lift. Michelle[ the front desk manager][ i believe]  was very lovely and made me feel very comfortable. Even when i went to breakfast i was most surprised at being given a handshake and welcome by the owner John. Most unexpected and made me feel right at home. Thankyou once again helen,5,2012,06,20
247,What a find !,"Yes, finding WAS a problem. SatNav did not like Dublin's one way system ! It is about 20 minutes from Dublin ferryport. In Herbert Road near to Aviva Stadium (Lansdowne Road rugger ground). Service great. Breakfast great( might last all day !) Room/en-suite great. Lounge and bar great ! 5 minutes walk from Lansdowne Road DART staion. At today's price 3.10 Euros to Tara Street/Pearse Street stations. A bit of a ""warren"" as several buildings joined together. Ample and free parking. Taxi to City centre 12 Euros.",5,2012,06,15
247,Convenient for Dublin port,"We stayed here one night before leaving to get the ferry the next morning.  As such, we didn't stay for breakfast.  The room was very clean and the staff were friendly; the only gripe was having a ground-floor room with a window right onto the hotel car park.",4,2012,06,12
247,bad stay,The hotel itself is nice and is in great location but had a bad stay in room 237.When we first got in there the floor is slightly unlevel and it creaks like it was built on tbe joining of two buildings.And to make it worse everytime you try to move or turn in the bed it creaks like mad.The walls and floor where paper thin as you can hear everything around you. Bar area is nice snd staff where quick and friendly.Breakfast food was nice but staff seemed to be more interested on what was on the televisions.Overall might try again if stuck but will make sure not to get that room again.,2,2012,06,12
247,"Look no further for an excellent, friendly family owned hotel in Dublin.","We had booked tickets to see Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers perform at Dublin's O2 Arena (the concert was excellent BTW – as you can see and hear for yourself from the numerous videos concertgoers have already posted on Youtube !) 

We had searched the Internet for somewhere to stay close to the arena.

The Sandymount Hotel caught our eye - with some great reviews on Trip Advisor - so we booked to stay there for 2 nights.

The hotel was everything we hoped it would be and much more. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful and they really made our stay a happy and memorable one. This we appreciated all the more because, aside from our evening at the O2, we chose not to venture out in the unseasonably wet and windy weather that was raging across Ireland (and back 'home' in the UK) throughout most of our 2 days there. 

Thankfully, the hotel has a very welcoming restaurant and bar plus several comfortable lounges, so we were able to totally relax and unwind while enjoying some of the tasty and very hearty food on offer in the restaurant accompanied by a few delightful 'beverages' from the bar !

Our 'standard' room was perfectly adequate for our needs and gave us the level of comfort we were looking for. Just one very minor concern; We were allocated room 233 on the ground floor which did get a lot of (often noisy) human traffic going past it along the neighbouring corridor and, although we slept sufficiently well that we did not feel we needed to request a change of room, we will certainly try to book a quieter upper floor room when we stay at Sandymount again in the future.

Meanwhile, returning to the thing that impressed us (and, clearly, many other Trip Advisor contributors):- Many companies (particularly those in the US and the UK), spend millions sending their employees on costly customer service courses when they could save themselves a fortune by simply sending them (a few at a time) to stay at Sandymount Hotel for a night or two where they could witness first class customer service in action.

Importantly, guests experience a service that feels warm, genuine and very caring (rather than just employees following corporate instructions to 'smile and be nice') and this is probably greatly helped because the Sandymount Hotel is a family owned and run business. Indeed John, the owner, casually approached us and chatted very amiably and helpfully in a manner that we have rarely, if ever, experienced in any of the other hotels we have stayed at previously. Oh that there were more hotels around the world like the Sandymount !

Thanks again to everyone for a great stay ! We most sincerely can't wait to return again ! 

Lastly, a top tip, courtesy of John the owner, (that sadly we didn’t discover until after the event), is that if, like us, you decide to walk back to the hotel from the O2, there is a public footpath you can use that shaves more than half a mile off the 2 mile walk we took – because we simply followed the roads. (Ask John or his staff for directions).",5,2012,06,12
247,A great wee find,"Perfectly located near to the RDS. Very friendly reception staff, great free parking and a nice atmospheric bar with great service. The price is great VFM and the hotel does exactly what is says on the tin. Will be staying here again next time I have business at the RDS. Also very close to the Aviva stadium. ",4,2012,06,12
247,Never Again,"This hotel was our last stop before flying back home after a self drive tour of Ireland. We were checked in to a 'standard' room, which was so small that practically there was no place to open even one normal size (24"") suitcase, unfortunateley we had two, one for each of us. Te room was in the basement and the window opened in te parking lot, bonnets of two cars decorated the landscape of the solitary wondow. At the receception we were told that the hotel was fully booked that night and that they were helpless and that we had booked a standard room only. After staying in spacious and comfortable rooms in Kilkenny, and Kilarney (booked for us by the same Irish travel company which had booked this hotel), this was a shock! Apparently a 3* hotel according to our travel agent; next the heater in the room did not work. Third, the sink in the bath room had two taps, one for hot and one for cold water. According to Serge, the manager, whole of Ireland had only this kind of tap system , apparently in Ireland the concept of  hot and cold mixers did not exist till date. I have not heard any more ridiculous statement by a hotel manager anywhere in the world. Phew!!!!! Now, we decided to sit in the reception lobby as the room was not worth going back to. It helped. I overheard the receptionist tell some one on phone that rooms were avaialable in the hotel, a superior room for Euro 115.00; I was aghast to hear that because I was given the 'standard' room for Euro 119.00 for the first night and Euro 99.00 for the second night (probably because we were to checkout before breakfast time next day). When I cnfronted Serge with this piece of information, I was promptly moved to the superior room. Before this event, I never knew that one can be cheated like this in a first world country or was I the victim of some kind of bias (read racial)........, who knows.",1,2012,06,10
247,"Sandymount Hotel Dublin, IRE","Hotel staff was excellent.  Rooms nice size, restaurant and bar very well done.",4,2012,06,07
247,A real find,"From the minute we arrived till the minute we left, our stay at the Sandymount was brilliant.  The staff went out of their way to help;  we actually felt like guests, rather than an inconvenience associated with so many hotels nowadays.  The bedrooms were bright, airy and quiet.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was very well appointed.  Breakfast was excellent.  We could not fault a thing.",5,2012,06,06
247,Super hotel,We stayed at the Sandymunt hotel 6 days in may 2012.  The hotel is very lovely og clean. The breakfast was super and we got alle that we coult ever want.,5,2012,06,06
247,A very nice change,"I've been staying in a lot of character-free chain hotels recently, so it was lovely to stay in a place which had friendly and attentive staff, excellent food and a comfortable room. I'd definitely stay there again.",5,2012,06,04
247,One of Dublin's little jewels,"My wife and I stayed at the Sandymount Hotel on a weekend break on Friday and Saturday 25th & 26th May just past. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the staff at the Hotel who made our stay such an enjoyable one and made us feel so at home from we arrived. The setting, ambiance, decor and cleanliness of your lovely Hotel were second to none and one we shall remember for a long time.
We would particularly like to thank Chantel who looked after us in the Restaurant on Friday night and who despite being under considerable pressure and after a long day was an absolute diamond with her service, help and advice and pleasant and courteous manner in which she served us. Emma was also a star and both made our dining experience a first rate one. The meal was excellent and combined with the service made it even better.
We also attended the Republic of Ireland v Bosnia game on Saturday at The Aviva Stadium and the atmosphere in the Hotel leading up to the game from Saturday Morning was something special which added to the whole experience of the game for my wife and I.
This was the first time we had stayed at the Sandymount Hotel and we will definitely return in the near future all being well. Since we returned yesterday we have told many of our family and friends about the Hotel and how nice it is to stay at and recommending it to all as a base for when they next visit Dublin!. 
Finally we'd like to say thanks once again for our wonderful stay and we wish you all the best in the future. We hope to see you again soon.",5,2012,05,28
247,A little charmer,"Stayed at this hotel last year when I went to a concert in the O2..While its not central to the city centre, its easily accessible by the Dart or Taxi. The hotel is lovely...clean,comfortable and cheap(which is always a bonus). The restaurant was lovely as well..food was fabulous,and the breakfast in the morning was welcome after a night out. The staff were also very welcoming,and very obliging and helpful. I'm going back to this hotel in 4 weeks time for the Westlife concert in Croke Park..and I'm really looking forward to it! All around..Great place to stay..good staff,clean hotel,great food!!!",5,2012,05,27
247,Disappointing,"I was visiting Dublin at the same time as a massive symposium so hotel rooms were limited.  I found the Sandymount online and booked it for one night.  The room was spacious and well appointed, with virtually everything one could possible need.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  However, the room, facing the front of the hotel and car park, turned out to be so noisy that I barely slept the whole night.  There was constant activity, with people shouting in the street, cars going in and out, recycling lorries thundering past...and a nearby building site starting work at 8am.
The hotel consists of eight terraced houses joined together so it is a bit higgeldy piggedly and definitely not suited to those with mobility problems or heavy suitcases.  The decor is a bit tired and faded in many parts.
The breakfast was ok,nothing special, with a small hot and cold buffet.",3,2012,05,27
247,Nice place!!,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our 11 days Ireland trip. We really liked the place. Its nice, clean and very comfortable place to stay. The rugby stadia is just 100 mtrs away. Its a good 30 mins walk to the city centre. For people who do not prefer walking, there is a DART station just 200 mtrs away and take you to city centre in 5 to 7 mins. We preferred walking on both days and it was really nice. There is no better way to see a city then by walking and trust me Dublin has to be seen walking. Back to the hotel review - so the rooms were nice, bathroom was clean and spacious and the best part was breakfast. Lovely breakfast will lots of choices. The staff is more than helpful. We had dinner there on one night and the chef even agreed to cook stuff outside the menu. HIghly recommend this place for vacationers as it is nice and quiet and gives you the peace that is needed on the vacation.",5,2012,05,18
247,Sporting Event,Great for rugby weekend at the AVIVA. The staff are very friendly and helpfull.,5,2012,05,13
247,Lovely hotel - Shame about the food,"We stayed here for our anniversary and the bank holiday weekend. We'd chosen the two nights offer with a meal for one of the nights and in the end we shouldn't have bothered.

The hotel itself was lovey, clean and bright and a short walk from the Lansdowne road dart station (NB:Don't get off at the Sandymount stop!) Upon arrival, the receptionist was friendly and efficient. 

Our room was clean but the view left a lot to be desired, facing other hotel rooms. Thank God for sheer curtains! The bed was comfortable and the facilities were more than adequate. 

Then we ate there. The dining area was where the bar was located and there was quite a bit of traffic whilst you were trying to eat your meal. We were seated and had our drinks order taken. We waited 10 minutes before another member of staff came up to re-take said order. We weren't that surprised considering our order was written on the waitresses' hand instead of a notebook. Maybe it was her first night?

The food itself was very disappointing. After reading good reviews about it, we were quite excited about eating here. I ordered the bruschetta which did not contain pesto and tasted like cheese on toast. The seafood chowder was lovely though! Neither of us could finish our mains as neither were cooked properly. We complained about the food quality and were told by the waitress that the chef was new, to quote ""So, yeah!"" 

A few minutes later she arrived back to the table and offered us a free bottle of wine, which was a nice touch but would be wary about eating here again. It was a shame as the breakfast facilities were lovely and we enjoyed our stay. But the dinner really spoiled things for us.

In short, we might stay here again, but would dine elsewhere.",3,2012,05,12
247,Stadium Living,"We stayed during a huge rugby match, so there was a lot of foot traffic around the hotel that day. Also, there was a concert on the hotel's grounds after the match, so it was terribly difficult to sleep until 4 AM in the morning. Our trip was booked so far in advance that there was no way to avoid this, but I wish they had given us a room where the window didn't open up to the staff area. Too noisy for me.",3,2012,05,12
247,Another enjoyable stay,"Having stayed at the Sandymount on several occassions I have always found the Staff to be very friendly and helpful
Our rooms have always been spacious, comfortable and very clean
The food at this hotel is excellent with ample portions and the buffet breakfast is also excellent",5,2012,05,10
247,are you going to a game or concert,"The staff at this hotel are great, very friendly and helpful. The room even though a little bland was
large and comfortable.I spent time just sitting around in the room which i never do in hotels.The food in the bar was really good as was the service. If you are going to an event in the rds or a game at the aviva this hotel is perfect. I have absolutely no complaints.",5,2012,05,10
247,Mid Range Hotel Outside the City Center,"For those that like big chain hotels in the touristy center of the city......The Sandymount is NOT for you. It's a small hotel in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Dublin within short walking distance to the DART train station(only 2 stops to central Dublin). We took the 30 minute stroll from the hotel to city center several times. It's quiet, small, and affordable. Unless you like to party, and we do, DO NOT stay here if there is a Rugby match at the Aviva Stadium. It's going to be rowdy with lots of pre and post game partying on the front lawn. The rooms are decent size by European standards and quiet enough to open the windows at night and not be bothered by noise. Rooms are basic with tiny tv's, outdated bathrooms(sink has separate faucets for hot and cold water) and decor, small safe and closet and NO mini bar. Beds are on the stiff side and pillows leave something to be desired. Free WIFI a big plus. Hotel itself has lots of public spaces, a restaurant(which we did not eat at but looked and smelled good) and a fully stocked bar with lots of drink options. The front desk staff is the highlight of this hotel, friendly and always greeting you the moment you walk in the door. Helped us with planning of trips to Belfast and Cliffs of Moher. I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it, but not to people who are hotel snobs.",3,2012,05,05
247,Nice stay,"I found the staff so nice and more than happy to help us in any way. I only stayed for 1 night with my 3 year old son and my mother but really enjoyed the stay and wish it could have been longer. The dart is just down the road and 1 stop away from the bord gais energy theatre which is then only a few min walk away. Loved the location as it was a nice area and quite but also really easy to get to places. The hotel was really quite and peaceful. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel as my son was tierd, I asked reception about takeaways in the area and the lady gave me take away menus to take to my room and order. I asked for plates and forks at the bar and the bar man was happy to give them to me no questions asked. The room was lovely,not very big but not small either, we had plenty of room and it was nicely decorated. The only faults I had with the hotel was the room was really warm even though I had turned of the heat and had windows open and also when leaving the room and looking under the bed to make sure we hadn't left anything behind there was a sock under one bed and a chocolate wrapper under the other.",4,2012,05,04
247,Very close to the Aviva Stadium,"My wife and I stayed at the Sandymount Hotel for the Heineken Cup Semi-Final at the Aviva Stadium and were not disappointed with it's location. On arrival we found the reception staff very friendly and were given a room in the basement area, but we had only been in our room for about two minutes when a member of staff knocked at the door and said that there had been a cancellation and asked us if we would like an up-grande. We were then shown to a nice bright airy room on the first floor overlooking the front of the hotel, our room turned out to be triple with a large bathroom, slightly dated but more then comfortable for a weekend in Dublin.The breakfast was self-service and it was superb and it certainly set us up for the day, after breakfast on both days we didn't eat again until 8pm each evening.
The hotel is in a really nice area of the city, close to the Rugby Stadium and only about 200 metres from the DART railway station that takes you into the city centre. The airport bus also drops you off about a five minute walk from the hotel.
The hotel also put on entertainment for the thousands of rugby fans that were in town. I was supporting the losing team but I didn't hear the celebrating Ulster fans singing and didn't lose any sleep.
I would definitely consider this hotel for future visits to Dublin",4,2012,04,30
247,great location for aviva,"stayed for the heineken semi and unlike the previous reviewer we were the winning team!  food was great, staff were great.  rooms were comfortable and clean.  couldnt ask to be any closer to the stadium.",4,2012,04,29
247,Cheap but not so Cheerful,"We arrived on the Friday afternoon around 2.30pm and checked in without any delay. We parked in the free parking to the rear of the hotel. I have stayed at this hotel on 3 or 4 previous occasions, dating back 20 years before the recent name change.

 Our room was a double room with an adjacent single bed. The bathroom floor was damp which I put down to recent cleaning, but after wiping it dry, I saw water leaking from a radiator pipe, running along the grout lines across the floor. The taps on the bath and sink were both missing their tap-covers and the sink plug was a replacement after thought. The shower mixer valve was missing its fascia plate (hot and cold guess work) and the tile grout was an off brown/black shade of white. The grout/sealant above the toilet cistern had fallen out in several places. The overhead skylight in the bathroom is an unusual feature. We had already unpacked and decided to grin and bear it due to the cheap rate for overnight B&B. 

We  headed to the bar for some lunch, some fresh sandwiches which were spot on. The bar and reception area were modernised around the time of our last visit and still look fresh. The local Dart station is less than 5 minutes walk and cost just over 3 euros for a day return to Tara Station (only 3 stops to town centre.) We shopped and later had a meal in Gallagher's Boxty House, Temple Bar area. Back to the hotel for a couple of drinks and off to a comfortable nights sleep. The next morning while using the bathroom my feet got that wet feeling, but the radiator pipe was dry! Flushing the toilet soon revealed the issue, in that the waste pipe to the rear leaked on every flush, the coloured water being the evidence required! This is neither hygenic or acceptable and was obviously not a brand new 'just happened' issue, given the grout colour. The towel used to mop up was chosen due to its colour before being used.

After a good breakfast  we checked out, having paid upon arrival. The receptionist asked how the room was and I informed her of the bathroom issues. We were dismissed with a statement that she was sorry and maintenance  would check it out. The focus that morning seemed to be concentrating around the 1000 or so rugby fans coming to use the outside beer tents. Pity help anyone using the hotel on the Saturday who wasn't going to the match as the fans (all good natured) took up every seat/floor space and toilet inside the hotel. 

My advice to the staff? Focus more on the residents than the beer swillers, who by the way paid less for their drinks than we did the previous evening!",2,2012,04,29
247,"Small, clean, friendly","Stayed here for the Heineken Cup semi final. Very friendly, efficient staff. Hotel and rooms very clean, beds comfy. Bathrooms ok although could do with a bit of upgrading. Breakfast buffet very good and good quality freshly cooked food.
Only complaint was the loud singing at 1am!! Probably wouldn't have minded so much if we had been the winning team and you can't really blame the hotel!",4,2012,04,29
247,Quaint Irish Hotel!!!,"This second generation family owned hotel is a gem! It is in the D4 area of Dublin where most of the foreign embassies are located and only a 10 minute walk to the DART. The DART train will have you in city centre after just two stops. The restaurant was a big surprise and much better than the norm. The breakfasts at the Sandymount are amongst the best that we experienced during our three weeks in Europe and certainly the most affordable. Close to Sandymount village and Ballsbridge, there are great restaurants within 10 minutes and ATM's and grocery near by. The rooms are clean, comfortable, recently freshened, and a great value. The staff is very, very helpful. Glad we returned after 29 years and would so again!!!",4,2012,04,27
247,"Lovely Hotel, great location","Although not one of the most modern hotels, it's located in a great place to access the city without the noise and bustle of a city center hotel.  The staff are very friendly and good humored.  Breakfast was very tasty and bed very comfortable.",4,2012,04,23
247,Outstanding event !!,"I didn't stay at the Sandymount Hotel but used it as a venue to host a rugby supporters event prior to a game at the Aviva Stadium.

The service received in advance of, and during, the event was fantastic. The facilities provided were perfect and exactly matched our requirements. In fact, the staff went out of the way to exceed our expectations. 

On the day itself, the staff were friendly, good fun and happily attended to the needs of our 200 or so guests. The food and drinks services on site were very good. The 'pig and a pint' deal is highly recommended !

Special thanks to Lynsey who organized the whole event and the wider team who made our disappointing day on the field, one of fun and good times! ",5,2012,04,17
247,"Good, solid, safe and friendly choice in Dublin","The Sandymount Hotel is slightly out of the centre of town, which is quite a blessing in terms of providing a restful night’s sleep. It is well removed from the pubcrawl and buck’s night parties kicking up their heels! (Although it is very near Aviva Stadium, so if the football is on, and you are not a member of that big party, you might not find your sleep so restful!) It's also only 2 or 3 DART stops from the centre of town – but if you want to stretch your legs, it's really a lovely 20 minute walk into Dublin through the gorgeous Georgian streets. 

This is a family owned hotel, and the service is excellent! We had an executive room located away from the lifts and traffic areas, which provides an uninterrupted night’s sleep. The beds are comfortable, the room is warm (great for those of us not used to the cold!) and the showers are hot. The manner of all staff members is smooth, friendly and personal. Could not fault it in any way. The owner, John Loughan, is attentive and friendly, and ensures his guests get the most out of their stay at his hotel. 

The breakfast is a typical hot and cold buffet of eggs, bacon, sausage, black and white pudding, sautéed mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, hash browns and baked beans (with the usual juices, fruit, cereals, yoghurt, croissants and toast thrown in as well). No one left the breakfast room hungry! We didn’t use the restaurant for dinner, but we did have late night drinks in the bar, which was a nice way to finish the evening with friends.",4,2012,04,15
247,Great Hotel,"stayed in this hotel when i went to the heineken cup at the weekend. was very surprised how close it was to the aviva, great staff, nice room, great shower and a lovely breakfast, overall a great hotel for a one night stay.",5,2012,04,10
247,"2nd Stay - Friendly, relaxed, clean & value for money","This is our second stay at the Sandymount Hotel, as we were very pleased with the room, service and price we paid previously.  The hotel is 3 minutes walk away from the dart station, and only 35 minutes walk from Grafton Street if feeling energetic.

The hotel is clean, and modern and staffed by friendly and courteous staff.  We arrived shortly after 12.00 midday and were happy to check-in and come back later when the room was ready, however the receptionist had the room prepared within 10 minutes is something I've never experienced in any of the budget chains.

I could gladly recommend this hotel to families, and fully expect to be staying here again.",4,2012,04,09
247,Clean comfortable and good location!!!,"We arrived at the hotel for a overnight stay. After having trouble finding it due to getting lost slightly (no fault of the hotel, just Dublin streets). Arrived just after 12.30pm and was going to drop bags in and head to  city centre, but our room was ready!!! We suprised that the hotel bigger than what we thought as in how many rooms it had. Room was large enough and had also a single bed in it since I asked for a double room!!!  Nice decorated, clean and comfortable beds. Bathroom also clean and plenty of towels in it. TV channels also had plenty of choice. Staff friendly and helpful. We had dinner in the restaurant as it was included in our package and was lovely very filling and big portions. Quick service. Free parking a bonus at the hotel as I had enough of driving in Dublin. Dart (or Train stop as I call it) 5 min away from hotel and only 2 stops away from City Centre and only costing less than 2 euros single journey. Be warned tho getting a taxi from City Centre to the hotel will cost you about 12euros. Nice hotel, would visit again!!!!",5,2012,04,02
247,Lovely hotel,"Spent two nights at the hotel this weekend, and would recommend it. The only negative point I would make is the dining area is not always open for evening dinner and dinning is restricted to the bar lounge which can be noisy as not everyone is eating and the tv is on in the background, however the food they serve is very nice. I will certainly return The staff are also very friendly and helpful",4,2012,04,02
247,Great Value for Money,Stayed here for Lady Gaga concert last year. Staff are friendly but the O2 is about a 20mins walk away. It's a safe walk though as loads of other people are walking to the concert also you wont be walking there on your own. Food is lovely in the restaurant and the DART and the O2 are right behind the hotel. Think you've to pay for parking in the hotel though.,4,2012,04,02
247,Great location,"Staying just of of Dublin City has its advantages when staying at the Sandymount Hotel. Only two stops on the Dart (Train) and just a 5 minute walk to the station to get right into the heart of Dublin with out the hassle of traffic or the noise of staying in busy city hotels. 
The Sandymount staff are friendly and helpful, though someone on hand to help with the luggage would be a great help. Breakfast is good, rooms are extremely clean and you can get  quick clean make up room early if you are coming back in the afternoon. 
Parking of your car is safe. Great free wi fi . I stayed here 5 days and would recommend it.",4,2012,03,31
247,Second stay and we will be definitely visiting a third,"We originally stayed in this hotel when it was mount Herbert back in 2010 and decided to stay again. The hotel is a short dart ride from Connolly station or if you were as lucky as we were with the gorgeous weather when we visited it is half an hour walk to st step hens green. The staff are friendly, the room was just what we needed with a lovely shower, tea and coffee facilities and tv. The smallest of criticisms (though this may have been due to the weather rather than the hotel) is the room can get a little too warm. Highly recommended. Oh and if after a busy day of travelling if you don't feel like going into the main part of Dublin I would suggest going to the village of sandymount approx 5 min walk away. Marios restaurant and the. Sandymount bar are both brilliant and the price of guinness in the sandymount is cheaper than town",4,2012,03,29
247,Awesome staff',This family run hotel has a cozy feel and a staff that goes beyond what is required or expected. I definitely would stay here again. ,5,2012,03,25
247,"Great Location, good staff, rooms could do with a little tlc","Stayed here a few times lately for business, and the location is great, right beside the Aviva stadium, a short walk from RDS, and a stroll to Ballsbridge and it's bars and restaurants.

The staff are very welcoming and friendly, and the bar and restaurant is very comfortable.

The only issue here is due to existing constraints with the buildings finding your room can be a bit like a maze, but for some that is part of the charm.  It is a beautiful facade though, and I will definitely stay again.   The food is average, though there is plenty of choice in the local area within walking distance.

Probably not the hotel for you if you are looking for a luxury break, but if you are at an event or looking for a base to explore then I would definitely recommend it.",3,2012,03,06
247,nice,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here in 2010 and upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted by the lady at reception who was very nice. When we got to our room i was suprised in how small our room was but its a small enough hotel anyway,We were here for an ireland game so we got a good deal on our room. we also got a free baguette and pint b4 the game aswell. the food itself at the hotel was nice. my girlfriend got a chicken and i dont mean a cut up chicken a whole chicken which i was in stitches laughin overall we will be back sometime again",4,2012,03,04
247,"Sandymount Hotel, Dublin","Great location for Aviva Stadium, less than 2 minutes walk around the corner and the free car parking. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was average size but well kitted out with everything needed; tea / coffee facilities, ironing equipment, wardrobe space, good TV, not that we really used it and a good shower with plenty of power. As well as the being next door to the stadium there is also Landsdowne Road Dart station. The Dart runs frequently and will have you in the city centre in 10 minutes. Good value for money, good, clean accomodation, nice bar and great staff. What more do you want.",5,2012,02,28
247,Relaxing Stay.,"Wonderful relaxed atmosphere in quiet suburben area of Dublin. Friendly , helpful staff ,and nice old world feeling with modern amenities . I feel content there.",5,2012,02,27
247,dirty dancing,"stayed here on a package deal in feb 2012 which included tickets to dirty dancing musical the hotel staff are very helpful and friendly the rooms and the food were excelent the only downside was the bar service which was very slow and barstaff did not seen interested in the customers at all, we were given a free btl of wine when we checked in which was a bonus and free chocolates in the bedroom, very good value for money i will be back to stay again",5,2012,02,20
247,"Great value,friendly, welcoming, comfortable","We got a great offer. Excellent rate, with parking included.
Lovely welcome. All staff were friendly and efficient. The room was of good standard and well maintained. Any problems or requests were quickly dealt with. We had stayed here before, but thought there was a definite improvement from before.",4,2012,02,20
247,Dublin Weekend,"We had our 2 night stay booked through living social. On arrival the staff were pleasant and the hotel was warm. I was disappointed in the room, it was clean and tidy but the lighting was terrible, it was too bright and even if you only put one of the bed lights on it was still very bright and not at all cosy and relaxing. There were too many mirrors, the cupboards were mirrored and above the unit was a huge mirror with a very bright light above it also. Again not making it cosy. The TV screen was very small. The room had more of a clinical modern feel so it may suit others more. They had also forgot to have the chocolates and wine in our room on arrival, though when I asked they did apologise and hand them to me directly. The wine that we were given was not at all nice and we only managed to have a few sips before we decided we did not want to drink it. We did notice that this wine was not on the wine menu. The meal we had in the restaurant was really good. The main courses we had were lovely. Though the wine was very expensive and not the best I have tasted (especially at the price).The sweets were not as nice but the mains made up for them! This time I found Dublin very expensive and the taxi costs we were charged were outrageous. At times (not by the staff) some of the people were rude to us. The hotel was fine overall but I will not be visiting Dublin again. I've given the hotel 3/5,had it not been for the hotel staff, the meal we had there, and the Indian meal we had outside of the hotel the overall stay would have got a 1/5.",3,2012,02,14
247,Valentines stay,"My partner and I bought the Living Social voucher for two nights here, wasn't expecting it to be too great for the price but the hotel was nice and the staff were really lovely and helpful. The car park is a bonus as parking is free and secure. Sandymount village is really beautiful - we had our dinner in the Indie restaurant on the second night and it was beautiful food. Also on the first night the hotel itself was offering a 6 course Valentines meal for 30 Euro each, and it was delicious. The hotel is close to Leopardstown race course, so we spent an enjoyable day at the races for the Hennessy Gold Cup day. Only slight problems are the rooms are a little dated, and the bar closes pretty early and is rather quiet so not quite a 5 star but still very good.",4,2012,02,14
247,The extra mile!,"Loved the Sandymount. Very warm welcome, We arrived early following an early flight. No problem though, reception staff checked if room was ready while we enjoyed a fab coffee in the comfy bar. v friendly helpful staff. We booked via Living Social voucher, and had box of chocs in room and voucher for bottle wine. Lovely breakfast too with friendly efficient staff, Can't fault Sandymount and it's right next to Aviva stadium if that's what you fancy. dart station just round corner to take you to city centre. Don't use bus to get here. We got lost! We felt that everyone went the extra mile to make our stay a good one

247,"Great Location, Service, Food; Rooms vary Old v New, water problem","I stayed here - on 2 nights - 22nd and 24th of January.
The first night - I had a nice modern feel room - with large screen tv - and room to do some work. Great value and lovely room.

the second night - 24th Jan - I had a different room in a different part of the hotel - smaller room - with small 10-in TV. Sufficient - but not the comfort feel as the first room.
Uunforthunately there was also a problem with water on the 2nd morning. There was no cold water int he room - so could not have a shower - unless wished to be scalded and no water for the toilet - was not good. hey did offer a new room to shower - to pack up my things - before being showered - and move to a different room - not next door - but down a floor and in a different part of the building - just too much inconvenience - when I had planned to stay in the room for an hr or 2 in the morning to do some work. - before checking out.
But without toilet, washing facilities - I just checked out early and left. They did apologise again and offered an upgrade the next time I stay - but the impact had been made to my morning at that stage. Be aware also that at 12 o clock at night - they do not serve drinks. Once the bar is closed - at public normal hours, then that's it - there is no drink available - even if you wish to drink it in your room. Something I found out to my dissappointment on the 2nd night.
The 2nd evening I did eat in the Bar - and the food was great and good value. Breakfast int he morings wre v good as well.

If I had only stayed the first night - 22nd Jan, I'd have had no hesitation awarding 5/5 marks. The 2nd night stay - due not just to the reduced size room and small tv and older feel room- but the no water problem is something I presume was a once off and has been addressed by now - but that's too late for me. 2nd night would get 2 or 3 out of 5.
Staff were pleasant and helpful as muich as they could be, and the bar staff were efficient and prompt with service.
The Price and value of the rooms was excellent as was the location - for me.
For a Man on my own, having showered the night before - a stay like that with no wather on the morining is just about ok. If I was with my wife and children, then the no-water would have been a bigger problem.
Hotel had free wi-fi in the rooms which was great and a +, as well as Free Car-parking, a rare find in Dublin Hotels in a location like this.

The location is excellent - for RDS, Dart line to city centre or Aviva stadium.
Would I go back - if I knew the water problem was fixed - then yes.",4,2012,02,09
247,Very Enjoyable Experience,"The hotel is very convenient to the DART, to Sandymount Village and Ballsbridge.  It is situated very close to the Aviva Stadium and is located in the ""leafy surburbs"" of Dublin.  It's a really nice area and I felt safe enough to take a stroll on my own into Sandymount Village (approx. 10 min walk).  I stayed in Room 108.  The room was fine but was an ""inter-connecting"" room.  Being on my own I felt a little apprehensive in case someone could open the ""connecting"" door into my room.  Decor was nice and everything was spotless.  When I came back to my room later that night, I could hear people in the adjoining room talking.  In fairness they were speaking in hushed tones and as soon as they heard my light switches go off, they also ""bedded down"" for the night.  I will request a non-connecting room next time.  My sleep wasn't disturbed and the room was very comfortable.  The shower head could do with being updated.  Having said that, my shower was perfectly acceptable.  Breakfast was a buffet style and you could eat as much as you wanted.  The food in the serveries was a tad cold ... I opted for a small Irish breakfast.  While I was helping myself, I was asked if I wanted tea or coffee and this was duly delivered to my table without any delay.  Food was absolutely fine, no quibbles with it at all.  I have to comment on the staff.  They are extremely friendly and helpful, polite and courteous.  If they can help you with something, then they will make it so.  I met with some friends in the bar of the hotel and the bar staff were extremely efficient and friendly.  I will be back to this hotel but I will ring and book my room as you don't get a choice on the booking websites.  There is also ample parking in the hotel and I had to nip off to town the following day and the receptionist allowed me to leave my car in the car park until I returned a few hours later.  What a lovely touch and so unexpected.  Plus it meant I didn't have to face city centre traffic and was able to skirt the city on my way home.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience.  I will return.",4,2012,02,02
247,Great Value for money,"My wife and I stayed early January on a B&B plus evening meal. Really good room with wifi . Meal was excellent. Hotel is next to Dart Train for easy access to Central Dublin. Staff excellent and Breakfast great again served by friendly, helpful staff.",4,2012,02,01
247,GREAT PLACE to stay close to Dublin City Centre,"Convenient to the City Centre via the ""Dart"" metro system (10 mins into town) and close the the lovely Sandymount Village and Dublin's sea-front & beach.

........and with Free Parking (saving you up to €20 Euro a day !!!).

We went to a concert in the O2 (SO SIMPLE via the Dart to Connolly and Luas direct to the concert door).",4,2012,01,31
247,Comfort & Style at a great price,"Stayed here for 1 njght - Sat 28/01 - and found it to be a really friendly, warm comfortable hotel. Stayed with my wife & 2 year old little girl & the room was lovely & warm & spotlessly clean. Had dinner in the Tritonville bar that evening & food was very tasty. I had seafood chowder starter followed by the fish & chips - my wife skipped the starter & had lamb tangine which she was very impressed with. The only little complaint I have is there was a long wait for the mains after my starter - close to half an hour I would say. Had a few drinks in the bar after meal while my wife put the little one to bed & all in all a very pleasant evening. Was surprised to see there wasn't a residents bar in hotel especially with all the rugby matches in the Aviva coming up but this wasn't an issue for me. Would definitely stay again...",4,2012,01,31
247,"Fantastic Hotel, highly recommened…","Great staff, so helpful.   Lovely clean room, was so quiet and relaxing…  Breakfast was perfect.  I honestly can’t find fault with anything at the Sandymount Hotel…  

The Sandymount area is great, just a hop from the City Centre on the Dart, bus or by Taxi.

All within a 10 minute walk… Sandymount Green is a great spot with a few very nice restaurants,  Brownes is a gem! (french).  The promenade walk along the sea strand was very nice too.

Fantastic on every count.",5,2012,01,25
247,Great value,"I brought a group of 15 colleagues from around the world to Dublin for a week of meetings. We stayed in the Sandymount Hotel and used their meeting room facilities.

The hotel obviously doesn't have nearly the quality of some of the 4/5 star business hotels in dublin like the Merrion, Shelbourne or Westbury, but it does offer superb value.

The hotel is in a nice location - close to Sandymount village and Ballsbridge, near the DART and the likes of Baggot St, Stephen's Green and Grafton St are just about walkable.

There's a nice, relaxed atmosphere in the reception area with coffee, a peat fire and plenty of couches. This makes a big difference to groups who need somewhere to hang out.

The bedrooms are clean and modern, the meeting rooms are perfectly fine, the staff are friendly, the breakfast is standard fare, the bar/bar-food is fine and there's plenty of parking.

Again, I think the Sandymount offers excellent value.",5,2012,01,20
247,surpirsing,"had never heard of this hotel and i went with a coach group for a shopping trip from killarney last december and how surprised i was. The moment we entered the hotel we experienced such warm hospitality from reception staff, bar staff, and restaurant staff. we had a super meal which was well beyond expectations because of being on a coach tour we expected something very ordinary but we were indeed impressed.I can honestly say it was luxury all the way.After dinner there was entertainment in the bar which once again added to our stay. top marks to this 'hidden gem' will definately be back and have recommended it to no end.",5,2012,01,12
247,"""rugby country""","my wife & I visited in November 2011 and it was just like visiting an old friend. The nmae may have changed from Mount Herbert but the same high standards are maintained. The staff, from reception, bar & waiting staff & the chambermaids ensure an enjoyable experience. We have stayed here on many occasions and look forward to many in the future. For those who haven't been here this hotel is ideal for the Aviva Stadium (to me its still Landsdowne Road!) - a short walk from the Dart and excellent restaurants in the Ballsbridge area. We would unreservedly recommend it to anyone looking for a ""chillaxed"" break.",5,2012,01,02
247,An Enjoyable Experience,"When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with a warm welcome from the very friendly, short dark-haired receptionist. She was on hand for anything we required and was very pleasant to deal with. We had food on both eveings in the bar - 1 small problem here - The 1st evening we were charged €1 per dash of blackcurrant cordial so that was €2 for 2 pints of blackcurrant, and on the second we were charged €2 per dash so that was €4 for 2 pints of same!! Found this odd and quite expensive considering you would buy a bottle of cordial for that. It was however a compact but lovely, clean and comfortable place to stay. Its right beside the Aviva Stadium and of course a stones throw from the dart. Breakfast was very nice and bar food was very good too. Staff were nice and accomodating. It was an enjoyable experience and we will return!!!",4,2011,12,22
247,The best value in town.,"This is a little deceptive gem. From the open fire on arrival to the welcoming staff this is a "" home from home"". From the outside it looks like a terrace of houses. Maybe even not too inviting but  inside it's the best. Rose , Beatrice and Michele are the real managers in charge. They run a great show and yes it's value for money with room only at less than € 60. ",5,2011,12,14
247,First Time Visitor Hotel,"Our visit to Dublin and we pre-booked from Australia, the Sandymount Hotel in D4. It turned out to be a good choice. The airport bus driver didn't know the hotel, and this might have been because it has recently been renamed. Although the room was compact, one double and one single bed, it was very clean, there was a good supply of towels and it was warm - and considering we visited Dublin in winter, this was a welcome end to each day!

We included the full Irish breakfast, which included a selection of cereals, fresh, tinned and dried fruits, yogurts, breads and toast with spreads, and eggs (fried, scrambled and poached) bacon, beans, mushrooms, tomatoes, blood pudding, as well as coissants and tea and coffee. You could also have hot chocolate too. 

There was WiFi included, although you did need to get a new password every 24 hours. We had room service for dinner one night which was pretty good, although there was a €2.00
surcharge and we had to pay cash because we hadn't registered a credit card. 

The hotel staff were all friendly and the owner came and chatted to us at breakfast. They stored our bags for us after we checked out which was good because places in town were charging €5.00 to do this. 

I'd recommend the Sandymount because of the above and also it was only minutes walk from Landsdowne Road railway station which was only two stops to town, and the Aviva Stadium. You could also walk to Sandymount where there is a beachfront promenade for walking or running and the village is quite quaint.",4,2011,12,11
247,Great Hotel,"This hotel is in a great location situated directly beside the Aviva stadium and within walking distance to the Convention Centre and The o2 arena. 

The staff are very kind, chatty and very helpful. They welcome you with a happy smile that starts your stay in a pleasant way and this is continued by all staff in the hotel. 

The value for money was excellent at such short notice. 

I would have no hesitation in staying here again and will give enough time to use all amenities. ",5,2011,11,29
247,Lovely Staff,Great location and the reception staff were so friendly - had a lovely stay here!,4,2011,11,28
247,lovely location and friendly staff,We stayed for 2 nights in an executive room. We had previously stayed in standard rooms but hoped for a bigger room with a better outlook so we upgraded.We had the same outlook(onto an inner courtyard)as we had before and the room wasn't much bigger than the standard ones we had used. We did request another room but this wasn't available.The room was very clean with dressing gowns and slippers and the usual toiletries. The bed was small(double) but comfortable.We ate snacks in the hotel bar and enjoyed the food. There are also  many good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.The reception staff and bar staff were pleasant and friendly and the real fire in the reception area was very welcoming on a cold wet day. Car parking is free and its just a short walk from the hotel to the Dart railway station for travel into Dublin centre or further afield.The Aviva stadium (Landsdowne Road) is very close by and its a short walk to the R.D.S. in Ballsbridge. Sandymount strand is also near for those who like walking by the sea. This  is a  good value  three star hotel in a lovely leafy location. Our only complaints would be the small bed and limited out look. We were also disturbed twice during our second night 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. by people standing below our window in the courtyard presumably to smoke and also to  practice their auditions for the X factor. Yes the windows do open but not wide enough for a bucket of water! We will probably stay here again as we like the location  and the outdoor areas and garden around the hotel  . If they get bigger beds we will definately stay again.,3,2011,11,22
247,Enjoyable Stay,A nice enjoyable stay. Good location in the city. Dublin is a great place to visit and would recommend it.,3,2011,11,15
247,Great location in a nice area,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights to get a feel for the hotel since we are putting a group into the hotel for the Notre Dame/Navy football game next September 1.  We found the hotel is located only 1 block from the Aviva Stadium.  The rooms were very nice for a 3 star hotel and the bar and resturant were good but it didn't have the feel of a cosy Irish Pub.

It was a 5 block walk to the Sandymount Village green with the closest pubs and and places to eat.

The staff was very friendly and helpful in giving us directions to the different areas.  He DART is across the street from the stadium and would have been great to get to city centre if it hadn't been closed because of the flooding.

I would recommed this hotel for anyone going to the Aviva Stadium or who likes to stay away from the city centre in a quite area with close public transpotation.",4,2011,11,13
247,"The hotel is ok, just ok.","I stayed at this hotel last weekend for 2 nights. The hotel looks nice from the outside and the main reception area is nice too and I found the staff to be pleasent. 
However, the bedroom that we were shown to was tiny and very drab in its decor. The double bed was really only a large single and the wardrobe was so small as to be rendered useless. The bed is beside the wall that leads onto the main corridor and as the walls are very thin you could hear every single footstep and every single conversation held between people as they passed along the corridor. 
The en suite bathroom was so small as to be farcical. The toilet was wedged into the room with so little space the lid of the toilet seat couldn't stay up and if you didn't remain totally upright on the toilet seat you hit yourself off the wash hand basin that was directly in front of you as your perched. 
There were no little extras whatsoever provided, e.g. shower caps, shower gel and the toilet paper was of dreadfully poor quality. For the price paid (€90.00 per night) I certainly expect more.
Upon checking out, when asked if everything was ok by the girl on reception, I told her how I felt about the room, etc and her only response was that the hotel was built a long time ago and the next time I stayed they would try to find me a bigger room. 
I don't think I'll be staying again. 
If you're after location and a nice area then this hotel doesn't disappoint on this score. The Ballsbridge/Sandymount area is really lovely and located very close to the city centre and sea. There are many other hotels close by though that I would check out long before I'd stay here again.",3,2011,11,07
247,Bog Standard,"I honestly cannot understand how anyone can give this hotel a good review.  The lobby area is dull and uninviting, the receptionist on check in wasn't much better.  After following a long narrow corridor we found our room and ""bare, basic, dark & dingy"" is the only way I can describe it.  Bare walls and gross curtains, the tv was stuck in a built in box with only a couple of channels & no remote control, although I was promised one when I rang reception, it never arrived.  The bathroom was old and grotty with mould all over the tiles and hard toilet paper.  There was a small window that was filthy all around it & had a broken handle.  The fan on the wall (also grubby) had a nail sticking out.  There was soap over the sink but over the bath was a bottle of body and hair soap..... I don't use body soap to wash my hair!!!  Breakfast the following morning was chaos even though we went down early to avoid the last minute rush, it honestly didn't make any difference.  The staff were all over the place but the girl (who seemed to be their supervisor) was to blame for this.  We stood at the desk waiting to be greeted, after 5 minutes she came over and her greeting was ""What's your room number? not the ""Good morning"" we were expecting and told us to sit down anywhere.  As all the tables were dirty we had no choice but to take one, eventually someone did clean it.  The food at the self service was ok, the fresh fruit was empty but the hot food was good.  There were lots of staff but yet no clean tables and we had to call someone to ask for tea/coffee.  The supervisor spent her time calling staff to her desk to discuss rotas for the week ahead!!!!  On check out the receptionist didn't ask if we enjoyed our stay so I didn't bother to tell her.  For the same level of comfort, far better service and less than half the price I would recommend the D4 hotels around the corner.",2,2011,11,07
247,"Up for ""THE"" Gig","We stayed here recently when attending 'the' gig of the year at the O2.  Found staff very welcoming and helpfull on arrival. The bar food was great.  Service quick (as we were tight on time to make the O2.  Shuttle bus to O2 was available but we decided to take taxi as we didn't want to rush our meal. Very pleasently surprised when we were offered a lift by the owner. ""Free Parking"" also- another plus! Delighted we discovered the Sandymount Hotel.  Normally stay in that general area when in Dublin.  Will definately be staying here in future.",5,2011,11,04

We had travelled overnight from Toronto and went to the hotel early to leave our bags.We were very pleased when told that our room was available.The staff were friendly and helpful with suggestions for tours and transportation.The hotel is located very close to the Dublin Area Rapid Transit system (DART) and the AVIVA stadium.(Landsdowne Road).The hotel is located in a quiet area but only three DART stops to Dublin centre (Tara Road).Our room was clean and comfortable.The food was good and reasonably priced.The staff were always friendly and helpful.We felt that we received good value for our money and would definitely stay again when visiting Dublin.,4,2011,10,25
247,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Stayed here on a Saturday night. Fab little hotel in a great location!
lovely clean lines and modern in reception area and hotel bar & restaurant.
Great for a girlie night out in town! great place to start your night in. Super location if you are going to the Avia! 

Rooms are newly decorated - bathrooms are a bit dated but the power shower was amazing! Would return again",4,2011,10,17
247,Nice hotel,"It's a nice hotel, the rooms are clean and comfy, the food is excellent and reasonably priced. There is free parking (always a bonus in Dublin City) and the staff are quite nice. It is just minutes walk from the Dart station which brings you straight in to the city centre and is the same distance from the Aviva stadium so would be extremely handy for there. 

All in all a nice hotel if you get a good deal.",4,2011,10,14
247,Pleasant Stay,Just enjoyed a pleasant one night stay here at the refurbished Sandymount in Ballsbridge. Stayed here many years ago when it was the Mount Herbert. Has recently been refurbished and is very pleasant. Bit of a rabbit warren - lots of corridors and the rooms seem to be all almost identical but they have what you need and of a resonably high standard. Very nice breakfast. Nice staff and a good location. Would recommend.,4,2011,10,11
247,Lovely Hotel,I satyed here last year and went to a rugby match. the hotel was great first impressions were good but  got better as the weekend went on. stayin in the end of october for the marathon cant wait to go as i found the hotel very relaxing. the food was lovely as i love my food i can be very picky but this was lovely. the staff were also very friendly and were available to any problem that we had. lovely hotel and looking forward to my next stay.,5,2011,10,08
247,All the fun of Dublin,My wife and I stayed at this hotel and could not have been happier with the service and the location of the hotel. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful and were more than happy to accommodate and answer any and all questions we had whether it they were about the hotel or what to do in and around Dublin. We have stayed in this hotel on many occasions going back nearly 10 years and have never had any problems with the service we have received. I would recommend this hotel and in fact have recommended it to friends and family. It is well situated for the Dart station and niot far from the centre. The transport system is very good and there are a number of good shops and sights nearby.,4,2011,09,30
247,Better and better,"We stayed here a few months ago and were impressed, staying again last weekend it was even better. We had a lovely room which was quiet and very well presented. The location is just great, beside the stadium and a walk to the city centre (though we are walkers it has to be stressed). The staff are efficient if not effusive but the accommodation is very well maintained and presented. The fact that it's a family run hotel just makes it for us the best place to stay when visiting Dublin.",5,2011,09,28
247,Our wonderful stay at Sandymount Hotel,"Stayed at Sandymout for recent Eng vs Ireland rugby match - fantastic location, wonderful atmosphere on match day. Very convenient location  for match and sightseeing the folowing day. Friendly and helpful staff. Good car parking and other facilities. No hestitation in recommmending the hotel for match or sightseeing visits to Dublin. Lovely hotel - pleasant rooms and super location. Will be staying here again if possible.",4,2011,09,22
247,"A nice, comfortable hotel","We stayed at the Sandymount for the recent Ireland -v- England Rugby International and were ideally placed just a couple of minute's walk from the Aviva Stadium. There was a large free car park for our hire car (which we didn't use for a couple of days because the transport links are so good). The hotel room was a very comfortable double, if a little difficult to find at first in a maze of passageways. The bathroom was adequate, but could do with a bit of extra cleaning perhaps and definitely some new towels. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. If, like us, you've been to Dublin before and have ""done"" Temple Bar and maybe fancy somewhere a bit less crowded, try going south on the DART to one of the towns along the coast. We went to Dalkey in the evening which was a very pleasant little seaside town where there a number of decent pubs and restaurants. All in all, the Sandymount was a good place to stay and we would go back.",4,2011,08,31
247,Fantastic Hotel,"I would have no hesitation in recommending the Sandymount Hotel. The hotel is exceptionally well run and beautifully maintained. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. It's in a great location, 15 minutes to walk in the city centre or a couple of stops on the DART into the city. Close to the city. close to the beach, close to the Aviva stadium and close to the RDS. I will definately stay in this great hotel again.",5,2011,08,29

247,go some where else,"good points the room was clean and food was fine, now for the rest toilet so close to wall you had to sit side saddle no hot water on Sunday morning and the noise at 4am 5am was enough to waken half of the guests on  corridor .Night staff did try to quieten them down waste of time when i plus another guest complained at reception they looked at us as if we had two heads each . stay in Dublin quite often but will not be back here.",2,2011,08,22
247,Love this hotel and will be back,"Great hotel I have stayed here many times in the past and have recommended it to others.  Reception staff and restaurant staff extremely friendly and courteous.  Got excellent service in the restaurant.  Rooms basic enough but spotless and the bed very comfortable.  The only bad point of our stay here was the barman he was a pig - absolutely no manners whatsoever.  

Also location perfect - only a few steps to the Aviva Stadium and dart stop.  

Will definitely stay here again.",4,2011,08,22
247,Lovely quiet hotel in a busy city,"This hotel is great for anyone going to aviva, can see from hotel and just few minutes walk to the dart station for train to the city.  Lovely bright family room with double and 2 single beds.  Great buffet breakfast, manager stops by and chats to guests in morning lovely touch.  Will definately stay again, so quiet no traffic noise.",4,2011,08,21
247,Rust coming out of the tap,This is a glorified b&b and not a good one at that  beds hard and uncomfortable. The loo was so close to the bath you could not sit on it  and rust coming out of the tap  very odd.  And expensive,1,2011,08,08
247,"brilliant weekend, will be back.","Its a great hotel! Where its situated is absolutely perfect! Part of our group was attending a soccer match in the aviva which was only a stones throw away from the hotel. And the dart was just up the road, to get into Dublin for a bit of shopping. 
We had breakfast our first morning and it was lovely but a tad expensive if not included in your room price at 12 euro per head.
The staff were lovely, especially the receptionist on our second night, giving a description of the area, advising us on which restuarants to go to for dinner and booking a table. 
There was only one or two negative points, the rooms were very basic. I guess i expected more. But saying that, they were very comfortable and cleaned everyday. And an alarm went off early in the morning in the hotel, which woke us up and took approx. 40 minutes to turn off.
Overall it was a great stay and i would stay there again for shopping trips and soccer matches . Couldnt ask for more!",4,2011,07,31
247,July 31,"Stayed in this lovely Hotel for 2 nights in mid July, The Hotel is sitiated on a quiet Road 2 minutes walk from the Aviva Stadium, 10 minutes from the pretty Village of Sandymount  . The staff are brilliant and welcoming, the rooms are fine , large and spotlesly clean, Food is good, have no complaint, great Hotel , great area, close to bus and train to visit Dublin. Will be back",5,2011,07,30
247,Will come back again and again,"Beautiful professionally run hotel, friendly warm expert staff and the amazing Loughran family under the watchful eye of John",5,2011,07,30
247,Perfect for a visit to Dublin,"I stayed here in July on my first visit to Dublin. The hotel is perfectly postioned as it is in walking distance to the DART train which only takes two stops to reach the centre of Dublin. The hotel is excellent, booking in was painless, we actually arrived at about 1.30 pm  but that was no problem. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable.  Breakfast was buffet style and delicious! The choice was very good and was constantly being replenished. I was very pleased and would stay here again. Also the Aviva stadium is about 2 minutes walk from the hotel.",5,2011,07,29
247,A very enjoyable stay!,"This hotel is a really convienient location to the Aviva Stadium.  It is also situated within close proximity to The Dart.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  The room was spacious, comfortable and clean.  There was facilities provided within the grounds of the hotel for the line-up to the concert that was on that particular weekend, which added to the overall experience.  Would Recommend!!",4,2011,07,21
247,Food choice!!,"We arrived about 930 on saturday night due to a delayed train.. And were booked in by a very helpful receptionist who told us that the kitchen closed at 10.00! 
The bar food was very limited & felt under pressure to order!! We opted for steak sandwich.. Not very good!! Very tough & we both ended up leaving half each!!! It said on there web page that the food was reasonably priced, I have to disagree!!!  
But The breakfast was much better...
This hotel is great for location.. Only 10-15 mins stroll to the RDS!!!  ",3,2011,07,19
247,Food Service Bad! Breackfast Great! Staff Nice!,"First night got a meal, there was around 9 of us eating. 4 out of the 9 got there food first. It was obvious that the 5 were forgoten about by the chef. It took about 45mins for the first 4 to get their food. The rest had to wait a further hour to get their food. Never again did we eat there again. Rooms were a bit small, not supirior at all. They were very clean and room service was great. The best part of the hotel was the breackfast! So tasty on a all you can eat breackfast buffy..From huge chocalate chip muffins to sizzling bacon to nuts and fruit. I would stay in it again but would hop on the dart to get a meal in Dublin city!",3,2011,07,10
247,Very pleased with the Sandymount,"We were extremely happy with our stay in the Sandymount. The quality of service we received on arrival was great as we arrived before check-in time but the receptionist got us a room that was ready. Room was clean and bright. Had lunch in the bar and it was delicious. Location was perfect, just a 2-3 min walk from the DART station. Will definitely be staying there again.",5,2011,07,07
247,Great venue for RDS and Aviva,"4 of us stayed here for a concert in the RDS, we found it very welcoming and they even put on a pre-concert BBQ.
The rooms were clean and tidy and breakfast was nice",4,2011,07,07
247,"Great place to stay, you won't be disappointed.","Super hotel with great facilities, attentive and helpful staff. Food excellent brill breakfast and close to all amenities.",5,2011,07,04
247,Hidden Gem,"We stayed one night at the end of July and we loved it. Turn off  busy road in ballsbridge and we enter a quiet suburn. 2 minute walk to the dart station.
Free car parking was a bonus.  Reception staff were fabulous, extremely friendly and helpful. Lobby looks fabulous.
Bedroom was really nice, flat screen TV, the pressure on the shower was brilliant.",5,2011,07,04
247,Looks nice but Noisy VERY noisy with poor food,"Won't stay here again. This hotel looks nice but don't expect a good sleep.

Bar meal re-heated.

Room was SO NOISY as they don't have any sound insulation

Terrible nights sleep as I could hear other the beds creek in the other rooms....

I WILL NOT STAY HERE AGAIN.",1,2011,06,29
247,poor poo and noisey,"absolutely rubbish hotel. its in a posh quiet area but the hotel is huge. the staff while efficent werent very welcoming the whole atmoshere was impersonal and unc. omfortable. are room was Ok'ish, it wasnt overly large but just about enough, the bathroom was small but again just enough. The noise during the night was bad. I hardly slept. the returning guests were noisey, the floorboards creaked everywhere. the rooms did not filter out any noiises they may as well have been in the room. Breakfast was not included and the price was all ready more then the hotel i had just left which was 10 times better with breakfast included. pants all round wont be going there again and its not close to croke park as the hotel claims you have to go by train which annoyingly took me right outside the hotel i had been staying in! plus its another 15-20 walk from there! on the plus side parking is free.",1,2011,06,27
247,"Great location, paper thin walls!","This is a great hotel for the Aviva Stadium (Landsdown Road) and a generally good hotel with pleasant staff and decor. Parking is easy too, and free. However, I stayed in room 36 with a colleague in room 35, and I could practiaclly hear him breathe - and I'm not kidding! Maybe it's just these 2 rooms, I don't know, but I strongly recommend you take ear plugs with you, just in case. 
I must say however that the staff sorted out our complaints very well, and with good grace, so 10/10 for them.",3,2011,06,26
247,"Great vaule, nice hotel - better than I expected","Was in Dublin for a party recently and found it very difficult to get a hotel (a number of concerts were playing the same weekend). If hotels werent completely booked out, they were charging €500 per room!

Eventually managed to booked three rooms in the Sandymount Hotel for €90. I wasnt expecting a whole lot. But was a pleasant surprise! Nice, contemporary rooms - good bar, excellent choice of food and pleasant helpful staff!",4,2011,06,21
247,Always consisently good,"This family owned and run hotel has always been good value, even when the Celtic Tiger was alive! The staff are friendly, particularly the ladies at reception. The rooms are spacious and clean with comfortable beds. The breakfast has a good selection and I would think covers everyone's needs. It is located near the DART trains, a five minute walk, so the city centre is easily accessible. There is even now a bus to the airport that costs 5€, I think.",4,2011,06,18
247,Fantastic hotel & even better staff,"We arrived at the hotel at 11am and was told we could check in straight away which was a bonus as wheeling a suitcase around is not our idea of fun!
The room is possibly the biggest 'standard room' we have ever stopped in and it looks like all standard rooms have one double and one single in. Rooms are exceptionally clean!
We popped into reception on the way back out and the receptionist pointed out where to go and places to avoid which was fab as it was our first time there and didn't want to fall into the tourist traps!
We caught the DART into town (less than 5 minute walk)  which was 2 stops to Grafton street and 3 to O Connoll! The Dart runs every 10 minutes till 11.30pm and is less than 3E return.
We did not eat in the hotel but I wish we had as we went to the bar for drinks before heading out and the food looked amazing. 
The hotel also runs a shuttle to and from the airport which is 5E each and a little more for return. You need to book this service as we didn't and missed the last bus before our flight. This is where the hotel and the staff comes into its own. Knowing we were short of time the owner John very kindly offered to drop us at the air coach stop so we didn't miss our flight! How many places have you been where hotels have got your money and still go that extra mile! 
The hotel is also less than 5 minutes to the new stadium and free parking for guests so if your planning a gig or game this is most certainly your hotel!
I really can not say enough about the staff and hotel and would very much recommend a stop here.
A word of warning though Dublin is beyond expensive! we were drinking a pint of the black stuff and half a lager and the cheapest was 7.50E and the the most was 10.5E. Do not drink shorts as it will set you back 7.20E for a single. The hotel was cheaper to drink in ( not common usually!) 
Wine with meals is aslo mega bucks it was 24E for the cheapest bottle! For this reason we will not return to Dublin as we felt we were being openly ripped off! 
Its a real shame that this hotel can not be picked up and dropped in new holiday locations we wish to try as I have never quiet had a hotel experience like it!
Dublin zoo is a fantastic day out!",5,2011,06,14
247,Does not live up to all the hype in my opnion,"I stayed at this Hotel for two nights towards the end of May. I had read many positive reviews hence I had no hesitation in booking a stay here. My room was located on the third floor, right next to the stairs and unfortunately this caused quite a few problems at night whenever people where coming back to the hotel since their footsteps would wake me up.
The bed was quite comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. Definitely the highlight of the room was the kettle to make tea!
Breakfast was not bad, although there was a bit too much fried stuff for my liking. However there was an ample selection of fresh fruit to make up for this. 
The Internet service was almost non-existent with very weak wi-fi reception in the rooms.
The Hotel is located just two minutes away from the Avviva stadium. This can be a bot awkward for those wishing to visit the center, also given the fact that there are no real restaurants in the immediate vicinity. 
I was lucky enough to buy a ticket on my first night there and went to see the Ireland vs. Northern Ireland match. However the Hotel staff were no help at all in getting a ticket. When i asked at the reception i was told to speak to another member of staff. He told me that he had no tickets and my best bet was to try and buy one off a ticket tout. The irony was that the moment I got to the stadium I met a match steward who was selling tickets for 15 Euros and then i met the same Hotel employee in the stadium... so much for assisting the customer.",2,2011,06,13
247,"Central, trendy & great value",Just returned from this hotel today - it's in a great location just beside the new Aviva Stadium and around the corner from the dart station.  The hotel itself seems to have only recently been re-decorated so the room was great as was the hotel.  Staff were really friendly and helpful.  We got upgraded to the executive floor as they had room.  Coudn't ask for more.  Would definately recommend to family and friends.,4,2011,06,05
247,Pleasant hotel with friendly staff in an ideal location,This is a pleasant hotel situated ina quiet part of Dublin.It is an ideal location for travelling into Dublin from the Dart station which is a 5 minute walk away. On asking for 2 adjacent rooms we were quickly allocated 2 adjoining rooms.,4,2011,05,21
247,A Happy Helpful Hotel,"This is the second time we have stayed at The Sandymount Hotel in Dublin and it will not be our last. Clean,helpful and friendly. Good food from morning to night. Great for concerts at the O2 (Taxi €7 to O2 from hotel). Oh and don't forget it's next door to the Aviva stadium very handy.",4,2011,05,14
247,"Excellent hotel, staff very friend and extremely helpful, accommodation great.","We had excellent service from the minute we arrived.  We were very early and expected to only be able to leave our suitcases but we were booked in immediately and the porter took our luggage to our room.  We were offered a smoking or non smoking room and took the smoking option as my friend smoked.

The room was a twin bedded double and was absolutely fine.  The en suite bathroom/shower and toilet was also great.  It was very clean and the windows were easy to open to let the smoke out.

It is located about a 5 minute walk from the Dart (the local train service) and trains are frequent going straight into the centre of Dublin.  We went to Tara street.  We spent 2 days on the hop on hop off bus and visited many places.  The ticket for the bus now covers two days and not one.

We had travelled to Dublin primarily to go to the Andre Rieu concert at the O2 and the hotel offered a coach service to the concert and back which was inexpensive. They also offered a good service back to the airport.",5,2011,05,11
247,Great Location,"Stayed here for one night with my teenage daughter.  Within walking distance of the RDS,  Aviva Stadium and the Dart Station which is only 4 stops from the city centre.  With free parking at the hotel the whole location is an ideal alternative to negotiating Dublin Traffic and Car Parking Prices.

The only difficulty I encountered was a broken lock system on the sash window and as this was a ground level room looking directly onto the front garden of the hotel and very accessible from the public road I was a bit nervous about the security of the room.

The hotel itself would appear to be an older hotel which has undergone an upgrade but could still do with some tweaking like the toilet roll holder that woudl benefit from a rawl plug to secure it properly on the wall.

Having said all this I would not hesitate to stay here again and the hotel has moved to the top of my Dublin Hotel list.  I have already recommended it to family and friends and it certainly beats its neighbour hotels for the personnel attention given to its guests.",5,2011,05,10
247,I would highly recommend this hotel,"Myself and my husband and 11 yr old daughter stayed here for a night recently and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, the room was immaculate and spacious, plenty of towels and toiletries in the bathroom too. We also ate in the restaurant and the food was very good, although we thought it a little pricey. Breakfast the next morning finished off our stay, and wow, what a lot of food!! As regards where it is, it's literally 2 minutes to the DART into Dublin, and across the road from the RDS. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2011,04,29
247,Totally Pleasant Experience,"Stayed at Sandymount Hotel for 5 nights and highly recommend it for service and attention to detail. Had a wonderful Fish Pie and tasty bowl of vegetables on night of arrival. Very good location for D2 and D4 activities too. 
Will be returning here very soon.",5,2011,04,29
247,"Superb Hotel,Everything you could want, and more!","Just spent a most excellent weekend at Sandymount Hotel. Everything about this Hotel is great. The location is excellent 10 mins walk from sandymount village, and a 5mins DART trip will take you to the city centre.
The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome, and the modern well equipped bedrooms are great. The Hotel has free wi-fi, plus additional computer terminals with free use. The food is truly first class.
The Bedrooms are clean with very comfortable beds,extra pillows and blankets are provided in each room. It's great for the Aviva stadium, DART station  and RDS which are minutes away.
I would be delighted to highly reccomend it to any of my friends",5,2011,04,18
247,First class comfort at a reasonable price,"We loved everything about this hotel, its location, its food, its staff, its free parking. We had great nights sleep due to layout of the hotel. It is a most unusual hotel and it is none the worse for this its very charming and homely. The rooms are very comfortable and clean with all the usual extras.",5,2011,04,16
247,"Excellent location, close to the Aviva Stadium","Sandymount Hotel is the closest hotel to the Aviva Stadium.  It is also very close to Lansdowne Road Station on the DART Railway, with frequent trains to Dublin City Centre.

I visited Dublin with a friend, to attend a Heineken Cup rugby match.  We stayed at the Sandymount for three nights, and combined our visit with sightseeing.  Not surprisingly, the hotel was patronised by lots of rugby supporters.  Most of the guests attended the match and the hotel management erected a marquee in the grounds.  They also set up extra bars and a hog roast.   After the match, there was live (and loud) music in the bar.

This hotel is located in a pleasant residential street,, which is usually very quiet.  Consequently, it is equally suitable for business or leisure travellers, and  provides a perfect location for events at the Aviva Stadium.  However, the entire area becomes very busy, when there is a major event at the stadium.   Consequently, it is worth checking the sports calendar, if you are seeking peace and quiet.

The hotel's reception area and public rooms are clean, bright and attractive.  The breakfast buffet (full Irish breakfast or continental breakfast) was excellent.  Although I did not use the Internet , the hotel facilities include a business centre and WiFi (chargeable).  

Our bedroom was not particularly large.  However, it was spotlessly clean and perfectly adequate for a short stay, with comfortable twin beds, drawers and hanging space in a small wardrobe, and tea & coffee making facilities.  The wardrobe also contained an iron and ironing board.  However, the position of the TV (on a high shelf) was virtually invisible from the beds and chairs.

The bathroom was acceptable, although the shaver light did not work (even though I did report the problem to reception).  The plumbing was slightly temperamental and the only way to fill the bath was to turn on the hand-held shower.  Furthermore, it was very difficult to adjust the temperature of the shower.  On a more positive note, the hotel provided clean towels every day.

Although our accommodation was prepaid (via Octopus Travel), the receptionist requested credit card details (for extras).  We paid cash for everything in the hotel, so there was nothing to pay, when I checked out.  Consequently, I was intrigued to discover that the hotel had subsequently charged the princely sum of €0.01 to my credit card.  I wonder why !

Dublin is not a cheap location and the Sandymount Hotel is reasonably priced.  The staff are helpful and efficient, and I would have no hesitation in staying there again.

You can use the Aircoach service for travel to and from Dublin Airport.  However, the nearest Aircoach stop is a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel.  Consequently, it might be better to purchase a combined Airlink / DART ticket to Lansdowne Road station.

For sightseeing, I recommend a combined Dublinbus/Dart rambler ticket (postage-free from www.dublinbus.ie/en/Fares--Tickets/Tickets/2-Journey-Daily-Weekly/Bus--Rail-Tickets).",5,2011,04,14
247,"Great location, friendly staff","Location is perfect for a city break, or if you're a rugby fan! Staff are friendly and helpful, food in the restaurant well presented and of high quality.",4,2011,04,12
247,Good value,"Stayed here for a long weekend to visit family and explore Dublin. Sandymount itself is a very pleasant area with good quality neighbourhood restaurants. With the DART just around the corner the hotel is also well located for getting into and around the city quickly. The beds were comfortable, the showers powerful and the rooms were neat and clean. We paid just over 50 euros per night for our rooms, which makes the Sandymount very good value in what can be quite an expensive city.",4,2011,04,12
247,Excellent Quite Location: Great value,"As I commute to Dublin for work every day I tend to stay in Dublin once or twice a month for nights out on the town. I found the location of this hotel excellent. 2 minutes walk to Landsdowne road train station which gives you ease of access to the city centre. 
  The hotel staff are very friendly and there is a real family feel to the hotel. The bar is excellent and the bar food superb. I noticed a lot of locals in eating the bar food which gives an indication of the quality of food as there are an abunance of great eating places in the area.
Rooms were very comfortable and modern. Artwork around the hotel is excellent. A real gem of a hotel and great value for money.",5,2011,04,12
247,An oasis of calm - yet very convenient for Dublin city centre,We were up in Dublin to attend a social function in the Aviva Stadium and decided to stay at The Sandymount because of it being only a 4-minute walk away. At the front the hotel comprises a number of lovely terrace house with modern extensions to the rear. Our first impression in our room was of the quietness and it is not close to any busy road. The staff at reception were very pleasant and all the public areas are very modern. The breakfast room looks out onto a garden at the rear of the buildings and is very nicely appointed. A first class hot and cold breakfast buffet was the perfect start to a Saturday morning! Our room was not large but was adequate. The bathroom was slightly old-fashioned with the shower over the bath and just a shower curtain but everything was spotlessly clean. Another advantage of the hotel is that is is just a 7 minute walk to the Lansdowne Road DART station and it is just 2 stops to Pearse Street and a short stroll into Grafton Street and Trinity College. We shall definitely stay here again!  I must also compliment the hotel on the fact that parking for guests is free compared to many of the other hotels in the Ballsbridge area that charge up to €10 per night.  Keep it up!!,5,2011,04,12
247,"A good, functional hotel","We stayed at The Sandymount for one night prior to a ferry journey. The Hotel is located close to the DART and next to Landsdowne Road stadium. We found the hotel to be clean, functional and welcoming and ideal for our purposes. The only fault was that the WIFI voucher they gave me did not work (I could have got another but I didn't bother). Recommended.",4,2011,04,03
247,excellent hotel with great staff and food,"stayed in the sandymount on the last weekend in march 2011 and couldn't have asked for a better hotel.

we arrived early on Friday morning and our room was ready for us which was great.    the hotel is round the corner from a dart station and we got a 3day pass for bus and rail.  the room was clean and comfortable.   all staff were very friendly and the food in the hotel was stunning and reasonably priced.   the buffet breakfast was outstanding and an array of bread, cereal fruit and full fry ups were included.

we  will definitely be returning to the hotel in the future",4,2011,03,31
247,Perfect,"Still my favourite hotel in Dublin - I have stayed here many times. Staff are lovely, there's loads of parking, it's right beside the Dart Station, and the Aviva Stadium. Rooms are clean & comfortable, showers are great... What's not to love?! :-)",5,2011,03,29
247,"friendly, caring hotel","We arrived early mid morning and we were allocated our room within 15 minutes although generally not available until 15.00

Room was pleasant and 2 beds, 1 double/1 single  with ensuite

All staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and evening meals were excellent and good price

Local to AVIVA stadium but although game was on the Saturday and bar/restaurant became very busy there were not problems.
Substantial self-service breakfast which lasted us all day

Easy to get into Dublin centre by Dart (3 stops) and would recommend 1 day DART ticket which allows on and off all day travel in both directions

Although a little disappointed with Dublin Centre, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Sandymount and travelling along the coastline.",4,2011,03,28
247,EXCELLENT,Booked the Sandymount hotel after reading poor reviews on a hotel we had booked somewhere else in dublin i was so glad we booked this hotel from the moment we booked the staff were so caring and helpfull. First when my wife called and told them our flight was arriving a lot earlier that was no problem our room was waiting 4hrs before our original check in time. The staff were so freindly and cheerfull and nothing was a problem for them.The room we stayed in was a twin room and was very spacious and clean our room was cleaned every day we were their and new towels giving. We opted to have the breakfast and it was fantastic the choice was plentyfull and always warm again the resturant staff were polite and happy to look after you. We cant wait to stay at the sandymount hotel again in August.,4,2011,03,24
247,Used the Restaurent and Bar,"Hi We Did not  stay as guests as we live nearby ,but we were pleasantly surprised with the staff and the newly refurbished Hotel.
We have been a few times our sons conformation meal,School reunions,and life celebrations after funerals.
All handled with first class professionalism.This is down in large to the fact its family run.
its in a very safe neighbourhood and nice streets for a stroll if you wish to stretch your legs
I would have no hesitation recommending the Sandymount Hotel.",5,2011,03,21
247,It is like a home away from home !,"We stayed in the Sndymount hotel on the 20th of March 2011.  The staff was super helpful and friendly,  They arranged a family room for us and early check in which was much appreciated after the 18 hour flight we had.  They arranged for our vouchers and discount cards to be delivered to the hotel before we had to check out.  We had a superb breakfast and would recommend this hotel to any one who needs to travel to Dublin.  In my books the Hotel rates more than a 3 star, Well done to you all, See you again on the 26 of March 2011.",5,2011,03,21
247,A perfect base for exploring Dublin,"A perfect base for exploring Dublin and its stunningly beautiful suburban coastline. It’s a period boutique hotel around the corner from the DART commuter train, which takes minutes to get to the City Centre. In the other direction the DART also takes you along the coast on a short ride to Dalkey and Killiney beach.  My husband and I couldn’t fault the Sandymount.  It’s a friendly, characterful, family hotel set in a peaceful road of elegant Georgian houses in Sandymount village near the beach. The rooms are comfortable and spotless and their delicious Irish bacon at breakfast is a great starter to a day in Dublin’s fair city!",5,2011,03,21
247,"Very comfortable, freindly and perfectly located","One struggles to think of a better hotel in the Irish capital than the Sandymount. I stayed for one night in April 2010 and was struck by how comfortable, clean and convenient the hotel was. The rooms are superb and I had a very relaxing, undisturbed night's sleep. Despite the hotel's size, it has all the trappings of a friendly family-run establishment. The breakfast was delicious; and the decor and furnishings fresh, contemporary and uncluttered. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Dublin.",5,2011,03,21
247,Relaxing but convenient location,"My family and I enjoyed a short stay at this hotel in 2010. The location was great, right in the heart of the lovely 'village' of Sandymount. We enjoyed a stroll to the beach but could easily reach the centre of Dublin via the DART. The staff were particularly helpful and the rooms impeccable. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing, convenient location.",5,2011,03,20
247,Comfort and Irish hospitality in one!,"What we liked best was the welcome we received when we arrived at reception.  The receptionist was very friendly and helpful and gave us a very warm welcome, helping us with directions round what we wanted to visit in Dublin.  It had been a number of years since I'd been at the hotel, and I thought it was much improved,   We found our room to be very comfortable and clean and had a good night's sleep.  I would not hesitate to go back there again and use it as a base for visiting Dublin, even though it's a bit outside of the city centre, the walk is only about 20 minutes - or the DART train is just round the corner.  The online room advance purchase offer made the stay even sweeter!",4,2011,03,07
247,"a wonderful experience,the customer still matters here","Wonderful location, so convenient to city centre, yet almost a village setting, Sandymount strand just a few minutes walk.
Very friendly helpful staff, v. comfortable rooms, great breakfast, healthy or not so healthy options, attentive staff re coffee refills, and generally a homely yet professional atmosphere, so different from chain hotels. 
Would recommend for stays in Dublin a real gem.
Congrats to the owners and staff. P.S. genuine review no interests or connections just a happy customer.",5,2011,02,22
247,This Hotel ticks all the right boxes,"All staff very friendly and helpful , free parking a bonus in this area, Rooms were very well equipped and the Bristo served lovely food from a varied menu and the buffet breakfast
selection could not be faulted.
This hotel is ideally located just around the corner from the Dart station for a city centre trip.
Combining value with service I will use this hotel again.",4,2011,02,05
247,Great Hotel - Beware of Taxi Service,"We stayed in this hotel over the weekend 28th/29th January., while attending concert in the O2. We could'nt fault the hotel. It was in a great location, on a lovely quiet road, just beside Lansdowne Road Dart Station ; therefore handy for trips to Bray/Greystones/Howth/or City Centre. The Hotel itself was very clean/warm/homely, & the room was lovely & spacious. Staff were friendly/helpful, & the breakfast was excellent in a lovely bright dining area. The only downside of our stay, was the taxi the hotel booked to take us to the O2 fleeced us, & this left a bad impression. We advised the hotel of this & they followed it up with the taxi co., - no response/explanation as yet. So just be aware of this.",5,2011,02,03
247,excellent hotel great value,"This hotel is what a good hotel should be. Clean, quiet, convenient with friendly helpful and unobtrusive staff I would recommend it to any one.",5,2011,01,28

247,Highly recommended,"We have stayed here a number of times - lovely spacious rooms, great Irish breakfast, good location within walking distance of central Dublin and great value for money.",5,2011,01,20
247,A truly wonderful stay in a fabulous hotel,"Stayed here on 18 Dec 2010 as my husband and I were going to watch Leinster play at the Aviva stadium.  My treat for his birthday.  We arrived at the hotel about 11am and fully expected to leave our luggage with reception and have a wander as the officail check in time is 3pm.  However, we were given our room immediately and told that as it was Ian's birthday they had upgraded our room to and Executive suite.  Wow, what a room!!  Absolutely spotlessly clean, warm and cosy. You can see it on the website, it's the one with the topiary tree in it!

We ate that night in the restaurant and the food was delicious, the best steak ever.  The restaurant staff were efficient without being obtrusive.  Breakfast was awsome too!

The reception staff as were all the other were so friendly and helpful, couldn't do enough for us.  Don't know how far the hotel is from the town centre but we walked easily to Eddie Rockets and some traditional pubs.  The Aviva stadium is literally a stones throw away but no noise or hassle from the crowds, just a brilliant atmosphere when they came to the hotel bar.

We would most definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.  Don't change anything, nothing is broken so don't fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111",5,2011,01,19
247,"Cracking location, wonderful staff","Stayed 2 nights during business trip in Dublin 4 - superb location, right next to Avviva Stadium and Lansdowne Rd DART plus only about 30-40 min walk into city centre if you want to stretch the legs!

Fantastic buffet breakfast (ate loads!) plus the rooms were really comfortable too - special mention to the reception staff who were genuinely welcoming, friendly and helpful.

My third time staying here for business in Dublin and will definately be back!",5,2010,12,30
247,No Luxury But Good Value & Great Location for Aviva,"Had a one night stay recently for a game in the Aviva stadium and found the location perfect .Booked a special for €109.00 which included B&B for two and a pint & baguette before the game .Not bad value for the location especially with free parking which is unusual in Dublin.Because the bar area of the hotel was so busy before the game it was a hassle trying to figure out how to avail  of the offer of the baguette & pint so for any future customers get a voucher at reception go to the carvery in the bar for the food ,keep your voucher and hand it in at the bar for drinks.
I have to say that I found all the staff extremely friendly & patient even with the large crowds that were in the public areas before the game.
This is a much larger hotel than I expected with over 160 rooms spread between 4 town houses & extensions.This has led to a maze of corridors on different levels which can be a little confusing at first.
Our room had a double & single bed with the double probably the smallest  I have seen in a hotel room.The room had a small wall mounted flat screen tv & tea and coffee maker.The bathroom was the biggest let down with cheap fixtures & fittings and very  poor lighting for shaving etc.They only supply those horrible wall mounted  gel dispencers .The shower saved the day with great pressure.
Breakfast was quite good with a self serve selection that should suit most people ,the only thing I could recommend that the hotel would provide a pot of coffee at breakfast instead of trying to get cup refills.
Plenty of bars & restaurants within walking distance and the hotel is situated in a really nice area of Dublin.",3,2010,12,16
247,"Location, location, location!","Superb hotel. Ideally located right beside the new Aviva Stadium, within walking distance to the RDS, and right next to the Dart & major bus routes. From the outside the hotel is authentic, old style but inside the modern decor is balanced with the feel of the building. Staff are friendly and very helpful - particularly when it comes to directions. Rooms are clean & comfy. Parking space's are ample, and are free for residents. Would definitely recommend & will stay again.",5,2010,11,29
247,"Outstandingly underated, comfortable, centrally located, friendly Hotel","A very friendly and efficent welcoming staff,  clean and comfortable rooms, quite Hotel. Centrally located, excellent food. This is a very underated Hotel. Whithin 100 meters of AVIVIA stadium and Lansdown DART station this is an ideal Hotel for Business or pleasure visits to Dublin for a short or long stay. Very reasonable rates and I would recommend highly. I will be back!!",4,2010,11,26
247,A comfortable and friendly hotel in a great location.,Mount Herbert has a bit of tradition but it's also pleasingly modern in a comfortable sort of way. Best possible hotel for Lansdowne Road. Great staff and welcome.,5,2010,11,26
247,Ok,"Choice of this hotel was purely only for the rugby match. The location for the Aviva stadium is great, the DART is just around the corner. The room was NOT like the photos of the rooms on the website, ok for size but more of a tired outdated hotel room. The TV was situated high up on a unit facing one corner of the room making it difficut to watch from the bed. The shaver light did not work and as for the internet, despite being close to public areas there was no access at all. Breakfast in the morning was a good choice of food but with bacon, egg and sausages siiting open with no cover or heat, you can imagine it was not even that warm. The evening meal was quite good and staff very pleasant. Yes it was busy with a rugby weekend and this is only reason to go back because of the location, will ask for a better room next time but will also check out other nearby locations.",2,2010,11,25
247,Very good for location and value.,"Mount Herbert Hotel is a very clean and welcoming hotel, conveniently located beside public transport, yet within easy walking distance of the city centre. The staff are friendly and helpful. All in all, Mount Herbert is very good value for money.",4,2010,11,16
247,This must be one of the worst hotels ever,"I can now understand why this hotel was cheap. Service is horrible, their systems don't work e.g. I had to go and ask new keycard every night. Kitchen is closed 9.30pm that is ridiculous. I hadn't had any food whole day and they were like nothing can be done. I've seen many hotels but nothing like this. Breakfast was only thing that I can say was ok.

Internet is really bad, connection is slow and disconnects all the time. Room was not cleaned, it was dusty like I was first visitor in 6 months.

Awful place, avoid at all cost!",1,2010,11,15
247,Dublin Marathon No No,"Just had to write this review I stayed here when running the dublin marathon 2010
The service and quality is not what is said, there is rooms to this hotel that are in awful shape the rooms are of an incredible low standard smell and if your looking for good service in the bar or restaurant your sadly outa luck steer clear of the food its more of a greasy cafe its thrown together like a slop house, Ive never written a review on a hotel but the staff & management or a complete an utter joke they blame eveyone but themselves for poor service and quality.

Only thing this hotel has going for it is location other than that stay clear!!",1,2010,11,12
247,Reasonable prices in lovely part of town,Right next to the Lansdown Road Stadium meant that the hotel was full of rugby fans when we arrived at the hotel on a Saturday afternoon but the hotel is clean and very comfortable. The prices are reasonable and the staff friendly.,4,2010,11,06
247,Average hotel convenient for Aviva Stadium and Dart,"Stayed here in October. Pleased with room at first glance, bed comfortable (although not very big) and room spacious. Liked the fact there was a safe in the room. Tea and coffee and hairdryer provided and tea etc replenished daily. Tv wall mounted but not plasma as in hotel photos. Bathroom definitely not as in hotel photos  (we must have had one of the older rooms) as ceiling was vey mouldy and paint was peeling off it. Hot tap on sink spun round when you tried to use it and toilet roll holder was falling off wall. Mirror steamed up due to there being no extractor fan, probably causing mould on bathroom ceiling. Shower curtain did not stop water coming over end of the bath. Room and bathroom  'cleaned' daily but we noted certain bits that were not cleaned during the days we were there. One receptionist, think her name was Beatrice, in particular was lovely, the others not so much. Would recommend hotel if you want a reasonable base to see Dublin or go to a Rugby match, and it is quite reasonably priced. Unless you get one of the newer rooms, I am afraid that 'luxury does not await you' as described on their blurb.",3,2010,11,03
247,A great choice if you want an authentic Dublin hotel,"We got a HUGE room. The staff seemed to be mostly local which is great. The value for money was outstanding,. We slept well. The location is excellent as you're in a quiet area but the Dart train is right around the corner. This is NOT an identikit hotel where every room is identical and the staff couldn't give a hoot...it is authentic and genuine and we enjoyed our stay.  A real Dublin / Irish hotel. It has a charm all it's own and we will be back next time we're dublin bound.",5,2010,10,26
247,Ordinary and out dated,"I stayed here for one night with my boyfriend. I had to go to an event in the RDS which is only a two minute taxi-ride away. I won't be going here again. The room was tidy but a bit dated. The fan in the bathroom didn't work. The bathroom floor flooded after showers. The mirror still wasn't clear the morning after. The room itself could have done with a paint job.

Our room was on the ground floor and boy did we suffer for that. I think we must have been below the main reception desk as for the whole night you could hear people walking above us. There was no air-conditioning so as you can imagine it was like a sauna in the room. 

The location for Dublin CIty would not be good but for the AVIVA or the RDS it would be excellent. I normally try to stay in 4 star hotels with nice modern decor but for the one night we said we'd chance this place. 

The breakfast in the morning was OK. Nothing special about it. The lady came with the tiniest coffee cup and only filled it once. The breakfast area/hotel restaurant was very dated. The hotel does have a sign up saying that it is being refurbished so maybe that's something good for the future. We got room service and the  food was nice. 

Good-things about the hotel: lots of parking, location was good and room service was tasty.",3,2010,10,15
247,First class,"A first class hotel,made most welcome by the girls at reception, lovely friendly smiles and very helpful. My bedroom was lovely and clean and spacious, and the chambermaid  a lovely young lady who was very efficient and helpful.
The bar and catering was very good and efficient (The Guinness was lovely)
A lovely hotel situated in a quiet area.
I highly recommend this lovely hotel.

247,"""SIMPLY  THE  BEST""","From the moment we entered the Reception area up to the moment we checked out of the Hotel, we were treated as if we had been the most important guests to have stayed there.  Our room was immaculately clean, with a welcoming tea/coffe service available.
Breakfasts were sumptuous and plentiful as were all other meals.
The Hotel staff were excellent as were the catering and waiting staff in the restaurant.
This was our 2nd stay at The Mount Herbert, and one wonders if it will live up to the service provided on our first visit...No surprises there !!!   
Our next visit, probably in the coming year, will be spent at The Mount Herbert,  where transport facilities were close by and information on the wonderful Ireland, was readily available from the helpful reception area.",5,2010,09,13
247,Perfect Base in Dublin,"We stayed at the Mount Herbert for the first night of an Irish holiday.  The hotel is perfectly situated both for the ferry port and for Dublin City Centre.  There are very good restaurants within walking distance and access to the city centre is easy, whether by car or public transport.  If using public transort, there is good parking at the hotel.

The hotel is bright and pleasant and we had an excellent room with modern bathroom. AND it wasn't expensive.  A definite must.",4,2010,09,09
247,Friendly and efficient service at the Mount Herbert.,"My husband and I often stay at the Mount Herbert.  The location is good - about 15 minutes walk from Sandymount Beach and five minutes from the DART station.  The bedrooms are very pleasant and the staff are very friendly people.  Breakfast is good, service is efficient and the hotel manages to be a very peaceful place even when it is very busy.",4,2010,09,01
247,Lovely hotel. very friendly staff and very central .,"stayed in the hotel for 3 nights husband and two year old baby. Staff were excellent. cot was in room on arrival and aslo a single bed which the toddler loved. 
Ate most evening's in the hotel. bar menu is nice portions are generous.
Breakfast is the best i have seen in any hotel. loads of fruit. yogurts and buffet breakfast.
Hotel is central for the dart. a two minute walk to landsdown station and straight into central Dublin,
A lovely receptionist Mairead took time out to advise me of directions to the zoo and marked out the map for me. very friendy and helpful lady.
Overall. ideal for kids. and lovely quiet hotel and ideal for the leisure relaxing break.",4,2010,08,25
247,Stones throw away from aviva stadium,"Myself and 2 of my friends stayed here as we were going to a game in the aviva stadium. When we booked on line the site said it was only a 2min walk from the hotel, and we weren't disappointed. It was exactly a 2min walk. There is a carpark for people staying in the hotel and there is no charge for it. The staff were all very friendly and the rooms were spacious and comfortable. I will be staying there again if I am ever at another game.",5,2010,08,25

247,A great place to stay when touring Dublin,"Stayed at the Mount Herbert for 2 days, and enjoyed wvwry minute of it.

very good service. Already recommended to friends who intend to 
visit Dublin.",5,2010,08,19
247,"A Great Priced Hotel, close to everything that goes on in Dublin city","Great food, lovely layout, affordable rooms, friendly and obliging staff, and only minutes from al major sporting events and concerts. Highly recommened",5,2010,08,19
247,The staff went above and beyond,"While the rooms are a bit small compared to American hotels, it was immaculate and had everything we needed: large tv, coffee and tea, decent sized bath and a very comfortable bed. It was also quiet and in a great location near the Dart station.

We arrived at 5 AM and the desk clerk went out of his way to find us a room so we could check in early and get some sleep after an all night flight. 
Overall, it was a great place to stay with reasonable rates.",5,2010,08,12
247,Great value. Great location. Great hotel,"It was by an immense stroke of luck that I found this hotel, but an even bigger stroke of luck was the amazing value.
I had seen a Bed/Breakfast and Evening Meal price offered by a supermarket and this led me to the Mount Herbert. When I checked out their website, they had an even better price, for the same offer.
It is a clean, friendly, comfortable hotel in a brilliant location. We were going to a concert at the 02, and could have walked, but decided to get a taxi. A short ride.
We had dinner in the hotel as part of our package, and it was delicious, as was the buffet breakfast the next morning.
The staff are incredibly helpful and I cannot fault any part of our stay. If I had a tiny, tiny complaint it would be that our room was the furthest possible away from the entrance - a bit like Ryanair's gates at the airport!!!! But that was the smallest of nit-picky things to say about an overall enjoyable stay.
Thank you to everyone at the Mount Herbert",5,2010,08,12
247,Very good hotel. Great value.,This hotel is a very good location. Very good staff. Would recommend it for a stay in Dublin. Located just around the corner from the new Aviva Stadium. Also has free parking.,4,2010,08,09
247,Great hotel - wonderful stay,"I would like to thank the Mount Herbert Hotel and its staff for a wonderful weekend on 17th July.I had my hen party there and the staff could not do enough for us.We requested our rooms beside each other and that was no problem.We had a wonderful dinner and breakfast the following day.
The B&B and dinner special was great valu.The hotel is very clean and modern and is perfect for a city break with lots of free parking and right next door to the dart.",5,2010,07,29

247,Best Ever,"Myself and family stayed in this hotel for 3 nights on a short break in Dublin.  The staff are so helpful, our large family room was spotless and breakfast was excellent (even my 4 and 7 year old approved).  The hotel is in a beautiful area out of the city centre which you can walk, or, take 3 stops on the DART train (station round the corner) to the centre of Dublin.

One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in - cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2010,07,14
247,"Excellent value hotel, a great find!","At only 60 Euro a room in a good area in Dublin, this was a great hotel. Rooms are basic enough, but had everything we needed. Staff were exceptionally friendly & so helpful when we were booking taxi's. Really lovely beer garden. Only a short walk into Sandymount, and short bus ride into town. Would def stay here again, especially if we we going to a match or concert in the Aviva (new Landsdowe) as it is literally on the doorstep!! Oh & free parking too :)",4,2010,06,26

247,Great location,"Great location short walk to the dart the directions from staff very good thanks. 
I’m glad i was in the room just the one night. On first opening the room door the smell was terrible reminded me of a gym changing room smell. After a 4hr drive to get there not a good start. Opened the window rite away stayed in room 10 min & out for the evening to a concert. Up at 7am and away 8:30am great. smelly room one factor that can be improved on very easy so this maybe a one off.
bed linen very good - clean. Bathroom very good - clean. Breakfast very good/great. and not the room on the web site photos completely different image. Requested double got to singles. Too short a stay to complain to staff. . . . Again Great location",2,2010,06,08
247,Can't argue with the price. Can argue with the food.,"The hotel is very well located close to the city centre. The hotel has recently been done up but it now has a mish-mash of old character with some very modern features. The hotel is 5/6 old houses. Doesn't really work with the new decor and the old ceilings and pictures.
The rooms were clean. The bathroom was very dated though. In fact the bath itself looked like it was 20 years old if it was a day. The room had a small portable tv which you would need to squint to see (and I have good eye sight).
The free parking so close to Dublin's city centre is a huge plus. Most places in the area either charge or do not have secure parking. 
The food in the bar is only so-so. Best described as canteen/take-away type. Even the menu is in a cheap plastic sleave. It tasted fine but if you don't like chicken wings, fish in batter or BBQ ribs there's very little available bar a small selection of salads. Unfortunately, the main restaurant was not open when we were there.
The breakfast in the restaurant was very good. Wide selection of cold meats, fruits, yoghurts, cereals and a mixed grill if you wish. 
Overall I would stay here again because of it's proximity to the city centre and the parking.  We got a great rate for one nights B&B and evening meal so I can't knock the place too much. 
Ideal fo rugby and football matches in the new Aviva which is about 300 metres away.",3,2010,06,03
247,Nice but further out than i thought,"This is a nice clean hotel, the interior is stylish and the breakfast is to die for, pay in advance and eat as much as you can, from cereal and muffins to a full irish. The bar food is also quite nice i thought, although im no gourmet chef.

I can't really comment on the bedrooms as i requested a smoking room and so thats what i got and i know that they are usually of the poorer quality, in other words it didn't look like the rooms on the web site but i was not dissapointed, the bathroom was clean and the bed comfy.The only fault i did have with the bedroom was that there was neither a mini fridge nor a safe, which left my friend havin to carry her ipod with her all night.

Also it says it is just over a mile from the O2, this is obviously ""as the crow flies"" because even in a taxi it took quite a while, i would not have liked to walk it!!!

On the whole it was a good hotel if your heading to the aviva it's ideal as it's literally 10 steps but for the city or the O2 i wouldn't recommend it.",4,2010,05,27
247,Great Location and value for money,"Great Location and value for money.

the bedroom was lovely, bed was sooo comfie!! lovely decor.. so lovely the boyfriend wants to use the colours 4 our home haha

we were going to a show that night in the Giety and had pre-booked a taxi, came on time, was so close to Gaiety. Been from North Dublin ourselves, I didnt realise how close Landsdowne was to City centre!!

247,"very friendly hotel, beautiful location","My 14 year old daughter and I stayed at the Mount Herbert Hotel for a few days. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only problem I found with the hotel was the food. The dinner was uninteresting, dull and badly cooked. It was a pity because the hotel had everything elso going for it. Very convenient to trains and public transport. Lovely leafy neighbourhood. Can recommend staying there but definitely eat out.",3,2010,04,12
247,What a Lovely Hotel!,"What a lovely hotel this is. Our thanks to all the staff, in particular Mairead, who was so helpful on reception and Paddy for the numerous top ups of strong coffee at breakfast. This hotel is great value for money, the rooms are of a high quality, well-maintained and very comfortable. The attention to detail is excellent (e.g. plenty of tea and coffee in the rooms, staff on hand 24 hours to deal with enquiries, the option of a complementary mug of coffee on your way out the door in the morning if you have no time for breakfast). The fact that this hotel is family run, in our opinion, contributes to the high quality and personal touch; it means a lot when the director of the hotel comes and talks to his customers at breakfast, as John does. Thank you once again for making our stay in Dublin such a good one.",5,2010,03,19
247,Good Deal,"We stayed here five nights, as we attended a trade show at the RDS.  We got a pretty good deal.  The hotel was fine, although the room was somewhat small.  We had to put our suitcases on the floor in front of our beds.  The bathroom was no-frills and rudimentary, but provided the necessities.   The beds were very comfortable.  Breakfast was included, but was ok, not great.  However, the hotel was a good deal for the price.  A bit of a hike to the RDS, but at certain times, there was a shuttle bus we did not use.  In decent weather, the canal pathway provides a wonderful path leading you close to the RDS and Ballsbridge's best restaurants.  If you can get a good rate, this is definitely worth the money.",4,2010,02,08
247,Lovely hotel/Location/Price,"my wife and I stayed here for 1 night on 26-27/12/09. booked it on booking.com and got it for a price that you would expect to pay for a 3* hotel. And this would definitely be 4*. to be truthful if we hadn't got it at a god rate, we normally would have thought of this hotel as being out of our price bracket.
Everything about the place was classy- great reception staff, lovely modern building, large well presented rooms and great breakfast. The location was great too- only a short bus/taxi ride into the city centre and right beside the RDS Showgrounds, where we went to see our rugby team, Ulster, being beaten by the local team, Leinster (and the ref!)
Could not say anything bad about this place. And despite its high class, the staff remained friendly and approachable, even when I requested, and received a room move. (NB- many rooms to the rear are positioned over a massive air con unit. Noise mostly blocked by double glazing but I didn't take a risk). 
If you can get this price at a god rate via a i-net booking site, go for it!",4,2010,01,03
247,Excellent value hotel close to city centre,"Hotel in good location just outside city centre. It is 2 mins from Landsdowne Road stadium and 4-5 mins from the DART station which is 3 stops to the city centre - 1.65 euro and every 15 mins. They run to about 11.30pm.
Room clean & warm and the bed was comfortable. Plenty of wardrobe space available & there is a safe in the room. Good range of TV channels available. Shower powerful and bathroom big for a hotel.
The bar was large and usually busy - I would imagine the patio area overlooking the garden to be really nice in the summer but its not too good in November!
Staff were able to check us in and let us have our room at 8.30am which was great after an early morning flight. Room was excellent value via hotels.com - did not have breakfast at the hotel so can't comment on the quality.
If you get chance walk to Sandymount (15 mins walk max) and have a look round the old village and a walk along the seafront.

My only criticism would be the noise through the walls from next door which appear to be very thin and if you don't want to be woken by cleaning staff at 8.30am at the weekend make sure you put up the do not disturb sign - they are quite noisy and persistent! I was also unable to get the internet in the business centre working.

Something to note the Aviva Stadium reopens in March 2010 so if you want a peaceful weekend after this I would make sure there are no major sporting events on as the hotel may well be full of groups of people going to the stadium.",4,2009,11,16
247,A clean hotel with helpful staff. Easy access to city center via bus.,"We stayed here twice for a couple of nights in August and September 2009 as a bookend for our trip to Ireland and Spain. We had a family room, with two twin beds and one double/queen. The beds were very comfortable and the room and en suite bath were very clean. The hotel itself shows a little wear and tear, and the layout is a little convoluted, but it's a popular place for a reason: price, not too far out of the way, and the staff is very pleasant and helpful. One thing, they tell you to take the metro to the center of Dublin, but a short walk to Ballsbridge to catch the bus was actually much more convenient.",4,2009,11,04
247,nice but cold,"Nice reception staff.
Prompt check in.
Ordered room service which was quick to arrive. Food was cold and old...
The room was also very cold even with the heating on full.
Good location and cheap price via hotels.com.

Maybe stay here again if room was warmer.",3,2009,10,06
247,"Fantastic hotel, great location & friendly staff","I suprised my fiance for a weekend in Ireland and we stayed at the Mount Herbert for 3 nights. The hotel is in a superb location so close to the centre of Dublin and the staff couldnt have done enough for us helping us plan our 3 day stay. The rooms were lovely and the beds were very comfortable. One one of the evenings we stayed in the hotel and enjoyed a few drinks in the bar which had a great atmosphere and the food was delicious. I'd highly recommend staying here, I'll definitely be back!! 
Fulham, London",4,2009,09,30
247,"Nice, Clean & Friendly Staff","Stayed here whilst travelling around Ireland with my Girlfriend. It was recommended by a friend and i must say, what a recommendation!!! We were only in Dublin for a few days and this was a great hotel as it was close to the city centre but not to close so we were able to have a bit of privicy. We ate in the hotel bar one evening and really enjoyed the meal (not to mention the guinness that was flowing that evening), simple food but all cooked and presented perfectly. Clean, Spacious & Comfortable rooms meant next time we are back in Dublin we will definately be staying here again.",4,2009,09,30
247,Warning to travelers with CPAP machine,"We stayed at the Mount Herbert for several nights during the Irish Derby.  This hotel has NO OUTLETS near their beds... the lamps, etc, are all wired into the wall.  I had to borrow an extension cord from the front desk for my CPAP machine and they were not very happy about lending it to me as they ""needed it for presentations"".   This may be typical for a European hotel, I don't know, having only stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel before this in Ireland and the Shelbourne has outlets.",3,2009,09,23
247,Great hotel!,"Dublin was our last stop on our Ireland journey, which was both amazing and stressful, and so our room at this hotel was a sort of safe haven. The staff was incredibly helpful and our room was huge! The hotel was conveniently close to the Dart train station so that we could easily travel into the heart of Dublin without worrying about parking our car. The breakfast buffett was very good and dinner in the pub was excellent. It was a tad hard to find at first but that's forgivable once you walk in the beautiful lobby. I would love to stay at this hotel again.",5,2009,09,17
247,Proof of payment,"I was debating wether to write this or not but after further reflection I think I should as writing to the Hotel I would only get the cold shoulder.
Afetr eating a relatively nice meal in the bar, we had just left our table when we were verbally attacked by the barman acusing us of not paying our bill. I would not mind but he did it in front of all the other guests within the bar. I tried explaining to him that we had paid the waitress but he insisted that we had not. I attempted to show him the receipt but he just kept on being aggressive. I asked him to get the Manager, he told me that he would get the police.

When the Manager came he introduced himself as the General Manager, he did not let us explain but listened to what his staff was saying. Then the Manager had the cheek to tells us that we had not paid. I was dumb struck, I took out my wallet and showed him our receipt for what we had eaten in the bar. No apology given he just said it was an honest mistake.

I asked to speak to a more senior member of Management or the owner. I was informed that I would get no higher than him as he was the General Manager. This was my second time staying at this hotel during the Horse show event and it will be my last.

I would suggest that the owner take a good look at how his hotel is being Managed. Never before have I been more insulted. These so called ""Managers"" what has happened to Irish Hospitality and further more having a manager just out of nappies managing a hotel.",1,2009,09,13
247,Excellent servive great location,"Great location close to Dart. Excellent conference facilities, free parking . I was greeted with a smile very rare these days .Very knowledgeable receptionist and very reasonably price bar menu . The hotel has really pleasant surroundings beautiful gardens and a bar terrace overlooking the gardens was a nice place to lunch with my clients This little gem of a hotel is located just 3 minutes from the new Aviva Stadium and I will definitely be back.",5,2009,09,05
247,Dublin's Best Hidden Gem,"On my arrival to the hotel I was greeted by extremely friendly reception staff, which checked us in nice and quickly. The room that we were staying in was perfect,it was very spacious as there was myself,my wife and our 3 kids. 
Breakfast was beautiful and it is served in their restaurant looking out over a beautiful garden scenery. The garden outside was perfect for the kids to have a bit of a run around after breakfast. 
Your also a 2 minute walk to the train station which is only 7mins from the city centre.
Unfortunately we didn't have dinner in the hotel.
Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so memorable. I will definitely stay again.",5,2009,09,02
247,Great Hotel in sea of bad hotels!,"I stayed at four hotels in Dublin on an extended work trip before I found this place.  I needed three things: 1) A gym in or near the hotel;  2) an ironing board in the room and 3) a kettle in the room.  And to be near my work in Ballsbridge.  The Burlington and Ballsbridge Court hotels have irons and kettles but don't have gyms but are near one - I could go on about these places and their grand lobbies and shabby rooms with no outlets.  After those two I went over to the Herbert Park Hotel. Expensive-er (120 euro / night) but pretty nice; however, no iron or kettle. I asked if they could allow me a kettle and was told I should use room service. This was from someone about to stay another 5 weeks.  A cab driver, listening to my rant about the kettle,  told me about the Mount Herbert: the owner called me, picked me up at a convenient time from work, took me to the hotel to show me the facilities and room options.  They sent a van for my stuff (as I had a bike I needed a large car) and paid for it.  The service is great. Food good.  Breakfasts are yummy full irish dealios.  This family run place is so accomodating and out of the way, not far from the sea but next to the train station if needed, and a nice walk to Ballsbridge, and near the gym.  Really good place for family, or business.  Somehow they make it fit for both.  Try it  you'll like it.",5,2009,09,01
247,Security for Dinner!!,"I stayed here with my family for the August bank holiday. We had a gift voucher for 2 nights b+b plus one evening meal.  On arrival check in was quick and we were staying in room 114 which had 2 single beds one double and a cot so first impressions were excellent. So off we went to find the room which was like going through a maze took us about 10 minutes to find it as the lift was broken.  

Breakfast the next morning was lovely so we were looking forward to our evening meal, what a joke that turned out to be, service was prompt but the starters were cold, the main course inedible, I was afraid to try the desert.  I complained about it to the duty manager and refused to pay for the childrens meals as ours was terrible as we only had the voucher for the adults meal but he said we would have to pay or he would get security... and we would be kicked out of the hotel I argued with him about it for about 5 more minutes where he said he would have to speak to the actual manager. He later apoligised after speaking to him but I felt that this should not have happened in the first place if the food was not eaten you shouldn't be expected to pay for it. We were offered no alternitive food so had to order in a pizza later which the receptionist kindly arranged for us. Imagine !!

The only plus was the parking and the ease at which you could get into the city.  We went to Dublinia which was interesting and good value for money but would I stay in this hotel again NEVER.......",1,2009,08,31
247,Very Nice Hotel,"We chose this hotel because of it’s location near Ballsbridge.  It was situated close to where my daughter was staying for the last few weeks.  It turned out to be a great location, out of the noise and hassle of the city.  
The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful.  This was our first day in Ireland and we needed a lot of assistance.  The staff was patient and explained how some things worked and helped with other things.  
The hotel is remarkably clean, better than you would find in an American hotel.  We stayed on a warm Saturday night, the hotel does not have air conditioning but the breeze at night was cool.  
In the morning we sat on the small patio in front of the hotel and had coffee while we read a newspaper that the hotel supplied. Very pleasant.
We would return to the Mount Herbert if we are in Dublin again.",5,2009,08,21
247,Don't go there!,"Stayed for the €99 b&b pus one evening meal deal.  This is the fifth Dublin hotel we have used for this type of deal, without doubt this was the least value for money.
The 'hotel' is really an over grown guest house with a ladbrith of corridors to reach the bedroom.  The quite bedroom requested was opening to the main carpark, there was no AC and not even a fan available from the reception.  The bedroom was small, one chair one bedside locker, no table, the TV affixed so high to the wall it was uncomfortable to watch. The room had a small double bed and a single bed so definately lacked furniture for three people if there were three staying in it.
The evening meal was not great, first the restaurant was closed so you eat in the pub section, that is how I would describe the 'bar' area. The plastic/leather look seating was old and felt dingy.  The picture windows gave wonderful views of cobwebs and spiders, albeit on the outside, but the inside of the frames could have been cleaned as well.  Staff cared less about guests, while eating our meal, a female member of staff came round to see if our meal was OK, before I could lift my head she was gone! I overheard another forgien couple being asked to pay cash for their meal as they were not allowed to add it to there bill and the bar didnot accept credit cards. We had one starter, and two main courses and were still charged a €12 supplement, so much for the three course meal included in the price.
Over all theMount Herbert is dated, in need of major face lift, food was below adverage and staff could be more visible and available. The bedroom was small, pokey and needed new carpet. The ensuite was tiny, and the 'stick to you' shower curtain a real put off! Would not recommend the \mount Herbert and will not be back.",2,2009,08,19
247,Not good - Held my luggage hostage!!!!,"I stayed at the Mount Herbert from 4-7th August 2009 while competing at Dublin Show.  I checked out on 7th August and paid my bill, I asked staff if I could leave my luggage until later as I didnt want to travel around the show pulling bags.  I advised I would collect later that day.  When I went to collect my luggage at approx 7.15pm I nipped to the bathroom and my friend who I had arranged to travel home with was interriogated by the duty manager about an outstanding bill that I owed them for.  When I returned I was greated by a bill being thrust into my face and was told I owed an additional 150 euro for dinner the previous evening and would not get my luggage.  I explained that I had dined with 2 other people and had paid the bill afterwards.  The duty manager continued to argue with me and then asked me to step into a private room until he got the waitress that had served me the previous evening.  I was due to catch a train to Belfast at 8.45pm and we had been detained until 7.40pm and still had not got our luggane or spoken to the waitress who would clear it up, by this time and had to arrange for a taxi to enable us to get to the train on time.  At approx 7.45pm we were given our luggage and told we could leave I asked the duty manager in question if the hotel, would pay for the taxi as it was due to an error on their part that we had been held and missed our dart train to connect and ment we had to book a taxi.  At this time the General Manager, Liam Hurley, who had been standing in an offce behind reception approached us and said the hotel would not pay for anything, he then continued to shout this at us, as we had no other option or we would have missed our train home.  I paid over 500 euros for my stay at the hotel and feel i was treated really badly, it would have cost the hotel 12 euro to pay for our taxi and this as a good will gesture would have been the least they could do as such they did not even apologise for their mistake.  As a regular visitor to dublin this was the first time I had stayed at this hotel and it will be the last.",1,2009,08,10
247,"Great Location, Friendly helpful staff, some very minor quibbles","Easy access to Dublin centre via the train (station is just around the corner and Dublin centre is 2 stops away - less than 10 mins). If you're on the ferry this hotel is fantastic too as its about 15 mins drive from Dublin Port and not much further to Dun Laoghaire. 

We didn't have breakfast but we ate in the bar one night and food was OK but not brilliant. 

The staff were always friendly and helpful although we did get forgotten in the bar for a while and had to wait quite a while for our drinks but I felt they were genuinely concerned when I pointed it out and it was swiftly dealt with.

The room was excellent - very clean and roomy enough, bed was very comfortable.

2 minor gripes - although they say the rooms have laptop safes it seems many (bizzarely the refurbished ones !) do not. This was important for me as I note they have previously had an issue. They did offer to change the room but couldn't find one with a safe. They did also offer to hold my laptop in the office safe but I decided to take a chance.

Also one of the major attractions of this hotel was the  availabillity of car parking (quite an issue for hotels in Dublin) and indeed they do have a large car park but on one night it was full because of an Eagle's concert taking place locally so I had to park on the road outside which is fine but meant i had to get up and move my car by 7.00 am or risk a penalty. I managed to move it into the car park but even at that time there were only 3 spaces available.",4,2009,07,31
247,give it a miss,"lets get to the point: you deserve better than the Mount Herbert Hotel so give it a big miss. On july 22nd, my wife and I stayed in room 332- it was very bad value for money and service was terrible at reception. I will not go on and you should not go to the Mount Herbert either.",1,2009,07,23
247,Great Place to stay,"We stayed at this hotel on 3 different occasions over our 2 weeks stay in Ireland. The location was great - just out of the city near the train station or only a few Euro for a taxi. In the beginning we had a rental car and there was plenty of free parking. We stayed in 3 different rooms and all were very comfortable and quiet. The staff were great very friendly and helpful. The food was good and breakfast had a great choice but make sure it is included in your room price. I would definitely stay here again, it was way better that the Dublin City hotel where we stayed before our tour started - we returned to the Mount Herbert rather that stay in the city hotel when our tour ended. It is good value for money - we found specials from their website. My son had stayed at this hotel and he recommended it. 
Our only disappointment was (this was the only hotel we stayed in the 7 weeks of our holiday) that charged rather a high price for the internet - most hotels we stayed in did not charge for use of the internet - we had our own laptop.",5,2009,06,23
247,Quiet rambling hotel minutes from City Center by train,"I went on a grad school trip to Dublin for a week and we all stayed here.  The Mount Herbert is a large hotel that looks small from the outside.  However once inside and walking around the hallways, you can tell that the building is actually several buildings that have been connected together.  

The staff was excellent.  Breakfast was included in our package and it was really good.  The internet you need to pay for.  You can get a card at the front desk, and there are two computers that you can use.  

It's in the Ballsbridge area, with the Dart train only a few blocks away.  Like wise you can take the bus from city center to Ballsbridge, have a pint at Mary Mac's and then walk back along the canal to the hotel.  Very safe and peaceful.  The canal makes for a great running track.  

The stadium was under construction, so I have no idea what it's like when there is a game going on.  I would absolutely stay here again.",4,2009,05,20
247,beautiful hotel in superb location,"i stayed in hotel on sat 25th april with my partner and friends. i travel to dublin a lot and know most areas well. as the hotels website descibes, this hotel is in an exclusive location and only 5 mins from city centre. amazing value for money. rooms were spotless and trust me im fussy! didnt have bar food so cant comment but did have breakfast and again was beautifully presented. public areas were spotless!  if your planning a trip to dublin i would highly recommend you stay here.",5,2009,04,27
247,The most friendly and obliging hotel I have ever stayed in.,"This was a 2 day break in Dublin for our Twinning Groups.  
4 of us from England met up  with 13 Polish and 14 French for a little get together. 
The hotel arranged for us all to be on the same floor and before our dinner we wanted to have an aperitif all together.  They cleared a little area for us and even supplied us with glasses and a bucket of ice.  The French had bought some Pineau for the aperitif which is a traditional drink from the Charente-Maritime region of France. 
We have never in our life been offered such service in a hotel before.  I can not praise them enough for their hospitality. 
Our grateful thanks go out to the staff who bent over backwards to make our stay a memorable one.  Everything about the hotel was excellent.  Clean, good food, excellent service and very very friendly. 
We would stay there again if Dublin itself wasn't so expensive.  €5.20 for a pint of larger is a little over the top  - even if we were watching live football at lunch time.",5,2009,04,01
247,Good value for money,"I just returned from a 4-day trip to Dublin and my friend and I stayed at the Mount Herbert hotel during that trip. During check-in, the receptionist changed our room because the room they had booked for us was next door to a loud family. We were very thankful for that nice service, and the room we were given instead was a good one. Nothing special, but two decent beds, a tv, coffee and tea making facilities (with tea bags and cofffee), it was not too small and it was cleaned every day. We were given clean towels every day as well. The bathroom was fine as well. The breakfast was not included in our room price (which was 69 euros per night for 2 persons, so very cheap) and cost 10 euros per person. It was a good breakfast, but unfortunately the breakfast menu was not entirely the same as the food being offered, which meant that the pastries and muffins advertised were nowhere to be found on the buffet. Apart from that disappointment, there was enough to eat and the food was okay. The staff was very friendly, apart from the bartender in the hotel bar, who was uninterested and grumpy at his customers. No tip for him!",4,2009,03,30
247,Good Location - Friendly Staff,"We used Mt Herbert as our base for a week of driving around Ireland. Upon arrival we had to organise rooms next to each other as our travel agent had not bothered to advise the hotel we were a family of four with two children aged 10 & 14. The staff were most accommodating and organised the rooms in the far wing which was great as the rooms were spacious and had obviously been recently renovated. The hotel also allowed us to store our luggage whilst we headed off in our hire car. The hotel is within walking distance of Sandymount Village that had some lovely restaurants. It was also only a short taxi ride into the city centre, although we were ripped off by a Dublin Cabbie coming back to the hotel so beware! Nothing to do with the hotel of course. When we returned to hotel a week later the rooms were given were more in the centre of the hotel and quite a tight squeeze. Nicely finished, but substantially smaller than the rooms we had on our first visit. Overall we enjoyed the Mt Herbert Hotel and if you have children staying away from the very centre of Dublin is probably a very good option.",4,2009,02,08
247,Restored my Faith,"On listening to the radio yesterday regarding the current status of the Irish Hotel industry, it reminded me I had not yet entered my thoughts on the Mount Herbert hotel.  We stayed there during the Dublin Horse show last year after getting a great value mid-week deal for 2 nights B & B and dinner.  I have travelled extensively with business over the years and stayed in many hotels and can truly say I was delighted with the standard of the accomodation  - a mixture of old and new styles blended together - the food and most of all the staff.  They were professional, polite and efficient and could show some of the 5-stars a thing or two about multi-tasking aswell as customer service.   

There's plenty of parking available and wonderful peace and quiet while still being only a 10 min walk to Ballsbridge.   It was excellent value for money and I can recommend it for whatever your reason is for a Dublin visit.",5,2009,01,30
247,Didn'd disapoint,"I had booked this weekend with the Supervalu Getaway breaks and i have to say that both of us were very impressed with the hotel for the duration of our stay. 
Our package included 2nights bed & breakfast along with one meal which we took on our first night. There was plenty of variety and the staff were extremely friendly. 
Our room was everything that would you expect from a three star hotel comfortable  and inclusive of tea/ coffee making facilities which were welcome after our drive up and came in very handy after a long days shopping in the city.
The DART was only a 2minute walk away with 3 stops in to the city centre, what more could one want? The secure car parking was a bonus too especially as many hotels in the area charge for parking.",4,2009,01,07
247,Loved it!,"My friend and I travelled to Dublin for New Years Eve and stayed at the Mount Herbert Hotel. We arrived six hours earlier than the check in time because of our flight times, hoping just to leave our bags, but they got our room ready for us within the hour, allowing us to have breakfast that day instead of the next. The room was lovely, modern and clean and we had everything we needed. The staff were friendly and helpful, suggesting a brilliant pub for us to spend our evening! We would certainly stay here again!",4,2009,01,03
247,A hotel of strengths but a number of weaknesses!,"We booked a last minute stay in Dublin to celebrate the New Year
2008 and were pleased to find The Mount Herbert online at price
more reasonable than most, (bearing in mind that we really wanted a decent sized 3* hotel with easy access to the city centre.) On arrival we were greeted by very friendly and helpful reception staff so were thinking ""so far so good"", then we found our ground floor ""superior"" double room and then the disappointments started... Our room was described as ""superior"" but though clean and comfortable, was the size of a shoe box! The room itself had clearly been refurbished fairly recently, though with fairly cheap fittings and the bathroom was ""tired"". However, maid service was good and thorough, though we didnt have any tea bags as promised on first morning and didn't think was worth bothering reception for any.
Our biggest disappointment came on New Years eve.. Having been out in the City centre for food and a couple of drinks until about 8pm that evening, we decided, as we worried about the availability of taxis after seeing new year in, we would go back to hotel to enjoy what they had to offer and see the New Year in back there. The bar was dead, just two other people quietly enjoying a drink there, and not even a party popper in sight! The barman had the news on the telly and gradually, it became more and more apparent that New Year 2008 at the Mount Herbert was going to go totally unnoticed!!.. Adding insult to injury, at 11.15pm, a sour-faced barman came to our table asking us if we required any more drinks as the bar was closing!!!.. then proceeded 20mins later to serve another couple! We were in no way giving anyone any problems, just sitting quietly enjoying a drink to see in New Year! In the end we retired to our ""shoe box"" to see 2009 in there! We were on the whole very disappointed and although no entertainment was promised as such, at very least expected the bar to have been open past mid night on New Years eve for residents! We also felt conned as by 11.15pm, it was to late to travel into town and go elsewhere! HAPPY 2009!!
On a brighter note, the hotel is in quiet location but very near the Dart station with frequent trains into City which about 3 stops away.
Food wise... didn't eat in restaurant but had breakfast which very nice and bar food was average.",3,2009,01,03
247,"Good location, decent hotel","This is a very well located hotel if your visiting the Dublin 4 area. Its only 100 yards from Lansdowne Road Stadium and Lansdowne Road dart station (tram line). Its also very convenient for the RDS. I had a business engagement in Dublin 4 and found the hotel of a good standard, the food was fine, bar and food possibly a little expensive but the hotel itself was very good value. There was free parking (which is a valuable commodity in D4 as there was no parking at the offices I was going to so i could leave my car at the hotel). Overall it is a good hotel for 3 star and does what it says on the tin.",4,2008,12,13
247,Friendly place,"Lovely family Hotel. After a 28 flight we were welcomed warmly by the reception staff.  They went out of their way to help us.
Breakfast was an amazing spread each day. 
Rooms clean and large (well mine was) Bathrooms could do with an upgrade, but still fine.
Location was perfect. A few minutes fwalk rom the train line straight into town. At night it was peaceful and quiet. Beautiful area to walk around during the day. The local village near by had a couple of good eating places. 
Would stay here again.",5,2008,10,24
247,BEWARE !!!!!!!,"We had a nightmare as our friends passports were
stolen from room, we called the police who were very good but the hotel staff did not want to know & gave us no help at all.
Our friends had to get a ferry to hollyhead then a train the whole
journey took 12 hours and cost £290...",1,2008,10,05
247,Good Value in Dublin 4,"I stayed in the Mount Herbert in Sept on business. The hotel suited me as I was working in the ballsbridge area. The hotel is located in a very plesant street area with tree lined avenues and nice gardens.
The Hotel itself is a very standard 3 star hotel. The facilities are quite good with WiFi and parking. The room I had was OK. It needed a bit of paint and was sparse in part but it had all I needed - iron and board, coffee and kettle as well as a comfortable bed.
I would recommend the hotel to the average guest looking for a reliable and standard hotel. For less than €100 it was good value but nothing amazing.",3,2008,09,30
247,Great Hotel in a Great Location!,"Stayed here on our first trip to Dublin and would definitely recommend it. The hotel is in a very handy location, within walking distance of the city centre but far enough out that you can get a decent night's sleep!
Nice staff and a lovely room- we had a suite on the ground floor but it was remarkably quiet.
Would definitely stay here again!",5,2008,09,28
247,Bad Experience,"The hotel itself was nice but the room we had was TINY and we had a terrible experience when we tried to check in. 

When we arrived the receptionist couldn't find our booking. We were left waiting in the lobby for over half an hour while they tried to find it. While we were waiting another guest tried to check in and was told they were fully booked and they didn't have any record of him - after 20 mins of arguing he had to leave as he was late for a wedding so he left not knowing where he was going to sleep that night! Eventually the receptionist called us over and told us we mustn't have booked with them as they couldn't find our records and tried to send us away. I asked to use their computer so I could show them the email I had confirming my booking. In the end they said there must have been a mistake with the name and gave us a room that had been reserved by someone with the same first name as me but who hadn't checked in yet!! 

I had only booked a room not B&B so I asked if we could get breakfast included in the morning to compensate for the now hour long delay which had left us running late for an event we were attending that evening. The following morning when we went to breakfast the waitress told us we'd have to pay for our meal. I explained what had been agreed but we were still left standing in the restaurant in front of everyone while she went to reception to 'check our story'  - all very embarrassing! When we checked out the manager asked how we enjoyed our stay so I told him the problems we had had...he said to give him a ring next time we stay and he'd arrange a discount. Ha! Not very likely!",2,2008,09,27
247,Absolutely loved it!,"I must admit we were dubious when driving in to the hotel as it does not look much from the outside, however when we went in, the reception staff were extremely friendly and informed us that we had a free upgrade to a suite. The suite itself was beautiful - large flatscreen TV on the wall, stereo, lots of space, beautifully decorated - very modern. The bed was large and comfy. The area itself is very quiet - a residential area so we had a good night's sleep. The location is great, just a few minutes walk to the Dart station and only a few stops in to the city centre. We drove and the car park was secure - the gate was locked at night. Will definitely stay here again!",5,2008,09,08
247,Excellent hotel,"Our first visit to Dublin, we could not have picked a better hotel.
In a prime location away from the busy center of Dublin but with easy acsess to the dart system.
The hotel is idylic & very modern with a few cosy snug lounges set through the corridoors. The staff are freindly & nothing was a problem for them, they even booked some tour tickets for us!!
The bar is very nice with a veranda overlooking the gardens.
Food in the bar & the resturant was excellent could not fault a thing.
Our room, a little smaller then the ones shown on there website but still big enough. Very clean & comfy.
Will be revisiting soon & will recommend the mount herbert to anyone",5,2008,07,30
247,"Lovely Hotel, Friendly Staff","My friend and I stayed at the Mount Herbert Hotel recently whilst attending a concert in Dublin.  On arrival at the hotel we found the reception staff to be very friendly, helpful and efficient.  Our room was great for our short stay.  The food in the bar was vey good and again the staff were friendly and helpful.  The hotel is quite a distance from the city centre but with the Dart service close by getting around is not a problem.  Overall this is a nice friendly hotel which we would definitely stay in again.",4,2008,07,29
247,Great stay and pleasant surprise,"Booked online on their website from a Londonderry McDonald's around 4pm,, we' didn't arrive till 1 am. I'd only booked one night, not knowing what to expect. Turned out to be a great place and we stayed three nights while in Dublin on business. Not a tourist hotel as there's little of general interest in walking distance but a good business location for that same reason.

Thank you very much to Richard who handled the desk late at night. he made us feel very welcome.",5,2008,07,14
247,One of my faves!,"I loved Mount Herbert. The building is beautiful, and so is the neighborhood. Spent a week there (on my own) the first time; came back with friends the next time. The Irish breakfast is to die for, and the service is superb. I very much enjoyed things like tea with sandwiches in the lounge in the afternoon. The room was very comfortable and quiet. The staff was efficient and friendly. When I checked out early one morning, no one was available to carry my bags from my room (I have a disability), so the exceptionally nice female desk clerk did it herself!",5,2008,06,11
247,"Nice Hotel, good location, shame about the staff","Stayed here on weekend of Bon Jovi Concert.  Very good Location for dart and rds.  Taxi cost about €13 to City Centre.  Dinner and Breakfast in our package, great breakfast, dinner wasn't the best.  Rooms ok could do with an update.  Receptionists couldn't be nicer, really friendly but the bar staff and waiting staff could do with a bit more people skills, not even a 'good morning' at breakfast just very serious looking faces.  We had a complaint with regard to dinner, a bowl of vegetables which we ordered extra as they didn't come with the meal were burnt beyond the point of recognition and asked for the restaurant manager, he didn't even offer an apology just became defensive.  After that , our waiter didn't seem too happy with us, he just stayed at the end of the bar talking to the bar staff and staring down at our table. 

Would probably stay here again for its great location,  probably give dinner a skip next time!",2,2008,06,11
247,nice hotel  - great for the rds,"me and my fiancee` stayed here on a supervalu getaway break -  for the bruce springsteen concert in the rds - what a smashing deal !! hotel was in a great location for the rds - just a few minutes stroll away. 

the bar and lobby were quite modern and had a good atmosphere and the dinner/breaksfast were plenty and tasty. 

staff were friendly too but disappointed with the room - toilet was quite small and there was a strong odour - but as we didn't spend too much time there it wasn't that big a deal. also nearest bus / atm was at the rds so a fe minutes away...

would definitely stay there again if going to the rds... would ask for a different room though :-)",4,2008,05,30
247,Okay Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here over St.Patrick's Day weekend so it was kind of the last choice we had without having to spend a fortune; so it wasn't cheap, but there were WAY more expensive places to stay.  With that said, the hotel rooms have just recently been remodeled...very clean and pretty good sized considering it's Europe.  The staff was friendly and when we had a problem with our room (TV didn't want to work) they moved us to a better room right away without charging us anything extra.  It's not near the city center at all; when we looked on a map we said hey let's try walking, but it ended up being half an hour away.  BUT, the train station is about 5 minutes away and you can take the train to the city center (about a 10 minute ride).  There is a restaurant at the hotel, but it's kind of pricey for the quality of food they offer; you'd be better off going into town to eat.  Also take note that there's not any restaurants anywhere nearby.  The walls were kind of thin so it was a little noisy, but nothing that kept us from sleeping.  When we checked out they locked up our luggage so that we could sight-see some more.",3,2008,04,30
247,WOW!!!,When i walked into the hotel i was amazed!!! It was soooo nice and clean and very modern. I had a twin room which was lovely and nice and big. The bathroom was a little shabby and the shower was cold but other than that it was perfect. The breakfast was really nice and it is well worth booking it in advance. I LOVED my stay here and ould recommend it to loads of people. If i were to go to dublin again i would definately stay here!!!,5,2008,04,10
247,What a Great Hotel,"Booked a 4 night stay over easter 2008.I'm always a little apprehensive when arriving at a new hotel that i've never stayed before but any fears I may have had were gone when we pulled into the hotels vast parking area.The hotel looks impressive and very pleasing on the eye.From the minute we arrived to the minute we had to leave (sadly), we could not have been better taken care of by the wonderfully helpful staff who were so friendly, indeed nothing was too much trouble.The hotel was spotlessly clean,our bedroom was very large with a double & a twin bed,large flat panel LVCD t.v./easy chairs and all the facilities you would expect in the bedroom of a good quality hotel.The buffet style breakfast served in a lovely dining room was both exceptionally good and extensive.Facilities in the hotel are also very good.I dont normally take the trouble to write comments regarding hotels but just had to express my delight with this one.Any time in the future theres only one hotel I'll be heading for when staying in Dublin and of course its here.One more thing, not only is this a fabulous hotel it's rates are so very,very reasonable.   Peter from North Wales",5,2008,04,04
247,Dublin Charm,"My friend and I stayed here for a long Easter weekend.  The hotel, once we found it, was ideal.  Two mins walk to the dart station and in a quiet location away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre.  Room was very clean with everything you need for a short trip.  Bar was pleasant with an outside area and prices a lot cheaper than town.  Staff were most helpful and had good knowledge of the area.  Breakfast was buffet style and had variety to suit every taste.  Would definitely stay at this hotel if I returned to Dublin.  Please note, watch your bag if out shopping in the busy city centre, I had my purse stolen after only abour 1 hour of being there!!!!",4,2008,03,29
247,Nice Hotel,"Overall good place to stay. Not particularly close to city center, but once you figure out the buses and DART(trains) systems, it is simple to get around the city. Room was nice. Walls are thin as it seems to be an older building. Had problem with Television and staff assisted immediately. When it could not be resolved, we were moved to a bigger/
nicer room for no extra charge for the last night in town. Breakfast is expensive for my taste. There are a couple cafes in walking distance though.",4,2008,03,20
247,no complaints,"Rooms were slightly small.  The food was nice but fairly expensive.  Overall for the price of a hotel in Dublin, this would be good value.  Its location is a bit away from the city centre though.",4,2008,03,12
247,Very Cozy,"I loved this place and it was only a little more than a hostel. Our room was quiet and the staff was very friendly. Their restuarant was expensive, but the food was great. I'll for sure stay here again!",4,2008,03,04
247,Poor - Give it a miss,"1Over the past two months as I was in dublin alone on business i've made two visits to this hotel. Throughout the past number of years i've had occassion to visit dublin at least 10 to 15 times and stayed in a number of different hotels throughout my time, as this hotel was cose to were I need to be on business I booked it and found it quite cheap.

This place is cheap and not cheerful! First visit got to the hotel around 6 pm window open in the room on a very cold/wet evening and the radiator was not working/shower running cold water/bed fairly uncomfortable headed to the bar for dinner found the food very poor for the price left the following morning. Decided to give the place a second try got a more modern room (with dirty walls, needed a paint job) on the second visit bit of difficulty finding it down long corridors without any signs didn't know if I was going the right way was just handed the key at reception and told the room number, no instructions how to find it!!! this time the room was more modern however on going to the room I passed a number of rooms with the spyglass missing and just a hole in the door so you could look straight into someone elses room!!! Tried the bar again for food in case I just had a bad experience the first time found it equally as bad for portion/heat!! 

Will I return - I don't believe so! although I do believe they are doing some renovations at the moment, but totally hit and miss whether you get a new room (with clean walls!) or an older room with no heat! there are plenty of other good hotels around the D4 area which are much better. Until renovations are complete here and all rooms are done up I wont be returning even if it is for 79 euro as i've paid on the last occassions.",1,2008,02,22
247,excellent hotel,"An excellent location in a lovely neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city, a 20 minute walk or a five minute DART train journey to the city centre.  (The hotel is 5 minutes walk from Landsdowne road station).
Arrived early morning at the hotel expecting to leave the luggage untill the room was ready later. We were greated by friendly and welcoming reception staff who found a room which we could occupy immediately and also received an upgrade. A lovely  suprising contemporary interior to the Hotel which was imaculately clean. Excellent breakfast,  the best  buffet type breakfast I have experienced in many hotel stays.  A Highly recommended Hotel when visiting Dublin for any reason, business or pleasure.",4,2008,02,17
247,"excellent, couldnt of chosen a better place to stay","the hotel was a claen , friendly plce to stay. me and four friends stayed for two nights on a hen weekend. we had a fantastic time. the reception staff couldnt do enough to help. anything we wanted we got straight away. breakfast was fantastic as was the room service. rooms were clean and well equiped with plenty of room.i would deffinately use this hotel again and i reccomend it to everyone any age.",5,2008,01,31
247,Room was awful - Fawlty Towers,"Radiator in room not working, room smelled damp, water leaking into wardrobe from floor overhead, toilet leaking.
Terrible two nights stay here in cold weather.  Asked duty Manager on the first night to look at radiator and TV.  Nothing done.  Following day asked again and actually got a little part of the radiator working myself.  He did change the TV for me.
This room 601 was located in the downstairs part of the Hotel and maybe other rooms are better.
i will not be returning to find out.",1,2008,01,27
247,"Fine, but basic enough","Only stayed here for one night and didn't spend a huge amount of time here. The reception and common areas were tastefully decorated and there was quite a nice ambiance. My room was incredibly hard to find seeing as the hotel is like a maze. This experience was shared by a work colleague of mine also so it wasn't just me. The room itself was HUGE! They biggest hotel room I've ever been in. It had three beds and there was only myself in the room. The room was adequate but sparsely and cheaply furnished with a barely noticeable TV in the far corner which was hard to see from the bed on the far side of the room. The bathroom was very very basic and only had cheap soap and shampoo dispensers. The windows the room were still the original sliding Victorian ones which offered little heat or noise insulation. All in all the room was adequate and the bed was fine but the overall impression was that the rooms were sparse and cheap. Not somewhere you'd want to be spending much time apart from sleeping.

The breakfast again was pretty average with tinned fruit and concentrate fruit juices from a machine. The cooked breakfast which I didn't avail of looked fine, but again nothing remarkable.

The location of hotel is probably it's best quality being 2 mins walk from Lansdowne Road stadium and DART(suburban rail) station. It's a lovely leafy quiet part of Dublin but yet within half an hour walk of the city centre and 5 mins in on the train. The RDS arena is about 5 mins walk away.

I would probably return here seeing as it is good value but it would be more of a place to stay for a concert or match weekend rather than a relaxing weekend away.",3,2007,11,09
247,"Excellent hotel, highly recommended","We have recently returned from a 3 night break to the Mount Herbert and found it to be excellent.  Having read other reviews we were a little dubious about our room but on arrival we were directed to room 505 on the ground floor.  It was lovely, looked like it has recently been refurbished.  The staff were friendly, the breakfast was excellent.  The DART station was literally a 2 minute walk away just around the corner.  It took 5 mins to get to Tara St station in dublin centre.  I would highly recommend staying just out of town as it is a party city and would imagine it to be noisy if staying in the city centre - you could hear a pin drop around where the mount herbert hotel is.  It really is lovely.",4,2007,10,22
247,Much better places in the area,"On first impressions the hotel seemed very modern and chic - the entrance hall is contemporary as are the communal area furnishings.  The room allocated was on the ground floor, with a window view of a wall directly outside.  No real natural daylight to be had.  The room was very small, no furnishings, the bathroom was cramped and in desperate need of a visit from some workmen!
Reminds me of my student days, staying in halls of residence!  Maybe  the room allocated isn't indicative of the rest of the hotel, but either way I'll be staying at the Bewleys or the Stillorgan park in future.

247,Convenient but not worth expense,"Used hotel for one night stay while attending a Rod Stewart concert (fantastic) in nearby Ballsbridge. Very large room - junior suite. Very little furniture in room 2 beds and a chair built in dressing table wardrobe in hallway. Beds were comfortable. Bed room carpet not very clean. Bathroom badly needs refurbishing rotting timber around bath, toilet seat broken.
Staff very pleasant and friendly.
Charging 4 star prices for a two star performance.

247,I love this hotel,"We stayed in the Executive suite for the Wednesday and Thursday night of Dublin Horse Show.  We had a late check in and the receptionist was very helpful and friendly. We had a late snack in the bar where the service was fast and the food freshly prepared. Breakfasts were really good too with a full Irish breakfast or continental to choose from. The hotel room was immaculate with lots of little extras, things that make all the difference like bottled water on hand. This is my third stay in this hotel and it just gets better and better, although I normally stay in a standard room. Since the refurbishment, I think last Autumn) the rooms are brighter and its not so easy to get lost in the corridors!  Cleanliness was superb and the staff were attentive. The Executive suite was a special treat this year and well worth it. This hotel is excellent for the Horse Show as there are usually plenty of horsey people around and it is a 5 minute walk to the RDS. I will definitely be back.
",5,2007,08,13
247,Very Good Hotel. Great Family Room.,"Just back from a 2 week family holiday in Ireland. We stayed at the Mount Herbert Hotel for 3 nights for the Dublin part of our trip.
Found the hotel to be of a very good standard. Our room (no.227) had plenty of space for the 4 of us, with a double bed & 2 single beds for our children, plenty of floor area too and was excellent value.  The room looked as if it and the bathroom had been newly renovated. Breakfast in hotel was very good, 13.50 Euros for Full Irish Breakfast, 8.50 Euros for Continental only - wide choice, worked out reasonable value as breakfast for children under age 12 is free. Found room service food to be good and not too expensive, although the room service menu choice was rather limited. Lounge areas look newly refurbished. Staff courteous and helpful.

Hotel has good parking and a large garden - great for children to play in. Location wise the hotel is 10/15 mins out of the city centre, but the Landsdowne Road DART station is literally a couple of minutes walk away and it's only 3 stops into the city centre. Hotel is well located for going south of the city to Powercourt Gardens & Waterfall (highest waterfall in Ireland) and also to Bray.
",5,2007,07,19
247,not great,stayed one night here found the room very small when we went to open the curtains we were looking into the back of a car as the car was backed up to or window and in the morning could here the people walking around over head very early in the morning also we were at a concert and when the concert was over came back to the hotel to a have a drink to fine that the bar closed at 12.30 and that there was no residence bar very disappionted as it was my wife birthday and looking forward to a drink before going to bed if booking don't stay on level 1,2,2007,07,14
247,OK for a short break,"Just spent a long weekend here (weekend get together with a girlfriend), having booked through the British Airways website (so we probably paid over the odds). We drove, and asked several people for directions when we were in the vicinity, but they all pointed us to the Herbert Park Hotel, which is near. Eventually went into this very large hotel and asked directions.

The Mount Herbert is small: the public areas have been recently overhauled, but the bedrooms are on the small side, and although very clean, are in a really need of refurbishment. The bathrooms especially (again, although very clean) needed ripping out and retiling. I'd rate the hotel as 2/3 star. Plus points were the tea making facilities in room, and the breakfasts are plentiful if they are included in your package. If they aren't, I would recommend either walking to Sandy Mount or popping into the city (fantastic breakfasts Bewleys on Grafton Street - the oldest coffee shop in Dublin). You are less than a five minute walk to the DART station (Lansdowne Road) which will have you in the city centre in a matter of minutes.  All the stations have train timetables, so you can plan your exit from the hotel down to the last minute! A three day DART pass is only EUR 15 – don’t forgot to go south on the train too – the views and beaches are lovely.

Needed to use the internet quickly on two occasions – this is where the hotel really rips you off and charges you (starting at 3 Euros for 19 minutes) even if you are using your own laptop on wireless.

Would I stay here again? Yes, if I had to (and needed guaranteed car parking), but I think there are much nicer hotels in the area for less money, especially if you can book at the last minute. Location wise, it was great – 10 minutes outside the city, so quiet at nights, but very convenient to get back to change and put your feet up before going out again in the evening.

247,"clean, bit out of town ...","My wife and I stayed at the Mount Herbert Hotel over the June Bank holiday.

Getting to the hotel via the 'Airbus' service from the Airport involved a 30 min coach ride to the top of Lansdowne Rd, and then a 10-15min  walk to the hotel.  Not too bad if you have a trolley bag .....

When we got there, we were 'upgraded' to a suite - nice one I thought .....

.... via a labyrinth of corridors, we ended up at room 404 (no porter to take our bags).  The room was indeed pleasant, clean and adequate.  Painted in neutral shades of green, it was a calm room.  Don't expect any views though - the small window overlooked the side of the building and the car park.

What was most annoying was the bathroom.  It was clean, but the bathtub was under the eaves of the building, and so there was 'half' a shower curtain - so having a shower (if you are taller than 6ft) requires some flexibility!

The bed was 'queen-size' so again, it was adequate, but not as we were expecting.  Despite that, it was clean and as we had done a fair bit of walking, it was a great place to rest.

In the morning, we went for breakfast, only to be told that it was an additional cost!  So, if anyone if contacting the hotel directly, make sure that you know exactly what it is you are getting for your money.  We had breakfast there one day, but the choice was limited (continental breakfast).   There was plenty of fried food if you opted for the more expensive (Irish breakfast) option.

The next  few days we went to the small village of Sandymount and had breakfast in a couple of places there.  It is a 7 min walk (timed!) and the quality of the coffee was MUCH better!

Overall, the hotel is a nice place.  Lansdowne Rd DART stn is less than 5 min walk away, and getting to Tara or Pearse St DART stn involves 2-3 stops, so you can be in the heart of the city in approx 10 min (as long as you don't have to wait long for a DART)

We walked back on two evenings, and it was approx 30 min.  The walk was pleasant, and we spotted some places on route that you would not see otherwise.  One evening, we got a cab back from Grafton St at around midnight, and it cost 10EUR.

Would I go back?  Probably not in a rush - there are some hotels that are closer to the city which would be more appropriate (SCHOOLHOUSE HOTEL - 15 min walk to the city, and the airbus drops you RIGHT outside!) for me.  BUT, if I had to, I would have no qualms about staying at Mount Herbert.

247,Superb!!,"My friend and I went to Dublin in April 2007. Our travel agency found this hotel and we were more than satisfied!!
It is located 15 mins walk from the centre of Dublin in a quiet residential area. Also it is very close to the bus stations and if you take a taxi, you won't pay more than 10 Euros to the centre.
Our room was very clean; our towels were changed every day. The staff was very polite, professional, helpful!! 
Although it's a 3 star hotel, I think it could easily be considered as a 4 star! 
I just have to say: one of the best vacations ever!! Next time I stay in Dublin, I'll definitely go there again!

247,Fab Hotel,"Have been wanting to go to Dublin for a while with my boyfriend so we went for my birthday in April. We saw this hotel on the internet and thought it looked really nice & it failed to disappoint!!

It is situated in a very nice area of Dublin, just around the corner from Lansdowne Road stadium, and also the DART station is a 5 min walk. The hotel may seem quite far away from Dublin centre, but the DART takes you into Connolly station in 5/10 minutes. We went for a weekend but it didn’t seem long enough!!!

We had a nice room, with a double bed. The room was very clean, as was the en-suite bathroom. 

The reception area and bar are modern. We were very pleasantly surprised by this. The restaurant was lovely too. 

I'd recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Dublin, you aren’t stuck in the hustle and bustle of the city centre, but it is very easy to reach. There are also a few nice pubs near the hotel & a very nice Chinese & Italian restaurant 

Breakfast was the same everyday but there was a very wide choice so you don’t have to eat the same everyday!! There were selections of cooked breakfast, cereals, fruits yoghurts and pastries!! Staff were helpful and were on hand if you needed anything!! Felt full leaving the hotel everyday for our days in the city centre. 

For our first couple holiday it was amazing!! We would definitely go back there again!!!

247,No problems,"Despite what some previous reviews have said, I found no problems with this hotel.

It is situated in a very nice leafy area of Dublin, just around the corner from Lansdowne Road stadium, and also the DART station.  The hotel may seem slightly out of town, but the DART will take you into Connolly station in 5/10 minutes and it's about 10/15 euro to Temple Bar in a taxi.

We had a large room, with a double and a single bed.  The room was very clean, as was the en-suite bathroom.

The reception area and bar are modern.  It looked as if they had been recently refurbished.

I'd recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Dublin, not be stuck in hustle and bustle of the city centre, yet have very easy access to the city centre.

247,Fabulous hotel very friendly,"I stayed at the Mount Herbert for 6 nights with a friend I was very pleased on arrival at reception staff were very friendly and we were shown to a nice room with all facilities advertised. All the staff were very helpful. We were able to get a taxi within minutes as the hotel has its own taxi company. The bar was extremely bright and cheerful with exceptional staff who would go out of their way to help in any way they could. They served excellent meals in the bar and good value for money. The dart is literally 5 mins walk away and 3 stops takes you into the city centre . We would not hesitate in returning to this hotel and hope to do so in the near future Thanx a million for a fantastic stay. Oh forgot to say great breakfast although breakfast staff not the friendliest but not rude either so not a problem at all.

247,First Holiday as a Couple,"Wanted to go somewhere for new year with my boyfriend!! After trawlling through hundreds of going places brochers we decided this one way best!! was quite an expensive ""weekend away"" but you have to look at it practically, we flew new yrs eve and stayed new year weekend, so expense it was to be expected!! Hotel was amazing!! Its the first time ive ever had to check in without my parents, but the staff were helpfull enough!! The only thing with the staff is they all seem to be european, no traditional irish to welcome you!!  We were also there for the final ever match at Landsdowe Road!! So we had quite a welcome from rugby supporters!!

We stayed during the renovation of the rooms, we were informed there would be some distubance--- we didnt hear a peep!! The lounge and bar had already been completed and they looked fantastic!! 

The rooms are a distance to walk but the hallways are nice 2 walk and are cleaned everyday!! The room was small but we were in a quite corridor!! Bathroom and rooms cleaned excellently everyday, clean towels, empty bins, hovered etc etc!! Rooms were warm and clean and just in general comfy!!

Breakfast was the same everyday but a big variety so you dont have to eat the same everyday!! selections of cooked breakfast, fruits yoghurts and pastries!! Staff helpful but again all european!! We stayed at quite a quiet time of year so there seemed more staff to guest ratio!! Felt full leaving the hotel everyday though!!

We ate in the bar one night, because we had such a long day and we were to tired to get the dart back in to town!! It was a really nice meal but expensive!! but we found the prices in dublin city centre we the same (unless you facied dinig in Mac Donalds).  

Staff helpfull at all times and super efficeint, we blew the main fues in our bedroom and within 30 mins they sent someone 2 fix it!!!

Really nice hotel about 10 mins DART journey away from town where you can get buses to all the main attractions, including the guinness factory!!  About 45 mins bus journey from airport!!

For our first couple holiday it was amazing!! we cant wait to go back in years to come!!",5,2007,03,18
247,The Labyrinth,"This hotel was overpriced, and had a number of snafus, including being unable to serve breakfast properly.  Granted, they'd just had a fire, but given the maze-like structure, that  knowledge was more hindrance than help.
",2,2007,02,24
247,Disappointing,"I was dissappointed with this hotel. The best discription I can give is it tries hard to be impressive but needs a lot of more work to be at the level its portrays. The staff are nice but I found it quite irritating that rooms were been cleaned rather loudly at 8am in the morning. My bedroom was also cold and not aired and the bathroom was badly cleaned. All and all, I would not repeat my visit and would not recommend staying here, unless you were really stuck. On perusing the area, there are far more superior quality hotels.
",2,2007,02,19
247,Not Impressed,"The Mount Herbert Hotel is in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin; an exclusive part of the city where embassies are located, as are the diplomats' homes. In spite of being in the most upscale part of Dublin (and having been in existence for about 55 years) and convenient to the DART, the Mount Herbert was a disappointment.  The reception area, restaurant and bar have been beautifully refurbished and are very stylish, but the beauty ends there.  The rooms we had (of the 172 in the hotel) were in desperate need of renovation and the others looked the same (not sure where the brochure example room photo came from).  The bathroom was mold-infested (see pictures), smelled as such, and had temperamental hot water and spigot handles that required 12 turns before any water came out; and then it came out in an all-at-once rush, splashing out of the bowl and onto the floor.  The shower was a travesty.  If you don't possess a hydrological/mechanical engineering degree, then the shower will alternately scald and freeze you.  Even if you do ""figure it out"", the hot water ebbs and flows with a mind of its own, making for a very frustrating and disappointing shower experience........every time.  The heat didn't work the first night, although they did repair that right away.  There was a rugby match (at the stadium one block from the Mount Herbert) the day after our last night there, so several rowdies were obviously getting primed up; the antiquated thin walls and old floors let us hear everything. The food in the bar was very good, as was the service, but only in the bar.  The mediocre service at the front desk and from the rest of the hotel staff were the exception to the wonderful, warm, personable attitudes we had experienced everywhere else in Ireland.  I cannot recommend the Mount Herbert; 1 star rating (and that's only because of the bar). This review also speaks for two seperate rooms in the same condition.

They Catered for all our needs & the food was great especially the price list, what more could you ask for good food and not too pricey.

They were very helpful as they cornered of a part of the bar so we could celebrate my dad's 70th Birthday.
I would Definitely go back & are already planning to.
I have got to say thank-you to Patrick from the Bar he was great as were his fellow workers.

The only thing was that i could not do my hair at the mirror as there was no plug for my straighteners in our room.

247,Good value,"12 family members stayed at the Mount Herbert last weekend for my father-in-laws 70th Birthday.

Negatives were the rooms were very dated and we were on the bottom floor and found our bathroom had a upleasant odour with no extractor fan working.  We have a one year old, the cots were travel cots and could really do with replacing with new ones. 

The hotel restaurant did not open at all, you had to dine in the bar, the food was very nice, but it would have been nicer to dine in the Brasserie.

Positves were the staff were brilliant, so accommodating and helpful. They allowed us to section off a corner of the bar and put up balloons and banners.  Really excellent customer service.  The breakfast was excellent, my husband ordered poached eggs, and a plate of about 10 appeared!

Overall a very good experience, bit too far from the centre, but Ballsbridge is a lovely area and a very nice walk along the seafront about a 10 minute walk away.

247,"Nice stay, very pleasant","Lovely hotel nicely situated just outside the city. Easy walk into the city centre or you can use the very efficient Dart rapid transit system. Hotel bar is good and drinks reasonably priced. Restaurant is excellent and a lovely Irish breakfast provided each morning. Rooms maybe need upgrading.

247,Great For Sightseers,"Just had 2 days B & B at this hotel cannot fault it, as much as you can eat at breakfast. check out hotel web site before booking for the specials we had a 3 course evening meal on one night at no extra charge. well positioned for easy access into the city via bus rail or taxi.

247,An OK+ hotel,"I stayed at the Mount Herbert Hotel for three nights and found it to be a bit of both. The lounge, restaurant and bar area was very modern, clean and elegant looking. The rooms were not so new and trendy, but spacious and clean. No minibar in the rooms and the choice of tv-channels is not very impressive. 

The hotel consists of several buildings and finding your room can be a bit of a challenge. There are lots of corridors and stairs leading off in all directions. I had a room on the ground floor looking out onto a tiny little atrium, which was nice and quite. Less fortunate colleagues of mine had a view of the exhaust pipes of cars parked in the parking lot... 

However, if you are a non-smoker, the best thing nevertheless seems to be the ground floor (but specify that you want a room away from the parking lot). Collegues of mine staying on the second or third floor had bathrooms that stank of cigarette smoke from the ventilation system. 

This hotel is probably a good choice for families as most rooms had one double and one single bed. 

Personally, I found it a bit of a pain to have to take a train into the centre, but if you prefer to live somewhere very quiet and not too far out, the hotel location is not bad.

The conference facilities were ok, but a bit of a drawback that there was no internet access from the rooms and that the hotel's wireless internet system only worked in the reception area.

Overall, I'd give the hotel an OK+
",3,2006,10,12
247,perfect for our family,"we had a terrific rate on a very large room suited well for three people (couple and 16 year old boy).  The hotel is located slightly out of the throng, but easily within 30 minutes walking distance to Trinity College, etc., if you are walkers and enjoy getting a feel for a place that way (we do!)  Quite close by is a DASH station, every 15 minutes you can catch a train into downtown.  And you can walk 5 lovely  minutes along the river/canal to a local commercial district in Ballsbridge for your dinner or breakfast.

The hotel has probably seen grander days, it is slightly dog eared -- but then, so were we, as our time in Dublin was towards the end of our travels.  It felt luxurious nonetheless, because we got a bathtub AND  one of those mysterious other european bathroom fixtures, in addition to the sink and toilet.  

Highly recommended.
",4,2006,09,09
247,Great value for money,"For a three-star hotel, this was great value for money. We had a double room with plenty of space (and an extra single bed) and a clean bathroom. In terms of location, it doesnt get any better than Ballsbridge in the vicinity to the centre. A very leafy and quite part of town. The Lansdowne DART station is only a stone's throw away, and the centre is only three DART stations away. Townships of Ballsbridge and Sandymount are within 5-10 minutes walking. Few pubs in both these places for meals.

We had breakfast included in our package. It was pretty standard for the price we paid.

Most of the hotel staff were very friendly, helped out with directions/maps, luggage storage and taxis. Watchout for few stuck up reception staff behind the desk (only a minority).

All in all, a very pleasant stay and we would have no hesitations to stay here again.
",4,2006,09,03
247,Great hotel,"Couple us headed down to Dublin in february for a mates birthday, before doing so i checked out few hotels on tripadvisor and eventually found this great hotel. We where looking for a cheap nights stay but also a comfortable one and this fitted the bill. The hotel was not far away from the Temple Bar area and next to Landsdowne Road..the hotel staff were helpful although i had made a booking in advance they had not recorded my stay so it was lucky enough i brought my record from my e-mail! All in all we enjoyed are short stay and would recommend The Mount Herbert Hotel to anyone..
",4,2006,06,08
247,Awful! Don't stay there.,"When we arrived, we were after check-in time but were kept waiting for nearly 2 hours for our room. Although the main part of the hotel is modern and quite nicely decorated, the rooms didn't look like they had been touched since 1988! dark, dingy furnishings, broken tv remote, lovely view of a brick wall. 
the walls are paper thin, and you can hear every other guest in your vicinity. On our second morning, before 7am an emergency door was opened and the ensuing alarm went on for at least ten minutes until I called reception. eventually someone came to turn it off. Around ten minutes later a member of staff walked into our hotel room and walked out again with no explanation. When we complained about our stay when checking out they didn't want to know.  
Sandymount is a beautiful area of Dublin, but take my advice and stay somewhere else in the vicinity. I'll certainly never go back to the Mount Herbert!
",1,2006,06,03
247,Wonderful Hotel,"I have just returned from a weekend in Dublin with 5 girlfriends.  We booked through Book Now Limited two triple rooms.  We all thoroughly recommend the hotel - both for its facilities and its location.

The dart railway station is literally 5 minutes walk away and the fare into town is just over a euro each!  We used the Aircoach service from the airport and that was only 7 euros each (be sure to ask for the Ballsbridge route).  The Air coach service is 24 hours so even though our flight was at 6.30 we had no problem getting there.  

The hotel itself is set in a lovely wide street - leafy suburbs.  It has lovely gardens and grounds with some unusual trees and shrubs.  

The bar is excellent and the bar food was good.  The decoration of the bar and other communal rooms was very smart and stylish.  The hotel offers internet access so we were able to check-in on line for our flight home.  

The rooms themselves were spacious, well decorated and lovely and clean.  There was always plenty of hot water and tea making facilities which were very welcome!!

All in all - an excellent choice if you want a nice quiet location but within easy reach of the bustle of the wonderful City Centre!
",5,2006,05,31
247,Peaceful location,"This is a good, basic, well-run hotel with friendly staff, great food and well-stocked bar.  The bar and restaurant are bright and modern and overlook lovely gardens.  Staff are consistently cheerful and obliging, though they had a bit of trouble coping with large numbers at breakfast when the hotel was full.  The wonderful breakfast more than makes up for the search for milk, teaspoons, whatever!  The room we had was spacious and spotlessly clean but in need of an update, as are the corridors leading to the rooms.  If you are not too put off by the drab magnolia walls and putrid colours of the bed covers you will get a comfortable night's sleep, undisturbed by noise of any kind. The tea making facilities are welcome but if you are fussy about your morning cuppa, take your own tea bags as the ones provided taste, shall we say, a bit cheap!  Some bath oil would be nice too.  The hotel is in a quiet, mainly residential area but only minutes away from the city centre by Dart train (Lansdowne Road  station five minutes walk).  Worth noting that if you come back on the Dart in the evening after the gate to the street is shut, the only way out is via the underpass which, when we were there, was flooded  because of recent heavy rain.  Another point to watch - if someone tells you there is a shortcut to the nearest pubs and shops, be  prepared for a long walk!  This so-called shortcut takes you along the canal bank and a short walk it is not, though shorter than going through the streets and you do get to see some wildlife on the way! Again, there is a tunnel to walk under, also flooded if there has been the merest drop of rain.  All in all, if you don't want to go to the expense of a top class hotel, the Mount Herbert is an excellent choice and well placed for exploring Dublin.
",4,2006,05,17
247,Excellent,"We stayed in this Hotel whilst in Dublin for a big rugby match recently. I have no hesitation  in recommending it especially those attending a match as you are literally 500 yards from the turnstile.
On arrival our booking could not be found and I had no reference number. The receptionist could not have been nicer and  we were given a room which was clean , tidy, roomy and overlooking the garden.  Breakfast was lovely and staff were polite.  We had a drink in the garden before the match which was nice.  Our booking was sorted out, Munster won the match ..................

IThis Hotel is exceptionaly busy with supporters but it does not get roudy as the bar and restaurant are very big.
",4,2006,04,26
247,Not impressed.,"I'll keep this breif. 

Room we had was noisy (judging from the heard of eliphants staying in the room above and corridor noise). Large number of the staff seemed to come from Eastern Europe, I had difficulty in making myself understood on many occasions. On night #2 of our stay we were woken 4 times by an ultra loud fire alarm (located in our room), we later found out that this was due to some drunken football fans larking about (a situation that took 4 hours to resolve !!)in another part of the hotel. We called reception to compain and were told 'Don't worry about it' and that was it, no appology or other reassurance. Breakfast was OK but on one morning the hot buffet had been left to stand and had dried up. Location wise, it is in a quite neighbourhood but don't stay here if you want somewhere convienient to the City, the train journey can be tiedious.
",2,2006,02,26
247,What a bargain!,"Friday night in dublin at 2 day's notice within walking distance of the city, free parking and a great breakfast - for only €39!  Unheard of.  Comfortable, clean, stylish front of house, nice bar/brasserie.  The only drawback was no residents bar.  Mind you, that probably wasn't a bad thing...",4,2005,12,06
247,Excellent choice!!,"This hotel is located approximately 10 minutes by foot from the Jury's Ballsbridge AirCoach drop off, and literally steps away from the DART Lansdowne Road station.  The staff...very friendly, the rooms...very nice and the price...even better!  The daily rate includes a HOT Irish breakfast buffet..and if you are not into hot food early in the morning..no worries as they have an extensive continental breakfast as well.  The rooms are quite large and that is a plus for those who have spent any time in other Dublin or London hotels!  The grounds are beautiful and the area is really nice.  I would return in a heartbeat!  The hotel has an excellent pub/bar and the prices are equal (if not less than) in the city itself!  An even better plus!  You will like this place!
",5,2005,10,25
247,Suprising upgrade,"Travelled to hotel in 1994 and was very impressed by the changes made on my recent trip.
The front of house has has a total refit and now rates very highly.
Hotel bar is the highlight of this with very cheap drinks compared to the city centre prices.
Rooms are clean and staff are always happy to help.
Breakfast in included with the room rate and is a nice way to start a morning after the night before!!
Overall I would reccomend the Mount Herbert to anyone travelling to this fine city.
",4,2005,10,17
247,Basic but try it,"This hotel is in a great location one metro stop outside the city. Very upscale residential area, 3 blocks from the Dart and bus stop. Safe Area.

The hotel is clean but old. Not run down but kept up. Not renovated either. It's big so it's lively. Family atmosphere, seniors and tourists. A mix. Nothing rowdy. The staff is attentive but all business. Very efficient except for the wake up call. Don't rely on it. Bathrooms are clean and kept up. Beds are so so. Linens are clean and fresh. Watch your step. The configuration of the hallways have many ups and downs, twists and turns on un leveled flooring.  The upstairs bar and cafe is great and lively at nite. Very welcoming and comfortable. The prices were very reasonable.

The free breakfast is terrible but some rave about it. Fake scrambeld eggs or real fried eggs, ham, sausgage, baked beans, tomatoes, juice, cereal, yogart, toast,fruit. The presentation and buffet area is not appetizing. The serving staff, foreign youth, maybe students. No ambience but you can live with it. Ignore the smell form the wet rag used to clean around the area of the fake eggs and then used to clean the tables. You know, that egg smell. 

They pour the unused milk from the containers on each table back into the milk jug used for the cereal. That's a no no in my book.
",4,2005,09,28
247,Nice place,"This hotel was slightly out of the city, but not by much, and a walk from the bus stop. Try asking a local how many stops until you get to Landsdowne Rd because that's the stop you need to take. Cross the street and go past the stadium.. keep going (should look like a residential area) and there it is on the right. The hotel offers a quaint room with more than adequate spacing and friendly staff. The room we stayed in was ensuite and everything advertised was available. It was slightly mucky but we informed the check-in clerk and it was rectified immediately. They even allowed us to check in early to catch some ZZZ's before we went out for the day. The bistro/bar downstairs offered a variety of foods at reasonable prices. I have even sent my Mom to this hotel so... it's trustworthy. Dublin is a wonderful city with quite a few places to visit. My recommendation is to visit the Jameson Distillary first to obtain a wonderful (free) map of the city.. the best one we found. It does pay to plan out where you are going in this city because everything is within walking distance, but plan to walk a lot!  Have fun!
",4,2005,09,16
247,A Very Good Basic Hotel,"I stay in the Mount Herbert regularly as I am often in Dublin on business and it is within 15 minutes walk of where I work. It is a bright and spacious hotel with ample car parking. The rooms are basic but comfortable. Breakfast is served from 7am (but I've often turned up at 6.45 with no problem) and there is a good range of juices, cereals, fruit and hot food. Later on in the day the bar serves good food up to 10pm and is very reasonable price-wise. It is situated in a secluded street near the Landsdowne Road football stadium and is very quiet at night thus ensuring a good rest. It's not a place I'd necessarily bring my wife for a weekend away but for business travellers or those on a tight budget it's ideal.",4,2005,09,15
247,Rather disappointing,"Got a single room rate, including breakfast, through laterooms for E79 which was fairly good.
Hotel well situated for Aircoach and the Dart although Dart presently not running at weekends due to line improvements.
Bedroom small with small bed, clean but rather disappointing.  Breakfast good with an excellent fruit salad.
Staff problems noted, saw front desk staff in verbal arguments with other staff on two occasions over luggage and room service.
3 star just about, certainly no more.
",3,2005,07,02
247,Just OK,"This is an old victorian style hotel, just outside of Dublin.  Our room was very large and it had basic furniture.  The breakfast was good.  We paid $94 for a double including breakfast.  It has free parking.  Not a luxury hotel but overall good value.  The price is very reasonable.  If you are price conscious, go for Mount Herbert...
",3,2005,05,05
247,Decent enough for the price!!!,"The hotel had an offer of 39.50 Euro per person B&B sharing during the month of January, 2005....that is like £28...incredible offer for a hotel in Ballsbridge, the swankiest district of Dublin!!!...especially for a weekend night which was when we were staying...a Saturday!!! 
We had a triple room...nothing fancy...but, clean enough. The bar's nice and trendy enough...breakfast was grand...plenty of parking behind the hotel, so cars are safe.
Definitely would consider staying at the hotel again if I'm out solely to party in Dublin!!!...especially if any similar offers were on!!!!
",3,2005,04,25
247,"Quiet, Reasonable Hotel","Room was quite spacious for a double (included an extra single bed).  Water from taps was scaldingly hot and slightly brown - some renovation work was underway to the restaurant which may have been to blame.  Breakfast was OK but choice was a bit limited.  Setting was peaceful (except the two hours when a football match was taking place at Lansdowne Road 100 yards away - but that was to be expected).  Convenient for the DART into Dublin centre (6 minute ride and 6 euros for a three day ticket).  Generally clean and comfortable and decent value for the price (79 euros a night for B&B for two) and the staff were friendly and helpful.  Some local info / guides etc would have been useful in reception.
",3,2005,04,01
247,Quiet Hotel Away from the noise of the pubs,"We had a wonderful experience at the Mount Herbert. It was our first stopping point when we arrived in Ireland. We took the Aircoach bus from the airport to the Pembroke Road stop. It was a walk of three long blocks to the Mt. Herbert. Our family room had a double bed and two singles, perfect for our 10 and 11 year olds. The restaurant was closed the three nights we stayed, but the bar was serving dinner. The food was very good. The full Irish Breakfast each morning was also good. The restaurant overlooks a very beautiful garden. There is a playhouse and playground equipment in the garden for younger children. I can not get over how quiet it was at this hotel.  The DART station is within easy walking distance. We also took taxies and it was between 7 and 10 Euros for the four of us to go back and fourth to the center of Dublin.  The Staff were very friendly and helpful. I would recommend the Mount Herbert to anyone who wants to stay in a quiet upscale neighborhood.

247,Just loved it!,"Wanting just a wee break away for a few nights with our son and toddler grandaughter and attracted by the fair price and the fact of a garden for our grandaughter.  We set off.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The staff were excellent from the moment we arrived until we left, friendly, helpful and also professional.  The triple room with a cot, whilst a little on the small side was clean and comfortable.  The restaurant was excellent and very child friendly.  The Dart is only a few minutes walk away and took us into the centre of Dublin - no need to worry about where to park the car etc.
We hope to return again and again.

247,Still going strong!,"It had been some time since I stayed at the Mount Herbert, so when I returned for one night recently I was interested to see if it was still the same. I was not disappointed. It is not ""Grade A"" but a very good B+. The rooms vary but most are large and airy. All are very clean and comfortable, with all facilities you might require. I note that they do now provide tea and coffee making in rooms. Breakfast is very good. Location is quite near city centre. The DART (rapid train to city) station is a few minutes walk away. There is a very quite atmosphere as there is no bar. Location is in an upmarket residential part of Dublin. Many singles stay here. Prices are usually OK. You may be able to get offers.",4,2004,05,16

247,Gute Lage des Hotels,"Im Rahmen unserer Rundreise war das Sandymount Hotel das letzte vor Abflug. Wir hatten uns aufgrund der Hotel-Website auf die dort aufgezeigten großzügigen Zimmer gefreut. Leider konnte die Wirklichkeit den Bildern nicht standhalten. Als Reisegruppe wurden wir in einem ebenerdigen Trakt in Mini-Zimmern mit Mini-Bädern untergebracht. Die Nacht war kurz nach 5 Uhr zu Ende, da diese Zimmer sehr hellhörig waren und wir jedes Geräusch vom Flur und vom Stockwerk drüber in voller Lautstärke erleben durften. Die Zimmer waren sauber, die Betten ok, das Personal sehr freundlich und das Frühstück bot eine gute Auswahl. Die Bahnstation ist nur wenige Minuten entfernt und so ist man nach 3 Stationen in weniger als 8 Minuten in der Innenstadt Dublins.",3,2019,10,09
247,Decepcionan las habitaciones,"Al llegar, el hotel es muy agradable, las zonas comunes están bien y tiene un comedor-pub que está bastante bien. Los desayunos buenos y la atención tambien buena, pero las habitaciones son muy muy pequeñas, y el cuarto de baño no llega ni a los dos metros cuadrados. Hay que jugar al tetris para entrar a lavarte las manos. Está lejos del centro pero hay buses. ",3,2019,09,29
247,Così non va,"Avrei potuto assegnare una valutazione migliore, perché l'hotel gode di una buona posizione, la prima colazione è ricca ed è molto curato. Ma è successa una cosa incredibile e indicibile: il terzo giorno della mia permanenza la camera non è stata rifatta, alle 14 sono rientrato e ho fatto un riposino, uscendo alle 15.40; al mio rientro,alle 23, ho trovato asciugamani e acqua fuori dalla porta! Riferito l'accaduto alla reception il giorno dopo, le scuse, poco convinte, sono state accompagnate da una scusa assurda: ""eh sì, ma le pulizie vengono fatte alle 15!"". Perso il turno???",2,2019,09,17
247,No se parece a la fotografía,"Bien. Únicamente anotar que la publicidad es engañosa porque, al menos mi habitación, no se parece a la de la fotografía en nada. Aparte de eso, el hotel bien en todos los sentidos: precio, ubicación, limpieza y atención. ",3,2019,09,04
247,Ottima posizione,"Hotel situato in ottima posizione in un quartiere tranquillo non lontano dalla fermata della Dart: in 10 minuti si è in centro.
Camera e bagno spaziosi e puliti.
Abbiamo usufruito dell'ombrello a disposizione dei clienti.
Manca il minibar in camera ma in compenso ci sono due bottigliette d'acqua rifornite giornalmente.
Check in e check out veloci.",4,2019,08,18
247,Servizio ristorante ,Hotel fantastico camere molto confortevoli e possibilità di parcheggio custodito  gratis posizione ottima per visitare la città a 3 m a piedi si trova il treno x il centro ristorazione ottima con il nostro amico italiano Michele molto gentile e professionale....,5,2019,08,13
247,Speravo meglio,"Hotel a 4 stelle ubicato vicino allo stadio di Dublino.
Molto curata la presentazione esterna, comodo il parcheggio.
Un po' intricata la disposizione interna con la reception al 1 piano. 
Personale gentile, check in e out veloce.
Camera medio piccola, disposta al piano terra vicino al parcheggio. 
Bagno piccolo con vasca da bagno, scelta discutibile in relazione alle dimensioni dello stesso e alla sicurezza (si rischia di cadere uscendo dalla vasca).
Alcuni dettagli migliorabili come il sapone disposto sul wc (ma perché?!).
La camera inoltre era poco insonorizzata (si sentivano le discussioni dei vicini).

Buono ma non quanto atteso.",3,2019,08,13
247,Super Hotel!,"Wir waren Silvester 2018 im Hotel.
Es war wahnsinnig liebevoll.
Das Frühstück hatte eine gute Auswahl.
Man gelangt mit der Bahn direkt ins Stadtzentrum. Diese befindet sich nur 5 Minuteb zu Fuß entfernt.
Alles top!",5,2019,08,06
247,No está en el centro pero está bien comunicado,"Estuvimos solo una noche en un viaje organizado. Nuestra habitación no era muy grande pero suficiente para pasar la noche. El baño era amplio y parecía muy nuevo, quizá renovado recientemente. La estancia fue agradable. Tenía parking por lo que parece un hotel adecuado cuando se viaja con coche propio. Las instalaciones comunes del hotel están muy bien, muy agradables. Aunque no está en el centro hay una estación próxima, de todas formas nosotros fuimos andando hasta Merrion Square, es un paseo agradable de unos 20-30 min. La zona del hotel es muy residencial pero se puede encontrar supermercados y lugares para comer.",4,2019,07,27
247,Licht und Schatten,"Hier erst einmal die negativen Punkte:
Die Bausubstanz ist alt. Die Zimmer sind überzeugt (selbst bei 23 Grad Aussentemperatur) und lassen sich aufgrund der Fenster nicht klimatisierten oder ausreichend lüften. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist schlecht.
Positive Aspekte gibt es aber auch:
Das Personal ist freundlich und professionell. Frühstück ist ausgezeichnet. Die Anbindung an die Innenstadt ist durch die direkte DART-Station kein Problem. Bei Nutzung Bigbus holt ein Shuttle die Gäste direkt am Hotel ab. Darüberhinaus hatten wir ein neu rennoviertes Badezimmer.",3,2019,07,27
247,Gute Lage,"Wir haben hier unsere Rundreise begonnen und waren sofort von diesen Hotel begeistert. Die Zimmer haben alles was man braucht,  es gibt Bäder mit Wanne oder Dusche. Auch beim Frühstück ist für jeden etwas dabei. Es sind nur wenige Minuten zum Stadion und Bahnstation, auch zur Innenstadt von Sandymount ist es nicht weit.",5,2019,07,16
247,Das hat Eindruck hinterlassen,"Unsere Rundreise haben wir hier beendet und hatten uns drei Nächte eingebucht.
Sehr freundlicher Empfang, freundliches Personal und wir haben uns sofort ""dazugehörig"" gefühlt. Zimmer etwas klein, aber sauber und gemütlich. Frühstücksbuffet trifft wohl jedermans Geschmack und war sehr reichhaltig. Zur nächsten Bahnstation sind es nur wenige Gehminuten und dann zwei Bahnstationen zum Hopp on Hopp off.

Special thanks to Beata and the whole staff of the bar.",5,2019,07,15
247,Muy agradable,"Hemos pasado dos noches en el hotel y el personal encantador, muy amables. Limpio y silencioso. Cenamos en el hotel muy bien. Un poco apartado del centro pero muy bien comunicado por el tren que está muy cerca.
El desayuno muy completo tanto dulce como salado.
Muy recomendable para disfrutar de Dublín y descansar al finalizar el día.",5,2019,07,06
247,Bello  ma non insonorizzato,"Abbiamo soggiornato solo una notte in quanto poi siamo partiti a fare il giro di tutta l' Irlanda.
 L' hotel dispone di parcheggio gratuito. 
Trattasi di un grande complesso un po' dispersivo all' interno con ascensore al piano, ma con una scalinata all' entrata che fa rimpiangere i vecchi buoni facchini.
Reception molto disponibili e cordiali.
Posto bello all' interno da vedersi sia la sala colazioni con vetrata sul giardino sia la sala interna che la saletta libreria
È un hotel con molte sale comuni come la maggior parte di quelli in Irlanda ma dispersivo per trovare la camera.
Corridoi stretti che collega o 3 edufici assieme.
Camera con letto con materasso molto buono ma piuttosto piccola, non conforme a quella della foto.
Buon bagno con vasca e para spruzzi  in finestra apribile. Shampoo e bagnoschiuma in dotazione nel mobile che aveva un' anta semidistaccata.
Niente phon, portatevelo da casa ed attaccatelo con presaconvertibile allo specchio. Presa nascosta.
In dotazione solito caffe solubile  o the' oltre alla colazione.
Buona la colazione self service calda tipicamente irish, niente fatto al momento, piuttosto varia con dolcetti anche marmellate etc.
Difetto grande che avevo già letto in varie recensioni, al di là delle dimensioni della stanza che per una notte va più che bene , il vero problema è l' insonorizzazione pari a zero. Dal corridoio sembra di sentirli in camera così pure dalle altre stanze. Inutile dire che dormi un po' si e un po' no.
Peccato perché l' hotel essendo in zona Arena è ottimo per uscire da Dublino se si è in macchina anche se è lontanuccio dall' aeroporto.
Consiglio tappi per le orecchie.
Per il resto se fosse insonorizzata sarebbe un buon hotel ed avrei dato punti in più.
Per una notte ci può stare, soprattutto visto il materasso confortevole, ma due notti io personalmente non avrei resistito.

",4,2019,06,28
247,Gute Anbindung ans Zentrum,"Wir waren auf einer Rundreise und haben hier unsere letzten beiden Nächte verbracht. Das Hotel liegt in der Nähe einer Bahnstation, nur 3 Stationen von der Innenstadt (Tarastreet). Das Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr üppig und der Service ist wirklich gut.",5,2019,06,27
247,Gute Wahl,"Wir waren nur eine Nacht hier und trafen erst kurz vor Mitternacht ein. Empfang war freundlich und zuvorkommend. Ausreichend Parkplätze, die man auch nach dem auschecken am nächsten Tag noch nutzen konnte, um mit dem öffentlichen Nahverkehr von der sehr nahe gelegenen Station aus noch Dublin etwas  zu erkunden. Die Zimmer sind Bauart bedingt relativ klein, aber absolut sauber und ordentlich. Wasser, Kaffee und Tee kann man sich selber etwas zubereiten. Das Frühstück ist auch auf kontinentale Gäste eingestellt. Insgesamt eine sehr gute Wahl gewesen. ",5,2019,06,23
247,Genial,"Estupendo hotel en Dublin, totalmente reformado y muy acogedor. A 3 minutos del tren para ir donde quieras. Especial mencion a Irene de recepción que nos ayudo mucho y nos trato genial. Pena de no poder estar mas tiempo.",5,2019,06,13

247,Lo mejor su personal,"Agradabilisimo el personal, tanto de recepción como de cafetería.
Belen, Ivor...etc gracias por atenernos tan bien.

La decoración del hotel hace que resulte muy acogedor.",5,2019,06,09
247,Buon rapporto qualità-prezzo,"Hotel situato a 5 minuti a piedi dalla dart che in 10 minuti massimo ti porta in centro. Camera ampia e moderna, bagno un pò piccolo. Pulizia ottima. Struttura un po' dispersiva.  Buon Rapporto qualità-prezzo. ",4,2019,06,07
247,Eccellente ,"Ottimo hotel vicino all'Aviva  Stadium. Camere pulite, personale carino e disponibile, colazione eccellente e bar/ristorante molto buono. A pochi minuti dalla Dart, treno,che ti porta in breve tempo nel centro di Dublino. Sono stato molto bene e ringrazio tutti per la gentilezza dimostratami. Consiglio vivamente. ",5,2019,06,05
247,Es un hotel súper agradable. Recomendable para todas las edades.,"Estuve con mi novio y mi hermano durante 5 noches. El primer día llegamos muy cansados del viaje y en el hotel nos recibieron muy amablemente. Los empleados de recepción son encantadores, nos ofrecieron información sobre la ciudad y fueron muy atentos.

Aunque el hotel está a las a fueras, en 10 minutos andando llegas a una zona con restaurantes que está muy bien. Además, está al lado de una estación de tren y hay un montón de trenes para ir y volver al centro. Si te compras la Leap card de visitante te sale muy bien de precio.

La habitación era acogedora y limpia. (Tienen netflix y amazon prime en la televisión hehe) Estuvimos como en casa. 

Nosotros comimos todos los días fuera por lo que no puedo hablar de la comida del hotel.

Visitamos Dublín y las afueras, saliamos pronto por la mañana y volviamos tarde, por lo que volviamos al hotel muy cansados. El hotel era muy tranquilo por lo que pudimos descansar todos los días muy bien.",5,2019,06,05
247,Bien,"Limpio, buen desayuno, buena atención, en especial de Marc. Recomendable, pero algo apartado del centro, aunque la estación de tren está a 2 minutos y te lleva al centro. O un buen paseo es bien agradable para descubrir de ciudad.",4,2019,06,03
247,sehr gutes hotel,"service und vor allem sauberkeit auf den zimmern waren top. große auswahl am frühstücksbuffet und war auch sehr lecker. die lage vom hotel war nicht optimal. zur nächsten haltestelle des hop on hop off bus musste man 25 minuten zu fuss gehen. außerdem war unser executive zimmer exakt das gleiche wie ein normales zimmer welches direkt unter uns war, nur haben wir etwas mehr bezahlt. war aber trotzdem ein toller urlaub in einem sehr schönen hotel.

247,Vacanza a Dublino,"Io e altre amiche abbiamo trascorso una breve vacanza a Dublino. Abbiamo cercato un hotel un pochino defilato ma comodo per gli spostamenti e ci è stato suggerito questo hotel alla periferia di Dublino. Che dire? Solo cose positive! L’hotel è piccolino ma carino e ben disposto! Il personale cordiale e disponibile nel suggerire mete o comunque per risolvere piccoli problemi organizzativi. Le camere confortevoli e pulite! Nota di merito alla colazione abbondante, varia, completa di leccornie salate ma anche dolci per palati poco abituati alla tipica colazione inglese! E poi anche se in periferia l’hotel dista 5 minuti da una fermata della Dart il loro trenino cittadino che in 10 minuti ti porta in centro! Se la vacanza è stata soddisfacente rilassante divertente parte del merito va anche a questa location! Consigliatissimo!",4,2019,05,23
247,Un agradable hotel en muy buena zona de Dublin,"Estuvimos allí el primer fin de semana de mayo. No usamos el servicio de restauración, porque con solo tres escasos  días, preferimos patear bien la ciudad de Dublín, que no conocíamos. La habitación amplia, limpia y bien iluminada, así como el baño. Especial mención merece el personal de recepción, por su amabilidad, simpatía y profesionalidad.",4,2019,05,09
247,Buen hotel para descansar.,Buen hotel para descansar. Limpio. El personal súper amable y te ayudan siempre. En ese sentido es estupendo. No me gustó  la  ubicación. Hay 40 minutos caminando hacia el centro por lo que debes usar taxi o tren si quieres gastar tu tiempo en ver la ciudad y no en caminar hacia alli.,4,2019,05,08
247,Muy buen hotel,"Buen precio para lo que es DUblín; muy bien comunicado con el centro; el parking fenomenal. Atención excelente del personal. Habitaciones amplias y cómodas. El desayuno excelente. Solo cenamos una noche y no estuvo mal, aunque la carta podría ser más variada",5,2019,04,30
247,Komfortables Hotel mit tollem Frühstücksbuffet,"Sehr freundlicher Empfang - ungefragt bekamen wir Tipps zum Ausgehen. Hoteleigener Parkplatz, geräumige Zimmer, tolles Frühstücksbuffet - auf Anfrage auch glutenfreies Brot. Einziger Wermutstropfen: Der Abfluss in der Badewanne war leck - so war Baden unmöglich.",5,2019,04,22
247,Soggiorno eccellente,"Siamo stati al Sanymount per il weekend di San Patrizio, ci siamo trovati molto bene, stanze pulite e staff cordiale, colazione un po' cara ma decisamente all'altezza del prezzo. Fermata del treno a 5 minuti e comoda per arrivare in centro. Consigliato",5,2019,03,20
247,Weekend con amiche,"In occasione del weekend della festa della donna in 5 amiche abbiamo soggiornato due notti a Dublino. Abbiamo scelto questo hotel come nostra base per visitare la città, pulito, ordinato e accogliente. Personale gentile , sicuramente da consigliare",5,2019,03,20
247,Tolles Hotel für Kurzurlaub ,"Wir waren für 2 Nächte hier und waren sehr angetan:
-schnuckelige Zimmer
-sehr freundliches Personal
-gute Lage
-leckeres Frühstück

Natürlich ist nie alles perfekt (wir hatten zb. einen unangenehmen Brummton vom Sicherungskasten im Zimmer 212), aber die positiven Punkte stechen hervor und wir würden sofort wieder kommen! 
Danke für die schöne Zeit! ",5,2019,01,06
247,Freundlich. Gastlich. Sehr gute Lage,"Dieses Hotel ist eine klare Empfehlung auf Grund vieler Faktoren: 
- Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter
- Lage
- Ausstattung der Zimmer
- Grösse der Zimmer
- Qualität des Frühstücks. 
Für ein Hotel im britisch- irischen Raum eine sehr gute Wahl.",5,2018,12,30
247," Concerto a Dublino","In vista di un concerto alla 3Arena di Dublino mi sono ritrovata a dover cercare un hotel nelle vicinanze per due giorni.
Il Sandymount hotel è facilmente raggiungibile con le navette dall'aeroporto; vicinissima allo Stadio, e 3 minuti a piedi distante dalla Dart ed a diverse fermate del Bus ( una a 3 minuti a piedi e quella della navetta per l'aeroporto a 10 ).
Situato lontano dal centro della città, ma con 3 fermate di Dart sarete subito in zona Temple Bar.
L'hotel si mostra come una grande struttura, molto curata e pulita, con il personale molto cordiale e sempre presente alla reception per ogni evenienza. 
Diverse aree comuni molto carine, le stanze ampie e la sala colazione molto bella.
Nel complesso un ambiente molto rilassante sotto molti punti di vista.
Qualche pecca comunque c'è : i bagni in stanza sono un po' piccini, ma la cosa è anche sorvolabile; bisognerebbe migliorare l'insonorizzazione nelle camere.
Comunque sia, se vi trovate a Dublino per un concerto il Sandymount è una buona opzione.",3,2018,11,23
247,Wundervolles Hotel,"Wir waren total begeistert von diesem super Hotel. Das Personal ist freundlich und die Zimmer sind super sauber und gemütlich. 
Das Hotel versprüht einen gewissen Charme und Gemütlichkeit. 
Kleine Geschäfte, Supermärkte und Pubs sind zu Fuß erreichbar und mit dem nahegelegenen Bahnhof ist man innerhalb von 10 Minuten in Dublin. 
Alles in allem ein wunderbarer Aufenthalt.

Gerne wieder !",5,2018,10,30
247,"Sandymount, ein 4-Sterne Hotel in Dublin?","Wir haben 4 Nächte im Hotel gebucht. Zum Glück konnten wir zwei davon noch annullieren. Ich erwarte von einem 4 - Sterne Hotel in Dublin mehr als eine gute Lage.
Zimmer klein mit schmutzigem Teppich, Ikeastyle flatpack Kasten und Sicht auf einen Parkplatz, dafür sind 250 Dollar pro Nacht ohne Frühszück einfach zu viel.",3,2018,10,13
247,Ottimo hotel appena fuori dal centro,"Io e la mia ragazza, abbiamo soggiornato per 5 notti in questo hotel molto carino! Lo abbiamo scelto per la posizione decentrata e per la vicinanza alla Linea Dart. Molto importante anche il rapporto qualità/prezzo, decisamente buono per gli standard Dublinesi.
La nostra camera era molto accogliente con una nota di merito per il letto comodissimo con cuscini e materasso di alta qualità!
Per le nostre abitudini italiane, la mancanza del bidet è un punto a sfavore, così come l'impossibilità di utilizzare la doccia con il diffusore ""mobile"".
Nel complesso un hotel da consigliare senza dubbio alcuno!!",4,2018,10,12
247,Gut mit der S-Bahn zureichen ,"Ein familiengeführtes Hotel. Sauber und gut. Frühstück ist in Ordnung. Preis-Leistung ist OK.

247,Satisfecho,"Desde el primer día buena atención y realmente nos sentimos como en casa. Destacar que solemos cenar fuera cdo viajamos para conocer diferentes propuestas y en esta ocasión, dada la calidad de la comida, lo cercano del servicio y el ambiente fenomenal y elegante, hizo que cenaramos las tres noches en el hotel,  la relación calidad precio muy buena. En sentido general las instalaciones gastronómicas muy acogedoras. Sólo de pega tengo las habitaciones donde nos hospedamos, la planta baja, los pasillos algo pobre en decoración, humedad en los suelos, no había mini bar en la habitación, al parecer estaban en reformas. Realmente cdo terminen sería algo fenomenal, para descansar y estar en el centro en breve tiempo por lo bien comunicado que está. Está en una zona divina donde poder andar y disfrutar de la naturaleza y tranquilidad. Volvería sin duda. Gracias a todo el equipo.",4,2018,09,12
247,Perfekt,"Dieses Hotel ist eine sehr gute Wahl, zwar ein wenig vom Dublins Zentrum entfernt, dafür ruhig gelegen.
Alles stimmt hier: das Ambiente, der Service, die Bar mit fantastischen, schmackhaften Speisen. Alle sind hier sehr freundlich, zuvorkommen, möchte vom Service-Personal folgende Namen erwähnen: Ioana, Lee, Paolo und die zwei Damen beim Frühstück, deren Namen ich leider nicht weiss.  ",5,2018,09,12
247,Tutto molto bene specialmente al ristorante,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel dove tutto è nella norma, abbastanza curato, ma in particolar modo mi ha colpito la disponibilità della camera era del ristorante Ioana e sel suo chef che ha preparato per me un piatto dietetico visto che non ero stata bene nei giorni precedenti, un piatto di riso e pollo gustosissimo seppur semplice nella sua essenza!!! Grazie davvero! Peccato che per la cena ho richiamato per il servizio in camera e mi hanno detto che quel piatto non era possibile prepararlo...bah! Cmq in ogni modo complimenti nell'hotel, ben 
organizzato! Sarebbe carino se il personale addetto alle pulizie fosse più educato e ricambiasse il saluto degli ospiti...",5,2018,09,10
247,Sorprendente  ,"Mañana saldremos del hotel, serán cinco días que hemos estado y la verdad es que desde el primer momento nos sorprendió.
El hotel está a 15’ de Dublin en un pueblecito, andando 5’ no llega tienes una estación de tren que te acerca a la ciudad. 

La limpieza de todo el establecimiento es muy buena incluidas las habitaciones, puede que los colchones algo flojos, el resto muy bien.

El desayuno después de tantos días algo repetitivo y si no eres de salado más , pues hay poca oferta de dulce, o de otro tipo de alimentos.

El bar , que hemos hecho servir por las noches para bien cenar o tomar alguna cosa, decir que el equipo de Ivor con Ioana, Beata y Lee, muy bien , muy profesionales, amables y atentos . 
Ivor además habla español así que mejor aún, si venís por aquí y no habláis el idioma, preguntar por él.
La cocina que hacen muy buena y sorprendente !! 

Hemos estado muy bien, en general la gente es muy amable . ",4,2018,09,06
247,L'Irlanda che ho sempre sognato ,"Soggiornato due notti al Sandymont Hotel al termine del nostro viaggio nella bellissima Irlanda.  È posto a pochi passi dallo Stadio, vicinissimo alla stazione della Dart è abbastanza comodo per andare in centro e visitare la città.  La struttura è situata tra le case, in fase di ristrutturazione e miglioria, devo dire però  che è  un ottimo hotel, camere spaziose e pulizia impeccabile, arredo moderno e piacevole. Il personale sempre cortese e gentile.
Ottima sia la colazione che la cena con ampia varietà di piatti.

247,Hotel tranquilo y muy cómodo,"Estuve allí con mis hijas, y a pesar de no estar en el centro, pues se halla a 2 kms del centro, pero tiene la ventaja de tener parking gratuito y de estar en una zona de fácil acceso , bien sea andando o en Darst",5,2018,08,18
247,"Sehr schönes Hotel, guter öffentlicher Anschluss, freundliches Personal","Wir waren hier für zwei Nächte in einem Executive Room einquartiert und haben die Entscheidung für dieses Hotel nicht bereut.

Das Haus ist relativ einfach über das DART-System zu erreichen - von hier lassen sich viele Trips in und um Dublin organisieren. Auch ist es in Gehweite zum Avviva-Stadium und zu den Docks mit dem dortigen Board Gais Energy Theatre. Die Gegend um das Hotel herum ist sehr ruhig, fast schon ländlich und für Dubliner Verhältnisse fast schon malerisch.

Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig, das Badezimmer sauber und modern eingerichtet. Das Kingsize-Bett war für unsere Begriffe höchst gemütlich und hat für einen guten und tiefen Schlaf gesorgt.

Das Frühstück im Hotel war ein warmes und kaltes Buffet mit allerlei guten Dingen. Von Rührei über Speck bis hin zu kleinen süßen Teigtäschen und Vanille/Zitronenbällchen gab es hier wirklich alles um gestärkt in den Tag zu starten.

Das Personal des Hotels, ganz besonders Frau Morawiec vom Reservations Dept., ist wirklich in jeder Hinsicht höflich, freundlich und zuvorkommend. Auf Wunsch wurde uns auch extra Allergiker-Bettwäsche aufs Zimmer gebracht, da ich an einer schlimmen Hausstaubmilben-Allergie leide und sonst in der Nacht nicht wirklich schlafen kann.

Momentan werden am Hotel Renovierungsarbeiten durchgeführt - wir haben davon aber nichts mitbekommen.

Alles in allem: Eine absolute Empfehlung für dieses Hotel, dass wirklich in jeder Hinsicht hält was es verspricht und Dank des super freundlichen Personals eine absolut tolle Atmosphäre zum Wohlfühlen schafft.",5,2018,08,11

Es liegt gleich nebenan vom Aviva Stadium in einer ruhigen Gegend, die schon sehr dörflich wirkt. Das Gebäude ist schon älter, aber die Zimmer und das gesamte Haus sind gut renoviert und gemütlich. Besonders hervorzuheben sind das gute Restaurant, in dem wir zweimal sehr gut und zu vernünftigen Preisen gegessen haben, und das gute Frühstücksbuffet. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und dabei völlig unaufgeregt. Perfekt geeignet für kurze Aufenthalte bis eine Woche.",4,2018,07,14
247,"Ein solides Hotel mit angenehemn Einrichtungen und Services, allerdings mit kleinen Schwächen","Das Sandymount Hotel liegt unweit der DART im Außenbereich von Dublin, im Stadtteil Sandymount, ganz in der Nähe des Aviva Stadium. Die Anbindung zur City ist durch die Dart gut, wobei es angenehm ist, dass diese nicht zu hören ist.

Das Hotel hat unterschiedliche Zimmer, die solide eingerichtet sind. Wir hatten beim zweiten Aufenthalt ein angenehm großes Zimmer (ca. 20qm) mit gepflegtem, neuerem Wannenbad. Das Bett war allerdings kleiner als gedacht - nur 1,52 x 200m - hierbei haben wir gelernt, dass in Irland ein Bett mit gerade mal 1,52 Breit bereits als Kingsize gilt.... Zum Glück gab es ein zweites. das Hotel war bemüht uns ein Zimmer mit mehr Komfort anzubieten, allerdings war 1,50 das größte was sie hatten.

Frühstück war vielseitig, klassisch irisch, frisches Obst, verschiedene Brotsorten, sogar glutenfreies Brot, laktosefreie Milch, gute Qualität der Produkte und stets wurde nachgereicht. Kleinere Sonderwünsche wurden auch erfüllt.

Abendessen (Lineout-Bar) war gut. Kleine aber interessante Karte, gut gekocht, schmackhaft.
Die Lineout-Bar war ganz gemütlich und hatte recht freundliches Personal.

Was mir für ein Vier-Sterne-Hotel fehlte (und weshalb die Bewertung eingeschränkt ist): Pool oder Sauna, Fitnessbereich o.ä. 
Lesebereiche, Lobby und Businesscenter sind vorhanden und ganz gut ausgestattet.

Wer nicht gut zu Fuß ist sollte dies bedenken, denn das Hotel ist nicht barrierefrei.
Einige Bereiche sind via Aufzug erreichbar, aber die älteren teile des Hauses nicht.
Hier merkt man die vielen An- und Umbauten - ein etwas eigener Charme.

Ein gutes Hotel, dass mir allerdings noch erklären müsste wie es zum 4. Stern kam.

Andere Viersternehotels, die wir auf unserer Rundreise besuchten, hatten die fehlenden Aspekte aufzuweisen, so dass es meiner Ansicht nicht an ""Landeskategerie"" liegen kann.
Aus deutscher Sicht würde ich es als ein solides Dreisternehotel ggfs. superior einstufen.

Das Hotel ist sehr engagiert im Umweltschutz - für irische Verhältnisse.

Wer gut und nicht direkt im City Centre wohnen möchte, aber eine schnelle Verbindung möchte, ist hier gut aufgehoben - wenn er bereit ist den recht hohen Preis aufzurufen.",3,2018,06,27
247,e sembra di dormire nella storia,"a pochi passi dalla stazione della dart, ad un paio di fermate dal centro e dallo stadio, una struttura che, insegne e bistrot a parte, sembra ed e' immersa e confusa nelle case vittoriane del quartiere.

nonostante tutto, ambiente, servizio, spazi esterni sono decisamente superiori alle attese.
un gioco rientrare in stanza ""perdendosi"" tra i corridoi della struttura. divertente ed in tutti i casi non scomodo neppure con le valigie al seguito.

personale decisamente preparato, cordiale e disponibile.
cena e colazione veramente gradevoli, molto curati, gustosi, buoni e curati.

un plauso particolare perche', per esigenza di viaggio, ci hanno servito colazione alle 3.45 del mattino e, nonostante tutto, non mancava nulla e tutto era appena ed appositamente preparato. vista l'ora ed il sonno, decisamente una graditissima cortesia confermata da una piu' che ottima e completa varieta'.

247,Ein wirklich schönes und ruhig gelegenes Hotel,"Unsere Rundreise in Irland begannen wir natürlich in der Hauptstadt. Die Auswahl der Unterkünfte war groß, doch bei der Suche nach der richtigen landete ich immer wieder beim Sandymount Hotel. Und wir haben die Buchung nicht bereut.
Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich und das einchecken unkompliziert. 
Der weg zum Zimmer war allerdings interessant, wir haben uns wirklich gefragt ob wir in einem Hotel oder einem Labyrinth sind. Da nicht jeder Aufzug zu jeder Etage/jedem Zimmer führt, muss man sich hier erst einmal zurecht finden. Hat man den Weg allerdings gefunden, kann man sich über ein schönes freundliches Zimmer freuen.
Zur Lage des Hotels ist zu sagen: es liegt nicht im absoluten Zentrum von Dublin. Dies sollte aber für die meisten kein Problem darstellen. Wer gerne und viel zu Fuß unterwegs ist, kann ins Zentrum laufen, wer es etwas bequemer mag, nimmt die nur einige 100m entfernt abfahrende Bahn.",4,2018,05,04

247,Comodo se si ha l'auto,Camere pulite e confortevoli. Letto comodo e bagno ampio anche se con doccia a vasca. Locali comuni gradevoli con anche area internet. Parcheggio ampio e comodo. L'unica pecca è rappresentata dalla distanza dal centro che è raggiungibile con 10 minuti di passeggiata alla stazione e altri 10 minuti di Dart. Sicuramente comodo e pratico se si è dotati di auto dove allora le distanze dal centro rendono il Sandymount molto pratico e comodo,3,2018,04,23

Consigliato anche per la vicinanza alla stazione della Dart, in pochi minuti si può arrivare nel centro di Dublino senza problemi.
Gentilissimo il personale che ci ha fornito ottimi consigli sulle varie tappe e luoghi da visitare in città.",5,2018,04,20
247,Eccellente hotel,"Hotel con tante camere, numerose aree relax, fitness room, wi-fi gratuita, internet point vicino alla reception, personale disponibile e servizi in camera efficenti.
Colazione buona, varia e abbondante a buffet, conviene comprare i pass al check-in se no costa di più.",5,2018,04,16
247,Il centro città a portata di mano,"Vi abbiamo soggiornato 5 giorni durante il St. Patrick's Festival 2018. L'hotel si trova a pochi chilometri dal centro di Dublino ma è ben collegato tramite la Dart. La stazione è a poche centinaia di metri dall'hotel. L'hotel dispone di una bar/ristorante di buona qualità, personale cordiale e una buona scelta di birre. I prezzi non proprio popolari ma comunque in linea con lo standard di Dublino.Le camere sono pulite e comode, anche se quello del piano terra sono mal coperte dal segnale wifi.",4,2018,04,02
247,"Beste Unterkunft, die wir bislang in Irland hatten","Beste Unterkunft, die wir bislang in Irland hatten. Super freundliches Personal, sehr hilfsbereit. Preis-Leistungsverhältnis 1A. Nur 3 Dart-Stationen von der City entfernt. Großes Zimmer, großes Bad. alles sauber und großzügig.",5,2018,04,02
247,Schönes familiäres Hotel,Der Aufenthalt im Sandymount Hotel hat uns sehr gefallen. Die Zimmer sind toll eingerichtet. Leider ist es etwas hellhörig. Die Betten waren mir persönlich zu hart. Ansonsten sehr gutes Restaurant und freundliche Angestellte. Das Hotel bietet eine sehr gute City Karte von Dublin an. Dublin in nur 3 Zughaltestellen gut erreichbar.,4,2018,01,08
247,Muy confortable,"Agradable y con personal atento. Muchos rincones con sofás en todo el hotel. El desayuno un poco caro, desde mi punto de vista. La ubicación es buena gracias a la estación del dart, pero no hay ningún bar o cafetería al lado, es un barrio residencial muy bonito.",5,2018,01,04
247,Alles super,"Saubere, moderne Zimmer, freundliches Personal. Eine gute Lage und eine wohlsortierte Bar. Das Sandymount Hotel hat so ziemlich alles, was es braucht um sich wohlzufühlen. Nutzte die Gastfreundschaft für eine Nacht auf Geschäftsreise und würde es immer wieder buchen.",5,2017,12,25
247,Weekend in Dublin,Abbiamo trascorso 2 notti in questo Hotel. Comodissimo per visitare il centro di Dublino poiché situato a meno di 5 minuti a piedi dalla stazione dei treni e con la Darth in 10 minuti si è in centro. Molto carina la hall. Camera da letto un po’ piccolina ma pulita e graziosa. Esperienza positiva! ,3,2017,12,12
247,BELLO MA SCOMODO,"L’hotel, di per sè, è molto carino: belle le zone comuni, ottima la colazione, molto pulito, stanze comode e grandi.
Purtroppo, però, si trova in una zona periferica della città, e non è ben collegato al centro. Inoltre anche i taxi sono difficili da reperire in quella zona, e l’hotel non offre servizio navetta.
Luci e ombre...",4,2017,11,29
247,Buono,"Discreto hotel un po'  lontano dal centro che però  può essere raggiunto abbastanza velocemente grazie alla dart che passa nelle vicinanze. Parcheggio gratuito, stanze confortevoli, buona colazione, prezzo interessante. Da considerare.",3,2017,11,16
247,Wir waren sehr zufrieden,Wir waren 3 Erwachsene mit unterschiedlichen Interessen aber alle waren zufrieden. Die Lage des Hotels ist ruhig aber dennoch gut angeschlossen. Die Bahnlinie DART ist in der Nähe sowie auch Buslinien. Das Personal ist freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Frühstücksbuffet war vielseitig und sehr köstlich.,5,2017,11,05
247,"gutes Hotel in ruhiger Lage, trotzdem Zentrumsnah","Das Hotel ist modern eingerichtet, das Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr gut und abwechslungsreich, die Betten sind bequem. Sehr freundliches, hilfsbereites Personal. Einziger Minikritikpunkt sind die fehlenden Ablagen in der Dusche",5,2017,09,06
247,Gutes Hotel für einen kurzen Städtetrip,Preis Leistung angemessen.Guter freundlicher und zuvorkommender Service.Die Innenstadt ist in nur einige Gehminuten zu erreichen.Der Strand und somit Laufmöglichkeiten in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Hotel.,4,2017,09,05
247,Un po' scomodo,"Ambienti comuni carini, non so come siamo le altre stanze ma la mia veramente piccolissima con bagno molto stretto e a piano terra, quindi umida! Non so se sono stata sfortunata con il tipo di stanza! L'hotel è in zona tranquilla e residenziale vicino alla baia di Dublino, lontano dal centro, per raggiungere il quale c'è bisogno della metro che ha una fermata nei pressi dell'hotel o taxi. ",3,2017,09,01
247,Muy aceptable,"Buena relación calidad/precio; muy buen servicio; estupendo bar y comidas. Todo a gran altura. El único inconveniente la lejanía del centro, el aislamiento y la inseguridad que supone llegar de noche desde la parada del tren por unos parajes muy despoblados y oscuros.",4,2017,08,31
247,Gutes Hotel mit nettem Service,"Wir haben im Mai auf unserer Rundfahrt durch Irland zweimal im Sandymount Hotel übernachtet (Hin- und Rückfahrt). Beim ersten Mal hatten wir ein ziemlich altes, abgewohntes Zimmer, was aber sehr sauber war. Das Personal war sehr nett. Beim zweiten Mal haben wir wohl ein neu saniertes Zimmer ergattert und das war wirklich schick. Sehr sauber, alles fein :) Praktisch sind auch die Parkplätze direkt vorm Haus. Die Metro ist in 10 Minuten Fußweg zu erreichen.",4,2017,08,30
247,Tranquillo e comodo!,"Ho soggiornato due notti in questo hotel e mi sono trovato benissimo! Camere accoglienti e pulite, personale gentile e colazione ottima. Anche se è un po' lontano dal centro è possibile raggiungerlo in poco tempo grazie al treno DART a 5 minuti a piedi dall'hotel. Lo consiglio!",4,2017,08,27
247,nice for a short family trip,"Guter Service, gemütliche Atmosphäre, gutes Essen. Nur unser Zimmer war ein bisschen zu klein für 3 Personen, aber der Rest war wunderbar. Es war möglich, in die Innenstadt zu gehen, sonst könnt ihr mit dem Zug fahren.
Good service, cozy atmosphere, good food. Only our room was a bit too small for 3 people, but the rest was wonderful. it was possible to went downtown otherwise you can drive with the train.  ",4,2017,08,27
247,Decepción,"Acabamos de llegar hoy al hotel y sólo puedo decir que no sé si termino las 3 noches que tengo contratadas. Entrar a una habitación el primer día y encontrar cosas por debajo de la cama, telas de araña por todas partes, el mando de la tele más vale ni tocarlo porque te quedas pegado..  da igual si tienes 4, 3 ó 2 estrellas, la limpieza es fundamental y más el primer día que un cliente entra. 
Descansar no se yo si lo lograremos, porque la cama hace un ruido horrible cada vez que te mueves y se oyen voces a pesar de ser las 12 de la noche.
",2,2017,08,22
247,Due Notti a Dublino,Hotel molto carino e comodo per girare a Dublino. Vicinissimo allo stadio e soprattutto al trenino che in meno di 10 min ti porta in centro. Situato in zona tranquilla e silenziosa è un ottimo punto di partenza per girare la città,5,2017,08,21
247,fast perfekt... aber nur fast.,"3 Nächte im Sandymount Hotel.. diese kündigen sich die letzten drei Tage vor dem Check in Termin durch E -Mails an und rufen sogar an, ob wir kommen? Im nach hinein ist dieses ungewöhnliche Verhalten nur dadurch erklärbar, dass ein Fußballspiel im benachbarten Stadion stattfand und man wohl keine Leerräume haben wollte.
Unser Zimmer 325lad nach hinten raus und war sehr ruhig.Das Bad war eher klein und die Dusche nur als Wannendusche.Die Fensteraussicht endet 1,5m auf die Mauer des nächsten Gebäudeteil.Das Zimmer auch nicht übermäßig geräumig - aber ausreichend.
Die Wegeführung im Hotel fanden wir unübersichtlich und nicht besonders Gästefreundlich...apropos freundlich.. Die Damen an der Rezeption sind uns durch ihre bewusst zurückhaltende Art nicht besonders positiv aufgefallen. Zunächst dachten wir an ""irische Art""- aber mitnichten- bei jedem Blick auf einen Plan oder Handy wurden wir freundlich von Passanten angesprochen und Hilfe angeboten..die Damen an der Rezi sagten kaum ""guten Morgen"". Möglicherweise liegt das auch an den vielen Durchreisenden - das Hotel wird von Bustouren gerne als Kurzresidenz genutzt.

Was aber richtig gut ist ist die Lage. Mit 25 min Fußweg sind Sie im Leben...und die Bar..eine urige Bar oder besser Pub aber mit gutem Essen. Wenn sie mal keine Lust auf Downtown haben kann man hier auch den Abend ausklingen lassen.
Alles in Allem   wir würden wiederkommen.",4,2017,08,11
247,Hotel elegante e accogliente,"Questo hotel è situato in un quartiere tranquillo di Dublino, a breve distanza dal nuovo stadio della città. Il Trinity College è raggiungibile in pochi minuti con la Dart. Le camere sono pulite e accoglienti. Molto belli gli ambienti comuni. Il ristorante dell'albergo è di qualità. Ottima la colazione con ampia scelta di dolci: molto invitante anche l'Irish Breakfast. Personale gentile e disponibile sia in sala che alla reception.",5,2017,08,11
247,Meglio di no,"L'hotel si presenta negli spazi comuni molto curati. Le camere però sono davvero piccole e non c'è frigobar (mai visto in un 4 stelle).
Il servizio di housekeeping non è dei migliori, un giorno si sono dimenticati anche di rifare la camera. Ma anche quando l'hanno fatta, la pulizia, in particolare del bagno, è sempre stata approssimativa.
L'hotel si trova in una zona carina ma un po' decentrata ad un paio di fermate di treno dal centro. Il fatto è che a quel prezzo e con questi servizi conviene premderne uno in centro.
",2,2017,08,10
247,Hotel zum Wohlfühlen,"Kann hier einige Bewertungen nicht nachvollziehen, vielleicht haben wir auch mehr Glück gehabt oder größere Zimmer erhalten, weil wir vier Nächte gebucht haben Wir hatten ein wirklich großes Zimmer mit französischem Bett und Einzelbett, neues Badezimmer mit großer Badewanne. Zimmer waren trotz Fenster zur Straße nicht laut. Wir waren in den Zimmer rechts vom Eingang zum Hotel, 600er Bereich.
Das Frühstück war auch völlig okay, sicher geht es qualitativ immer noch besser, die Rühreier waren wohl aus Eipulver aber dann habe ich halt die richtigen gegessen. Leute die  gerne, so wie ich, auf das englische Frühstück verzichten, finden genug andere Dinge (die Croissants waren z.B. richtig lecker und der Fruchtjoghurtdrink).
Die Rezeptionisten haben uns alles freundlich und ausführlich erklärt, sie geben auch Tips für Lokale, irische Abende und Ausflüge. Zum vorgeschlagenen Hop on Hop off Bus der Dublin City Scape: Es ist zwar der Tourbus, der vom Hotel aus gut erreichbar ist, uns jedoch nicht überzeugt hat. Die deutsche Übersetzung hat von 4 Fahrten nur einmal funktioniert, da allerdings auch nur mit wenigen Sätzen, wo hingegen der irische Busfahrer oder Begleitung deutlich ausführlicher war. An den Haltestellen kamen die anderen Linien auch häufiger. Dazu vielleicht noch mal an anderer Stelle schlaulesen... Ach ja, wer abends noch vor die Tür möchte, Sandymount Village ist etwas verschnarcht am Abend, vielleicht dann doch lieber in die Richtung Ballsbridge gehen, da ist deutlich mehr los.",4,2017,08,08
247,Hotel mit Atmosphäre,"Wir sind auf unserer Irlandrundreise zweimal hier untergebracht worden und haben uns gut betreut gefühlt.
Ein Haus mit Atmosphäre trotz beachtlicher Größe. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Auch Sonderwünsche sind kein Problem. In der Bar bekommt man jederzeit nicht nur gute Getränke, sondern auch wohlschmeckende kleine Gerichte (versuchen Sie die Pasta mit frischen Waldpilzen) und dazu ein Guinness....
Die Mitarbeiter sind aufmerksam und liebenswürdig. Ich kann das Haus empfehlen auch wenn manche Zimmer vielleicht für den kontinentalen Geschmack etwas klein wirken;-)",4,2017,07,31
247,Excellent,"Muy recomendable, aunque no está ene el centro de Dublín, y hay habitaciones excesivamente pequeñas. Demasiados paseos para acceder a alguna de las habitaciones. 
Pero el personal y la estancia, en general, muy recomendables.",5,2017,07,29
247,Ottimo hotel ,"Ottimo hotel in posizione tranquilla a Dublino (non lontano dal centro ma lontano dal caos) vicino lo stadio Aviva. 
A 5 minuti dalla DART e a tre fermate dal Trinity College e quindi dal centro di Dublino. Ottimo il parcheggio e la colazione. Prezzo nella media. ",4,2017,07,17
247,"Na ja, wenn man Glück hat","Über das Hotel kann man geteilter Meinung sein.

Leider sind in TripAdvisor nur die großen Zimmer zu sehen. 
Unser Zimmer im Haus 5 war nur ca. 10qm groß. Das Bad war nur gleichzeitig mit einer Person zu betreten. Da fragt man sich, warum man a) in ein kleines Bad noch eine Badewanne einbauen muss und b) in ein so kleines Zimmer ein Doppel- UND ein Einzelbett einlegen muss. Koffer konnten nicht wirklich abgelegt werden und fanden nur auf einem Sessel Platz.
Die Betten waren gut, die Räume sauber.
Das Zimmer hatte keine Klimaanlage oder ein richtiges Fenster, nur eines zum Kippen.
Man musste Glück haben um nicht auf dem schmalen , langen Flur einem anderen Gast zu begegnen, weil an einander vorbei wäre schwierig geworden. (s. Foto)

Das Hotel liegt ruhig an einer Seitenstraße nahe zum Aviva Stadium. Zu Bus und DART waren es ca. 6-8 Min.

Das Hotel ist modern eingerichtet und verfügt über eine gemütliche Lobby mit Kaminzimmer und einen moderne Bar mit moderten Preisen. 

Sehr gutes Frühstück (5) , aufmerksames Personal und guter Kaffee. Sauber. 

Also man muss halt Glück haben oder versuchen die 5xx Zimmer zu meiden. Freund hatten ein größeres im Haus 6.
Hotel eher für Businesskunden, da in der Nähe zu IBM und AIB. Für Touristen eingeschränkt da lange Wege (ca. 15 min) auch zu Pubmöglichkeiten u.ä.",3,2017,07,02
247,Paseos por Dublin,"Ciudad encantadora para caminar, gente amabilísima y mucho ambiente joven. Merece la pena hacer excursiones por los alrededores y disfrutar de la música en directo en los pubs, así como de su cocina. No hay que perderse la visita a Dublinia y Christ Church!",4,2017,06,25
247,Excelente,"El vecindario es residencial, muy tranquilo y agradable. A unos 20 min del centro en el tren. También se puede hacer a pie con toda tranquilidad, nosotros fuimos de noche y nos aportó un recuerdo entrañable de la ciudad. 
Dublin y sus gentes nos enamoraron y el hotel también. Hotel tipo boutique, tiene diversas salas, una con chimenea , sala de ordenadores, WiFi en todo el hotel. Un bar donde relajarse, con un ambiente alegre pero tranquilo. La comida , siendo españoles obvio no nos entusiasmó pero fue correcta. Quizá el desayuno podria ser mas completo para el precio que es , la verdad es que había poca variedad y eche de menos un puesto de tortillas o creps.
Me enamoro el hotel en si, el cuidado de los detalles que tiene, lo limpio que estaba todo. Si eche de menos mas tarde que carece de ese toque humano tan entrañable que de encuentra caminando por la ciudad de Dublin.Esa quizá hubiese sido la guinda del pastel.
Volvería, pero comería en la ciudad.",5,2017,06,23
247,Albergo tranquillo lontano dal chiasso,"Un albergo 3 stelle in una zona residenziale molto tranquilla, vicinissimo allo stadio Aviva (bello per altro). Molto comodo per raggiungere il centro, solo 3 fermate di DART in pochi minuti. Considerando che il centro diu Dublino è un caos causa lavori sradali vari, la scelta è decisamente buona. C'è il parking. Le camere sono un po' piccole, ma tutto funziona, anche il safety box. Personale cordiale. La colazione è molto varia.",4,2017,06,15
247,Es war okay...,"Bei der Ankunft war der Parkplatz ziemlich voll und eng. Daher war das Parken umständlich. Wir hatten ein kleines Zimmer mit Blick auf den Lieferanteneingang, vor dem oft geraucht und bereits 6.30 Uhr laut gesprochen wurde. Das Zimmer aber war in Ordnung - sauber und alles da, was man braucht. Das Frühstück war aus der ""Konserve"", aber essbar. Die kleinen B&B's konnten das besser. Die Lage war recht zentral, der HoponHopoff - Bus ist in 10 Gehminuten erreichbar.",3,2017,06,06
247,Sehr zu empfehlen,"Tolles Hotel in einem Vorort von Dublin. Bus und Zuganbindung in direkter Nähe nach Dublin. Zu Fuß braucht man ca. 45 Minuten. Sehr nettes Personal, Kostenloser Shuttle zur Aircoach Haltestelle zum Flughafen. 
Die Zimmer sind kleiner, aber sauber mit einem tollen Bad. 
Das Frühstück war top.
Das Hotel liegt in der Nähe des Aviva Rugby Stadions und ca. 15 Min vom Meer entfernt. 
Von unserer Seite uneingeschränkt empfehlenswert.",5,2017,06,02
247,Schickes Hotel in einem Vorortviertel,"Das Hotel liegt in einem sehr ruhigen Vorortviertel von Dublin direkt neben dem AVIVA STADIUM . Das RDS ( Royal Dublin Society) - Grund meines Besuchs- ist in unmittelbarer Nähe. Mit der DART ( eine Art S-Bahn ) kann man das Zentrum bequem erreichen. Aber auch nach einem ausgedehnten Spaziergang. HopOn-HopOff Busstation rund 15 Minuten entfernt. Hotelparkplätze sind übrigens kostenlos.
In Hotelnähe befinden sich auch noch ein paar nette Pubs, Restaurants, ein Spar und Tesco Supermarkt.
Das Hotel wird meiner Meinung nach sehr sauber gehalten. Ebenso die Zimmer, die zweckmäßig eingerichtet sind. Bad wirkte sehr neuwertig und war sehr sauber . Alles aber relativ klein.
Hoteleigene Bar und Restaurant mit guter Speisekarte ( für jeden etwas ) 
Personal an der Rezeption stets freundlich und hilfsbereit. Was man beim Frühstück ( gut und very britisch ) und in der Bar nicht immer der Fall war. Wirkten oft überfordert. Lag vielleicht auch an den Reisebussen, die das Hotel fast täglich aufsuchten ...",3,2017,05,24
247,Bellissimo hotel 😌,Bellissima camera con bagno privato confortevole. Colazione ottima con cibo salato e dolce. Staff gentilissimo. Attenti ad ogni dettaglio. Consigliamo questo hotel anche per la posizione strategica vicina al centro.,5,2017,05,24
247,Hotel classico alla giusta distanza dal centro città,"La stanza era pulita e gradevole, ritengo che la dimensione, pur contenuta, sia accettabile.
Non era insonorizzata, si sentono sbattere le porte vicine quando chiudono automaticamente e si sente il rumore dalle stanze adiacenti se i vicini sono rumorosi, tuttavia questo non è stato un problema così marcato.
Il personale si è dimostrato sempre gentile e paziente, dalla reception al riordino della stanza, tutto è stato fatto con precisione. Il personale si presenta bene.
L'albergo verrà apprezzato da chi non vuole stare proprio al centro - peraltro caotico, anche di notte, lo sconsiglio - ma neanche in periferia. Il mare è a 1000 metri, la stazione della metro DART è a 700 metri, cosa molto importante. La vicinanza con lo stadio Aviva non crea problemi di rumore, anzi, rende facile l'individuazione del luogo. Il quartiere è mediamente elegante. Acqua potabile dalle utenze delle stanze.
C'è moquette ovunque, è una caratteristica di questi luoghi, ma a qualcuno questo potrebbe non piacere.
Non sento la necessità di tornare necessariamente in questo hotel, tuttavia, se dovessi, lo farei senza problemi, meritano un punteggio medio alto senza dubbio.",4,2017,05,24
247,Sehr nettes Hotel zum Wohlfühlen,"Als Paar haben wir 2 Nächte hier verbracht.

Pro:
Zügiges Check-In
Gemütliches Zimmer mit nützlichen Details wie USB-Anschluss neben der Steckdose zum Aufladen.
Sehr sauberes Zimmer und Bad
Bügeleisen und -brett bereits vorhanden
Zahlreiche, täglich frische Handtücher trotz ""don`t disturb"" Karte vor der Tür

Contra:
Hellhörige Zimmer
Verstopfter Bad-Abfluss 
Als die Verstopfung beim Check-out erwähnt wurde, wurde das professionell bis unfreundlich aufgenommen",4,2017,05,08
247,Ottimo hotel ma un po' decentrato,"Ottimo hotel, pulito, con belle camere e servizi. Molto disponibile il personale. Purtroppo un po' decentrato dal centro città, anche se ben servito da bus e treni. Altri neo il  Wi-Fi non funziona in tutte le camere, e spesso, soprattutto gli ospiti italiani sono ospitati in stanze adiacenti il parcheggio. E insomma, se un'auto sbaglia la retromarcia ti entra dalla finestra perché sei praticamente ad altezza auto.
",4,2017,05,04
247,Ottimo soggiorno,"Ho trascorso 4 notti in questo hotel e devo dire che è stato un soggiorno perfetto.
Comodo ai trasporti grazie alla vicina fermata Dart, accoglienza ottima da parte di tutto il personale, con check in veloce.
Camera molto pulita, come tutto l'hotel, con letto molto comodo.
Colazione davvero abbondante sia dolce che salata.
Sicuramente il punto di riferimento per i miei soggiorni a Dublino.
Da consigliare senza ombra di dubbio",5,2017,04,23
247,"Lejos del centro, reformado, tranquilo","Me alojé una noche en este hotel de Dublín, está alejado del centro, fuimos en taxi y se tardaba un rato, además pese a ser sábado y no muy tarde no había nadie por la calle. Está cerca del estadio de fútbol.
Se nota que ha sido recientemente reformado, y la parte del lobby es bastante bonita. Son varios edificios bajitos anexos y resulta un laberinto hasta que llegas a la habitación. Íbamos con mis padres y queríamos habitaciones contiguas, con lo que muy amablemente nos cambiaron y nos subieron de categoría, dándonos a mi pareja y a mi una habitación familiar con tres camas, una de ellas de matrimonio. Había además mucho espacio, estaba todo moderno y el baño también. 
Sin embargo, a mis padres en la habitación contigua les dieron una habitación más estándar, con cama de 135 cm para dos personas, lo cual me parece insuficiente, y muy poco espacio entre la pared con la mesa de estudio y la cama. Por lo demás las habitaciones eran iguales, decoradas en el mismo estilo moderno y funcional. Vistas 0, eso sí.
Hay dos comedores, uno más pequeño en la cafetería y otro en el piso de abajo. Nos dijeron que podíamos desayunar en el que quisiéramos y que el buffet era igual en ambos, pero no es así, bajé por curiosidad y en el de abajo tenían más cosas que en el otro no había, como pan de barra, mayor selección de quesos (una variedad más, en lonchas) o batidos naturales. 
El buffet en sí es sencillo, y no te hacen aparte nada que no tengan ya puesto, como huevos fritos por ejemplo, que no había. Poquísima fruta, no había cereales y el zumo de naranja y el café son bastante malos. Eso sí, el personal es muy amable, no había microondas pero si se lo dices te calientan lo que quieras, y además algunos camareros hablan español.
Del personal de recepción lo mismo, muy amables, nos cambiaron a habitaciones contiguas sin problema, algunos hablaban español y hasta me prestaron un adaptador para el enchufe.
Sin embargo, pese a que tiene bastantes puntos positivos, no lo recomiendo si lo que quieres es ver Dublin al estar alejado del centro.",3,2017,04,21
247,Sehr zu empfehlen,"Das Hotel zeichnet sich aus durch freundliches hilfsbereites Personal und Gemütlichkeit. Die Räume waren sauber, die Betten komfortable und die Bäder wirken neuwertig. Die neugestaltete Lobby wirkt elegant und auch das Restaurant ist einladend und zu empfehlen. Sehr praktisch war die gute Anbindung an die City mittels nahegelegener Dart Station.",4,2017,04,15
247,Abseits gelegen,"Das Hotel war das letzte während unserer Busrundreise und wir verbrachten dort zwei Nächte. 
Die Zimmer im Erdgeschoss sind sehr winzig. Für zwei Personen fast zu klein. Das Bad eine Herausforderung für etwas größere Menschen. Sauberkeit ist aber ok. Ansonsten ein Hotel mit Verlaufgarantie. Seltsame Gänge, irgendwie wie im Labyrinth. Der Gang zum Restaurant und zur Bar benötigt gute Orientierung. In der Bar kann man sehr gut essen, wenn auch die Preise gehobenes Niveau sind. 
Wenn man dieses Hotel jedoch mit Gepäck Richtung Flughafen verlassen will, muss man sich auf einen 10-15Min. Fußweg einrichten, damit man die Haltestelle für den Air Coach erreicht und das zieht sich mit Gepäck. Das Hotel bietet auf Nachfrage einen Shuttle-Service zu dieser Haltestelle an. Die Fahrt mit dem Taxi zum Flughafen kostet zwischen 25 und 28€. Wenn man in die Innenstadt möchte, ist es am besten, die DART zu nehmen.",3,2017,04,14
247,Ottimo hotel,"Abbiamo trascorso 2 notti in questo albergo e cenato una sera.
La posizione è molto tranquilla perché un po' periferica, ma in 3-4 minuti si arriva alla stazione della DART che ti porta in centro. Le camere sono molto spaziose e pulite. Il bagno (almeno quello della nostra camera) è  stato ristrutturato di recente perché sembrava quasi nuovo. Il personale molto cortese e disponibile. Se devo proprio trovare un difetto, è che in camera non c'era il frigobar e l'acqua del rubinetto non era molto buona (sapeva di cloro).
Il rapporto qualità/prezzo secondo me è ottimo e di sicuro, se dovessi tornare a Dublino, prenoterei ancora lì.",4,2017,03,06
247,LABERINTO DE PASILLOS. BUEN DESAYUNO,"LO MEJOR: Si vas a trabajar encontrarás una buena localización, cerca de la estación de tren frente al Aviva Stadium que te lleva al centro (Tara) en 3 paradas o si vas de turista esa misma estación también te conecta con la zona costera. Buena wifi y buen desayuno.
LO PEOR: Si cargas maletas pesadas prepárate para arrastrarlas hasta tu habitación por un laberinto de pasillos y escaleras que constituyen la unión de varias casas que conforman el edificio de este hotel.
Si vas en invierno y tu habitación  no estuvo ocupada, cuando entres te recibirá un frio brutal y húmedo porque el radiador estará cerrado.",3,2017,03,05
247,Schönes Hotel in ruhiger Lage,"Meine erste Wahl in Dublin. Es ist ein schönes Hotel im ruhig gelegenen Sandymount Viertel. Es ist gemütlich eingerichtet, schöne Zimmer und das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Frühstück gut aber nichts besonderes. Man kann am 2. Tag auch in der Stadt frühstücken gehen.
Die Lage ist super. Man kann mit dem Kombiticket mit dem Flughafentransferbus in die Stadt fahren und dann mit der DART ans Hotel. Die Nähe zur DART Station ist optimal um z.B. einen Ausflug nach Howth zu machen. Wenn nachts keine Bahn mehr fährt ist man von der Innenstadt mit dem Taxi in 10min wieder am Hotel. 
Wer abends keinen Trubel möchte findet in der Nähe das ein oder andere gemütliche Pub. In 20-30 Gehminuten kann man das Meer erreichen. Natürlich eignet sich das Hotel auch für Start und Ziel einer Irlandtour.",5,2017,02,14
247,Empfehlenswertes Hotel für Städtetrip,"Wir haben das Hotel für ein Wochenende in Dublin gebucht. Die Lage ist klasse, wenn man nicht direkt in der Innenstadt wohnen möchte. Die DART Haltestelle ist nur 5 Minuten Fußweg entfernt, von da aus ist man innerhalb von 10 Minuten im Zentrum. 
Alle Hotelangestellten waren sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war groß, mit einem schönen modernen Badezimmer.
Das Hotel ist uneingeschränkt für einen Städtetrip zu empfehlen. Wir waren begeistert!",5,2017,02,07
247,Ottimo,"Stanze pulite, personale fantastico che ha capito la nostra stanchezza dopo 5 giorni di camminate e ci ha accompagnato alla fermata del bus per il ritorno all'aeroporto, computer con internet disponibili che ho li utilizzati per la stampa dei biglietti per il volo. La fermata del tram è a 200mt circa e in 5 minuti sei nel centro, altrimenti con 20 minuti di camminata si arriva ugualmente. Città fantastica hotel fantastico merita visite.",5,2017,01,06

247,Fantastica Dublino!,"Dublino è una di quelle città in cui vai una volta...E ritorneresti altre mille.
Il Sandymount Hotel ha un'ottima posizione, fuori dal centro ma comunque comoda con i mezzi pubblici, zona tranquilla e silenziosa.
Camere confortevoli, spaziose, due pc con stampanti a disposizione che ci sono tornati molto utili per il check in online del volo di ritorno.",4,2016,11,03

247,Nähe zum Fährhafen,"Das Sandymount Hotel ist hervorragend als Start bzw. Ziel einer Irlandtour geeignet, da es in nur 15 Minuten von der Fähre ( nach Holyhead ) zu erreichen ist. Das Hotel entstand aus diversen Einfamilienhäusern und ist entsprechend verwinkelt und etwas unübersichtlich. Das macht aber auch den Charme des Hauses aus. Die Zimmer sind blitzsauber und gepflegt.

Ein paar Restaurants (Pubs und Italiener) sind zu Fuß in ca. 10 Minuten zu erreichen. Das Rugby-Stadion ist gleich um die Ecke - falls hier gerade ein Spiel stattfindet, wird es wohl turbulent und in der Bahn entsprechend voll.
Zimmer: spartanisch zweckmäßig eingerichtet. Tapete war fleckig. Die Zimmer sind hellhörig. In der zweiten Nacht unseres Aufenthaltes rumpelte es über uns bis nach Mitternacht. WLAN ist kostenlos und funktionierte einwandfrei. Ein Fön ist vorhanden - man findet ihn im Schreibtisch, wo er auch fest mit dem elektrischen Anschluss verbunden ist und nicht entfernt werden kann. Im Bad befindet sich nur eine 2-polige Steckdose - passt nicht zum Anschließen der üblichen dreipoligen Adapter, die man für Irland im Gepäck hat. Außerdem ist ein Wasserkocher vorhanden, Teebeutel und löslicher Kaffee werden angeboten.
Personal: sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend.
Frühstück: warmes und kaltes Buffet, ausreichende Auswahl für durchschnittliche Ansprüche.

247,Schönes Hotel in ruhiger guter Lage,"Das Sandymount ist ein super Hotel, wenn man es eher etwas ruhiger mag und trotzdem citynah übernachten möchte. Mit dem Bus kommt man super vom Hotel ins Zentrum und zurück, wir haben direkt am Flughafen ein Ticket gekauft, mit dem man 72 Stunden den Bus nutzen konnte, das war sehr praktisch. Dublin ist für deutsche Verhältnisse sehr teuer, dieses Hotel hat im Vergleich dazu ein sehr gutes Preis Leistungs Verhältnis und einen sehr guten Standard. Alles ist sehr sauber. Unser vermutlich sehr preiswertes Zimmer lag im Souterrain sozusagen fast im Keller und war mit einem Queen size Bett ausgestattet. Wenn einem das zu klein ist für zwei Personen, sollte man darauf bei der Buchung achten. Das Personal war super freundlich, für acht  Euro pro Person bekommt man ein vernünftiges kontinentales Frühstück und der Strand ist tatsächlich fußläufig erreichbar! Alles in Allem kann ich dieses Hotel und die Lage sehr empfehlen.",4,2016,09,01
247,Vacanza a Dublino,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel dal 12 al 17 agosto. Accoglienza eccellente da parte della cara Signora Beatrice, location interna ed esterna molto curata, pulizia ottima così come anche la gentilezza di tutto il personale. Molto caratteristico visto che è ricavato sapientemente bene da una ex distilleria. Vicinissimo alla stazione della Dart. Lo consiglio vivamente

247,Gutes Hotel in guter Lage,"Das Hotel ist gut ausgestattet und auch sauber. Es ist gut zu erreichen und die Parkplätze sind kostenfrei. Die s-Bahn mit direktem Anschluss ans Zentrum ist ca. 300 Meter entfernt, allerdings sind es auch nur ca. 3 Km zu Fuß.",4,2016,08,12
247,Nett ,"Liegt etwas außerhalb und nur leicht mit der Schnellbahn zu erreichen - 5 Minuten - schließt gegen 23h30.
Freundlicher netter Empfang, kleine aber renovierte Zimmer, neue Bäder.
Gute Empfehlungen für die Umgebung.

247,Incomodo y muy lejos ,"Entre cientos de recovecos, angostos pasillos, ascensores pequeños, se llega las habitaciones pequeñas pero cómodas, camas y almohadas confortables, tiene secadora de pelo, planchador y plancha, caja fuerte.
Un baño muy moderno con tina
Desayuno ingles completo.

No para discapacitados",4,2016,07,17
247,"""Ci torno""","Ho pernottato in questo albergo per tre giorni. L' hotel è molto pulito e carino; lo staff è assai gentile e disponibile. La colazione è ottima e abbondante. La posizione è ottima, in quanto è a circa 5 minuti a piedi dalla fermata del treno più vicina. Inoltre la zona è tranquilla, anche durante la notte. L'unico difetto che posso trovare riguarda la dimensione delle camere, veramente troppo piccole per tre persone.",4,2016,07,12
247,Verwinkeltes Haus mit etlichen Treppen,"Das Hotel liegt im Stadtteil Sandymount, an einer ruhigen Straße. Zur Stadtmitte kann man mit der nur 5 Minuten entfernten S-Bahn fahren.
Unser hellhöriges Zimmer war sehr klein, mit Blick auf den Hotelparkplatz. Es lag in einem Anbau des Hotels. Über einen Nebeneingang, einen Stock unterhalb der Rezeption, konnten wir unser Zimmer schnell erreichen. 
Die Damen an der Rezeption waren sehr freundlich und behilflich. Selbst eine Bus- Tagesfahrkarte wurde von Ihnen ausgestellt. 
Die Zimmer waren sauber. Das Frühstück und das Abendessen waren reichlich und gut.
Da wir am Abreisetag erst am Nachmittag von einem Bus zum Flughafen abgeholt  wurden, konnten wir bis dahin unsere Koffer in einem Nebenraum unterstellen.",3,2016,07,12
247,"Schönes Zimmer, gutes Frühstück","Wir hatten ein ruhiges und sauberes Zimmer, freundliches und kompetentes Personal, es gab einen Gratisparkplatz und das Hotel liegt nahe am Zentrum. Verschiedene Busse hatten ihre Haltestellen nur wenige Minuten vom Hotel entfernt. Alles bestens.",4,2016,07,09
247,Gutes Stadthotel für Kurztrip in Dublin,"Wir waren 3 Tage in Dublin und haben in diesem Hotel übernachtet. Die Zimmer sind in Ordnung, alles da, was man braucht. Die Betten sind okay, aber etwas weich. Das Frühstück ist gut. Insgesamt ein gutes Hotel für einen Städtetrip gut geeinget.",4,2016,07,09
247,Vacanza,"Stanze spaziose, letti molto comodi, personale gentilissimo, colazione abbondante tipo irlandese e continentale. Ubicazione non proprio centrale ma a breve distanza la DART (metropolitana scoperta) oppure, percorrendo un breve tratto a piedi, si raggiunge Pembroke Road e da lì, con i mezzi, qualsiasi punto della città.....",5,2016,06,27
247,Bella esperienza,L'hotel si trova in una zona residenziale ben tenuta e a pochi passi dalla fermata del treno veloce che porta in centro. Ambiente moderno e pulito. Si mangia discretamente per essere all'estero. Pulizia e cortesia sono di casa.,4,2016,06,26
247,Comodo per visitare la città pur essendo fuori dal caos,"Bagno e arredamento abbastanza nuovi. Colazione continentale a 8 euro non abbondantissima ma sufficiente per iniziare la giornata (croissant, muffin, pane da tostare, marmellate/nutella, yogurt, macedonia, succo di frutta, ecc.). Quartiere residenziale con poco traffico. Rapporto qualità/prezzo abbastanza buono rispetto ai prezzi medi di Dublino. Si consideri anche il fatto che si è fuori dal caos ma a 5 minuti a piedi dalla DART che poi in 10 minuti ti porta nel centro città.
Di negativo dovrei segnalare solo la moquette in tutta la stanza e corridoi dell'hotel. Si sa che è una caratteristica del nord Europa ma non è molto igienico! Lavabo della nostra camera piccolissimo (è in pratica un lavamani).
Pulizia della stanza e delle parti comuni comunque molto buona.
Staff molto disponibile e gentile.",4,2016,06,10
247,Zimmer zum Parkplatz,"Ohne Not, Zimmer zu bekommen, die echt unterirdisch sind, finde ich Grenzwertig.
Die halbe Nacht liefen die Lichtkegel durchs Zimmer. Das Hotel war nicht mal ausgebucht. Also warum dann diese Zimmer. In der Bar wurde man gepflegt ignoriert.
Wir haben im Abstand von zwei Wochen dort gewohnt. Beide Male waren wir enttäuscht.
Wechselnde Standorte des Frühstücksraumes sind auch nicht sehr hilfreich.
Ich wünschte mir so oft, das das Personal an Rezeptionen wenigstens minimale Deutschkenntnisse besäße. Ein frommer Wunsch.",3,2016,06,09
247,Vacanza memorabile,"Questo hotel è situato vicino allo stadio e a pochi metri c'è la stazione del treno veloce che la rende comodissima per gli spostamenti. Ottima colazione e stanze confortevoli. Personale anche Italiano. Molto signorile. Meta di giocatori chissà che non se ne incotri uno?
Consigliabile sa per affari che per vacanze.",5,2016,06,07
247,Schönes Hotel mit schrecklichem Frühstück,"Das Hotel hat eine gute Lage nahe der DART Linie (heißt 10 min bis Innenstadt). 
Man ist abseits genug vom Trubel entfernt. Die Zimmer sind neu reserviert, die Bar ist nett, Mitarbeiter sehr freundlich, aber das Frühstück ist eine Katastrophe (besonders der Kaffee ist ungenießbar - hier wird der ambitionierte Kaffeeliebhaber zum Teetrinker).",4,2016,05,27
247,Suerte segun la habitacion,"Lo malo es el laberinto que son los pasillos para llegar a las habitaciones que nos fueron asignadas, las habitaciones hiper pequeñas, la ventana daba al parking con lo cual dejamos la ventana cerrada todo el tiempo porque pasada gente continuamente y se veia hacia dentro. Otra desventaja es la ubicación. Muy lejos del centro. Muy lejos de lugares para comer algo o comprar algo. Es una zona residencial. Por suerte estuvimos solo dos noches. Lo bueno es que el hotel en si es bonito. El desayuno normal pero bien. Por la habitacion y ubicación no lo recomiendo.",3,2016,05,24
247,Frisch renoviert und sehr angenehm,"Die Hotelzimmer werden zur Zeit renoviert, diese Arbeiten sind weitestgehend abgeschlossen. Dementsprechend in sehr gutem Zustand, dennoch ist der gemütliche Charakter nicht verloren gegangen. Das Personal ist freundlich, die Bar auch gut, es ist gemütlich im Sandymount. Zu empfehlen ist, nach einem renovierten Zimmer zu fragen, ideal zur wenig befahrenen Straße und in manchen Zimmern haben die Bäder ebenfalls ein Fenster.",4,2016,05,24
247,Gute Lage,"Das Hotel ist in ziemlich guter Lage. In 5 Minuten ist man zu Fuß bei der S-Bahn und in ca. 15 Minuten direkt in der Innenstadt. Für Fußball-Fans auch interessant: in 2 Minuten ist man beim Aviva Stadium.

Das Hotel selber ist recht verwinkelt und der erste Eindruck ist etwas verwirrend. Das Zimmer war ok. Sehr ruhig und auch sauber. Das Bad ist etwas klein geraten. Für meinen Geschmack passt das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis nicht ganz. Ich finde es etwas überteuert.",3,2016,05,20
247,Sehr gutes Hotel für einen Dublin-Städtetrip,"Das Hotel liegt in Sandymount, etwa 15 Minuten vom City Center entfernt. Eine Bahnstation ist nur 5 Gehminuten entfernt. In der Nähe ist auch der Sandymount Beach.

Das Hotel ist innen modern und geschmackvoll gestaltet. Das Standardzimmer war von der Größe her okay. Das Hotel insgesamt, das Zimmer als auch das Badezimmer waren sehr sauber, das Bett sehr bequem.

Das Servicepersonal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. 

Empfehlenswert ist auch das Full Irish Breakfast, das zu einem sehr guten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis erhältlich ist.",5,2016,04,27
247,Fantástica comida y nueva habitación,"El desayuno es aceptable, la habitación totalmente renovada, la atención del personal fantástica.
La única pega, es que está a unos 30 minutos andando del centro, pero el metro está justo al lado y te lleva en 5 minutos.",4,2016,03,01
247,si vas al AVIVA no hay otro mejor !,"Buscamos un hotel cerca del estadio para ver un partido de Rugby, y tuvimos una muy agradable sorpresa, ya que los hoteles en irlanda suelen ser bastante pobres.
lo principal es que está a 2 minutos del estadio; si vas al centro hay un tren que pasa cada 15 min que en solo dos paradas te deja en el centro. Andando una media hora.
las habitaciones muy correctas pero sobre todo muy limpias, el desayuno correcto, no faltaba nada y todo de calidad. El personal encantador, muy atentos.
Nos saludó el propietario y director del hotel, al que vuelvo a felicitar por la gestión",5,2016,02,09
247,Ottima soluzione x una breve vacanza!!,"Sono stata all'hotel sandymount per capodanno su consiglio di un collega, prenotando attraverso un'agenzia di viaggio. Mi sono trovata benissimo. Camera pulita, asciugamani puliti ogni giorno anche se non richiesto, colazione buona e abbondante x tutti i gusti, e se vuoi ti fanno anche l'uovo alla coque o il porridge espressi, unica pecca il gelo nel bagno a causa degli infissi un po' vecchiotti. Ottima la logistica:l'albergo è situato in una zona residenziale di dublino, a due passi dallo stadio del rugby e alla Dart (la metro di superficie che va lungocosta da malahide a greystones). La dart è comodissima ma non viaggia nelle ore notturne, per cui per raggiungere l'albergo dal centro di dublino dopo le 23.30 (orario chiusura di tara station) occorre prendere un taxi. Per andare dall'aeroporto all'albergo, in orario diurno, si può prendere il bus 747 fino a connolly, e poi da lì, la dart fino a lansdowne road: se acquistate in aereoporto la mitica leap visitor card, avete tutto incluso. Voto: 8!! Ci ritorneremo!",4,2016,01,16
247,Ottima sistemazione in Dublino,"L'hotel è situato in una zona tranquilla e molto elegante, vicino al mare è molto comodo con i mezzi per andare in centro.
Lo staff è gentile ed efficiente, colazione ricca a un prezzo giusto.
Le camere sono semplici ma accoglienti, tutto è sempre perfettamente pulito, in sostanza un'ottima scelta come rapporto qualità e prezzo.",4,2016,01,02
247,normal,"Está a unos 3 km del centro. El hotel cuenta con taxis. también se puede ir en tren que queda a unas 3 cuadras. El desayuno bastante berreta. Un día cenamos ahí y es bastante normal pero me pareció caro por lo que ofrecían. Había una moza latina muy amable. La habitación era bastante ruidosa. No contaba con frigobar, pero tenían cafetera con té y café. El barrio es muy lindo, pero el hotel realmente no me gustó.",3,2015,12,26
247,Visita a Dublino ,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel in novembre durante un week end a Dublino. Posizione non centrale ma tranquilla anche dal punto di vista della percezione di sicurezza, in una zona residenziale vicinissima allo stadio Aviva,sufficientemente  servita dai mezzi pubblici. Hotel confortevole ristrutturato e ben  arredato nelle parti comuni,  stanza e bagno piccoli ma sufficienti , pulizia buona, accoglienza più che buona. Avevo solo pernottamento perciò sul vitto non posso dire,  comunque lo consiglio tenuto conto del rapporto qualità prezzo .... soprattutto se trovate un'offerta . ",4,2015,12,12
247,Acogedor,"La habitación que teníamos era amplia y estaba muy limpia, las camas super cómodas. No hay minibar pero hay una kettle con te, leche y café.
El baño también amplio y limpio.
En el desayuno tienen bastante variedad, panes para tostar, bollería, el típico desayuno inglés, fruta, yogur y cereales. Tienen una mesa apartada con pan y cereales para personas celiacas.
El hotel en general está genial pero está algo alejado del centro, sobre todo si vas en invierno y hace frío para volver por la noche andando.. lo bueno es que a 5 minutos hay una estación de tren que te deja en el centro.",4,2015,12,12
247,dipende dalla camera,"Hotel carino ma un pò caro, anche se nella media di Dublino. Il primo giorno mi hanno dato una stanza pessima, poi, per fortuna, c'è stato un problema con il lavandino(non defluiva l'acqua e spandeva) e me l'hanno cambiata con una bella, senza però ritoccare il prezzo che  un single, paga esattamente come in coppia. Colazione buonissima e super, certo per 12 euro in più al giorno a persona ci mancava anche che non fosse così ...",3,2015,12,05
247,Da consigliare,"L'albergo non è molto vicino al centro però l'ambiente è  confortevole e molto accogliente.  Il personale si è dimostrato molto disponibile e gentile,  pronto a soddisfare tutte le richieste (a qualsiasi ora del giorno o della notte...) in una parola: professionale! Le camere, pulite,  funzionali e perfettamente insonorizzate ci hanno regalato un riposo inaspettato e veramente gradito (dopo un anno di duro  lavoro...). Il servizio in generale  è stato  impeccabile.  La distanza dal centro della città è stato per noi un problema solo all'inizio ma con l'aiuto del personale della reception abbiamo trovato dei modi semplici ed economici per  visitare questa bellissima città.  E' un Hotel da consigliare.",5,2015,12,03
247,Recht nah an der S-Bahn aber dennoch ruhig gelegen,"Größeres Hotel mit freundlichem Personal. Das Haus war sehr verwinkelt und man musste z.T. die Aufzüge wechseln. Die Zimmer waren groß, die Matratzen gut, aber die Betten schmal. Bei Bedarf vorher nach 2 Bett-Zimmern fragen, wenn einer unruhig schläft. Das Frühstück war ordentlich.
Parken auf einem Hotelparkplatz war kostenlos. In 5 Minuten war man zu Fuß am S-Bahnhof und konnte alle 15 Minuten nach Dublin rein fahren. Aber auch in der Nähe des Hotels waren kleine Plätze und Lokale oder Geschäfte.",4,2015,10,20
247,Perfektes Hotel für Städtetrip!,"Service: sehr gut, sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal
Zimmer: sehr sauber, Bad einwandfrei, Matratzen etwas gar weich
Lage: ideal, in der Nähe die DART-Station und 5 Minuten zu Fuss sehr gute Restaurants, in unmittelbarer Nähe des AVIVA-Stadiums",4,2015,10,11
247,Super Hotel in top Lage!,"Mein Freund und ich haben zwei Nächte im Sandymount Hotel verbracht und waren rundum zufrieden. Unser Zimmer war im Erdgeschoss und sehr schick eingerichtet. Das moderne Bad hat vor allem durch die Sauberkeit überzeugt, was mir bei einem Hotel sehr wichtig ist.
Das Frühstücksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch. Uns hat wirklich alles sehr gut geschmeckt. 
Besonders positiv war zudem der sehr freundliche und aufgeschlossene Service. So haben wir zum Beispiel hilfreiche Sightseeing Tipps erhalten! 
Wir würden dort jederzeit wieder übernachten :-)",5,2015,09,28
247,Es más un hostal que otra cosa.,"No sé qué variedad de habitaciones tienen, la que me dieron a mí y la otra que dieron a mi compañero (íbamos de trabajo) eran cutres como las de las pensiones de mala muerte. Leí que había plancha (según los servicios que ellos indican) y nada de nada, la plancha brillaba por su ausencia. En el baño no había enchufe. Un tubo fluorescente encima de una lavabo como los que había en la mili. Los muebles de la habitación no valían ni 10 euros. La cama sí estaba bien. El hotel es un laberinto de pasillos en los que te pierdes fácilmente. La recepción y el restaurante bien, parecen de un hotel normal hasta que entras en la habitación y te das cuenta de dónde te has metido. El barrio no está mal pero no tiene nada que ver. Tengo claro que NO vuelvo más por ahí.",2,2015,09,28
247,Trato muy cercano en especial el conductor de la furgoneta de viaje del Hotel.,"Hotel un poco alejado del centro pero muy bien comunicado. Mucha tranquilidad en un barrio residencial con las tipicas casas de estilo georgiano. En especial este mensaje es para destacar el trato amable de la gente de la zona y del hotel pero sobre todo el de Blue O'Brien, el majísimo y dicharachero conductor a cargo de la furgoneta de viajeros en el hotel que ha sido un encanto y muy atento a la hora de tratarnos y facilitarnos el transporte en las mañanas al centro de la ciudad. Todo un lujo!",4,2015,09,17
247,Qualità - prezzo,"Seconda visita a Dublino e seconda volta che fatalità alloggio qui, ottima soluzione per un po' di qualità ad un prezzo sotto la media degli alberghi in centro o nei pressi. 
Peccato per la colazione esclusa dal prezzo , vista la qualità potrebbero tranquillamente includerla. Camere buone, silenzioso e ottimo x chi noleggia un'auto avendo parcheggio privato gratuito. Al centro in treno ( fermata a 600m.) o taxi .",4,2015,09,14
247,Muy correcto y útil,Situado cerca de estadio y bien comunicado con el centro de Dublín por transporte público muy cercano al hotel. Parking gratuito para coche privado. Habitaciones confortables con todo lo necesario en el baño incluido zapatillas y albornoz. Desayuno irlandés de calidad y abundante. Perfecto para iniciar un recorrido por Irlanda hacia el Sur.,4,2015,09,14
247,Carino,"Hotel carino, vicino al centro.
Colazione però troppo poco varia e non compresa nel prezzo.
Camere nella norma. Bagni puliti e letti comodi. 
Le Receptionist sono disponibilissime e ci hanno consigliato i posti più belli da vedere.",4,2015,09,12
247,Schönes Hotel,"Ein schönes Hotel mit einem schönen, sauberen Zimmer. Der Empfang war herzlich und die Mitarbeiter waren freundlich und hilfsbereit. 
Das Hotel ist in der Tat verwinkelt, da es vermutlich über die Zeit gewachsen ist und angrenzende Gebäude als Erweiterung genutzt werden. Wenn man den Ausschilderungen immer folgt, findet man jedoch sein Zimmer. 
Das Frühstücksbuffet war reichhaltig, allerdings wirkte das Personal teilweise etwas unkoordiniert. Entweder wurde man fast minütlich gefragt, ob man Kaffee haben möchte oder man musste sehr lange darauf warten. 
Alles in allem ein super Hotel in etwas ruhigerer Lage, jedoch ist das Zentrum mithilfe der DART Bahn schnell zu erreichen.",5,2015,09,06
247,La ricerca della camera nascosta,All'apparenza non grande in realtà abbiamo camminato girando a vuoto un po' tutti per trovare le camere. Letto matrimoniale ad una piazza e mezz'asta ma volendo c'era il secondo letto. Colazione non molto varia ma buona. Purtroppo la posizione decentrata in zona stadio costringe ad utilizzare i mezzi pubblici per arrivare in centro. In bagno lavandino senza miscelatore ma mitica la doccia.,3,2015,09,01
247,"Ottimo hotel, nei pressi dello Stadio Aviva","L'albergo ha qualche anno, ma di buon livello. le camere sono di diverso tipo, quindi dipende da quale vi assegnano. In genere sono ampie, moderne, confortevoli, pulite e silenziose. I letti invece non sono abbastanza comodi. Buona l'accoglienza, ottima la colazione, cortese il personale. L'albergo non è in una zona centrale, ma il centro è facilmente raggiungibile sia con taxi che con mezzi pubblici. In zona pub e buoni ristoranti.",4,2015,09,01
247,La colazione andava inclusa nel prezzo ,"L'hotel è molto carino ed il personale accogliente, gentile e preparato. Le receptionists ci hanno dato molti consigli e indicato varie zone di interesse, incluso il delizioso villaggio di Sandymount a 10 minuti di camminata dell'hotel. Nonostante la posizione un po'fuori dal centro di Dublino (vicino al grande Stadio Aviva), il centro è raggiungibile in 2 fermate di treno, lì chiamato DART, anche molto conveniente rispetto a Londra. Alternativamente ci si può muovere in taxi, lì molto economici. Il prezzo dell'hotel al centro può variare dai 6 ai 10 euro. Le stanze sono arredante semplicemente ma con gusto ed i bagni sono moderni e puliti. Letti molto comodi e spaziosi. La camera é dotata di un kettle per il tè o caffè, latte in polvere e zucchero. Direi che per il prezzo pagato e per la posizione dell'albergo, avrebbero quanto meno potuto includere la colazione, trattandosi di un prezzo medio alto per sole due notti. L'hotel é sede di conferenze e meeting disponendo di grandi sale al piano terra quindi c'è un continuo via vai di gente specialmente durante la mattina. Il personale dell'hotel propone anche una serata in un ristorante a Dublino centro con musica e balli irlandesi e cena per circa 35 euro. Nonostante l'incertezza iniziale e solo dopo aver controllato che i prezzi prenotando direttamente con il locale fossero gli stessi, abbiamo accettato e trascorso la serata lí. Il gruppo di cantanti e musicisti irlandesi è stato fenomenale, la cena non è stata poi male, e la serata è passata velocemente e piacevolmente. C'è talmente tanta gente mandata anche da altri hotel che si può finire a cenare ad uno stesso tavolo con gente sconosciuta ma Personalmente lo consiglierei per una serata in pieno stile folk irlandese!
",4,2015,08,27
247,Buon compromesso,"Albergo abbastanza grande con parcheggio, in zona Aviva stadium... Fermata della Dart a pochi minuti a piedi. Colazione extra a 12€. La sera a pochi minuti a piedi ci sono alcuni ristoranti un po per tutti i gusti. La Wi-Fi è compresa anche nelle camere ed è di qualità media. Nel complesso le camere sono discretamente grandi, i letti un po piccolini. Personale disponibile e pulizia buona. Rapporto qualità prezzo abbastanza soddisfacente. ",3,2015,08,24
247,Discreto,"Vicino alla dart , in 10 minuti si arriva in centro . Parcheggio privato e personale molto gentile. Segnale wi fi i ottimo . La colazione , a mio parere , al mattino è migliorabile . Comunque per una o due notti di passaggio per un fly and drive penso sia perfetto .",3,2015,08,23
247,Nettes Hotel!!,"Es war das erste Hotel auf unserer Irland-Rundreise. Das Hotel von außen ok, von innen sehr verwinkelt, aber mit Charme. Das Zimmer war sehr groß und sauber. Das Bad könnte eine Renovierung vertragen, aber war ebenfalls sauber.
Das Frühstück war sehr lecker und reichhaltig. Die Lage etwas außerhalb und damit sehr ruhig.",4,2015,08,19
247,Un po distante dal centro con la DART a 100 mt,"Parcheggio ampio, lontano dal centro ma ben collegato coi mezzi pubblici: c'è la DART subito dopo l'angolo; personale gentile, camere ampie e igiene nella norma, niente di eccellente. La colazione è 12 euro a persona. Infiniti corridoi per arrivare alle stanze. Portatevi l'adattatore da casa perchè mi hanno fatto pagare 5 euro per comparne uno (altri alberghi lo prestano invece..). Wifi veloce e gratuito",3,2015,08,15
247,2 Notti a Dublino,"Hotel 4 stelle pulito, camera ampia, a 5 minuti a piedi da fermata della DART (biglietto per il centro 2,15€, andata ritorno giornaliero 3,85).
Wifi perfettamente funzionante e possibilità di utilizzo PC in loco con stampante a titolo gratuito.
Abbiamo pagato 200 Euro per 2 notti, colazione esclusa (chiesti 12€ a testa a persona).
Per la colazione si può comodamente usare uno dei numerosi bar in centro che per qualche Euro permettono di fare la Iris Breakfast.
Ristorante interno con qualche piatto interessante e a prezzi abbordabili.
Consigliato.",4,2015,08,14
247,Non ci tornerei,"Hotel che dista 3 km dal centro, servito dalla dart. E' possibile raggiungere i maggiori punti di attrazione anche con una passeggiata di un'oretta. La zona è tranquilla anche in tarda sera.
Non dimenticate l'adattatore per le prese, l'hotel ve lo vende a 5 euro (non si vergognano??). Altra cosa da non scordare è l'acqua: ho dovuto acquistare sempre in hotel una bottiglia di naturare da 75cl all'assurda cifra di 5 euro.",3,2015,08,14
247,Precioso hotel en un barrio residencial,"Se trata de un bonito hotel en un precioso barrio residencial alejado del centro de Dublín.  Es el unico incoveniente del hotel, la lejanía del centro. Caminando son tres cuartos de hora. Por lo demás es impecable.",5,2015,08,12
247,Schönes Hotel mit sehr gutem Service,"Nach einem sehr unruhigen Flug und ohne Koffer kamen wir am Hotel an und waren entsprechend gelaunt. Doch die schlechte Laune wurde uns gleich genommen, da wir wirklich freundlich begrüßt wurden und alle versuchten, uns bei unserem Pech mit den Koffern zu helfen. Wir erhielten kostenfreie Zahnbürsten und Bademäntel, um wenigstens die Nacht zu überbrücken, da die Koffer abends nicht geliefert wurden, was uns wirklich viel geholfen hat. 
Auch das Abendessen war sehr gut, sodass wir trotz allem eine gute Nacht hatten. 
Das Frühstücksbuffet setzte dann noch eins drauf, die Auswahl war wirklich sehr gut und es wurde auch auf Lebensmittel-Unverträglichkeiten gut eingegangen. 
Die Dart-Station ist in der Nähe des Hotels, sodass man auch gut in die Stadt kommt, dies haben wir allerdings nicht genutzt.",5,2015,08,11
247,Camere scadenti.,Io e mi moglie abbiamo trascorso una notte in questo hotel durante il nostro viaggio di nozze. Ci hanno dato una camera tripla con un letto matrimoniale ad una piazza e mezza.  Non c'era spazio per le valigie quindi abbiamo usato il terzo lettino. Il bagno era sporco e vecchio. Una cosa buona il personale gentile e preparato.,2,2015,07,26
247,Buon hotel,"Buon hotel, parcheggio auto disponibile, personale gentile, buona la prima colazione e veramente molto belle le aree comuni.
Camere pulite ed abbastanza spaziose.
Piuttosto distante dal centro di Dublino (circa 4 km a piedi) ma vicinissimo all'Aviva Stadium.",4,2015,07,14
247,Una elección acertada!,"Fantástico hotel a las afueras de Dublín. Tranquilo, acogedor y a menos de 5 minutos del Dart que en sólo 3 paradas te deja en O'Connel Street. El parking en el hotel es gratuito, el desayuno es buffet variado y el personal es agradable y profesional. Precio razonable.",5,2015,07,10
247,Excelente en todo ,"Los cuartos esta muy bien. 
La comida es deliciosa y fresca. 
Lo mejor es la atención del personal muy profesional, muy atenta, pro activa, dinámica. 
Tuve el gusto de tratar con 2 funcionarias que realmente sobresalieron del equipo del hotel por su atención  y por dar un servicio de excelencia, recomiendo que vengan a este hotel y traten de contactar a Beatrie y Goscia!!!!

247,Koloss an ruhiger Lage,"Verwinkeltes Hotel mit gutem Essen und ebensolchem Service. Liegt in leicht zu Fuss erreichbarer Lage zur S-Bahn und zu einem modernen Gross-Stadion. 
Die sauberen Zimmer weisen weder Minibar noch einen Gratis-Mineralwasser-Service an.",4,2015,07,06
247,Un po' lontano dal centro,E' stata una tappa del tour fatto in Irlanda. Albergo molto carino con camere molto grandi dislocate in un labirinto di corridoi. Tranquillo in mezzo al verde. All'esterno è collocata una bellissima statua in onore ai giocatori di rugby. Niente male!,4,2015,06,30
247,Mini-Zimmer mit Haustieren,"Wir haben dieses Hotel gebucht, weil es das einzig verfügbare Hotel Nähe Dublin mit Parkplatz war und wir am Ende unserer Irland Rundreise noch ein Zimmer für 2 Nächte brauchten. 
Der Parkplatz beim Hotel ist groß genug! Vorteil!! Dann an der Rezeption haben wir uns erkundigt, wo man in der Stadt am besten parken kann. Die Dame meinte, man solle auf keinen Fall mit dem Auto in die Stadt fahren, da es sehr teuer sei. Ein Zugticket koste 2,50 pro Person pro Strecke. Wir sind dann am Abend trotzdem mit dem Auto zum Essen ins Zentrum gefahren (4,40 für 2h parken find ich zwar nicht teuer, aber gut).

Wir hatten ein Mini-Zimmer, oder besser Abstellkammer. Doch bevor wir das Zimmer gefunden haben sind wir durchs halbe Hotel gelaufen, da alles sehr verwinkelt und kompliziert ist. An der Rezeption hat sich auch keiner bemüht uns das Zimmer zu zeigen. Das Badezimmer war zwar im Vergleich zum Zimmer groß, jedoch waren noch jede Menge Haare in der Badewanne, die Klobrille war nicht gründlich geputzt und der Duschvorhang hat wohl auch schon bessere Zeiten gesehen.
Am Abend als wir dann im Bett lagen waren plötzlich 2 rießen große Spinnen im Zimmer und ein teilweiser Stromausfall legte den Fernseher lahm.

Das WLAN war bei unsere Ankunft sehr gut, aber nur ca 10 Minuten, danach ging 2 Tage mal gar nichts. Somit konnten wir unseren Heimflug nicht einchecken.

Die Lage ist ok, wenn es einen nicht stört mit dem Zug ins Zentrum fahren zu müssen (€3,75 kostet ein Tages Hin-und Retourticket). Ich würde in Dublin jedoch lieber in einem Hotel im Zentrum schlafen, weil man einfach viel flexibler ist. 
Am Beginn unserer Reise hatten wir ein Hotel mitten in Temple Bar -> TOP!",2,2015,06,25
247,Tolles Wohlfühl-Hotel,"Die Lage des Hotels ist ideal, um das Zentrum zu erkunden. Wenige Gehminuten zur DART-Station Lansdowne sowie zum Sandymount-Strand und einigen Pubs. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit und unser Zimmer war groß und wohnlich.  Das Frühstück vom Buffet war ausgezeichnet und insgesamt macht das Hotel einen guten Eindruck und das Restaurant (Line Out Bar) ist ebenfalls zu empfehlen. 
Gisela & Wolfgang aus Niederösterreich",5,2015,06,10
247,Nettes Hotel im ruhigen Vorort,"Das Hotel ist in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße im Vorort Ballsbridge gegenüber vom Aviva-Stadium. Das Lage war super, da sowohl die DART-Station Lansdowne (5 min), der Sandymount Strand (ca. 10 min) und einige Pubs und Supermärkte (10 min) nicht weit entfernt sind. Mit dem DART ist man in wenigen Minuten in der Innenstadt.

Das Hotel macht einen tollen Eindruck und das Restaurant (Line Out Bar) ist wirklich zu empfehlen. Auch das Personal ist höflich und zuvorkommend. Der Garten des Hotels ist wunderschön und lädt zum Verweilen an lauen Abenden ein.

Leider waren die Zimmer etwas veraltet, aber absolut akzeptabel. Es gab nur eine Dusch/Badewanne mit Duschvorhang und das Waschbecken war auch schon etwas mitgenommen. Hier und da waren Kratzer an den Möbeln und das Zimmer wirkte etwas mitgenommen. Es lohnt sich wahrscheinlich den Aufpreis für ein Premiumzimmer zu zahlen, wenn man es gerne etwas stylischer und trendiger mag. Wir hatten das leider verabsäumt. 

Nichtsdestotrotz war es ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt, da die Lage des Hotels, das Personal (v.a. der Line Out Bar) und das Restaurant großartig waren.",4,2015,05,26
247,Un hotel confortable en Dublín,"Estuvimos alojados en el hotel Sandymount a finales  de Abril hasta el 3 de Mayo, fue un viaje organizado, éramos un grupo de 36 personas. Este hotel esta situado en una zona residencial a las afueras de Dublín  y a unos  100 metros del Aviva Studium, construido en el 2010. 
La distancia desde el hotel al Trinity College, por ubicarnos en el centro, es de 40 minutos aproximadamente, andando a buen paso, lo hicimos el primer día porque  la mañana salio soleada, con lluvia, ni nos lo planteamos. 
 Una buena alternativa desde el hotel al centro, es el tren Dart, hay una estación que esta muy cerca del hotel, la de Lansdowne Road Dart Station, a unos 200 metros  y a cinco minutos andando.
Para los que no controlamos muy bien el idioma ingles, existen a parte del personal de la estación, unas máquinas muy sencillas de manejar, donde puedes sacar los billetes ida i vuelta desde esta estación a Pearse Station. Son dos paradas y en 5 minutos estas en Pearse, esta estación esta muy cerca del centro a cinco minutos del Trinity College, Temple Bar, O´connell Street, Grafton. El billete de ida y vuelta, creo recordar costaba sobre 3.75 euros.
Lo primero que nos llamo la atención del hotel, son sus pasillos laberítincos para llegar a la habitación. La habitación era amplia, limpia, luminosa y confortable y nuestras ventanas daban al jardín. La cama era muy aceptable. El desayuno variado, zumos, bollería y condimentos suficientes como para montarte tu propio Irish breakfast. 
El hotel cuenta con una cafetería comedor, en la que puedes perfectamente comer o cenar, los precios están a nivel de lo que  encontramos en Dublín, un poco caros.
El personal de recepción muy amable y atento, en todo momento intentaron ayudarnos,  a pesar del ingles regular con el que nos manejábamos, quizás la única pega, es que nadie de recepción pudiera entendernos en español.
En términos generales, nuestra estancia de cinco días fue positiva. 
A titulo personal, si contáis con medio particular de transporte, el hotel es el ideal en todos los sentidos, incluso para aparcar. Si tenéis que moveros por vuestros medios, es mejor localizar un hotel en el centro, ya que Dublín se puede visitar perfectamente andando, y debido a la climatología cambiante, algunos días nos hubiera apetecido volver un rato al hotel y más tarde seguir investigando. Por no coger otra vez el tren, o darnos un pateo bajo la lluvia, volvíamos por la noche. Muy importante, creo recordar, que el último tren desde centro al hotel es a las 23.35 horas, las alternativas o pateo o taxi sobre 14 euros.",4,2015,05,18
247,No me convence,"Sandymount Hotel es un hotel grande.  Lo ves por fuera y te esperas otra cosa muy diferente a lo que en realidad es.
Los pasillos son un poco laberínticos y las paredes son como papel, se escucha todo, así que la calidad del descanso no es especialmente buena.
La habitación era bastante pequeña y no especialmente limpia. No es que estuviese sucia como tal, pero no tuve esa sensación de limpieza y pulcritud que he tenido en otros hoteles. Y desde luego, cualquier parecido con las fotos que había visto cuando contraté el hotel era pura casualidad.
El cuarto de baño necesita una reforma urgente... A poder ser, en la próxima, que limpien las gotas de pintura de la grifería y que aislen mejor las ventanas, porque se colaba una brisilla nada agradable con el día lluvioso que nos tocó.
La señal de la WiFi un poco débil, pero suficiente.
La verdad es que pagar 288 euros por tres noches en este hotel, no me parece que esté en equilibrio con la calidad que ofrecen.
Eso sí, la estación de tren a cinco minutos escasos andando... Pero nos sirvió de poco porque estaban en obras y no había servicio.",3,2015,05,11
247,Toller Übernachtsmöglichkeit in Dublin,"Sehr gute Hotel in der Nähe der Innenstadt. Nur zwei Stationen mit der Bahn bis zum Zentrum - auch in laufweite vom Hotel gibt es gute Möglichkeiten zum Essen und Trinken (ca. 1. km). Hier sind die Lokale von mehr Einheimischen besucht als in Temple Bar. Der Service ist sehr gut - zu allen Fragen haben wir umfassende und freundliche Antworten erhalten. 
Die Zimmer sind großzügig  gestaltet - aus unserer Sicht. An der Bar haben wir etwas gegessen und getrunken - auch hier war der Service super und die Preise hielten sich im Rahmen. 
Das Frühstück ist sehr reichhaltig und bietet neben Full Irish auch Wurst und Käse als Alternativen. Gerade im Vergleich mit anderen Hotels auf unserer Reise war das Frühstück ausgezeichnet.
Parken ist im Übernachtungspreis mit inbegriffen.",5,2015,05,09
247,Bell'ambiente..,"Bell'ambiente, anche se un po' fuorimano; bella camera, pulizia impeccabile, personale disponibile ma, grossa pecca, nessuno che parli la nostra lingua anche se nei tre giorni in cui siamo stati ospitati c'era una grossa presenza di Italiani.
Una lamentela: nonostante ciò che è scritto sul sito internet dell'hotel, nessuno ha risposto ad una mia mail con la quale chiedevo indicazioni per giungere a destinazione con i mezzi pubblici.
Comunque il soggiorno è stato piacevole e la colazione varia ed abbondante.",4,2015,04,20
247,El peor hotel,"Puede que sea una opción buena para los que estén interesados en ir al Aviva Stadium pero si no es así es horrible. La habitación que me dieron tenía los muebles rotos, la puerta del baño con huellas de dedos, la cortina con moho y la bañera con desconchones. Las vistas a una escalera oxidada. En la carta del restaurante ni un plato de pescado, poco variada y la atención bastante regular. El peor hotel que conozco, tiene tres estrellas pero le sobran dos",1,2015,04,06
247,Super Hotel,"Das Sandymount liegt im Vorort von Dublin direkt bei dem Aviva Stadium. 
Wir wählten dieses Hotel mit einer großen Gruppe (ca. 50 Personen). Bei der Ankunft lief alles reibungslos, die Karten für die Zimmer wurden schnell verteilt. Ich hatte mit meinem Partner zusammen ein Doppelzimmer, welches von der Größe her für uns völlig ausreichte. Es war sehr sauber, was wir nicht so mochten, war der Teppichboden. Das sei in Irland aber üblich. Das Zimmer war ein wenig hellhörig, was aber nicht weiter störte, da die anderen Hotelgäste sich ruhig verhalten hatten. 
Schon fast ein wenig lustig fanden wir das Wirr Warr aus Gängen und Nischen, welches uns an ein Labyrinth erinnerte. Aber zum Glück gibt es ""Wegweiser"" für die Zimmernummern.
Wenn man in die Innenstadt möchte, kann man gemütlich die S-Bahn nehmen, die Haltestelle ist nur 5 Gehminuten vom Hotel entfernt. 
Das Frühstücksbuffet war ausreichend. Beim Abendessen konnte man bei Vorspeise, Hauptspeise und Nachspeise jeweils zwischen zwei Gerichten wählen. Jeder Gang wurde sehr schnell serviert.
Besonders zu erwähnen ist ein Abend, bei dem wir mit der Gruppe kein Abendessen gebucht hatten. Da ein Teil der Gruppe (ca. 25 Personen) spontan entschied abends doch ins Hotel zurückzufahren, zauberte uns hungrigen Mäuler das Personal um 21:00 Uhr ein leckeres Abendessen, obwohl der Koch eigentlich frei hatte und die Küche bereits Feierabend. Das war wirklich eine wahnsinnig tolle spontane Reaktion und ein Musterbeispiel für Gastfreundschaft.",5,2015,04,05
247,muy buena lugar,"Un lugar maravilloso para visitar después de un viaje a Aviva Stadium. Tuvimos un muy buen almuerzo con mi familia el servicio y la comida era excelente. No hemos tenido la oportunidad de estar allí, pero se lo recomendaría, ya que es muy céntrico y tiene todas las comodidades que se esperan.",4,2015,03,26
247,Muy buena opción,"Buena opción para visitar Dublín si no quieres alojarte en un albergue y buscas relación calidad-precio. Tranvía a 5min a pie que te lleva al centro en tan solo dos paradas.
Habitaciones amplias y limpias. Personal del hotel muy atento.
Repetiría.",4,2015,03,25
247,Linda infraestructura,"Con mi familia solo fuimos a este hotel por el día para esperar el tour del Aviva Stadium que está prácticamente al lado, decidimos pasar a solamente tomar un te, pero como la atención fue tan buena nos quedamos a comer y esperamos el siguiente tour del estadio. La gente es muy amable y accedieron a mostrarme todas las instalaciones del hotel (estudie hotelera y quería conocer sobre el hotel). Es un gran hotel que hay que ir si lo que buscas es cercanía a la ciudad y relajo después de largo día recorriendo Dublín.",4,2015,03,12
247,"Gutes, ruhig gelegenes Hotel mit freundlichem Service","Das Hotel liegt in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße des Stadtteils Ballsbridge (gutes Wohnviertel), nahe der Bahnstation Lansdowne Road (DART). Die Zimmer verteilen sich auf vier Gebäude, alles ist etwas verschachtelt. Die Zimmer sind modern ausgestattet und vergleichsweise großzügig von der Größe her (kein Vergleich zu den Absteigen in London, die auch noch deutlich teurer sind...), allerdings teilweise etwas hellhörig (Nachbarzimmer), was aber während der Nacht kein Problem darstellte. Das Frühstück wird in einem großen, angenehmen Frühstücksraum mit Gartenblick serviert (Buffetauswahl war gut und ausreichend). Das Personal, v.a. an der Rezeption, war sehr hilfsbereit. Ich würde das Hotel wieder buchen (hatte diesmal ein günstiges saisonales Sonderangebot mit ÜF).",4,2015,03,03
247,Buena relación calidad-precio para un fin de semana en Dublín,"El hotel cumplió con nuestras expectativas. Habitaciones limpias y calentitas (en enero y en Dublín se agradece), camas ultraconfortables, personal agradable, cosas de aseo (gel, champú y jabón) y cosillas para acompañar un desayuno dentro de la habitación (kettle + té, leche y café). El WiFi funciona regular tirando a mal (a nuestra habitación no llegaba la señal con demasiada intensidad), pero tampoco importa mucho si no es un viaje de negocios. Tampoco viene mal desconectar. El hotel no está en el centro de Dublín (como puede verse en cualquier mapa), pero está a 20 minutos andando de la zona más turística y hay una parada de DART (Cercanías) a 4 minutos a pie desde la entrada del hotel. En dos paradas te deja en pleno centro (precio del billete sencillo: 2,15 €). En fin. Poco más que añadir. Si regresáramos algún día a Dublín, repetiríamos. :)",5,2015,01,23
247,Carino ,Sono stata in questo hotel per una settimana  in occasione del capodanno...Molto bello e pulito. Non proprio in zona centrale ma a pochi metri dall aviva stadium e vicinissimo alla fermata della dart con cui raggiungere il centro di dublino,4,2015,01,16
247,un gran hotel muy cerquita en tren,"Es un hotel muy bueno, gran relación calidad - precio. Está muy cerquita del tren, a sólo 2 paradas de tara station (centro de Dublin).
La habitación es muy amplia y la cama muy cómoda. 
Tienes una tetera para calentar agua con té o café. 
El desayuno me pareció muy caro (12€) pero como no lo tomamos no puedo opinar si merece la pena.",5,2014,12,01
247,C'è certamente di meglio,"Hotel grazioso, situato abbastanza distante dal centro, ma nei pressi della stazione in cui passa il treno per il centro città, unica pecca che il treno passa di rado, tipo ogni 20 minuti. Le camere ampie ed eleganti, il bagno invece un po' obsoleto e trascurato. La nostra camera nello specifico era situata nel seminterrato dunque la posizione non era delle migliori.Ogni giorno veniva servita la tipica colazione irlandese, ricca e gustosa, anche se, per chi non mangia salato di prima mattina la scelta era piuttosto ridotta, soltanto toast con marmellata.",3,2014,10,13
247,Furchtbar!!!,"Im Vorort von Dublin liegt dieses ""Hotel"". Das einzig Positive ist, dass man sich praktisch nicht verlaufen kann, um nach Dublin zu gelangen. Denn es geht nur geradeaus. Die Zimmer sind nach einem Labyrinth nach einiger Zeit zu finden. Katastrophal war das Bad. Die Toilettenspülung hatte man praktisch in der Hand. Außerdem war es viel zu klein, es war auch kein Toilettenpapier vorhanden! Die Toilette war praktisch an die Badewanne angebaut, so konnte man nicht mal richtig darauf ""Platz nehmen"". Das Fenster im Zimmer bekommt man nicht auf, es ist sehr laut gewesen und nicht sauber. Viel zu kleines Zimmer. Nicht mal der Frühstücksraum war sauber. Auf den Stühlen konnte man noch das Essen der letzten Tage oder Gäste? sehen. Absolut kein Drei-Sterne-Hotel. Nicht zu empfehlen!!!",1,2014,10,06
247,Hübsches Hotel,"Dieses Hotel hat mir schon von aussen besonders gut gefallen. Die Zimmer waren wieder nicht so leicht zu finden, aber wenn man den Weg ein paar Mal gegangen ist, geht das schon.
Besonders fiel mir der Service auf, dass die Koffer in die Eingangshalle gebracht wurden und sofort jemand hilfreich zur Stelle war.
Ein sauberes Hotel mit schönen Zimmern, gutem Essen, freundlicher Bedienung. 
Ich konnte nicht klagen. Jederzeit gerne wieder ;-)",4,2014,09,27
247,Super nettes Hotelpersonal!!!!!,"Sehr schönes Hotel mit ausgezeichnetem Service! Nachdem unser Flug aufgrund eines Lufthansa-Streiks gestrichen wurde, haben uns die netten Damen der Rezeption sofort weitergeholfen und unseren Flug umgebucht! Vielen Dank nochmal dafür!!!,",5,2014,09,04
247,Proprio di fronte allo stadio Aviva,"A due fermate di trenino dal centro, parti comuni molto curate, postazione pc. Servizio al tavolo attento e sempre cordiale, ottima cucina.Non altrettanto disponibili alla reception. Moquette del corridoio e della stanza che imploravano disperatamente pietà! Camera x tre dove appena ci si stava in due . Sul pavimento in camera abbiamo trovato un 5 pence, un cent, un foglio di protezione per assorbenti! Bagno piccolo (CON BIDET)  risalente al dopoguerra. La cosa più spettacolare sono i panni sporchi e le lenzuola da cambiate (pulite) messe per terra davanti allo sgabuzino di servizio (photo aviable!) mattina e sera!",2,2014,09,03
247,Caro y en mal estado,"Hemos estado en este hotel durante nuestras vacaciones en Irlanda en Agosto. Me pareció un hotel muy caro para lo que realmente ofrece. Pagamos 230€ por una habitación (sin desayuno) y el lavabo estaba en un estado pesimo. Muy dejado y con las baldosas rotas.

Lo mejor la ubicación. Buen barrio y cerca del tren para ir al centro de Dublin.
No es recomendable.",2,2014,09,03
247,Elegante,"Ho dormito in questo albergo per una sola notte nell'ambito di un tour in Irlanda.pertanto non conosco le tariffe e non posso esprimere un giudizio sul rapporto qualità prezzo.la mia esperienza è stata decisamente positiva in quanto trattasi di una elegante e pulita struttura facilmente raggiungibile sia dall'aeroporto che dal centro di Dublino.quest'ultimo si raggiunge dall'albergo in 5 minuti di Dart, un trenino verde la cui stazione è a circa 200 ml dalla struttura.l'hotel dispone di un parcheggio interno.la colazione è ottima e abbondante sia per gli amanti del dolce che del salato.il personale è gentile e disponibile forse leggermente più distaccato di quello degli hotel che ho incontrato nei vari paesetti irlandesi.",4,2014,08,28
247,"Ottimo, nulla di più.","Hotel che si trova in un ottima posizioneper raggiungere Dublino e a pochi passi dall'Aviva Stadium. Offre una reception aperta 24/24, c'è un salone per trascorre re del tempo in Relax, e c'è una stanza con cui ci si può connettere a dei computer con la possibilità di stampare anche dei documenti. La rete Wifi copre l'intero Hotel, e l'Hotel offre anche altri servizi tra cui quello di lavanderia. La colazione è abbondante e c'è di tutto e di più, ed anche pranzo e cena sono buoni, considerando che i cibi e tutto sono completamenti diversi da qui. Le stanze sono spaziose e pulite, e ogni giorno viene effettuato cambio di asciugamani e di coperte. Consigliato a tutti.",5,2014,08,16
247,Sehr guter Service,"Wir waren 2 Nächte in diesem Hotel, was nicht leicht zu finden war. Es liegt in eine kleinen Seitenstraße, dadurch ist es sehr ruhig.  Die Dart-Bahn ist in 10 Minuten erreichbar, sodass man schnell in der Innenstadt ist. Das Hotel wirkt auf den ersten Blick gepflegt, allerdings sind einige Dinge schon sehr alt und dadurch auch nicht mehr schön, z.B. die Teppiche in der Fluren. Das Bad war zweckmäßig eingerichtet, es war alles da, was man so braucht- allerdings ist der Raum klein und nicht einladend. Die Betten waren sehr gut. Das Restaurant hat eine ordentliche Karte, sodass man nicht wegfahren muss, um eine Abendessen zu erhalten.",4,2014,07,17
247,Eigentlich gut wenn nicht..,"Wir waren mit einem befreundeten Ehepaar  Tage in diesem ruhig gelegenen Hotel untergebracht. Das Hotel besteht aus verschiedenen Objekten und ist sehr verwinkelt. Über Flure und Treppen findet man zu seinem Zimmer, welches nicht gerade üppig ausgestattet ist. Leider ging der Auszug am zweiten Tag kaputt und es war für gehbehinderte Gäste schon etwas anstrengend zu den Zimmern zu kommen. Das Frühstück war immer das gleiche, Abwechslung war nicht angesagt. Vielleicht könnte man es Aufschnitt und Käse einführen, da es nicht jedermann Geschmack ist morgens warme Wurst zu verspeisen. Das frische Obst bestand aus Äpfeln, Bananen und ab und zu Pflaumen. Beerenfrüchte waren nicht angesagt.
Leider ist uns bei der online Buchung ein Fehler passiert der dazu führte dass wir für zwei Paare drei Zimmer hatten und auch bezahlen mussten, obwohl das Hotel ausgebucht war. Ein Entgegenkommen war hier nicht zu verzeichnen, die Buchungsbedingungen sehen dies nicht vor.
Das Bedienungspersonal war zwar freundlich und hilfsbereit, es hatte aber den berühmten ""Durchblick"", man musste oftmals mit der Hand winken um auf leere Gläser oder Tassen aufmerksam zu machen. Vielleicht könnte hier eine gewisse Schulung helfen.
Sauberkeit war gegeben.",3,2014,07,14
247,personale cortese,"ho soggiornato in questo hotel due notti,il personale molto cortese e attento alle nostre esigenze anche nelle informazioni che abbiamo chiesto essendo la prima volta a Dublino.Hotel e' situato a 150 metri dallo stadio Aviva e 200 metri dalla stazione,che in due fermate ti porta in centro per quello comodissimo quartiere molto tranquillo,abbiamo usufruito anche del ristorante all'interno del hotel ed e' stata una piacevole sorpresa cibo  e servizio e ottimo anche la spesa 43 euro in 3..
L'unica cosa negativa e' stata la stanza situata al prima piano la cui finestra dava sul parcheggio interno dell'hotel quindi risultava un po' rumorosa..",4,2014,07,08
247,Zimmer sehr unterschiedlich,"Ich war mit einer kleinen Gruppe unterwegs. Die meisten von uns bekamen ein winziges Zimmer mit noch winzigerem Bad. Meines lag noch dazu in der Durchfahrt zum Parkplatz, so dass ich noch nicht mal wirklich Tageslicht hatte und auf eine Wand schaute. Daher war es auch recht ungemütlich und kalt im Zimmer. Im Bad gibt es keine Heizung.
Von den im Internet gepriesenen ""stylischen"" Zimmer war dieses Zimmer weit entfernt. Da konnte auch das rote Kissen auf dem Bett nichts mehr reissen.
 Das Hotel ist extrem hellhörig, man bekommt alles mit, was die Nachbarn neben oder über einem machen. So ist an durch-oder ausschlafen gar nicht zu denken. Mein Zimmer, obwohl schon als Einzelzimmer sehr klein, sollte offenbar auch als Doppelzimmer herhalten, da 2 Tassen und Zahnputzbecher vorhanden waren. Das Bett hatte ca. 140cm Breite, evtl. weniger. Im winzigen Schrank waren ein Bügelbrett und Bügeleisen zu finden, ebenso eine weitere Decke.
Einen Föhn konnte ich nicht finden, der wurde aber nach meiner Reklamation nachgeliefert.
WiFi war im ganzen Hotel kostenlos auf Nachfrage zu bekommen und auch relativ stabil verfügbar.
Das Frühstück war nicht besonders abwechslungsreich, einen Tag war sogar nur Toastbrot dort, keine anderen Brotsorten. Dazu Marmelade, Obst, Cerealien, Joghurt, Spiegeleier und einige warme, irische Wurstsorten.
Die Bar und der Aufenthaltsraum in der Lobby sind recht modern eingerichtet.
Die Kommunikation des Personals im Hotel ist ausbaufähig. Unsere Gruppe umfasste 14 Personen, im Restaurant war für 26 gedeckt. 
Am 2. Morgen sollten wir in der Bar frühstücken, da das Restaurant überfüllt sei. Als wir kamen räumte man in der Bar gerade alles zusammen und wir wurden wieder ins Restaurant geschickt.

Der Eingang zum Hotel liegt ca. 10 Stufen hoch. In unserer Gruppe waren mehrere ältere Damen, keiner der Angestellten versuchte mit den Koffern zu helfen, obwohl mehrere oben in der Lobby standen und unsere Ankunft sahen. Uns wurde auch nicht mitgeteilt, dass es einen Seiteneingang zu ebener Erde gibt, mit direktem Zugang zum Lift.
Allerdings gibt es Zwischengeschosse im Hotel, die nicht mit dem Lift zu erreichen sind.",3,2014,06,18
247,Caro y ruidoso,"Hice la reserva desde internet, en las fotos se mostraban habitaciones muy lindas y como iba en plan de pareja, no me importó que el precio fuese un poco elevado para una sola noche.

La habitación estaba ""bien"", pero por 150€ la noche, espero mucho mas que un simple ""bien"", era bastante básica, adicionalmente en la ducha habían esquinas con moho.

Cuando llega la hora de dormir, te das cuenta que escuchas cada paso que den tanto los de la habitación de arriba como la gente que pase por el pasillo, pues si, bastante molesto para dormir.

Conclusión: si la habitación costara la mitad de lo que cuesta, sería una buena opción.",3,2014,06,10
247,Reception cortese e disponibile ma stanza rumorosa,"Terza volta a Dublino. Siamo stati 2 notti (28 e 29 Maggio). Il personale è stato cortese e disponibile su ogni richiesta. Il problema è stata la stanza, spartana e soprattutto, essendo al piano terra, si sentivano tutti i rumori del pavimento di sopra, e quelli provenienti dal cortile(affacciavamo proprio sui posti auto). Il prezzo è stato effettivamente caro per il tipo di stanza ricevuta. La zona è molto buona, residenziale e attaccata alla Dart, in due fermate(5 minuti) sei al centro di Dublino.",3,2014,06,06
247,Sandymount Hotel Aprile/Maggio 2014,"Ho soggiornato in questo albergo dal 29/04 al 04/05. La mia camera numero 129 era nella zona non fumatori al primo piano. La stanza era abbastanza grande, il bagno era pulito ( non cerà il bidè). Il riascaldamento non è mancato...la notte dormivi bene anche in pantaloncini corti nonostante durante il giorno il tempo non fosse dei migliori. Per quanto riguarda la colazione non so che drivi perche non l'abbiamo mai fatta a causa dell'eccessivo costo. Fanno servizio di prenotazione taxi per e dall'aereoporto, loro ti dicono che costa 24 euro a tratta max 4 persone, però il taxista mi ha chiesto 27 euro ( tratta in notturna).La zona dell'albergo è residenziale, molto tranquilla e la sera dormi e ti riposi senza problemi. A 5 min a piedi c'è la DART stazione Lansdowne. Mentre quando sono arrivata ore  20.30 ho preso all'aereoporto l'AIRCOACH  Route 702: Dublin Airport to Greystones/Bray con fermata Ballsbridge Hotel ( che dista 10/15 minuti a piedi dall'albergo). Vicinissimo all'Aviva Stadium. Quindi alla fine : posizione molto buona,a lbergo buono, servizi idem... non posso di certo lamentarmi. Se dovessi tornare , sicuramente se trovassi un buon prezzo ci ritornerei.",4,2014,05,05
247,"Quarta volta a Dublino, c'è di meglio","Quarta volta a Dublino, sempre in hotel differenti che ci sono stati scelti e pagati, per cui indipendenti dalla nostra decisione. Una volta siamo stati mandati al Four Season, per cui non terrò conto dell'elevata differenza di categoria. Questo hotel mi trova perplessa nell'esprimere un giudizio, soprattutto leggendo di opinioni positivissime. Le note negative sono per me posizione e stanze. Come posizione non è in centro e questo per me non è il massimo, specie per la sera, se dipende da noi scegliamo sempre hotel centrali per comodità, in ogni caso in circa cinque minuti di taxi eravamo in Grafton street, altrimenti a 5 minuti a piedi dall'hotel, c'è il treno che porta alla fermata Tara, centrale, in altri 10 minuti circa. Non è scomodissimo ovviamente, ma si devono comunque prendere taxi o mezzi pubblici. Se invece si va per sport, l'Aviva stadium è proprio accanto quindi è perfetto come posizione in quel senso. La zona è residenziale,molto carina, a piedi si arriva al Sandymoun village con ristoranti, pub, negozietti e il lungomare. Per chi come noi è stato diverse volte a Dublino può essere una valida alternativa, sembra di stare in un paese e non in una capitale. L'hotel è carino ma semplice, un tre stelle secondo me, buona colazione, abbiamo pranzato al ristorante un solo pranzo, non male. La nota dolente per noi è stata la camera, probabilmente ci fosse capitata un'altra stanza la mia recensione avrebbe un punto in più a favore. A vedere le foto ci sono stanze più luminose, classiche con finestrone, la nostra stanza invece era piccolina, fatta a L, con finestrella grande la metà e a piano terra quindi poco luminosa in ogni caso. Infatti non era nel corridoio, ma era sotto la scala, la numero 135. Il bagno classico di piastrelline bianche, con qualche prodotto in omaggio, ma veramente basic. Il letto è morbido e comodo, peccato che sia piccolo, da una piazza e mezza e non il classico matrimoniale, noi che siamo abituati a dormire con molto spazio non riuscivamo a girarci comodamente, inoltre si sentiva ogni singolo rumore, da chi camminava nella stanza sopra alla tv accesa, al chiacchierare...sembrava di averli nella stanza con noi.Forse è dovuto al pavimento di legno, ma si sentiva anche che si coricavano o muovevano a letto, insomma, la mia recensione non è positiva per questi motivi, a meno che avere una camera nel corridoio sia diverso, se sono tutte insonorizzate così male e con pavimenti di legno,per me è impossibile riposare senza tappi per le orecchie. Richiedere una camera all'ultimo piano per assicurarsi di non avere nessuno sulla testa!",3,2013,10,18
247,Buono soprattutto nella posizione!,"Bel quartiere residenziale, molto tranquillo con fermata della dart a 200mt molto comoda con 3€ arrivi in centro.hotel buono e con camere spaziose per gli standard del posto ,eravamo in due ma avevamo una tripla. 
Lati negativi: Ristorante da evitare, cibo non eccelso e servizio scadente. Richiesta una camera non fumatori e data una che puzzava molto di fumo.",3,2013,10,14
247,Völlig ok,"Wir waren für eine Nacht im Sandymount Hotel, da wir eine Rundreise mit dem Auto machten. Das Personal war stets freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wir hatten 2 Singlerooms gebucht, hatten aber je ein Doppel- und ein Einzelbett im Zimmer?! Das Hotel ist sehr ringhörig, ich konnte meine Zimmernachbarn bis um 04:00 in der Früh lachen und reden hören...die Zimmer waren sauber und von der Grösse her tiptop.
Da es nicht sehr zentral gelegen ist, nutzten wir abends und zum shoppen ein Taxi.
Das Frühstück ist ok, aber nicht umwerfend. Das Hotel besitzt eine schöne Bar und ein hübsches Restaurant.
Alles in allem ein gutes Hotel für einen kurzen Aufenthalt in der grandiosen Stadt Dublin!",3,2013,09,30
247,Saubere Zimmer,"Wir starteten unsere Rundreise im Sandymount und beendeten unseren Urlaub auch in diesem.
Dabei war unser erstes Zimmer unten im Keller,dies war sehr klein und hellhörig,sodass wir die Leute im Nachbarzimmer schnarchen hörten.
Die letzen 4Nächte verbrachten wir dagegen in einem geräumigeren Zimmer mit großem Bad.
Leider war die Frühstücksauswahl sehr einseitig,trotz internationalen Publikums.Es gab weder Käse noch andere Sorten an Wurst.Ebenso hätten wir uns eine Karte gewünscht,wo aufgeführt wird,dass man Porridge und Rührei nachordern kann.Dies haben wir nur rausgefunden,da es andere Gäste gemacht haben.
An unserem letzten Abend besuchten wir auch die Bar,welche sehr schön ist.
Der Weg ins Stadtzentrum ist ziemlich weit,wenn man ihn zu Fuß bestreiten möchte(50-60Minuten).Jedoch ist Straßenbahn und Busanbindung auch in der Nähe.",3,2013,09,29
247,Empfehlenswert aber lange nicht Spitze,"Ok ist es alle mal. Die Gänge sind verwinkelt die Fußböden knarzen an vielen Stellen und Spinnen gab es auch als Mitbewohner. Das Frühstück war ok auch die Bar mit den angebotenen Speisen war ok.

La posizione non è proprio centrale.....è vicino allo stadio Aviva, vicino alla fermata DART Lansdowne Road Station (in 5 minuti si è in centro)...l'unico problemino è che l'ultimo treno dal centro è alle 23:30.
WiFi gratuita: bisogna solo farsi dare la password giornaliera.
Collegato bene anche con l'aeroporto: prendendo l'Aircoach (7€ a persona) si arriva a Pembroke RD.....da lì è poco meno di 1 km fattibile a piedi.",4,2013,05,08
247,Buon hotel a costo contenuto,"Prenotato questo hotel tramite Booking.com a un ottimo prezzo, sistemazione senza troppe pretese ma pulito con wifi gratuita, vicino all'Aviva Stadium. Con le offerte che ogni tanto fanno è consigliato.",4,2013,04,29
247,Ottima zona e niente male il cibo,"il quartiere è molto isolato e attorno non c'è granchè da vedere ma nei giorni in cui si gioca all'aviva stadium si respira un'aria magica e anche il Sandymount si organizza per i festeggiamenti. Dista circa 3,5 km dal centro, raggiungibile con il bus o il treno in meno di 10 minuti. Anche la stanza è molto graziosa e il personale molto disponibile;unico difetto la connessione wi-fi prende solo nella hall. Le zuppe sono da leccarsi i baffi e anche le cheesecake sono ottime!",5,2013,04,11
247,HOTEL FAMILIAR,"Buen hotel, para ser un tres estrellas, el desayuno se paga en recepción, esta más que correcto, aunque está alejado del centro,la estación del DART de Lansdowne Road esta a 200 metros y en 10 minutos estas en Connelly, el precio ida y vuelta es de 3.50. Las zonas comunes están muy bien WiFI gratuito, y el personal muy amable, la verdad que fue una estancia muy agradable.",5,2013,04,06
247,"Schönes Hotel, aber ein bisschen laut","Wir besuchten Dublin kurz vor Silvester und für den gezahlten Preis waren wir sehr positiv von dem Hotel angetan. Die Zimmer waren sauber, das Personal freundlich und das Hotel liegt zwar nicht ganz zentral, dafür aber gleich neben einer DART-Station und in der Nähe einiger Restaurants, Pubs und einem Tesco-Markt.
Der einzige Kritikpunkt betrifft die Hellhörigkeit der Zimmer. Zum einen quietschen und knarren die Dielen auf dem Gang doch erheblich, weshalb man ab 7 Uhr morgens häufiger aus dem Schlaf gerissen wird. Zum anderen scheinen auch die Wände zu den anderen Zimmer nicht besonders dick zu sein, denn das Duschen der Nachbarn kann man auch deutlich vernehmen. 
Dennoch ist ein Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel, vor allem die Zimmerpreise bedenkend, eine solide Empfehlung.",4,2013,03,29
247,Ottimo,La posizione non è centralissima ma in un bel quartiere residenziale molto comodo per chi voglia recarsi all'Aviva Stadium o al RDS e comunque ben servito da mezzi pubblici. La struttura è bella così come la camera che mi è stata data. Il personale molto disponibile ad offrire tutte le informazioni richieste. E' inoltre dotato di un ampio parcheggio. Una struttura che mi sento quindi di consigliare anche in considerazione delle tariffe applicate.,4,2012,10,31
247,magnifica dublino,"bellissimo hotel situato a 15 km dall'aereoporto e 3,5 km dal centro e a pochi metri dall'Aviva Stadium e dalla stazione che ti porta al centro in 2 minuti. Servizio ottimo , pulizia dellle camere impeccabile . Super consigliato anche perche quando ci sono le partite all'aviva stadium nell'albergo organizzano il terzo tempo!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2012,10,12
247,Hotel antiguo,"Hotel de 168 habitaciones en una edificación antigua, con mantenimiento evidente, pero habitación con holor a humedad, aunque limpia y bien pintada. El desayuno muy bueno al igual que las áreas comunes.No tiene libre acceso a internet en el lobby, y se debe tomar el tren para llegar al centro histórico. Es ideal para quienes quieran concurrir a algún evento al Aviva Stadium, situado a sólo 100 metros.",3,2012,06,23
247,Nettes Hotel in ruhiger Lage,"Das Hotel ist sehr verwinkelt (offenbar aus mehreren kleinen zusammengefassten Häusern entstanden). Die Zimmer sind in Ordnung und gut gepflegt. Das Frühstück ist für Irland typisch (Bohnen, Speck, Würstel etc) aber auch continental (cereals, Wurst, Käse etc).

Abends hat ein nettes Restaurant und eine gemütliche Bar (Pub) offen.

Es gibt gratis Parkplätze.

Die Lage ist sehr ruhig. Die Innenstadt ist in ca. 20 mim zu Fuss (5 min mit dem Auto/10+ min mit der S-Bahn) zu erreichen.",4,2011,08,07
247,Angenehmes gemütliches Hotel in Dublin,"Ich war bereits mehrere Male beruflich in Sandymount, Dublin, Irland und habe jedesmal im Mt. Herbert übernachtet. Das Hotel ist nichts exorbitantes, aber sehr schön gelegen und hat eine sehr gemütliche Atmosphäre. Das Hotel ist in einem alten Gebäude untergebracht, dementsprechend verwinkelt ist es. Es gibt eine Bar, die Zimmer sind gemütlich und die Lansdowne Road Station für die S-Bahn DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) ist auch nah. Da das Hotel nicht im City Centre ist, hat man keine Probleme, einen Parkplatz zu finden.

Insgesamt eine sehr gemütliche, aber preiswerte Unterkunft.",4,2010,09,21
247,"Teuer, dilettanisch, schmutzig, alt - und dreist","Der gute Eindruck endet kurz hinter der Rezeption -  das Zimmer ist groß, aber muffig, und es hat absolut nichts mit den Fotos auf den Webseiten zu tun. Der Ausblick auf Müllcontainer ist atemberaubend, Küchengeruch ist überall im Hotel, auch im Zimmer. Bei gutem Wetter gibt’s Lärm von draußen, das sind Betrunkene auf der Terrasse. Sauber ist nichts, aber alt. Die Wanne hat einen schimmligen Rand, die Armaturen sind so, wie Billigarmaturen nach ein paar Jahren sind, der Duschvorhang ist uralt und hat Stockflecken. Da das Gebäude sehr alt ist und wohl nie ganz renoviert wurde, ist es äußerst hellhörig. Man bekommt Schritte auf knarrenden Dielen von oben, die Klospülung von nebenan und vieles mehr mit, auch lautes Rufen vom Müllcontainer vor dem Fenster.
Im Restaurant gibt’s morgens pappiges Frühstück für 10 Euro oder ein pappiges, altes irisches Frühstück für 15 Euro. Das Brot ist nicht frisch, der Saft die Billig-Fruchtnektarversion. Auch hier läßt die Sauberkeit zu wünschen übrig. Im Restaurant abends sehr hohe Preise, dafür ein sehr unaufmerksamer, langsamer Service: ein Essen wird nach 30 Minuten serviert, das zweite gar nicht, auf Getränke warteten wir ca. 15 Minuten (das Restaurant war nur halbvoll). Das zweite Essen kam nicht, war aber trotzdem auf der Rechnung und wurde erst nach längerer Diskussion, daß man als Gast ja auch nachfragen könne, von der Rechnung genommen. Der schlechte Service wird noch durch die Trinkgeldautomatik des Kellners getoppt, der ungefragt von sehr hohem Tip ausgeht und nicht mit Wechselgeld wiederkommt. 
Das WLAN – 7 Euro pro Tag – teilt man sich offenbar mit vielen, es reicht gerade mal an alte ISDN-Geschwindigkeit heran.",2,2010,06,07
247,"Bueno, pero alejado","Buen hotel, aunque está alejado del centro. Tiene la estación de tren (DART) de Lansdowne Road a 500 m
Hotel muy tranquilo, con habitaciones espaciosas y comodas",4,2008,04,21
247,Buon Hotel in zona residenziale,"Hotel situato fuori Dublino, nel quartiere residenziale delle ambasciate e quindi molto tranquillo.E' ben servito dalla linea ferroviaria. La stazione, infatti, è a pochi minuti a piedi dall'albergo e si raggiunge il centro di Dublino in circa 15 minuti.  La nostra camera era sul lato posteriore dell'hotel al livello del parcheggio, ma  abbastanza ampia e molto pulita. Dispone di un ristorante con buona cucina, anche se per i nostri gusti un po' troppo ricercata. C'è anche un pub che chiude alle 24.00. La colazione, a buffet, è sia continentale che irlandese. (nel nostro caso non compresa). Purtroppo a noi è capitato di arrivare in sala colazione 20 minuti prima delle 10.00 e di continentale non c'era rimasto molto tranne i corn flakes; poiché per i nostri stomaci la colazione irlandese a base di salsicce, fagioli ecc. era troppo pesante, abbiamo ripiegato su una pasticceria a pochi minuti dall'hotel.
