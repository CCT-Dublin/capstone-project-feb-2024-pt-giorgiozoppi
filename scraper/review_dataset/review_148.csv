148,Always excellent,I have stayed here before a number of times and always excellent. Great location and the staff are always polite and attentive. Minor EV charger issue experienced but excellently dealt with by concierge (Max was excellent) as was the management in dealing with this. Well done. A lovely oasis of class and quality right in the heart of the west end.,5,2024,10,20
148,Best mistake I could have made,"We accidentally stayed here for a night when I messed up our reservations at the Waldorf and I couldn't have been happier. The service was spot on and the ability to find space for 13 of us on the roof terrace for drinks went above and beyond. The view is spectacular and our visiting American friends were suitably impressed. The room was enormous and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Looking forward to returning soon, thank you.  ",5,2023,07,10
148,Great time at ME Hotel,"Thank you for the excellent hospitality from staff Tawii. The reception area was very nice. Once I entered, I was greeted by Tawii which she nicely introduced me of the hotel. I‚Äôve visited lounge and bar which is very pleasant. It was such a great experience and a most restful time while visiting London.",5,2024,10,20
148,Great time at London,"The place is very fantastic. The lounge is very modern with a very warm welcome from the hotel staffs. The RADIO bar is well decorated with a nice London view. I very recommend to visit this place. Most of all, many thanks to Javi and Tawii for such a great hospitality at ME London Hotel.",5,2024,10,20
148,Should have been a better experience,"I stayed at the ME London in early October ‚Äò24 and booked the hotel at the suggestion of friends who were getting married nearby. They assured me that if I joined the ME rewards that my hotel rate would be lower than the rates marketed online and as lowly priced as if they‚Äôd secured a room block. I made my reservation five (5) months before my arrival date. 

On the day of arrival, I checked in at 11:30 AM and was told my room would be secured by 3 PM.  I‚Äôd requested an early check in, but apparently no rooms were available. As the day went on, I checked twice on the status of my room and eventually had to shower and change for a wedding event in a friend‚Äôs room because my room wasn‚Äôt ready. I didn‚Äôt get access to my room until almost 3:30 (hours after many friends arrived and got into their rooms). 

Thankfully, one of the managers, Javier Martinez, made it his mission to improve my stay. He met with me personally to apologize and offered me breakfast and dinner at Radio.  Upon checkout, the hotel wrongly charged me for mini bar items and Javier had the charges reversed. 

The good:  
Max at the concierge desk
Wayne, the bartender at Radio
Javier Martinez, the hotel‚Äôs manager on duty. 

Covenant Garden is a great area!

The bad:
Despite signing up for the membership, getting 200 points, and reserving my room within the required time frame,   having a basic room without breakfast included, I was charged at least $500 more than friends who had the same exact accommodations and booked months later. 

My room wasn‚Äôt cleaned for two days and the third day only because I called down to request service after being away all morning. 

Price check around because to me, the ME wasn‚Äôt worth the $1800 US over three nights that I was charged.",2,2024,10,19
148,Great stay,"The reception team were extremely helpful from when we checked in, all the way to check out. The room was extremely clean, quiet, in a great location and well thought out, including chargers, Dyson hair dryer and a straightener. At check out, max was very helpful, getting us a taxi and helping with our luggage.",5,2024,10,18
148,Favourite London Hotel!,"Such a brilliant stay!! 
We were in London for a night and we had a super time at the ME! The staff go above and beyond there. 
When we arrived we were greeted by the gorgeous Claudia. She was so kind and accommodating, it really made a great start to our stay. 
We had a lovey room upgrade and when we got to the room they had left us a bottle of champagne and with a beautifully hand written card. How lovey is that!! 
As always the ME has the  most comfortable beds and pillows so we were able to have a brilliant sleep after  long day. 
We very much look forward to next trip back!! 
Huge thanks!",5,2024,10,15
148,The most amazing stay,We had the most amazing stay at the ME London. The hotel is perfectly placed for Covent Garden and Theatre Land.  We went to Radio Rooftop in the evening which had a lovely vibe with DJ.  Breakfast was very enjoyable served at Gino d‚Äôcampo restaurant.  Portions large and lots of choice.  We were lucky to get a room upgrade which was fantastic,5,2024,10,15
148,Wedding Anniversary made special.,"A fabulous central hotel with a great atmosphere and modern decor, if a little dark in the corridors leading to the rooms. The quality and variety of the breakfast was great and served by very attentive staff. Same attention to detail was experienced with all staff we met.",5,2024,10,09
148,"Amazing experience, views and location!","Amazing experience! I have been there in the past, but this time it‚Äôs been a remarkable stay. Extremely good location. Very nice room, really special amenities in it. Luxury Rooftop bar (Radio) with a good service and nice drinks menu. I need to give a special comment about one of the employees: Susana Castro. Being at front desk she goes the extra mile (and even beyond!) to make sure everything‚Äôs perfect; helpful making sure that the room was ready, helping me with a reservation at the rooftop, and also helping my colleagues with their room allocation. Thanks for your help!",5,2024,09,23
148,Beautiful time at ME üòç amazing customer service,"Amazing experience with Tawii - so excited to return, she gave us exceptional service and everything with top notch. She also makes amazing cocktails! The atmosphere was amazing and the vibe was welcoming as well as warm. The couch and lounge area was also aesthetically pleasing!",5,2024,09,21
148,Best hotel in London,Best hotel in London! Great location near everything. Easy access to busses and the Tube. Close to everything. The rooms are huge and super comfortable and bathrooms have 2 sinks. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Highly recommend- We will be back.,5,2024,09,20
148,Fantastic experience,"Popped in during a day trip to London. Doorman was very welcoming and even chased us in to give us a voucher for a free drink with a meal. Visited the rooftop bar for cocktails and were treated like VIPs by all the staff.
The all-day menu was superb, but we had already eaten.
Would not hesitate to return.",5,2024,09,20
148,More attention to detail required‚Ä¶,"My wife and I spent a night at the hotel.
Many things were good including our check in, room and dinner at Radio Roof Top. The room was a Extra ME+ Junior Suite which was really well designed, we loved the bathroom with a massive double rainfall shower, a well appointed living room and some of the best audio we‚Äôve heard  in a hotel we were able to easily connect to various speakers built into the ceilings of each room. Nothing but praise for the room. 
What was not so good was.

Requesting certain items to be ironed, informed we would be contacted to confirm timings and then an employee knocking our door to say it couldn‚Äôt be done.

At 6:45am,our door was knocked by a member of the room service team (we did not order).
Upon telling this to the individual, we were told that (abruptly) no mistake was made. Eventually. Said person recognised their error and left. 

Having breakfast at Luciano by Gino D‚ÄôAcampo
- requested medium done poached eggs that arrived raw, highlighting issue and told re-cooked eggs would be provided that were never received. 
 - waiting over 20minutes for coffee
All of the above was communicated to a customer rep who apologised - really made no difference.

Upon check out, we were asked how we viewed our stay. All of the above was stated and consequently our parking fee was removed.",3,2024,09,10
148,Stay was perfect thanks to Tawii!,"I came to stay for my son‚Äôs 4th birthday, although I have stayed in this hotel many times this trip was absolutely fantastic. I emailed ahead of arrival asking if the hotel could arrange a balloon for my son, and Tawii honestly went above and beyond for us! 

The hotel is beautiful, the room was lovely and the lounge area in the room was spacious.

I honestly can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough, the bar on the top floor is lovely although a shame children are not able to use this area on a week day evening. 

Overall excellent stay and a big thank you to Tawii!",5,2024,09,10
148,Amazing staff and great views.,"Amazing view of London. On a sunny day it is the perfect place to go with friends or family. Lovely staff, we had Tawii as our amazing hostess, who took great care of us. Very good service and amazing drink options, the cocktails were delicious.",5,2024,09,08
148,"Lovely rooftop bar, perfect to come to with family or friends. The view is amazing and the drinks are all delicious.","The bar has an amazing view and the cocktails were delicious. They also have lovely wine and beer options. Tawii was our server, she was so nice and took great care of us. Amazing bar to come with your friends to. Would definitely recommend and come again.",5,2024,09,08
148,Great rooftop bar for drinks!,Fantastic view from a rooftop bar. We went just to have drinks but had a great time. The view over the Thames river is fantastic. The drinks aren't cheap but they're well made and Tawii was a lovely host and made us feel very welcome. I would definitely come again.,5,2024,09,08
148,My visit to the rooftop bar,"Great view and lovely drinks and staff, especially Tawii. She was very helpful with getting to the bar and was very nice to us. She helped us very much and was very delightful to be around helping us with our drinks and conversating with us about the day",5,2024,09,08
148,Spectacular views and the warmest welcome!,"Tawi Aura was our host and we were welcomed to the 10th foor personally and greeted with a warm team. The views are simply spectacular, we see the Shard, walki talki and celebrated my beautiful partners birthday in rooftop style ü•Ç. It doesn‚Äôt get better than this and we award 10/10 for the ME team! üéâ‚ú®‚Ä¶",5,2024,09,08
148,A little slice of luxury against a busy London,"Absolutely 5* meal at the rooftop bar. Fantastic setting amazing views only trumped by the outstanding food. Had a sushi feast accompanied by one of the best cocktails I‚Äôve ever had. 

The hotel  was a perfect setting for our pre show lunch and drinks, location is top tier for most theatres and attractions. ME London‚Äôs reception is one of the most breath taking pieces of architecture I‚Äôve seen and adds to the feeling of elegance and luxury that already hits you as you enter the doors. 

Lovely touches throughout the hotel from the beautiful sunflowers at the entrance, eye catching wall art through to the candles dotted all around you really do feel like you have walked into a glamorous sanctuary leaving the hustle and bustle of busy London outside",5,2024,09,05
148,"Great food, great service  and great venue.","It was an absolute pleasure to visit yesterday and have lunch at radio which has such amazing views of London. 

The food and service was faultless, and i am very glad that this was where myself and friends decided to go before our show. 

It was primarily picked for location as it is situated close to the theatre. I would highly recommend and intend to go back and stay there.",5,2024,09,05
148,Check Your Credit Card for Double Charges,Double Charge for room. Its a disgrace this hotel they charged twice for the room. Trying to get the money back it a nightmare. Try calling the hotel and nobody answers. When they do they promise to call you back and do not. Just called again today and reception put the phone down. Its a disgrace I am a loyalty member will not stay here again......,1,2024,08,23
148,The ME is where it‚Äôs at in London,"The ME is glamorous and fun just like us, so it was a perfect fit! It‚Äôs right in the middle of where you want to be.
We saw Taylor Swift while we were here and even got friendship bracelets from Vanessa, our fellow Swiftie working at the hotel. She was so wonderful to us. We felt like we were staying with friends.
Can recommend!",5,2024,08,19
148,Best hotel in Convent Garden. Will stay here every time I‚Äôm in London.,"Very well located in the heart of Convent Garden, close to all the theatre‚Äôs, vast amount of great restaurants, shops and public transportation. The hostel itself has on the the coolest hotel‚Äôs lobbies I‚Äôve ever seen, the rooms is fantastic with all nice to have amenities like steamer, Dyson hairdryer, ambient light with preset mood, ability to cast you own music on the room sound system, spacious bathroom with double showers and a super comfortable king bed. And the best part of it all is the staff. I can‚Äôt recommend the hotel enough because of them. Everyone is so attentive and friendly and it made the stay even more enjoyable! Oh don‚Äôt miss out on the Radio rooftop that has a great sunset vibe with DJ with a 360 view of London and amazing modern Asian food!",5,2024,08,19
148,Love it,"Went to Radio City and Sol looked after us we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a friendlier lovely young lady to look after us üòÉ
Lovely place and we stayed here‚Ä¶magic. Great food and surprising good value for money for the location. If you want a good day/night here is recommended",5,2024,08,17
148,Lovely experience,"Tawii was such a warm and lovely welcome! The atrium was gorgeous and it‚Äôs such a beautiful place to have a drink.  Thank you so much for a great birthday for my mum. 

We are so thankful. The champagne was amazing and we had such a warm welcome from your kind staff.

Tawii - our star!",5,2024,08,15
148,a great stay,"The stay has been incredible, the best thing about the hotel is the staff, they welcomed us at the reception with a glass of champagne and the concierge was very helpful with everything. We went to Lucianos and the food was delicious. we met Claudia, the duty manager, because we had a problem with the air conditioning in the room but she solved everything very quickly, she was brilliant. We can't wait to return soon, thank you guys",5,2024,08,12
148,Birthday weekend ,"Fabulous hotel experience from walking in to walking out, the staff were amazing , especially Tawii, she went above and beyond to see to all our needs and make our stay perfect , we were celebrating a birthday,  we got balloons in the room, bithday cake snd champagne,  wonderful, we have already recommended the hotel to friends ",5,2024,08,12
148,Worth a visit x,"Tawii was amazing!! gorgeous vibes and everything was perfect!! definitely worth a visitüòçüòçüòçü´∂üèΩ 
Clean space & drinks were also amazing could not fault the experience ‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂üèΩ Food is also worth a visit in STK! gorgeous steak and amazing atmosphere x",5,2024,08,10
148,Super friendly staff and in a central location,"The staff was super helpful and always so friendly.  We loved the lobby, the hallways and our room were great.  We especially liked Viktor, the concierge, and Ivan, the door man who gave us fantastic recommendations and couldn't have been nicer.  The ME London is in a great location as well.",5,2024,08,03
148,"In 20 years of traveling the world, this was one of the best hotels I‚Äôve stayed  in!","I‚Äôll start with saying I booked and cancelled and rebooked about 10 hotels for my 3 day weekend stay in London this past July. I used to live in the city for 6 years, so I knew the location I wanted but couldn‚Äôt narrow down the level of perfection I wanted. I even booked ME once in the process, then cancelled because I couldn‚Äôt decide on the room. We finally booked the Beyond Me+ Suite Panoramic City View. Before getting to the room, I‚Äôd like to explain how the location is perfect with every London icon in each direction walkable in less than 15 minutes. Tower Bridge and Tower of London are the furthest at a 40 minute walk, but just a quick tube or taxi ride away. Walking into the hotel, we were blown away. The ‚Äúlobby‚Äù had amazing lounge seating everywhere and a swanky bar as well as STK restaurant. The check in was an elevator ride up with the coolest lounge ever with floor to ceiling projections (and when I say ceiling I mean up to the top of the hotel). We were greeted with a choice of 2 cocktails (sparkling wine or a signature concoction that was delicious). Check in was very quick and then we were shown up to our incredible room. We had a bottle of champagne waiting for us in the room with a delicious dessert. As stated above we booked the Beyond Me+ Suite with city view. The room was massive. The sitting room had a couch, tv, coffee table, and sit down table with a view of the strand. On the shelving we had tons of glasses, an espresso machine, and an assortment of snacks. There was also a get ready area with a 24 inch makeup mirror and the best part: a DYSON hair dryer. This room also had a closet and its own toilet & sink only bathroom. Outside the room was a long corridor to the master amenities. The room had a massive bathtub and large shower on one side and across the hall, the other toilet and joint master get ready area (2 sinks), and an extended area for doing makeup, including a box of amenities that was refilled every day. The chapstick is incredible. Finally, the bedroom. The maaaassive bed was one of the most comfy we slept in. I even inquired after our stay on what the bedding used was because I want to buy it for home. We also had more closet space, more snacks, nightstands on both sides with built in charging cords for all types of plugs. All the lighting was from a digital pad next to the bed, where you also controlled the AC. The tv was massive and made for a mini comfy movie theater before bed. The first night we had dinner at STK and the service there too was absolutely incredible. Finding good service in London is always hard to come by , and I feel awful I forgot our servers name, but he went above and beyond. We had just gotten engaged in the stop prior to London and he brought us a special dessert and was just all around attentive, kind, and excellent at the actual serving, remembering everything. Thank you! I hope we can definitely return back to the hotel soon!",5,2024,08,03
148,Never ever,"Dirty, smells so bad, all furniture also so used I couldn‚Äôt even sit, lie down or walk without shoes.  Bathtub so dirty it‚Äôs even unwashable. 
Cigarettes under the mattress. This hotel became like hostel for homeless people. Had to cancel my stay after couple of nights as I couldn‚Äôt even sleep there because of loud music from the rooftop bar.",1,2024,07,22
148,Concierge,"I am not usually a reviewer, but I must say that the concierge staff was fantastic, particularly Victor who was able to get us into restaurants at the last minute. Being able to have a top-notch concierge is a valuable asset to any hotel, as I travel a lot. Well done to Me hotel.",5,2024,07,21
148,"Beautiful, sophisticated hotel","Absolutely stunning hotel - attention to detail is second to none. My husband and I were made to feel incredibly welcome with every interaction with the wonderful stuff. The hotel is spotless, beautifully decorated and smells divine. The rooftop bar is definitely worth a visit, with a great drinks choice and nibbles. We will be back!",5,2024,07,15
148,The Perfect Base for London,"As someone who travels a lot for work, I don‚Äôt normally write reviews for hotels. However, having stayed at the Me London regularly over the past year on business, this hotel has quickly also become my base of choice when in London with friends and family. 

The hotel is modern with fantastic amenities and is perfectly located to make the most of London while travelling for work or leisure. The rooms are spacious and there are great places both in the hotel and only minutes away for dinner and drinks.  

In the hotel, Radio Rooftop (which was being refurbished during my last trip) is great for a relaxing drink on a sunny evening, Marconi lounge is a great space to work by day and often has a DJ at night and STK has a great lively vibe for dinner and drinks with friends. 

Although other properties nearby offer similar standards of presentation and amenities, I have been blown away by how welcoming the staff have been, and the level of personal service that is often forgotten in this style of hotel, with special recognition to Claudia and Tawii. 

On my first trip, Tawii from the Aura team kindly showed me around the hotel and explained that the theme is Yin and Yang and the contrast of light and dark, which has been executed with great attention to detail. Tawii has remembered me every time I‚Äôve visited which has made the hotel feel very welcoming and she has offered fantastic recommendations and places to see. 

Claudia from reception has also always been very welcoming and warm. She is always in fantastic spirits and remembers me on every visit, greeting both myself and my guests by name. On the very rare occasion something has gone wrong, Claudia has truly gone above and beyond to make sure any questions or issues are resolved immediately and has provided service that sets Me apart from other similar hotels in the area. 

Thanks to Claudia, Tawii and the staff at Me Hotel-  I look forward to my next stay!",5,2024,07,15
148,The staff that makes you feel at home.  I,"I went with one friend and and unknown person,  we were not having a good communication with all the parties involved.   So when we got to the hotel things got real bad.  So I didn‚Äôt know what else to do but Rhoddy Maria, Vanessa Denis and all the staff I need it anything.  They made me feel at home. Very safe and secure they went above and beyond to make sure the problem was resolved.  I end my trip in London solo, but I did so much and as much as I could do I. 5 days.  Exactly what I need it.   I give than a 10 in everything. 
Vanessa went beyond to help me with my traveling.",5,2024,07,08
148,From Tears to Cheers!!,"An 11hr flight delay & missed connection is how I began this trip! After speaking with Claudia, the shift leader at the ME Hotel I could finally exhale a bit. Their system has us as a no-show even though I had emailed the hotel but Claudia quickly took charge and made things right?

When we finally arrived she had a 30th anniversary balloon, champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert waiting for us along with a hand written note from her.  She went above and beyond which brought a smile to my face and warmed my heart. She showed up shortly after we checked in and upon seeing me she greeted me with a big hug....which was welcomed and needed.

She wasn't working when we checked out but once again she went the extra mile by leaving a gift bag and another hand written note wishing us well as we headed back to the US. 

Claudia's efforts and the rest of the ME staff really lifted our spirits and changed the entire trajectory of our first time in Europe!  Thank you!
Shaniqua and Brian",5,2024,07,04
148,Perfect stay in London,Everything was really nice in Me London. We had a suite and enjoyed the Aura service. The furnishings and the view from the suite were indescribably good. The Our concierge Javier from the Aura team was welcoming us very warmly with his manager Matteo. Clear recommendation üòä,5,2024,07,02
148,The hallways are scary and completely dark.,"It was centrally located to many attractions but the hotel itself is over priced and not what we would recommend. The staff were generally nice but I found many to be condescending and unwelcoming. I will say they provided me with a lovely bottle of wine for my birthday and I really appreciated that. 
I phoned and thanked them as soon as I received it. 
I think the worst part of the hotel is the hallways. Perhaps they feel it‚Äôs modern and funky   to walk in utter darkness but it is not!  It‚Äôs dangerous, unpleasant, disorienting and quite frankly a little scary. My vision is excellent and I found it 
hard to navigate with nothing but a few ‚Äúnight lights‚Äù spaced 20 feet apart. The real surprise is they haven‚Äôt been sued yet or that their insurance allows for this.  This is a huge issue and I suggest if you are vision impaired  - DO NOT stay here. And if you have excellent night vision I would still suggest bringing night googles or ask for a guide. I would not advise single woman to stay here.",3,2024,07,01
148,Amazing Experience!,"I'm a Melia brand enthusiast after this visit!  First, I cannot say enough positive things about Susana on the reception team--she absolutely saved our vacation and went above-and-beyond to make our trip easier and memorable!!!  Try to connect with her if you can, as she was incredibly helpful and kind!  

Second, this hotel is just so cool.  From the moment you enter the lobby and go up to the reception area, the vibe is sleek and modern.  The glass of Cava upon check-in was very welcome after the stress of travel, and everything that you could possibly need was handled seamlessly thereafter.  The rooms were lovely and made travel easier--there was a Dyson hair dryer, cords available on the bedside table to plug in your phone without any adapter, turn down service, etc.  The showers were great and had the best water pressure that we had throughout our trip.  Breakfast was also very good.

In general, we had an impeccable experience, and this is in line with our experience at a Melia property we stayed at previously in Rome.  However, the amazing service that Susana provided and the wonderful amenities has sold us on this brand for our European travel!",5,2024,06,24
148,Best hotel by far! Thank you Tawii and Luca,"Me and my husband are both very fussy when it comes to the hotels we stay in. We go for weekends away every couple of months and have stayed in many hotels. This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in. From the minute we stepped in to the minute we left everything impeccable. Stunning rooms, delicious food, excellent and very professional staff. We were looked after by Luca and Tawii who were so kind, helpful and really went the extra mile to ensure our stay was  flawless. Thank you so much we we‚Äôll be returning soon!",5,2024,06,23
148,Can‚Äôt recommend this hotel more highly!!,"Working as a tour leader, I had an emergency where the hotel across the street could not accommodate a family of four and we had to
move them to the ME. I could not believe the level of service, of listening, and executing my requests for our guests who were in an awkward situation. The concierge, front desk,and management rallied to make a very special time for our guests. In particular, Susana made the stress melt away. I felt heard and she delivered on every request, or at least made every effort to accommodate my requests. Without question they met our guest recovery needs and even followed up with our guests who had had problems with a different hotel. The ME knew that our guests needed to have a wonderful time. With two young children in tow, they arrived to their new room with cake and champagne and the guests could leave their troubles behind. I wish we used this hotel as part of our tour, if only to work with a much friendlier and knowledgeable staff than the ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù hotel we use now. Keep it up Melia group. I want to stay with you when I come back for leisure. Beautiful hotel. Beautiful experience!",5,2024,06,22
148,5 star,"Really good service from Luca Taxii today
Really helpful 
Loved spending time here and had a great time

148,Staff are great LUCA and TAWII,The staff are the best I‚Äôve ever met. Especially LUCA and TAWII. They were very helpful and great at showing around the hotel and checking in. STK was a great bar experience with good music and great atmosphere.  The drinks are great as well!!!,5,2024,06,22
148,Very friendly staff ! Tawii and Luca,"Enjoyed my stay here. And was comforted by the lovely staff. Especially Tawii and Luca who were very friendly and helpful  
It was easy to check in, and they showed us what was near the hotel and where to visit 
It was lovely to stay here and we will stay again",5,2024,06,22
148,Excellent stay - shame it was just overnight,"Excellent hotel in a fantastic location and just a shame it was just an overnight stay, but room was nice and large with loads of technology and teh staff couldn't have been more helpful - just one minor issue in that I checked in online and not once did it say please bring photo id (ie passport/drivers license).  Living in the UK and with a UK passport I didnt even think I would need this and never have been asked for this before in a UK hotel.  The only thing I need to find now is that amazing smell they use throughout the hotel - which I believe is a signature smell!",5,2024,06,20
148,Promises the world but just doesn't deliver,"I booked direct with Melia and found the pre-arrival customer service to be non-existent, the website is all gloss but no useful content or information, phone calls not answered and e-mails not promptly responded to and when they did they didn't answer what was asked, just upselling opportunities. When I made the booking directly the website makes a big fuss of the roof top terrace not once did it say that it wouldn't be open during my stay, its loss was a major reason I booked the hotel but despite pointing this out and complaining to the hotel they never acknowledged this. During my stay they knew I wasn't happy and made no effort to rectify my issues nor provide any super customer experience as they promised, only on my return did I receive an e-mail promising an undisclosed discounted rate in the future but i'm a bit fed up of them promising everything and delivering nothing. 

The rooms are spacious, facilities good in typical Melia style and quiet and food offering good quality. The corridors however are in darkness with just accent lighting over certain items, this is very disorientating and out of the darkness staff in black custom suddenly appear and disappear the same faces not doing anything but hanging about, very creepy, does the hotel have security problems as I see no need for this, they should have them answering their telephones. I tackled one of them about this saying it wasn't right that a man was lurking around in the dark, he was replaced by a woman. The entrance of the hotel often had up to 5 members of staff just there when I returned which I found uncomfortable, the area however seemed safe and a good choice to me.

The staff are abrupt and lacking in warmth, service in the resturant was slow at times and they kept running out of basic items and menu options. I found the hotel too expensive for what was on offer but the core offering was good (and I got an hours extension which was useful) so if a good deal was offered then go for it. I just was disappointed over and over by the lack of customer service and a drink of water or cava on my arrival and bottle of champagne and dessert on my arrival is no substitute and annoying in itself. The hotel also expects a service charge to be paid on the room rate paid, it is just too much.",2,2024,06,14
148,Stylish modern hotel,"A modern, stylish hotel with an interesting decor and design. We booked last minute and received a lovely welcome. Our balcony room provided amazing views towards the south bank and of the city sky line. Claudia and Gladstone warrant special mention for their top level of service. It was a memorable stay. Thank you very much.",5,2024,06,12
148,Wonderful,"Wonderful hotel in a fantastic location. From start to finish this hotel is 5 star. Everything you could possibly want was catered for with amazing personal touches. Special thanks for the balloons, cake and champagne that was in our room on arrival for my daughter‚Äôs birthday.

148,So relaxing!,"Had an absolute amazing stay here, stayed in London many times before but first time at Melia. Shruthi the receptionist was fantastic. Very helpful and even escorted me to my room with all my bags. Breakfast was also delicious. Love all the candles and the scent. Just a zen vibe! Can‚Äôt wait to stay again.",5,2024,06,01

Staff is unbelievable, especially Mike from front desk, who went above and beyond finding us the most suitable room and helping us out in whatever we needed. Chapeau!",5,2024,05,29
148,Great location and Concierge team,"From the moment we arrived, Vicktors and Gladstone went above and beyond to make sure our stay was unforgettable. They managed to secure reservations at top restaurants and provided great sightseeing tips. Their attention to details and genuine hospitality set this hotel apart. Great location, just on the edge of West End. Sadly Radio bar was closed for refurbishment. Breakfast service was shocking, we had to wait for coffee to arrive over 30 min. Concierge team recovered our breakfast experience with recommendations for the following days. TIP: Book room without the breakfast, there are so many great breakfast places around.",5,2024,05,28
148,Great Central London Hotel! Enjoyed Our Stay!,"Very nice hotel for our 6 night London visit. Great location in Central London. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Hotel decor is very contemporary and hallways are extremely dark, but rooms are bright and well appointed. Housekeeping was great with daily routine service and also turn down service. Beds, pillows, and linens were very comfortable. The included breakfast was nice with a la carte hot food and a continental buffet. Our only disappointment was that the rooftop bar/restaurant was closed for remodeling and breakfast was served in the ground floor restaurant.",5,2024,05,25
148,Beautiful Hotel,"Absolutely beautiful Hotel. The staff was amazing. Victor the concierge helped me so much to plan my day. The only issue I had was when I went for breakfast. It‚Äôs the restaurant at the Hotel. The waitress never came back to refill my coffee. I couldn‚Äôt get anyone‚Äôs attention. It‚Äôs not a big deal, but they could improve their service a little better.",5,2024,05,24
148,Great hotel in a fantastic location,"The hotel is in a fantastic location on the doorstep of Covent Garden and the theatre district. The rooms were spacious and with a good view (we had a city view room). The staff were fantastic and very helpful on arrival at check in. 

The only negatives were the rooftop bar was closed for renovations, which I hadn‚Äôt been advised of prior to booking and as we had wished to use this for drinks this would likely have influenced my decision to stay this weekend. Also, I had emailed a couple of queries a couple of days in advance but my email went unacknowledged. These were two small things that could be improved upon but overall a great stay at this hotel and I would stay again provided the rooftop bar was open.",4,2024,05,22

148,Great location and concierge team,"We recently stayed at ME hotel and was blown away by the exceptional service. The concierge staff, especially Victor, who went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable. Our arrival to the hotel were far from 5 star luxury service. 

We arrived at 10AM, greeted by blond gentlemen and Victor, who took us to the reception and offered bubbles. At the reception we were informed, that our room is not ready and reception will call us when our room is ready. No call received. Upon check-in (7PM) we were informed that roof top bar is closed for refurbishment. Reception hand it over the keys and hotel manager Paula took us to the room and hand it over the card for the review. Our grandsons helped us to write this review.
 Our bags were delivered by gentlemen Kai who kindly placed the bags in wardrobe and offered rooming.

The room was clean, windows cannot be opened.

Following morning Victor planned our four day itinerary with day by day maps and recommendations with places to visit, including seeing some hidden spots, such as King's canal boat, 12th century Medieval dinner, hidden Regent canal walk and Victor Wynd museum . He also gave us a card (as he says magic card) and instructed us to show his card to the host/manager if we want to get in restaurants while in London. From breakfast in Fallow, afternoon tea in Wolseley to the dinner at Session Arts Club, his ""Magic"" card managed to get us in.

Our second morning started started with some air conditioning and safety box issues. Room was extremely hot and we couldn't open the safety box (probably from previous guest). Upon arrival in the evening we had apology note and bottle of champagne.

Following nights we had no issues and we received great service. 

Upon check out, we had a ""surprise"", that 5% accommodation service charge is added to the room bill.

Overall, perfect location, great concierge team, especially Victor. 

We are coming back for week stay in July for Wimbledon tennis tournament, can not wait.",5,2024,05,15

148,Nice modern hotel with a spectacular view,"Excellent modern hotel, closely located close to the Thames and covent garden. Much better than the Savoy which is next door. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. Ivan made sure that I was well taken care of and made all my request happen with 5 mins. Truly exceptional customer service. Breakfast was also good offering a combination if a mini buffet and al la carte. I would definitely come back!",5,2024,05,11
148,Theft,Jewelry taken from room. Beware of theft in this hotel. Staff is unable to do anything about it and won‚Äôt even offer a solution.,1,2024,05,04
148,Great customer service,"We stayed at the hotel at the beginning of the month with my husband and two children. Due to a small issue we had with the air conditioning we had the opportunity to meet the Manager Luciano, who was able to solve the situation correctly. Honestly, I wasn't planning to write this review as I'm not used to it (maybe I'm a bit old fashioned!) but yesterday Luciano surprised me by remembering us sending a beautiful message congratulating our little Lily on her birthday. These little details make ME London our trusted hotel in London.",5,2024,04,29
148,"Great hotel, location and service!","I checked in with mom on sunday the 1st. The hotel is fantastic and is at a wonderful location. right across from the Waldorf and also adjacent to India House and several embassies. It is a chort walk from the Temple stop as well as charring Cross stations and absolutely adjacent to the Waterloo Bridge. 
The check-in experience with Shruthi Satheesh was very good. she is very caring as well and showed concern for my mom. The experience was very smooth. The concierge and staff are very helpful. The breakfast is great as well. I would recommend it any time!",5,2024,04,23
148,We loved every bit of it! üíù,My partner and I went to celebrate his birthday at Radio Rooftop Bar and were warmly greeted by Tawii and Luca. Both of them were absolutely amazing. Other members of staff were also kind and smiling throughout our time there. They looked after us right from when we stepped inside ME and all the way up to Radio. These two are huge assets to the organisation. What a 5 stars service. üôèüèº‚≠ê,5,2024,04,22
148,Wow !,"Stayed here as husband was running the London marathon. I had visited the hotel a couple of times for the rooftop bar but never had the privilege to stay over. As members of Meli√° we booked direct and received a good offer (although all hotels in the area for the marathon was higher than normal). 
Absolutely beautiful and stunning hotel, the reception was amazing and the staff were so friendly and very professional. They guided us to our amazing room (room 610) and explained facilities in the room. We then went to the rooftop bar for complimentary drinks - again such a wonderful gesture. The room had everything you could want, beautiful design, modern equipment - honestly perfect and could not of wanted anything else. 
If you are thinking of booking this hotel, do it !!! It‚Äôs stunning. Book via the Meli√° website for lovely perks. 
Thank you to all the staff at the hotel and for my husband‚Äôs complimentary bottle of bubbles that he received in the room on completing the marathon, with a personal greetings card. This hotel goes over the top to ensure your stay is the best ! Worth every penny and we will definitely be back",5,2024,04,22
148,Five-star experience,"I‚Äôve just spent two nights here with my sister and we absolutely loved every second - it‚Äôs a true five-star hotel and has an incredible vibe.

Anna greeted me in reception and was brilliant, warm, friendly, accommodating and made me feel extra welcome. She later knocked on our room door and brought us a programme for the Tina Turner musical that we were seeing the next day. This was such a lovely thought and we really appreciated it!

The rooms are beautiful and so so big (as is the shower!). The treatment that you receive from staff is five-star standard (although there was some dodgy service from some of the staff at breakfast, but this didn‚Äôt change our view of the ME team as a whole). Concierge team were also wonderful.

Rooftop bar is such a cool spot and we love a hotel with a turndown service, so appreciated that too. Will be back again with my fianc√©!",5,2024,04,21
148,My favourite hotel in my favourite city!,"Been there in 2023 and came back in January... Glad to see Tina again who remembered me and was lovely catching up...She is a great professional but also, she is super friendly and welcoming. Great hotel, great atmosphere, lovely all around... Can't wait for my 3rd time!",5,2024,04,20
148,"Marvellous modern, and stylishly hip hotel centrally located at The Stand London.","I specifically reviewed and chose to stay 3 nights in this marvellously modern and stylishly hip hotel which is centrally located at the Strand, and really accessible in central London. Really glad for my choice of ME London hotel, although I have to make my own way to join up with my Tour group to explore Britain and Ireland later. The internal Reception 10 Storey atrium is stunning, with a very hip and happening cool vibe of swanky and futuristic decor, with image projections on their wall. The contemporary look and juxtaposition from dark and black corridors, leading into a bright and white room is impressive sensory experience. My Superior ME City View room on the 6th Floor was quiet and offered a luxurious room size of 30 sqm which is a real treat in central London where space is premium. I enjoyed huge comfortable bed, pillow and well sound-proof room (which house-keeping did an excellent job to keep clean and turn-down service) which offer restful sleep. Humongous shower room was spacious with 2 Bali style shower-heads. 2 wash basins and separate toilet. Importantly, all staff are extremely friendly and provide effusive welcome by showing me personally to my room and I especially thank Ivan and Sruthi for their warm welcome and hospitality. Ivan is truly an asset to the Hotel, with genuine hospitality and service with a smile. 6 min walking distance to Charming Covent Garden which is a shopping and food paradise, and Convent Garden station connects you to rest of London. ME London Hotel's location in West End makes it convenient to catch musicals. Love the enviromentally friendly glass bottles of water, and large refillable pump bottles of Bigelow toiletries. Highly recommended, and I would most certainly stay here again.

148,"Superb location, sublime service. What a Team!!","What a great hotel... excellent location, outstanding service!!
My wife and I have enjoyed Radio the rooftop bar in the past and enjoyed the fabulously noisy STK restaurant but never had the opportunity to stay at The ME before..

This time, on  a spur of the moment weekend visit,  to see MJ The Musical and ABBA Voyage not forgetting doing the Monopoly Board walk over 3 days we had the chance to stay at and enjoy ME London. We could not have been more satisfied......

From the moment we were greeted on the ground floor by Concierge team and LUCA from Reception we were treated like royalty.

Our bags were immediately taken care of by Concierge and Luca ensured a very smooth check in at the wonderful reception, where we were plied with several glasses of Bubbles....all greatly appreciated.

Not only did Luca see to our needs at that point he also left us a very nice personalised Welcome card, a bottle of Prosecco and a bag full of goodies to enjoy in our room on our return from our days activities. All gratefully appreciated - Thank you Luca!!

Victor the Chief Concierge was a star...aided and abetted by Ivan his assistant.....
What they didn't know about London and in particular hidden London....
We already had a good idea how we were going to tackle and enjoy our three day walk around the monopoly board walk, but each day they brought it to life by adding lots of different places and things we should look out for to ensure we created unforgettable memories. They did not disappoint. 
Viktor's 'magic card' opened up doors and venues we would never have thought of seeing. His knowledge and expertise is truly remarkable. Every hotel needs a Viktor!!
ME London are lucky to have Viktor, Ivan and Luca....Superb!!
We look forward to returning before too long!! Thank you all.",5,2024,04,18
148,Business stay ,"I travel down to London once a month from Scotland for work. This is my 3rd stay in last 3 months at ME London, and sadly I think also my last, and will be looking to stay elsewhere with colleagues (and cancelling my next 2 bookings) .

PROS
Hotel is a great location for my London office and for going out in the evenings

Rooms are a good size (and usually comfortable.).   

Hotel looks fab,  with a regular turnaround of art in the main lobby,  and a check in area that looks like something out of James Bond. 

Great views from the radio rooftop bar. 

Good amenities in room - Dyson hairdryers, Nespresso coffee machine and a Kettle, good toiletries sometimes also ghd hair straightners

Good breakfast selection. 

CONS
Customer service isn't consistent: 
-2nd time stayed got a complimentary drinks voucher as our company uses ME regularly,   but not this time.
- Got an injury in the room last time I stayed,  no acknowledgement of fault from hotel  except bandaging me up and adding to accident book.   Emailed details on my return home, and didn't even get a response. 
- This visit was the first time I was offered a welcome drink on arrival. 

The room windows look nice, but don't do much for keeping the light out. 

Due to a fault with our office booking agent, hotel won't acknowledge promotions that I can't be added to my booking via the app. 

Final straw tonight it's now 4.30am and  I've been woken 5 tines tonight by a squeeling noise from the aircon/lighting control panel despite maintenance assuring me it was fixed earlier.    My main criteria for a hotel is to get a good night's sleep!! 

Its a shame as I really wanted to love this hotel, but if I can't gaurantee a nights sleep it defeats the point",3,2024,04,17
148,Lovely staff made the stay extra special,"Excellent location, staff were very attentive and welcoming, they made a big fuss of my daughter which she loved, we were shown to our room by Anna who was lovely.  The hotel room was spacious with comfortable beds and soft pillows.  We had room service breakfast and my daughter had the French toast, we only opted for toast wish we had gone for the full English as the French toast looked lovely.  All in all a lovely stay and would definitely reccomend and visit again, we are frequent London visitors and due back in June so may well book this one next time!",5,2024,04,15

We were looked after extremely well by a dedicated polite and warmly welcoming Aura Host Tawii. Looking after all our needs she made are stay more than welcome and ensured we were well looked after.

The location is perfect for shopping, sight seeing and eating! I would strongly recommend this perfect hotel with perfect staff! Thank you so much! Love Jess, Man and Coco x",5,2024,04,12
148,Style over substance,"I really wanted to love this hotel, but, sadly, I didn‚Äôt. Style over substance. Over perfumed and over loud, especially in reception. Lots (and lots!) of black marble gave it a tomb-like feel.
Room was nice with a small balcony with a city view. Comfy beds and double shower with some complimentary wine and chocolates.
Service in the radio rooftop bar was very very slow. Drinks were ok, food was good.
Convenient location for theatre and pretty decent price for the location.
As an aside we ate at Luciano - despite the bill having the option to charge to the room, our waiter said we couldn‚Äôt do this. Mistake or a bit of a scam?",3,2024,04,12
148,Birthday getaway,"I booked this hotel for my girlfriend's birthday and it did not disappoint.  From the moment we entered the building everyone was incredibly helpful. Glass of cava in reception while they sorted our check in (I believe you can pretty much check in when you like...) and then escorted to our room. I had worked with the Melia Aura team to organise a surprise in the room and they did a cracking job. It was also great that during our stay we could text the team and they sorted everything we needed. 

Few little things of note: communication with the Aura team prior to the stay was not great. It resulted in me panicking on my journey up to London as they had not got back to me despite sending several emails stating what I wanted. While checking in the hotel takes a large deposit on top of what you are already paying which would have been nice to know about prior to arrival. We were on floor 8, it was not a problem for us but if you are looking for an early night this is not the hotel for you as the music was blaring very loud. There are just a few things to note. Communication prior should have been better given the amount I was paying.

Nevertheless, the hotel is sensational. The lights, the location, the aura around it, the room are good but lots of things are well hidden - had to check where the mini bar was. We were lucky enough to have a balcony- unfortunately we didn't have the weather to sue it. Everything you'd expect from a quality London hotel. It was a really good stay and I would come again. Just those little stresses prior could have been avoided.",4,2024,04,11
148,Best Hotel near Covent Garden,"Great stay in a very convenient location close to Covent Garden and the main attractions in London. Very luminous and big rooms with also amazing rooftop breakfast.

Excellent location , but more importantly, relaxing and pleasant atmosphere in the hotel allowed to fully enjoy our short trip. We would like to extend a sincere Thank you to the hotel staff and ,specifically, to Anna. Anna made sure that we are comfortably settled in our room and included a hand written, personalized note to say Good Bye at the check out time. Location is great: walking distance 15 min to British Museum and St. Paul, 10 min to Trafalgar Square.  Modern design is not cold but cozy. Radio rooftop lounge provides for relaxing atmosphere and great city views. But most importantly, the staff. Hotel staff makes a difference: planning the trip outside of London, navigating the city, need a cab or a restaurant suggestion, just ask the ME team. Thank you Anna and ME team.",5,2024,04,07

148,Good option in London,"It is not the first time I have stayed at the hotel. It is a very good option, the location is excellent, I like the design and the quality-price ratio is very good.

I would definitely recommend it and I would stay there again but I think they are details that have to be taken care of.",4,2024,04,01

See you soon!",5,2024,03,27
148,"Caring, attentive and clean experience!","The going-beyond support and service from Alan Bath (especially after my traumatic experience the night before with another hotel), the friendly and speedy concierge, to the attentiveness of staff at breakfast (re: my GF preference) is full of care. I really appreciate the team.

The only one thing I'd say is the rumbling noise coming out of the toilet bowl that has nothing to do with flushing.",5,2024,03,26
148,I luv London!,"Overall good experience. Friendly, kind staff especially at the ground floor (street) level.  They even knew my name :-) 

However, a situation with an inoperable room safe took 3 days to resolve. Once finally functioning, the safe's door was unusually heavy to lift open. As a Senior Citizen, it was difficult for me.",4,2024,03,24
148,Horrible Facility wit horrible service,"there was a Horrible smell coming from the sink, shower & tub in the bathroom that hadn't been fixed for 2 days after complaining and according to the has been resolved. I was given another room after that was very dusty and not cleaned properly. The shower wasn't working properly. the iron was broken and leaking. the steamer was leaking. The TV wasn't working properly. the phone was broken a couple of times. the elevator key didn't work. horrible coordination between the staff. if there is a problem I need to repeat it to every single new staff I talk to. Disappointed with service and facility in relation to money spent",1,2024,03,24
148,THE. BEST. TIME. EVER.,"We had the best evening ever. Our Aura host Tawii made our time spent, the best experience ever. Thank you so much Tawii and ME hotel. We will be booking to come back here again very soon. We came to stay here for my wife‚Äôs 40th but we will spend many more celebrations here in the future. The Radio Roof Top bar is so much fun too. X",5,2024,03,23
148,Amazing hotel with great service and team,"This hotel continues to impress me. I stay most months for business and leisure.

Tina, the manager is excellent. Their attention to detail and service is excellent.

The Radio bar on the rooftop is a really nice bar, with amazing views across London.

Breakfast is also held on the top floor.

They have a gym and onsite parking which is also rare in central London.

Luciano‚Äôs the Italian underneath is also a must when you stay.

I would definitely recommend. Ideal if you want access to Covent Garden, the Strand or the Theatre district.",5,2024,03,23
148,Excellent,"Very helpful and friendly staff, would highly recommend a stay here! Will be coming back to this hotel definitely in the future. Have zero complaints about my stay and look forward to returning soon! Rooftop bar was a very nice experience as well",5,2024,03,23
148,10th Wedding Anniversary trip away,"A stunning hotel in a fab location, only a quick 8-10 min walk from the centre of Covent Garden.

We have the city room
With balcony - great views across London and too the Thames, perfect for those evenings getting ready. 

The Radio roof top bar is a must, again with some spectacular views.

The staff here are very welcoming and can‚Äôt do enough for you. 

I‚Äôd highly recommend staying here.",5,2024,03,23
148,A unique place to stay,"Excellent place to stay and live an exp√©rience !
An extraordinary hotel.
I had a disappointing issue during breakfast and the team and Radio manager were brave and very kind in customer care management, which was really enjoyable. 
The breakfast is amazing by the way, very seen so many fresh products to start the day.",5,2024,03,20
148,Best hidden gem in London.,"This hotel really is a hidden gem in the heart of the west end. If you‚Äôre going to see a show then this hotel is perfectly placed to reach so many theatres on foot, or with a short taxi ride. It‚Äôs just around the corner from Covent Garden so you‚Äôre not short of places to go. As you step inside you‚Äôre welcomed with friendly staff who can‚Äôt do enough for you. Luca, who dealt with our seamless check in was happy to welcome us with complimentary drinks whilst taking our details. We were then shown to our room by Tawaii, who made sure that we were completely comfortable with our room and that we had everything we needed. She had even arranged a welcome fruit platter, which was a lovely surprise! 
The room we had was very large and included all you could need, including toiletries, a double rainfall shower, bath robes, slippers, a Dyson hairdryer & GHD straighteners. After a great nights sleep, we headed up to the rooftop bar for a complimentary breakfast. The portions on the hot food were very generous and the selection of food from the buffet was incredible. You definitely don‚Äôt leave hungry. 
We‚Äôll definitely be staying again.",5,2024,03,19
148,Not your typical city hotel!,"I stayed at this Hotel whilst I was down for work in February 2024 and what a brilliant hotel it was. From the second you enter the building you are greeted with friendly faces and warm welcomes. 

A guy named Luca helped check me into my room and presented me with a complimentary drink. After a brief conversation I retreated to the rooftop bar for a drink before going to sleep. The rooftop bar had beautiful views of the London city skyline and was far enough up to not be distracted by the hustle and bustle of the inner city streets.

After a relaxing stay in one of their suites on the sixth floor, I awoke and after a shower I headed back to the rooftop for some complimentary breakfast. I ordered eggs benedict which was divine and had a coffee and orange juice which set me up for the rest of my day. The lady who waited on me was Tawii who was very welcoming and made sure any need I had was met, she even gave me a tour of all the complimentary breakfast items that was available. 

Check-out was easy and I enjoyed the rest of my stay in London. I'd stay again! Thank you Luca & Tawii and all the other staff at ME London.",5,2024,03,19
148,Roll of the dice: 6,"This is the hotel with the friendly staff!
Tylease in the reception helped me a lot as I was leaving the hotel. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming!
Not to mention the location and the fabolous view from the rooftop. Get a room with a balcony. This is the best gem in London!",5,2024,03,18
148,Me and the Mrs,"What a great hotel, very different and quirky. The staff are all so friendly and not in that ‚Äúhave a nice day‚Äù insincere way. The roof top bar is fantastic. The room was comfortable and well kitted out. The tv set up is a bit different but once I got the hang of it was great especially being able to watch my own Prime and Netflix accounts.
Breakfast overlooking London from the roof was fantastic. We dined out so didn‚Äôt get to sample the food. All in all a lovely stay thanks ME.",5,2024,03,17
148,5 star weekend.,"I stayed at the ME London with my wife for the weekend as a birthday celebration. 
It was a wonderful experience and they really went all out to make sure she had a great time. They sent a lovely token to the room on her birthday and we had a gorgeous meal. 
The rooms are great, breakfast is relaxed with vast choice and the staff are friendly and always smiling. 
Will definitely go back",5,2024,03,15
148,An excellent stay,"I stayed here for two nights whilst at a conference and honestly felt more like I was in holiday! 
The attention to detail from the staff was second to none. From checking in to the restaurant experience it was excellent in every way. 
The rooms are spacious, the beds are comfortable and the whole ambiance of the hotel makes you feel relaxed and comfortable. 
Would definitely recommend and look forward to staying again.",5,2024,03,15

148,Overall experience,The hotel was mesmerising and the staff were really helpful and kind. The reception area was the eye catching area of the hotel.

Loved my stay here! The room very clean, Amazing, With excellent view. 

Thank you so much because you made my days much better! 

We really Appreciate your services and support!!!",5,2024,03,14
148,A bit disappointing,"We paid just over ¬£400 per night, without breakfast. and really don't think it was good value. 

We were initially given an interconnecting room and could hear everything happening in the room next door, the TV, conversations etc. When we asked to move rooms (we were there for some peace!), the manager told us there were no other options as the hotel was full. Eventually they found another room but this one smelled of cigarette smoke. The bed was nice (and huge) though.

We paid extra to have the hotel breakfast, which was good and in a great spot but took forever to arrived.",3,2024,03,12
148,Fun fabulous fluffy modern luxury,"The best pillows I‚Äôve slept on, superb starf, great location, my new favourite indulgence. Great amenities inc steamer, Dyson, great lighting and full length mirror plus room was soundproof. Will stay here again and again and maybe even again!",5,2024,03,12
148,Excellent,Excellent location. Wonderful service and people. Amazing architecture. We used it for a business trip the first time and have been astouned. the proximity to covent garden with all the lovely restaurants und Shops as well as the lyceeum is also a big benefit.,5,2024,03,11
148,"Great hotel, great location, great experience!","The staff are extremely accommodating. I always come away looking forward to my next visit! The breakfast is great with a lot to choose from in a fantastic setting. The exercise room could be a little bigger, but if this isn't a priority then there is nothing to complain about.",5,2024,03,11
148,Poor experience over rated hotel,"Great first impression when you go into the Hotel, mood lightening and the reception area is a wow! Staff member also really polite at check in. However this is where it ends and it seems it‚Äôs all smokes and mirrors..the rooms are mediocre at best, with wall plugs not attached to walls, TV that doesn‚Äôt work, along with phones that don‚Äôt work and a cattlegrid like shower flooring. We stayed on the 9th floor and the noise from the rooftop bar of an evening was unbearable, we just couldn‚Äôt sleep until the bar shut due to the noise levels and the base of the music pounding through our walls/ceiling. Great location but that‚Äôs it. For the money paid there are much better hotels in the surrounding area..wouldn‚Äôt stay again!",3,2024,03,05
148,Cheated on the mini bar,I got charged for a red bull that most likely the cleaning lady drank after I checked out. I also had to change rooms because the first one assigned to me had problems with the shower. The second room was nice and clean. The interior design of the building is very unique.,1,2024,03,04
148,Wonderful,"Amazing location and extremely friendly staff, Luis was fantastic! Drinks and food definitively recommended. Particular mention to Jaime, who went above and beyond to make our evening absolutely special! I cannot express more gratituted to thank you enough!",5,2024,03,03
148,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel. The room is amazing (especial mention for the bed), the breakfast with a good variety and amazing views, the concierge service. Everything is really nice and accordingly with the price. Dennis and Dimiter do a great job. Congratulations!",5,2024,03,02
148,Great hotel. Highly recommended,"wonderful three days at the Me Hotel London. Great room. Spacious and quiet. Comfortable, large bed. Very tasty breakfast. The staff is friendly and attentive. I would especially like to thank Anna Nuzhdina for her attentive attitude towards us.",5,2024,03,01
148,Perfect stay,"Our first visit to Me London, have stayed in Spain in Meli√° hotels before but this hotel is superb.
Amazing location. Everything from being greeted on arrival to being escorted to the spectacular reception and then onto our fantastic room was beyond our expectations. Cannot fault anything on our two night stay all the staff were very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much effort. We cannot wait to stay again and will be bringing our whole family next time.",5,2024,02,29
148,Amazing stay,"Had an amazing stay, and had to stay an extra day and the receptionist Stan was amazing in helping us getting it all sorted. We were staying in an extremely dark room and Stan was amazing in changing our room which was much brighter and the window was much bigger to see the whole view really appriciate what he‚Äôs done for us and highly recommend anyone to stay here awesome place!",5,2024,02,29
148,Great Service from Jaime,"The room was really comfortable and perfectly  prepared and I want to flag the amazing treat I received from Jaime , the guest experience manager, he was really professional and kind , I will definitely come back and will recommend the hotel to everyone.",5,2024,02,29
148,Very good,"My preferred hotel of choice when in London.

If you want a hotel that oozes class this is the hotel for you. 

Had a small issue with getting a taxi on departure due to a public road race that was taking place outside the hotel and surrounding areas. However, Luciano Tomas was very professional in the way he dealt with the situation.

Hope to return soon.",5,2024,02,28
148,Spectacular,"I have never before thought about not writing a review of a hotel. The reason is very selfish. This hotel is so very good and we always want to find availability when we want to visit London again. It is just amazing. The location is perfect. It is right in the middle of Covent Gardens. There are so many transport options from the hotel. There are so many places to choose to eat.  The rooms are so big for London standards. It has giant king size bed . It has modern plumbing. The best part of the bathroom is that the toilet is separate. The rooms are also very modern. There is also a turn down service in the evenings. We just love this little extra spoil. There is a kettle, nespresso machine and a mini fridge in the room. And to top it all, the hairdryer is a Dyson. The staff at the hotel are wonderful, helpful and friendly. The breakfasts are incredible and so are the views from the breakfast room. Now, you can understand why we would like to keep it a secret.",5,2024,02,28
148,Perfect spot if you are travelling to London,"We received the best guest experience at ME London. 
The room was impeccable and the service received by Jaime Evora was outstanding.
Worth mentioning is that the hotel is located very central and has an amazing rooftop bar, spa, and restaurants. I highly recommend it.",5,2024,02,28
148,Excellent stay. Would highly recomment a visit,"Myself and a group of friends have recently just had an amazing stay.

The hotel is fresh and modern, with the rooms very comfortable and a great size.

We ate in the Sky Bar which was excellent. The food was incredible (the Chorizo Sausage rolls are a must!) and the views over London matched it.

The staff were friendly and attentive and made sure that the stay was perfect.

The hotel was in a brilliant location for getting arounf the city.

Would highly recommend and will be definitely using the hotel again in the future.",5,2024,02,27
148,You have to stay here!,"Stayed here for the weekend and couldn‚Äôt recommend enough! From the moment you
Walk in you‚Äôre greeted by great staff and luxury. The Rooftop with views over the city is stunning. Rooms are spacious and modern. Location is fantastic. Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place enough. Look forward to staying again!",5,2024,02,27
148,Best location,This hotel is in a great location if you want to be in the heart of London. Very impressive interiors with a great vibe and loved the view from my room. Had a great meal in the Italian restaurant with excellent service from the team in there. Highly recommend.,5,2024,02,26
148,Totally recommended,"We went there due to a friend's recommendation and it was totally what we were looking for, very comfortable, great treat, and then it was that spaniard guy, Jaime, what a guy, always taking care of the details,
In conclusion a really nice experience",5,2024,02,24
148,Amazing views with great drinks,"The radio rooftop bar has fantastic views of London‚Äôs skyline and does great classic cocktails. I would recommend the Marconi lounge as well, it‚Äôs a nice spot to meet someone and have a coffee. The hotel is very central so really easy to get to.",5,2024,02,21
148,Great front desk / check-in experience!,"I had a fantastic experience! What made it even more special and unique was when I checked in at the front desk and was helped by Stanzin Phuntsog. He was kind and attentive, with the perfect amount of effort, not too much nor too little, making sure I had everything I needed before leaving me to turn in for the evening after a long flight. It is rare to meet such professional, kind, and honest people in the tourism / service industry.",5,2024,02,21
148,Wonderful stay,"A beautiful and very comfortable hotel, interesting architecture and design, lovely rooms with very comfortable beds, very friendly staff and amazing breakfast in the rooftop bar. It is of course well located for walking all round London.",5,2024,02,20
148,Modern Design.  Genuine hospitality. I loved it.,"I decided on a last minute overnight stay after a day in London.  I

I regularly use the excellent Melia Athens and maintain a gold melia membership. The Me came to mind, taking advantage of the members' rate. 

I was a little unnerved by the uber modern design of the hotel. But the welcome here was genuine - not a trace of the ""standing and modelling"" arrogance that often comes with the genre. 

A minor glitch with the Melia online system caused a minor delay at check in, but the team could not have been more helpful and welcoming.  Service recovery at its best. 

The bed was among the most comfortable in London. I enjoyed an excellent night's sleep, especially so after three expertly made martinis in the Radio roof-top bar followed by dinner at the Ivy on West St, a few minutes' walk away. 

Overall, an excellent hotel; one the best in London, with an enthusiastic and welcoming team.",5,2024,02,20
148,Exceptional breakfast!,"We stayed here mainly for the location and as a special Valentine‚Äôs treat for a theatre trip. Hotel is very modern and ‚Äòtrendy‚Äô, check in was quite a long process but we received a free glass of bubbles and staff were friendly, There was an ‚Äòevent‚Äô going on in the reception area which was very loud and didn‚Äôt give us a great first impression - dogs included! When we finally saw the lobby on check out it is a lovely space with amazing moving art and nice seating. I would suggest not holding ‚Äòevents‚Äô in reception. We waited a while for the lift and were eventually taken to our river view terrace room on the 9th floor and showed around. The terrace rooms are great for smokers with amazing views and the room was spacious and included everything you could want, from a huge ring light, robes, slippers, shaving kit, toothbrush set, umbrella, steamer, Dyson hairdryer, all toiletries and many ports and attachments for all phones. Coffee machine with fully stocked mini bar (chargeable) but free water and tea/coffee. Magazines, welcome cake and champagne, the amenities were really Impressive. The only downsides for me were the bed was not that comfortable, too hard although very large and being right below the rooftop bar the noise/music was constant! Also the tv is strangely mounted too low on the wall, it needs to be higher as you can‚Äôt see the bottom of it when you‚Äôre in bed! 
The corridors are purposely very dark, it‚Äôs apparently an art effect with the bedrooms then being very light and bright but we found the corridors dangerously dark! I would not be happy as a lone female walking these corridors, or as an older person. Breakfast was exceptional! Served from 7-11. Everything you could want including Spanish omelette and honey straight off the hive, well worth the high price tag although ours was included in the room rate. (Full English ¬£21.00). The rooftop area is also a great space for breakfast. Sadly we didn‚Äôt like it as a bar in the evening, we waited a long time to be seated but all we wanted to do was have one drink at the bar and have a walk outside. Well you can‚Äôt go to the bar and you can‚Äôt get outside, so we sat inside and waited even longer to be served from our table. One stool was broken. We were given a free drink but some of the cocktails were ¬£24.00! I would not choose to drink here with all the other establishments to choose from in London. The worst thing for us was that you couldn‚Äôt seem to use the stairs even if you wanted to. We only wanted to walk from floor 9 to 10 but the door at the top on floor 10 was locked so we came back down again and waited for the lift. This must be a fire hazard surely? I would have preferred the option to use stairs but they were hard to find. Overall a good experience at the ME and I would recommend it for young people. Unfortunately I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again though as the room prices are extortionate. I did not pay for this stay but I believe this room would have been around ¬£450.00! A bit overpriced in my opinion but that‚Äôs central London for you! 4 stars as some improvements could be made and due to the prices, it‚Äôs not for everyone.",4,2024,02,19
148,Amazing experience,"From the style, to the s√∫per comfy beds, the whole experience was from another world! Amazing luxury in downtown London, s√∫per location Near everything you need to see in London. 

Also great staff, specially Paula who helped us along the way tremendously. 

Couldnt have thought that the experience was going to ve this good! Would recommend it all the way!",5,2024,02,18

148,Member experience :),"Yes, this hotel is beautiful and a 4/5 rating. However, member like Stanzin who we loved, and made our experience better, its a 5/5 :)

Ash:
Stanzin had shown his really nice and cute personality towards us which led to a really really long conversation, which i personally loved about. He introduced us about the room and kindly offered us, champagne to celebrate our moment. His explanation is very detailed and had answered all our question to fulfill our needs. Therefore, his service and personality is a 10/10 and would love to see him again.

For Stanzin, we love you for everything you do to ensure that our experience is better than before and the conversation we had was the best and personally, you‚Äôre the best service member!!! Hope to meet you again :) 

Jazz:

Stanzin had made our day brighter and better after having a rough day. This is what I needed, and we had a really nice conversation on what we did today and loved his eye contact and his energy. Definitely need member like him who can express their personality. Thank you for giving us a good time and we love what you do!! :)

148,Sheer luxury in the heart of London,"Quite simply the most perfect hotel you could wish for, right in the heart of Central London, who can ask for more!? Very familiar with Meli√£ hotels in the North of England so ME London was the perfect choice.

Upon entering, a warm smile and welcome from concierge, along with an offer to take luggage and accompany to the lifts. The smell on entering is absolutely divine, as is the artistic walkway which leads you from entrance to the lift lobby.

Up to floor 1 and the Reception is nothing short of stunning! Beautiful space with huge walls displaying beautiful imagery to instantly calm, all leading your eye up to the lovely atrium! A welcome glass of Cava followed by an invitation to take a relaxing seat on the sofa area while Reception sort the details and bring across the key.

Was escorted to the room by the lovely Aisha (apologies if mis-spelt!) who was a delight and naturally bubbly on the trip to the room. She was very courteous in showing the room features and could tell she naturally wants to ensure people feel welcome in the hotel.

The room itself was gorgeous! City view with a terrace looking out over the rooftops of the capital, with a lovely look towards Big Ben to the left. Within the room, the gorgeous mood lighting you have control of was a lovely touch, as was the Bluetooth speakers built into the ceiling. Huge comfortable bed, large TV, minibar for those late night snacks, and a beautiful bathroom with luxurious toiletries and a gorgeous rainfall shower.

All in all, this hotel is simply stunning. Very tastefully designed and done with comfort in mind. But the staff here make the hotel give that extra luxurious feel, always there to help with a smile. Shout out to the fabulous Claudia too who is the complete hospitality professional, with a kind heart as well.

Thank for all for a great stay, and look forward to visiting again soon!",5,2024,02,01
148,WOW! What a GEM !,"my brother-in law, his wife and my wife have just enjoyed our best ever 2 night stay in any London hotel.
The ME Hotel at Covenant Garden was totally out of this world.
The magnificence of the exterior and interior was unbelievable. Beautifully tiled surfaces and magnificently high ceilings had us captivated from the moment we entered.
The reception we had was beyond friendly with the staff extremely keen to ensure your stay was everything you had dreamed of.
After a very welcoming glass of free champagne we were shown to our rooms which had every gadget you could of imagined.
Each room had wonderful air conditioning and neat little touches that is hard to find anywhere else in the capital within this price bracket.
The bed was long and wide with lovely pillows and crisp linen sheets. Maid service was available every morning and left your room as new again.
The corridors were discreetly lit to prevent noise near any of the bedrooms.
The dining area was well laid out and we all enjoyed a full English breakfast each morning although a continental feast was also readily available.
There are two main restaurants one specializing in steaks and the other in Italian cuisine.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Discover it for yourself. We will certainly be back very soon.
Special thanks to Tawii Aura (host) alongside Victor and the rest of the crew including their very helpful doorman who was full of information which greatly helped our stay.

148,Best hotel in town,"Amazing experience, amazing team and amazing hotel.

First of all, the outside of the hotel might not very outstanding, but George (the porter) welcomed us as if we were royalty. What a wonderful, cheerful, caring soul, he made me smile from beginning to end. 

The ground floor lobby is very modern and with a smell that reminds me at home. Going up on floor you get to the reception and wow, breath taking, simply spectacular.  And what can I say about the room, its more than we spected, the size, the views, the features and all the little details that left us with our mouth open.

Breakfast on the 10th is amazing, very complete and good attention, not mentioning the fabulous view.

Last and surely not least, many thanks to Susana (reception) that took care of us throughout our stay along with Paula (Aura team) that took care of everything detail and went beyond spected and the amazing Claudia, young girl with bright future, unstoppable energy and all three with that family touch that Melia always stands for.

I'm sure I'll come back, and I hope I'll cross this 4 amazing souls one day because they are Very Inspiring People.

It had everything we needed and more. The concierge team also did a fantastic job of booking our ice skating session. It was a fun and memorable experience. The service was impeccable from the moment we entered the door until we left. The staff were always ready to assist us with anything we needed. This hotel really made us feel special and pampered. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing stay.",5,2024,01,24
148,Outstanding,"What an experience in this wonderful hotel! From the moment we walked in, we knew it would be an exceptional stay because of the smiles of all the staff. Special mention to Claudia who escorted us to our room, dedicating every second to make the experience outstanding. 

A stay full of details, from check-in, breakfast, turndown service, to our departure.

In short, the hotel and its outlets are spectacular, but without a doubt the quality of the staff makes you never want to leave.",5,2024,01,23
148,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel!  Loverly staff all very kind and welcoming. 
Rooms are amazing, we had a great time staying here 
Ty was very helpful through out stay 
Would definitely recommend staying in this hotel, location is also great very local. 
Would definitely stay here again",5,2024,01,23
148,Great stay in a River Terrace room.,"We were checked in by Vanessa who was great. We had an amazing time, we got to see the Light Art exhibit in the hotel which was very cool. The weather was clear and sunny which was very lucky for us and made the most of the River Terrace room‚Äôs cool outside space and view of the Thames. Highly enjoyable stay!",5,2024,01,23
148,Outstanding London hotel !!!,"The ME hotel is an outstanding 5 star hotel which is able to combine informality with exemplary standards of customer service which is seamlessly delivered by well trained and very friendly staff! 
Definitely try out the Radio bar on the 10th floor with lovely views across London! 
The adjacent steak themed restaurant has the best steaks in London in a very vibrant restaurant!
The hotel is reasonably priced compared to other 5 star hotels which do not match the Melia standards !",5,2024,01,22
148,Amazing views in the heart of London,Overall this is a great hotel in the heart of London. Staff are friendly and actually want to help. The roof terrace is particularly good with amazing views across the city. Well worth a stay / visit. The hotel is very modern and clean and would definitely recommend this hotel and other Melia hotels.,5,2024,01,21
148,Turned a good weekend a great weekend !,"Having stayed in Innside by Melia in Manchester previously, I was really looking forward to staying in, Me London, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed ! We came to London to see Mama Mia! and have a fun weekend away, and staying here made the it a really great weekend. Helpful staff, a super cool place and a perfect location to head to the theatre and then explore London in the daytime. What more do you need ? Would definitely stay again.",5,2024,01,20
148,More style than substance,This hotel has a lot of style but is lacking in substance. I spent one night here primarily due to location. Given the hotel has 5 stars I was surprised to find that neither the TV or the coffee machine worked in my room. The allocated space in the wall for a suitcase wasn‚Äôt big enough to accommodate an overnight bag and the floor space is pretty limited as the bedrooms are quite small. I also cut my hand trying to get into the shower gel and shampoo where the lids to the dispensers provided seemed to be welded on. On checking out I pointed out these issues and the receptionist promised that they would follow up but I heard nothing. I also had to chase them up to send the bill I had been told would automatically be sent over email. If you‚Äôre staying for business reasons functionality is key. I would recommend that management pay more attention to that.,3,2024,01,20
148,Nice hotel,"Great hotel, friendly and helpful staff, great warm comfortable rooms.
Great bar and restaurant with a good choice on the menu. good location.
The hotel is very modern and luxurious. clean and spacious room.",4,2024,01,16
148,"Accommodations fit for a magazine, an unbeatable location, and all the amenities you could ask for.","ME pulls off the difficult feat of making you feel that you are completely at home and, at the same time, that you are someone's honored  and pampered guest. Located in central London within easy proximity of the theatre district, restaurants you can't get enough of, and some of the best pubs the city has to offer, the stylish accommodations  are seconded by excellent food service and a beautiful rooftop bar with a truly impressive view (shared by some of the rooms/suites). The hotel staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and just a bit wry, and if you let them, they'll make your stay just that much better. This is our new go-to hotel in London.",5,2024,01,11
148,Amazing!,"I am a regular to this hotel, and I would definitely recommend it to travellers fancying a luxury holiday. Brilliant service and impeccable room. The loveliest hotel that I‚Äôve ever been. The location is amazing and the restaurants are all worth trying.",5,2024,01,11
148,Restored my faith in London hotels,"Great visit from start to finish. Staff couldn't do enough, room was perfect and we felt a very warm unobtrusive service throughout our stay. Stan on reception couldn't do enough to help. A big thank you to the ME team.",5,2024,01,11
148,Gorgeous hotel with the best staff ever encountered in London!,"This was our first time staying at the ME London and I have to say it is now our favourite. The hotel is truly stunning! The location is fantastic, with an abundance of restaurants & bars right on the doorstep and only a 5 min walk to Covent Garden.
The hotel is very modern and luxurious and the reception area visually striking.
What stands this hotel apart for us, from the numerous other London hotels we have visited, is the staff.  Literally every interaction we had with any member of staff
was lovely and the conversations genuine.  We would like to say a special thank you to Stan for looking after us during check- in, he recommended & very kindly made reservations in the STK restaurant  & Radio Bar while we had a complimentary glass of bubbly, all of which were fantastic, highly recommend a visit to both.
We thoroughly enjoyed speaking with him, Thank you Stan until the next time :-)",5,2024,01,10
148,Special Birthday Stay!,"We chose the ME London as the perfect location to celebrate a major birthday for my wife. We have known the high standards offered by the Melia Group through previous experience, and on this special occasion they once again excelled.

The location of the hotel is fantastic for the West End and Covent Garden, and the amenities the hotel offers including both Radio (Rooftop Bar) and STK made it the ideal location to host a large party (20+) without having to move away from the building - not to mention a cheeky lunch at the fabulous Luciano's before our guests arrived..

From the start of the booking process the hotel staff could not do enough for us to ensure that the occasion was memorable for all the right reasons. The night went perfectly, with constant signs of the ME team going above and beyond to deliver on our plans make this a special stay for us.

Extra special thanks must go to Tawii in the Aura team - her attention to detail, engagement and actions throughout the planning process and our stay really did make the difference - THANK YOU TAWII!! 

We will most certainly be back, and highly recommend to anyone looking at this hotel!",5,2024,01,10

There are so many extra luxuries in the room and is gorgeously decorated. The bed was quite comfortable. We had a lovely view.  Location is the best for visiting London, so close to theatres and Covent Garden. I hope to return for a much longer visit.",5,2024,01,01
148,First time experience was great,"On arrival, me and my wife had come to the reception and we got excellent customer service from a gentleman named Stan. He was very friendly, polite, kind and delivered excellent customer service. We were given complimentary champagne whilst waiting for our room keys. In  addition, we were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful artwork and we received spectacular, genuine personality that I thought was hard to come bye we wish him all the best and hope that he is rewarded for his excellent  deliverance to the service we needed. Me and my wife are very happy that Stan was at work today. All I will say is happy New Year from Mr and Mrs

The rooms were so cool and modern, and the rooftop and restaurant made the perfect combo.  I felt like at home, but with an excellent room service, what a luxury!

 The location was incredible, close to everything I needed and with that chill atmosphere that makes you forget that you are in middle of the big London

I would like to highlight Luciano, who since I arrived cared about me and my family and everything we needed, he made the experience worth it.

In short, thanks to Luciano and his team for making my stay great.  This place is the definition of ""good vibes.""  If you are thinking of staying here, just book straight away, you won't regret it.

148,Best city stay ! ,"I stayed at here a few days before Christmas for nights stay and it was incredible! Beautiful views from the rooftop to enjoy with yummy breakfast or drinks , to the most delightful bed. This hotel has a great attention to detail and all these little things made me feel really looked after at my stay. The best feature had to be the 24 hour room service !

148,The best choice ‚ù§Ô∏è,"It has been our best choice. In London we always went to another Melia. But this time we decided to go to Me London. Getting to know Susana and Paula has been the best part of our experience.

148,Fab Sunday Roast & unlimited drinks,"Dined here for Sunday roast after seeing the Tina musical.   Food was delicious complimentary bread & blue cheese prior to the main & although there was only 2 slices of toast beef on the plate the roasties, cauliflower  cheese, red cabbage, carrots, parsnips & Yorkshire pudding & gravy was more than enough.  Washed  down with 90 minutes of unlimited wine, beer,cider, Prosecco, mimosas or Bloody Mary.  The server Riu who was from Portugal was very attentive & friendly.  He kept our water & drinks topped up.  This was excellent value for money considering the surroundings & location.  I would recommend trying STK if you‚Äôre in town.  I‚Äôll Definitely be back next time I‚Äôm in London.",5,2023,12,04

148,Beware the emperors new clothes,"Theres an odd absence of hotel staff and people in the entrance to this hotel and reception is on level one through corridors of depressingly black  interior walls. A strange light show in reception, designed to impress, ( not me) until eventually you arrive in a room that more akin to a holiday inn than a 5 star hotel. ( and a tired one at that) 
The bar and restaurant has an absence of management( am i invisible), though large groups of excitable types seem more successful in getting attention . 
5 star price, 3 star experience‚Ä¶. Emperors new clothes im afraid. 
Ps lots of better options in london",3,2023,12,01
148,Incredible Hotel,"This hotel is excellent in every way. We stayed for  business as a group of five for 3 nights and I couldn‚Äôt fault it at all..  from the friendliness of the staff, the incredible rooms and amazing food to the best location in London by far. 
Nothing was too much trouble for anyone in the hotel, and I would recommend it wholeheartedly .",5,2023,11,28
148,"A welcoming smile, attitude, and conversation can truly make a difference. Great start to my day!!!","I am writing this review because I just met and spoke with Denisha who was so welcoming with her smile and attitude. As I returned from breakfast I had  a brief conversation with her and she really impressed me. She was polite, attentive and communicated with me in such a professional manner, even as I was questioning her about the Christmas tree being in the lobby before I left. For some reason I was oblivious to it earlier. ",5,2023,11,15
148,Overall experience,"The treatment of the staff, how attentive they are and how comfortable the location is and the state of the rooms were also very great. overall, I wouldn‚Äôt say anything negative about it.

Rooms were both well designed & comfortable with every need thought of.
Really impressed!
Breakfast on the roof was delicious.
I would certainly book again !",5,2023,10,27
148,Shocking for 5 star‚Ä¶.better off at a premier inn,"Shocked by the standards at this hotel.  My room (911)  was so small it was difficult to comfortably move around, small double bed.  Ports and devices generally either didn‚Äôt work or were hanging off the wall.   Hotel is dark and conference areas lack natural light.  Food is mediocre.
Staff were very rude in the bars, one evening we waiting 20mins to be served, ordered and paid for drinks and then was told the bar was closing and to drink our drinks in our room, we didn‚Äôt even have our drinks at this point.  Toilets were poorly maintained, generally no soap or hand towels available to dry hands.  Genuinely shocked by the standard of this hotel, stay well away there are much better hotels for the price.",1,2023,10,12
148,Deteriorating quality of rooms and staff ,"the hotel is in a worse case than it was years a go.  Maintenance and details are not paid attention to.  Each floor used to be scented and now it smells like a run down hotel, each room used to smell like the essence of ME but not anymore.  All the candles in the room used to be lit after turnover service which doesn't happen anymore.  the sliding doors makes a lot of squeaking noises. The bath tub has a scratch colored in Black for some reason.  The safe box in my room was dangerous to operate since the arm of the safe is broken so it slammed shut on my fingers several times and when I asked for it to be fixed they said it is the way it operates which I am sure it is not because they have the same safe in different hotels let alone the safe battery was weak and not functioning. Bathroom facets have rust all around it which looks very disgusting and unhygienic at all. the secondary light in the main shower area was not operational.  House keeping forgot to close the connecting doors to my corner suite which resulted in someone entering my room and luckily I was awake when it happened.  The concierge service back in 2017 was much more friendly than the current standard that you have and I am judging by their attitude towards guests and the attitude in a message that was sent to me which I have up to this date to prove. The TV's in the suite could use an upgrade and it will be preferable to have electrical shades since there are around 4-5 shades in the suite.

148,Don‚Äôt miss this hotel when you in London!!,"An excellent hotel in every possible parameter. 
The hotel is brilliantly clean, the rooms are large and spacious and exactly as shown in the pictures. 
The service is excellent, the breakfast was amazing, the atmosphere is excellent, the hotel's restaurants are excellent. warmly recommended.",5,2023,10,05
148,A wonderful hotel,"We stayed on a Saturday night for a last minute birthday and anniversary treat. Welcome glass of Champagne on arrival, extremely helpful/friendly staff. Wonderful modern hotel, the corridors are dark but this is all part of the style. We booked breakfast which we had in the rooftop bar, a wonderful view of London and what an amazing breakfast, we would definitely stay here again. Thank you ME.",5,2023,10,03
148,Bad value for money,"we spent a weekend in this hotel , booking the penthouse. 

The person who showed us the room discovered it at the same time as us and was unable to answer our questions.
 
The room is not well organized, and the cleaning is very poorly done, dirty cotton swabs in the trash can, the floor was all sticky, full of marks, we reported upon our arrival that the bathroom sink was clogged and no one came to repair it.

Every night we were very disturbed by the very loud music from the roof bar (we were just below), impossible to sleep with this noise...

the hotel guarantees you, access to the bar directly from the room but both times we were unable to enter because there were tarpaulins to protect against the wind.

And to finish when you book this level of room, the least you can do is not charge for the mini bar‚Ä¶",3,2023,10,02
148,Best hotel i‚Äôve ever stayed at,"When i first entered the hotel, The design and walls were gorgeous, Its a dimly lit, elegant hotel. The lobby is out of this world, The seating is spacious and comfortable, The service is amazing, the staff is kind and welcoming. My room was clean and ready made, The bed was snug and pleasant. The room itself was well lit and had a beautiful bathroom with vanity-like mirrors. All lights can be controlled by a panel which i found very entertaining and accessible. I highly recommend this hotel, great for a long stay.",5,2023,09,25
148,Excellent,"Amazing experience, really comfy rooms, excelent customer service and the workers are really kind.
I felt that they really care about cotumers and the experience you have in the hotel. 
Really nice breakfast as well.",5,2023,09,24
148,Non existent customer service ,"Currently staying at the Penthouse and honestly the customer service here is non-existent. If you would love pay ¬£2000+ a night and get zero service then do stay here. The only reason it isn‚Äôt a 1 star is because the location is spot on and the views from my glass dome room are gorgeous whether if it‚Äôs day or night. Breakfast is average, acceptable. Check in is a nightmare worst guest services I‚Äôve ever seen. Room is a little dated‚Ä¶. And not very clean. Layout a little odd and super tiny wardrobe I can‚Äôt even justify. No special service or concierge for staying at the penthouse. Don‚Äôt expect to be treated any different. I wrote a request for sparkling water to be stocked in my fridge but it was not done. Went down to the lobby to ask for it and still did not come. ",2,2023,09,22
148,Is this actually a Hotel?,"Oh dear! 
Q: What happens when a 5 star hotel forgets about its raison d‚Äô√™tre? 
A: You get the ME London! 
Shockingly bad customer service throuout our stay.
You enter this hotel on the ground floor and are immediately fumigated by cheap scent sprayed around the foyer, I suspect in an attempt to keep the hoi polloi from entering the building? 
Then into the lift lobby where there are 2 general lifts for the 157 guest rooms but the keycard system in the lift doesn‚Äôt work and indeed, the staff all appear to know this! The reason I suspect is thst the hotel isn‚Äôt particularly interested in the actual paying guests. 
Oh no. It simply wants to whisk the moneyed party goers upstairs to the Radio rooftop bar to pay over the top for cocktails, the DJ and to be seen and to see (the view).
Check-in was a joke. The front of house was rude and couldn‚Äôt find my reservation despite me clearly explaining I‚Äôd checked-in on-line. 
No welcome drink offered (Meli√° Reward Card Member).
Rooms are ok when inside but the corridors are so dimly lit that you need your phone torch to identify where to put your keycard to enter the room.
The beds are super comfortable and bathrooms sizeable and well equipped for a London hotel.
Breakfast didn‚Äôt seem to have any tea available? What was going on?
Oh by the way, you know that thing where you get a nice letter from the Hotel Manager welcoming you to the hotel? Well mine was addressed to a completely different guest. Very poor!
5 stars? You‚Äôre having a laugh! 
There are plenty of fine establishments within a stone‚Äôs throw of the ME London. Go elsewhere!",2,2023,09,17
148,"DISASTER from start to finish, The BEST concierge service ever received.","We recently had the misfortune of staying at the MEHotel, and we must say it was an absolute disaster from start to finish. I had high expectations for a comfortable and enjoyable stay, but unfortunately, my experience was plagued with issues in several areas, including maintenance, food, and keycards.

Firstly, the maintenance of the hotel was severely lacking, blocked sinks, AC. Upon entering my room, I immediately noticed a stain marbles in the bathroom that continuously enjoyed during my stay.  Despite reporting the issues to the front desk multiple times, no action was taken to address this problem. The lack of attention to such basic maintenance was disappointing and frustrating. I asked to speak with manager at the check out, after sitting 40 minutes in reception I noticed arrival guest was offered champagne on arrival. Why I was not offered on arrival??? Moreover manager did not come and speak with us and we left. 

General cleanliness and upkeep of the hotel left much to be desired. The hallways had a musty smell, and the carpets appeared worn and dirty. It was clear that the hotel was not properly maintained, giving an overall unhygienic and unpleasant impression.

The dining experience was equally disappointing.  Being vegetarian the options provided were limited (staff member offered steak???? when asked what vegetarian option she would suggest), and the quality was far from satisfactory. Additionally, the service at the restaurant was slow, with the staff seeming uninterested and inattentive to the needs of the guests. At the breakfast we had to wait 40 minutes to be served, which ruined our morning plans, however after speaking with Victor at the concierge on our second morning he made our stay more enjoyable, planning our itinerary and suggesting easiest routes, tips and places to avoid and explore the city. 

Another major inconvenience during my stay was the malfunctioning keycards. It seemed that every time I tried to access my room, lifts, the keycards would not work, forcing me to repeatedly seek assistance from the front desk and not even an apology. Overall we approached front desk 10 times to cut keycard This inconvenience added unnecessary frustration and wasted valuable time that could have been spent enjoying my stay.

Overall, my stay at the ME Hotel was nothing short of a disaster. The lack of maintenance, poor food quality, and constant issues with keycards made for an extremely unpleasant experience. I would strongly advise others to steer clear of this establishment, as there are surely better options available that provide a comfortable and hassle-free stay. We have to say thank you to Victor, who actually cared about us and made our first time visit in London memorable, with his suggestions and his kind attitude towards us. Sadly we couldn't leave any tip to him, as on our departure he was off.

The stay deserves strong one star, as Victor at the concierge desk was fantastic, we decided to leave 3 star review, as he truly cares of guest experience. 6,6 feet luggage porter was great too.

TIPS: Stay only because of location and comfortable bed - DO NOT expect 5 star service from staff member apart of the concierge team (Victor) who was the best concierge in over 7 years of travelling. They charged us 300$ for incidentals for 3 night stay, when everything was prepaid and lady at the reception responded ""If you break something we will charge you"".

148,Great stay,"Wonderful place to stay in London!  Can‚Äôt say enough about our stay at me hotel London. Good location, walking distance to everything and great friendly staff. Rooms are good size with large bathrooms. Our first night we had some difficulties with the AC and Tv. Uda, the night manger responded quickly saw we were exhausted and came to the rescue. Uda tried to quickly fix and when he was unable he without hesitation relocated us to another room saving our trip. We were able to get a good night sleep and enjoy London the next day. Highly recommend hotel and thank you Uda!!!",5,2023,09,07
148,Couldn‚Äôt recommend enough! ,"What a vibe this place is! The moment you go in you‚Äôre met with a great reception from the staff. The place is modern, chilled and the location is perfect. Fantastic hotel to escape the hustle and bustle of London. We‚Äôve stayed in lots of 5 stars throughout London and this for us is up there with the best. Great for leisure and business! Until next time! ",5,2023,09,07
148,great hotel with great amenities,"the room was amazing, staff was friendly & helped with our preferences. glad i didn‚Äôt have to stop using the gym for the stay and used the hotels! there was an array of options for food and v v close proximity to all the tourist spots.",5,2023,09,03
148,Very aggressive rude staff,"Stayed as train strikes and family coming up by car, as bday next day thought treat ourselves for a nice hotel with parking.   Booked on booking.com paid on that site - 409 for 3 adults one child.   When arrived at hotel at 7pm having been working all day and family travelling by car still on way, thought check in and meet husband in car as the concierge only gave me a map where car should be parked and as no
Where to pull up thought best get in car with husband to find parking - anyway this was my plan notwithstanding advertises as valet parking.   Went to reception to check in and after waiting for guest before me to check in for 10 mins, thought this should be quick as has booking reference and emails to hand.  Anyway the lady checking in couldn‚Äôt find my booking - she clicked and clicked on the keyboard for 20 mins not saying much.   She then said she needed to speak to management and waited another 10 mins - called husband who nearly arriving at hotel thought still had time.    Anyway booking found but issue with room and they said they needed to change as 3 of us (even tho booked for this) they tried to say that now be 509 for room and o told them that booking.com said 409.    They agreed to keep the price and invoice printed which said ¬£0 as paid on booking.con.   Anyway insisted I pay 409 plus 100 on card machine and I did this as was now nearly 40 mins and needed to just check in so could meet husband.  Anyway told after put pin in and it went through that not gone through and would need to pay again but this time 100.  I was very confused and the manager Lucino came out and explained that as had already said that I had paid on booking.com and hence they didn‚Äôt take the payment previous made on card machine but would need to pay the 100 for deposit.  Very confused and was disappointed and said I should have stayed somewhere else and he said fine stay somewhere else - I said can I have a refund and he said speak to booking.com - this was now 845pm - husband and 12 year old traveled for 3 hours to meet me - didn‚Äôt think best idea for me to then spend another 30 mins speaking to booking.Com to arrange refund and then find another hotel - at this point husband driving around and around hotel trying to find the car park.   I paid was given the card not told has to insert in lift to get to floors.   By 9pm met husband and daughter all of us extremely stressed - i upset as thought spent 1k on one room for night and tried to call bank to find out.  Night ruined.   Management aggressive and couldn‚Äôt care less that child coming to London and the stressful scenario she was about to walk into - very very improffesional on their part - I stay in hotels a lot for business ans can stay would rather stay in 2 star with good service then alleged 5 star with staff that want to fight you.   Awful , incompetent and will be making further complaint to head office.
 When checked out
They asked for further monies to cover a further charge and refused.",1,2023,09,03
148,Great second stay!,A fantastic second stay at Melia ME London. They knew it was our wedding anniversary and made it extra special with a room upgrade and a half bottle of champagne waiting in our room. Well done Melia :),5,2023,09,01
148,"Stylish, modern, and with an exquisite service","Style, modernity, and world-class attention. Amazing architecture for a 5-star hotel with a fabulous location. The reception is unique. Exquisite service. Breakfast at the rooftop is an extraordinary start of the day. We stayed at a spacious and stylish suit. ",5,2023,08,28
148,What a hotel!,"What an amazing hotel! We received a room upgrade and I booked the Romantic package for the room as it was my partner‚Äôs birthday. The package was incredible value, loads of special balloons to mark the occasion, a small chocolate cake, champagne and the bed was decorated in ros√© petals and roses. There was even a birthday message written next to the tv. The room was big, with a lounge, large bathroom, walk-in shower and good size bedroom. 
When we checked in we received a free glass of champagne and all the staff were very attentive. My partner doesn‚Äôt like lifts so we were shown round the stairs, normally just for the staff and emergencies, and later in the evening we climbed 10 floors to the Radio Roof Top bar! 

Overall a great night and day, a hotel like no other in London, superb staff all round the hotel. Highly recommend.",5,2023,08,27
148,"Nice, clean, friendly, quality.","Lobby is on the first. Because of the amazing view upwards.
Staff very friendly. Elevator system takes some getting used to with the cards. Works not on every go.
Clean room and kind of swankyness with all the darkness and RGB led lights. Nice rainfall shower, minibar and shades on the windows. We enjoyed the room very much!
Breakfast menu has a nice variety. Full English was good but salmon and eggs just as nice. You get to choose off the menu and get some bread and fruit off the bar. We also had a lunch here. Very tasty and nice view on the city (rooftop bar).
In the evening the bar was less enjoying to us. I guess its kind of go to spot. Not just for residents but had a club vide to it.
Nice restaurants closeby, good taxi spot in front.

Next time London we go here every time, no doubt. It was lovely. <3",5,2023,08,26
148,Exceptional Stay with Personalized Touches and Outstanding Service!,"I had an amazing stay at this hotel! From the personalized touches in my room to the stunning room upgrade with a balcony, every detail exceeded my expectations.

The room was spacious, modern, and impeccably clean. The friendly staff made me feel right at home, and I must mention Tawii, Jaime, Johan, and Victors for their exceptional service.

The breakfast choices were outstanding, accompanied by a captivating city view. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to this wonderful establishment!",5,2023,08,19
148,Fantastic experience in ME,"It was such an amazing experience in ME London with my family.
Friendly staff and tentative service.
The bed was super comfy and room was clean
We went to Radio for breakfast, the food was so delicious.
Will come again and highly recommend ",5,2023,08,16
148,Very disappointing,"This was a truly bad choice.
1) Inflexible staff, there was a lot of vacancy, yet the staff refused to upgrade my room for a decent fee, I was asked a very high price to get an upgrade.
2) Indecently poor breakfast, more expensive than the Shangri-la (!!!) yet poor choice, no smoked salmon at this high price, undercooked scrambled eggs... mostly cold food.
3) Rooms shaped like a corridor instead of being squarish, with poor ventilation, I felt the lack of air.
4) Automatic light in the room, when I went to toilets at night I woke up my girlfriend everytime, also noisy door to the bathroom.
5) Rooftop with a club atmosphere, meaning high volume music, and non guests that walk around the hotel, which causes a safety risk.
I wished to make beautiful pics from the rooftop, yet it was impossible as during winter it's closed off with plastics.

On the positive sides the room was stylish and the location is exceptional.",2,2023,08,10
148,Great hotel,The hotel was great staff nice location good the room was elegant with balcony and a gift  . the only negative was the early breakfast  we requested the night was not sent to the room  and we left the hotel 630 am,5,2023,08,08
148,"So Far Not Good, but you have time to fix‚Ä¶","Pros‚Ä¶ location, nice clean bathroom. Did a special little something for our anniversary. 

Negatives‚Ä¶ 
1. Reception told me our breakfast was NOT included. However, it was when we booked it. Had to argue about that and missed breakfast the first day.
2. Asked for a few extra towels, they came quickly but all had big ass black hairs on them. (See pics). 
3. Found some weird small bug in my bed. (See pics)
4. Went to work out earlier in the gym today. No antibacterial soap or lotion at all. No wipes either. Couldn‚Äôt wipe hands or wipe down the equipment, super gross for germs etc plus that little thing that happened called Covid. (See pics). 
5. Cool rooftop bar open till midnight. But not really. We went there at 11:15pm tonight, only to be told they were closing early. Went downstairs to ask if there was anywhere on-site we could get a drink after 11pm and was told ‚Äúno‚Äù even though everything online and at hotel says it‚Äôs open till midnight. Had to drink the 35¬£ small wine bottle in the mini fridge‚Ä¶ (See pics). 

The good news is it‚Äôs only Monday and we are still here till Thursday, so still time to make amends‚Ä¶",1,2023,08,07
148,Fantastic weekend at the Lodon ME,The team surprised us with welcome drinks and some perks to help us celebrate our anniversary. The breakfast at the roof top was really good and with fantastic views of the river. Overall a superb experience.,5,2023,08,07
148,An excellent hotel in the heart of London,"Its the best hotel i have ever been .It takes excellent in any aspect. The room was big with comfortable bed and pillows.The view on the streets and nearby theatre was amazing especially at nights. The inside balcony really impressed me. The architecture, the interior design especially in the reception were also amazing. The breakfast had almost everything.The guys in the bar were quite friendly and polite. I will definitely come back there whenever i visit again london!!!",5,2023,08,04
148,"Nice location, good design, roof top trendy","The atmosphere in the reception is really fantastic. The room are so beautyfull with lights that change colours.
Good location and roof top trendy, with Dj in the night.
Breakfast fast very complete.
You must see.",5,2023,08,04
148,Food and stay experience disappointing,"Room had a damp, stale odour. This was a room I upgraded too. I returned to reception to revoke my upgrade for a standard room and it too was a space I did not wish to spend any time. Stale air with damp, mouldy smell. 

Food at Radio Rooftop was very poor quality and returned the tacos. Cold, miserable portion size and visually unappetising. The vegetable spring rolls were a kin to a basic supermarket branded value item. Absolutely disgusting. Service shabby. Waited 10 minutes for a menu, drinks order arrived and was incomplete. Dismal experience.  As a resident I will not return to stay at this hotel due to the poor quality Radio Rooftop dining experience and unpleasant room scent experience. Staff pleasant.",2,2023,08,04
148,Birthday celebration ,"Have stayed at ME London to celebrate my birthday last month and invited over some friends. Everyone I or we encountered was extremely friendly and professional, from the doormen/Concierges to receptionists and all bar staff at Radio Rooftop (which is at the very top, as the name suggests). 

Thanks everyone for the wonderful stay üëã",4,2023,08,01
148,40th birthday stay,"Beautiful hotel, smells divine on entering the hotel.

Concierge are super switched on, bags whisked away within seconds of sighting us.

Clean rooms and very comfortable.

Hubby paid for package to have balloons and fizz on arrival with a message on mirror.

Sadly the message was not on the mirror, which would have been nice as I thought the hotel had made the room up for my birthday rather than it being from him.  Think he was disappointed by this, especially as cost ¬£200 & not what he paid for.

He had to tell me which didn‚Äôt seem as good as if the message had been there from him.

Rooftop area for breakfast was lovely.

Would recommend a stay here and most certainly return.

Really fabulous stay, thank you.",5,2023,07,31
148,The perfect 24hour stay in London,"I never usually bother to leave reviews but I just HAD to for the ME hotel. Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived, My friend and I were particularly impressed with the level of warm, welcoming service from all of the staff at especially the concierge. What a wonderful and charismatic team they are! 

The room was spotless and luxurious. There were so many options for food and drinks right on the doorstep of the hotel and within the hotel (STK, Radio rooftop etc)  We had reservations at places in SOHO, Mayfair and Covent garden which we were a short uber ride away from. All in all, we will most definitely be booking to stay here regularly on our visits to London. Thank you! ",5,2023,07,30
148,Meh ,"Great staff. Hotel is newer and contemporary but rooms have design flaws. Glass doors in shower and toilet do not open smoothly. It makes loud grinding noises because it rubbing on the tile floors. Towel hangers are inside toilet and shower, which is unsanitary and defeats purpose of drying. Toilet seats are not ADA friendly; 14‚Äù is too low. ADA toilet seats should be at least 17‚Äù.  Hotel rooms temperature are not cool enough. So if you like your room cold, this is not the place. Hotel‚Äôs hallways are too dark and stuffy; like a hot brothel.  ",3,2023,07,30
148,5 star,Fantastic service and atmosphere.   I will definitely return.  Great place to do business from whilst in London.  Located right in Covent Garden and has amazing style and decor to match one of London's trendiest parts,5,2023,07,30
148,Better than my wildest dreams ‚ù§Ô∏è,"This hotel has been a great find. We booked 3 rooms, there were 6 of us in total. We had gone to London to celebrate my birthday, it was arriving at the hotel and really living a fantastic experience, as soon as I entered the receptionist congratulated me on my birthday, when I entered the room she had decorated me with some balloons and champagne, Aura team wrote me a message on the wall !!! Then my friends and I went to the Rooftop and enjoyed the music and the views. The staff always very attentive, always smiling, really even though the hotel was in a perfect location, we didn't want to go anywhere but the hotel because the service was so attentive, so radiant and so kind. I'm sure it will be our Reference whenever we return to London.",5,2023,07,28
148,Extraordinary experience!,"I was with my partner for two days. I loved the experience because as soon as you enter the hotel there is an exhibition of Precious Barbie, the concierge guys greeted. All the wonderful staff, the concierge guys helped us with all the reservations, the reception, the architecture is spectacular. When we got to the room, the Aura team had decorated the room for us. We really hope to return for our next anniversary because we thought it was extraordinary!.",5,2023,07,28
148,"Beautiful Hotel, great customer service all round - Viktor at Concierge.....the best I have ever dealt with","This is a beautiful hotel in every aspect and is evident from the moment you walk in.  The service all round was fantastic. As the last leg of an extensive European holiday we had not made plans for London as we had been too busy in previous destinations.  Upon arrival we were greeted by Viktor at Concierge.  He stayed back well past his finish time and helped plan everything for the 3 days we were there from places to visit, the order in which to do them, restaurants to eat at and shows to watch.

Without a doubt, the team at ME London made our visit fun and memorable with a huge & special thanks to Viktor who takes great pride in ensuring hotel guests are looked after.......because he cares.

i would recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit London!!",5,2023,07,28
148,Just wonderful,"Wow the Me London was amazing..from the moment we walked in the door we were made to feel special, a welcome drink on arrival, ensuring we had dinner reservations, nothing was too much trouble. The Me London is structurally interesting, stylish, luxurious but with a comfortable feel to it  which was purely down to the lovely staff making us feel welcome.
It was my daughters birthday and she was made to feel very special with a totally unexpected suprise of balloons, cake and birthday message in our room.
The room was a really great size for 3 and the bed was super comfortable. The breakfast buffet in the rooftop bar was yummy so much choice.
A special mention to Jaime the manager on duty during our stay he was truly wonderful, he made sure we had what we needed and checked in on us at regular intervals to make sure we were OK ...Jaime you really made our stay memorable, we will certainly be back. I cannot recommend the Me London hotel enough, just wonderful.",5,2023,07,27
148,Always happy to be back,"Stayed with my family for the third time and now I can definitely see the hotel going back on track. The rooftop has improved a lot and breakfast offers more than ever before. Rooms are super spacious for London hotel room size, and it‚Äôs a double shower and massive wardrobe. Thanks me London for a 10/10 stay",5,2023,07,27
148,LONDONS BEST HOTEL!!!,"I was blown away by my stay. This hotel is in a different league to the other london hotels I have been to. 

All the staff are really friendly and the breakfast is to die for. My significant other had a great time too and kept complimenting the cleanliness of the Hotel. 

This place is like a fine wine it has become even better in the past year or so. 

The view from the bar at the tops is instagram worthy! 

I will be sure to be booking again next couple of months.",5,2023,07,26
148,Lovely weekend with the Hubble,"Attentive staff, room clean and well equipped, and with everything you need, whole experience was very special , we had a lovely weekend away for our anniversary. We will definitely be returning, Thankyou so much to all the staff ",5,2023,07,26

148,Excellent and Lovely experience at Me London Hotel.,Me London Hotel was one of the finest hotel‚Äôs  I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the staff. The Location was perfect. I had an excellent and lovely experience at the hotel. The staffs were friendly and helpful. I will definitely return the next time I come into London. ,5,2023,07,25
148,10/10,"This hotel is one of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in. From the concierge staff to the staff at the check in desk, all the staff in the hotel are amazing, friendly and extremely welcoming. The decor is very chic and I love the ambience of the building.
Radio rooftop was perfect for my birthday celebrations. The views of the whole of London was something to see. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who‚Äôs looking for a 5* hotel in the heart of central London.",5,2023,07,24
148,Extremely disappointing,"On arrival it took 20 minutes to check in. My son had booked in earlier and the receptionist could not seem to grasp there was more than one room on the booking with the same name.
Our luggage was not delivered to our room until after we had gone out
We were given no instruction about the hi tech room functions and struggled to change light settings and air con.
There was no bedside light on one side of the bed. Milk and orange juice supplies were not topped up. The housekeepers arrived at 8.25am on our day of departure to service the room. Otherwise the room was good.
At breakfast I asked for extra hot water for the tea. I was brought a glass of cold water. Next I was brought a cup of hot water and finally a full pot
The food was good but ordering a coffee was a long process, three requests for one coffee
On checkout, I noticed a 5% service charge which was removed.
I had paid a ¬£200 deposit on arrival as well as preauthorising the room cost. The hotel refused to deduct. The deposit and the manager was extremely condescending treating us a country bumpkins who didn‚Äôt understand how deposits worked. To be released later. It has still not been re credited to my bank.
The lift system was extremely slow, with only three lifts.
I certainly would find a much better and cheaper hotel elsewhere in London.",2,2023,07,23
148,SUPERB  - thankyou,"A very big thankyou to all the staff team at ME London. We had such a superb stay with you , welcoming staff in all areas of the hotel from the moment we arrived. Our room was excellent , clean , everything we could need for our stay was provided, beds were wonderfully comfortable,  housekeeping superb and delightful touches when we arrived back after our evenings to discover the room made ready and cosy for bedtime relaxing. Breakfast was excellent, freshly prepared and such a wonderful start to our day on the rooftop outdoor restaurant area. Bar staff and lounge areas, reception , all areas , all staff kind, helpful and welcoming throughout our stay , and a brilliant location for transport links and wandering at leisure enjoying everything there was to see and explore literally on the doorstep. Thankyou so much for a wonderful time. ",5,2023,07,22
148,READ PLEASE. Poor customer service and experience  ,"My experience in early July started out great and I had good things to say until the last day of my stay at the ME in London.  My wife returned to our room after a long warm day in London and noticed the room was extremely warm and noticed humidity building on the glass windows.  After a minute or two we discovered there was no power in our room.  We immediately called front desk and they sent a technician up.  After 20-30 minutes of attempting to reset the power in the room the technician mentioned that we had power to 1 outlet in the room , but the rest of the power (including AC) was not operating.  The technician left and stated he was going to partner up with a manager and they would be getting back to us.   Approximately 45-60 minutes later a manager (name unknown) arrived with a woman holding a long floor tube light telling us to use for the night.  I was SHOCKED to say the least!  I stated the manager how are we supposed to use the restroom? shower? etc?  Not to mention the humidity in the room with NO A/C?!?  He stated he wasn‚Äôt sure.  I explained that it was unacceptable and that he needed to relocate my wife and I for the night to another room in the hotel.  The manager stated that they were full and had no other rooms.  I began to get upset as the manager wasn‚Äôt looking for options (other than the tube light) to make us comfortable for the night.  The manager stated ‚Äúare you refusing the tube light‚Äù? I said absolutely!  i explained to him (I‚Äôm sure in a frustrated tone) if this is all he can offer he needed to partner up with his manager and come up with a solution.    He then exited the room and asked my wife an I to wait.  Another 30 minutes go by a different manager woh stated his name was ‚ÄúYohan‚Äù and he was an Assistant Executive manager Entered the room.  I finally thought we would by taken care of‚Ä¶..   Nope.  Yohan continued to reiterate that the hotel was full and he had no rooms to relocate us.  Again, flabbergasted I asked Yohan ‚Äúdo you really expect us to stay in this room with no power, air, ventilation, nothing?  He stated yes.  He had the nerve to say the room is ‚ÄúFUNCTIONAL‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶    Seriously?!?!  I explained that I booked my entire stay through an very reputable company Costco and that they would never refer members to the ME hotel if they had this level of poor service.  I then explained to Yohan that he needed to find us another hotel to stay in for the night, Yohan proceeded to tell us that ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt part of their policies‚Äù to do that.  Yohan then threw out that he would give me a 50% discount for the room for the night compensation.  He honestly thought that would make it better and my wife and I would stay in a room dark room with no air overnight!!!  Yohan had no clue it wasn‚Äôt about the money‚Ä¶.  At this point I was beside myself.  You could tell Yohan was becoming frustrated as well.  He immediately just turned and walked out of the room without saying a word to my wife or I.   He then after a short time returned to the room (remind you we are now about 2.5-3 hours into this) stating that he found us a room at a sister property across the city.   i expressed my disappointment in his customer service and how he approached the situation and began packing up our belongings.   I asked for the hotel General manager, and Yohan stated that he was the executive in the hotel.   I had to ask several more times who the Hotel General Managers name was he finally said his name is Mr. Orbitelli.  I then handed him my business card and told him that I would like to hear from Mr Orbitelli when we return to the states.  As of 1 week after returning to the states I have NOT heard from either Yohan or Mr Orbitelli offering no apologies or compensation for my wife and I inconvenience.  To add on to our disappointment we left London and went to Paris stating at another Melia property (Melia Vendome which was labeled as a ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù property) and were immediately put into an outdated room that had broken AC as well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..UGH.  Not to mention the hotel had a broken elevator.   We are extremely disappointed.  I hope that the Melia hotel chain learns from our experience and does some customer service training and updating to the Melia Vendome.

148,A fantastic visit !,"We visited this hotel last weekend and had a fantastic time! 
Our room was a superior city view and was brilliant. The room size was very generous for a central London hotel and the balcony was a brilliant addition especially as we had great weather! We took advantage of the great weather with breakfast on the balcony!
I mentioned when booking that it was our anniversary and the hotel obviously made note !
There was a personal message written on the glass above our tv wishing us a Happy anniversary and a half bottle of Tattinger which was excellent!
We also had breakfast in the roof top bar and this was amazing!
Upon checking out a member of staff personally checked we had a good stay and I think little touches like this make a great hotel!
Overall this hotel was fantastic and we will definitely return soon!",5,2023,07,13
148,Not 5 Star Quality,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights and honestly expected much better for the price and the 5 star hotel class. The hallways are very very dark which caused a safety concern when coming and going at odd hours.  The elevators do require a room key to be swiped before accessing the floors where guests stay which helped alleviate the safety concern. 
The air conditioning did not work very well in our room, to the extent that it made it difficult to sleep at night. The room itself and the bathroom were both tiny for the price, and there was very very limited closet space - making the room feel even smaller with two suitcases sitting in the hallway and right next to the bed.
The people we dealt with were all very kind and helpful, and the location was wonderful for easy access to most of the main London attractions and theaters. Other than that, we didn't have glowing reviews of ME London and don't plan to return.",3,2023,07,12
148,Amazing stay,"Stayed here last week with my fianc√© and we had the most amazing experience. We have become fond of the Meli√° experience as we‚Äôve stayed in many around the world. This hotel, however was one of the best. I can‚Äôt thank our concierge Victor enough. He was the cherry on top so to speak. The rooftop cafe is a nice touch. The room was spacious and modern. We will definitely be returning soon.",5,2023,07,07
148,Disappointing Hotel,"We stayed here at the recommendation of our travel agent and that was a mistake. The hotel is very dark ‚Äî so much so the hallways do not feel particularly safe. The check-in process was a mess due to an unsupervised trainee. A (warm) bottle of wine was sent up by the manager as an apology. Our rooms had multiple stains and scuffs but housekeeping was outstanding and did the best they could. The location is excellent for the theater district but we walked by many, many other options.",3,2023,07,07
148,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel in every way of you want a touch of class and no stress when you‚Äôre working away. From the minute I walked in they had everything under control from restaurant booking to a meeting room hire.
The rooms are beautifully presented with everything you could need and the food is Michelin star. 
I was only there for work for two nights but wish I could have stayed longer.",5,2023,07,04
148,Fantastic weekend treat! First class! ,"From the moment we arrived until we checked out, our stay and experience at ME London has been first class.

All in all I would not hesitate to recommend ME London and we will be back for birthday and Christmas!

Thanks so much Team ME London.",5,2023,07,04
148,Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location,"We had an overnight stay and only wish it could have been longer. Absolutely brilliant location, close to public transport. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and has a real WOW factor, the staff we encountered were all lovely and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us . Our room was really comfortable with a great view. The only downside was I wish we had stayed longer. We will definitely be back.",5,2023,07,04

148,First time in London,"We spent the last week June 18-26th at the ME London hotel. It was arranged for us by Shane Lawrence.
It was our first time in London and we had plans to attend the Chicago Cubs vs St. Louis Cardinals games at the end of our stay. 
From the time we checked in and all through the week your staff were wonderful. Especially Viktors  and Mattia who helped guide us to the best activities each day - great restaurants and were so helpful in securing reservations - a personal guide and a chauffeur for our ballgame transportation. 
Our visit was wonderful and your fabulous staff certainly helped make it the best possible week. 
If our travels bring us back to London we would look forward to staying there again. ",5,2023,06,28
148,Modern Drama and Great Staff,"The location of the hotel was great for what my husband and I wanted to go see. We were within walking distance and easy access to buses and other transportation. The hotel was very modern and dramatic in theme. The registration lobby was especially dramatic. The ceiling has a high pyramid skylight and offers sparkling wine while you wait. The room had a nice view. 

The best part of our stay was the concierge staff! Especially Victor!! He had very such personalized advice to our sightseeing desires. He kept us actively sightseeing while avoiding the area where the London Marathon was going on that day. Victor, Justin, and Peter were wonderful. We felt so welcome there and hated to leave.

148,Fantastic!,"We had an absolutely brilliant stay at ME London. Everything was pure perfection, including the location, rooms, F&B (Radio Rooftop is a must visit), and of course the service. We also visited Gino's restaurant Luciano's serving decent Italian food. 

Highly recommend!!!",5,2023,06,20
148,Don‚Äôt book,"We booked this hotel based on the great reviews and the fact that we could get adjoining rooms to accommodate 4 adults. We had requested early checkin prior to arriving as one of our party was heavily pregnant. Firstly on arrival at the hotel we waited about 20-30 mins before even getting to speak to anyone at reception. We weren‚Äôt offered welcome drinks that were on display. When we finally got to speak to someone she told us that whilst our room wasn‚Äôt ready she had us down as a priority and would call us once the room was available. We left our cases at the hotel and ventured out, waiting for a call. At 4.30pm in the afternoon we decided to return to the hotel as no one had contacted us. We managed to get into our room at this point after some issues with our keys and the lifts. Due to this we ended up slightly late (15 mins) for our reservation at the radio rooftop. We were told that our table outside had been given to someone else and that there was only availability  inside. We asked if we could move outside once a table became available and were quite rudely told no - once we sat down we could not change tables. The staff we dealt with a the radio rooftop were all quite unhelpful and rude. Again, checkout was unpleasant with the same woman who had told us she would call when our room was ready. She asked us if we had any problems with our stay and when we told her we didn‚Äôt get a call to check in she simply replied that she had gone home for the day! Not even as much as a simple apology for the mix up! Having stayed in lots of other 5 star hotels, both in London and other parts of the world, this hotel simply does not meet the standard of most others. There‚Äôs far better hotels in London.",2,2023,06,15
148,Amazing Hotel & Incredible Staff,"This was our first time visiting London and we were completely blown away by this hotel and the kind and incredible staff. Tina and her team (Aura Team) made our stay unforgettable! Absolute perfection!
We have stayed at many Meli√° hotels throughout Europe and each one has been special. Thank you so much for adding a little magic to our trip, we cannot wait to return!",5,2023,06,15
148,Modern and quiet yet small.,"This is a very modern hotel with avant garde style and was generally remarkably quiet despite a busy city area.  The roof top restaurant/bar played extremely loud music on the weekends that we could hear in our 9th floor room but it did not impair our sleep. The room itself was small and had no place to sit except the bed.  No small frigerator or coffee maker.  A bit surprising given the cost for a room.  Overall, not a big deal if one does not need a desk or a couple of chairs to watch the TV.  The location was very nice and we could walk to many sites",5,2023,06,08

148,Quite unexpected,"Be aware - this is more a party hub than anything else. Rooms are nice, but getting there is quite unpleasant. As my fellow travel partner put it - this place is a cocaine party including throw up. Not a 5* experience.",1,2023,06,06

148,"Great location and modern hotel, but value for money is not great and not so good service","Great location and hotel, but room and service was not as expected. Reception was not so knowledgeable, example: breakfast discount for children? Did not know. We never got any general info about breakfast either, where it was located (is in 10.floor) did someone else tell is",3,2023,06,03
148,Not Sure About This Place,I don't know what to think about this place. This was the last night of our vacation and our travel agent evidently wanted us to go out in style. It is close to attractions. Close to where our tour started. We had a great view of the London skyline from our balcony. Room service food was good our first night. Our room was comfortable. But it's so overly ultra-modern that it makes you wonder what the architect was thinking and detracted from our enjoyment. The hallways are almost dark. Mostly shiny black walls with chrome and mirrors. We would have preferred something more traditional.,4,2023,06,02
148,WORST LONDON HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!,"WORST LONDON HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!
- and I spend over 200 nights a year in hotels due to my work... And most of my reviews are very positive since that's how I see life. :-)

I won't give anything more than a 1-star review to a hotel which is being run by people who don't have a shred of empathy for their clients/fellow-humans and they only care keeping our money without offering us any service.

We were planning to stay here for 2 nights a few weeks ago.
Sadly, a few days before our stay, my father passed and we had to postpone our trip to London to attend his funeral in Greece.

We contacted the hotel to explain our extraordinary circumstances. They didn't really care much and they were not willing to give us the option to use our two fully paid nights for a future stay that worked for us. We were even happy to pay for the price difference in case the new dates cost more than our original reservation.

But no, your father dies and you can't come, you lose your money. Simple.

Yes, business is business, I get that. But we were not asking for any big favors or any kind of discount. We were just asking to be given the chance to use what we had already paid a lot of money for.

(FYI Ethical business-running is the best marketing a company can do in 2023.)",1,2023,05,31
148,A must stay!,"We had a fabulous stay over the May bank holiday weekend for our first anniversary with Me London. 
The hotel/staff/location/room/service as always with Meli√° is the reason we book. We were upgraded to a balcony overlooking the strand, which was stunning. 
Also, they where able to check us into to our room early, which was a huge plus as we had been travelling from 4am. 
Room was cleaned everyday and they also left a little sweet treat for us to celebrate our anniversary. We will definitely come back again. Thank you!",5,2023,05,30
148,Melia quality at a reasonable price.,"Excellent hotel, brilliant location on the Strand and less than half the price of Londons famous 5 stars. Breakfast in the rooftop restaurant is special. Aura staff are superb and go beyond the usual level of service.Sri Ronitha certainly deserves a mention.  Balcony rooms are not that expensive. Only downside is that common areas are darkly lit as part of the ambience.",5,2023,05,29
148,The Perfect Night!,"We booked the ME for a nights stay after our wedding and were kindly upgraded to a suite.

The staff were more than attentive, and met our every need during the stay.

The rooms are modern and extremely spacious, with fantastic views of the Strand.

I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel more. Thank you to all the staff for their kindness!",5,2023,05,24
148,"Irresponsible staff, could have cause serious illness!","We stayed with you over the weekend, and just received the email regarding leaving a review, so thought I would share our experience.

Firstly, the hotel itself was fantastic, we stayed in room 210, the room itself was great.  Also, the concierge who took us to the check in desks and brought our bags up to the room was great, we arrived around 7pm Friday, I didn‚Äôt get his name, but he was fantastic, he showed us around the room, showed us how to use the Bluetooth speakers, change the lighting etc he was great.  We went out for a meal at STK that night which was delicious.

On the first morning, we went to the rooftop bar for breakfast.  First of all, when they sat us down, the three tables directly around us all had dirty plates and leftovers from people that weren‚Äôt cleaned away throughout the whole time we were at breakfast.   

My partner is coeliac, so cannot eat anything that contains gluten, this is not a personal choice, it‚Äôs a serious allergy.  Straight away my partner told the waitress she was coeliac so she couldn‚Äôt eat gluten and asked what on the menu she could have, the waitress said the English breakfast can be made gluten free, and they have gluten free toast, so she went for that.

Now, the most concerning part and what really, honestly spoilt our whole trip and experience dining in the hotel, after my partner had already started eating, I was looking at our breakfasts and they both looked the same, I told my girlfriend to stop eating and I‚Äôll go check it‚Äôs 100% gluten free.  The waitress came over and said that it in fact wasn‚Äôt gluten free and began to list and point what my partner could and couldn‚Äôt eat which was really quite embarrassing for my partner ‚Äúyou can eat the beans, you can‚Äôt eat the sausage, you can eat the egg, you can‚Äôt eat the black pudding [‚Ä¶]‚Äù 

This is serious, as I said before my partner is coeliac and it‚Äôs quite a serious allergy.  The waitress then said we can get you vegan sausages and something else, but my partner already wanted to leave at this point, but I said yes.  The waitress then LEFT the plate of food, of which my partner couldn‚Äôt eat and only came back with 2 vegan sausages and some potato roasties about 15 minutes later after I‚Äôd already finished with my breakfast for a good while.

It shows a real lack of understanding and knowledge of dietary requirements, if there is anything that contains gluten on my partners plate, she can‚Äôt eat any of it, she would become seriously ill if she ate something that even touched something containing gluten, but the waitress expected my girlfriend to just eat around the breakfast items that contained gluten!  The whole plate should have been taken away and a fresh fully gluten free breakfast should have been brought out, we didn‚Äôt even get an apology or a sorry and the plate with gluten free food was just left in front of my partner, knowing she wouldn‚Äôt be able to eat it.  

The following morning, we both decided to get pancakes, one gluten free for my partner and one regular for me, I said to my girlfriend this way we‚Äôll be able to see if they are different and gluten free.  I had to shout a waitress over and ask if I could order some food as we were completely forgotten about, my partners trust in getting food at the hotel was total gone by this point anyway.  When the waitress came over with two plates of pancakes and before she put them down, I asked which ones are gluten free?  She looked at a waiter behind her and said something to him and then said to us, ‚Äúthey are both gluten free‚Äù.  

Why would you give me gluten free pancakes when I specifically said 1 gluten free pancakes, 1 regular?  I genuinely think they were both gluten and unsuitable for coeliacs, the waitress just didn‚Äôt really care or think that being coeliac or requiring gluten free food was important or really matter.  It‚Äôs fair to say my partner left the breakfast as she and I had absolutely no trust that anything she was getting were gluten free.

These two mornings really spoilt our trip to Me London.  We‚Äôve stayed at other hotels in London such as the Ritz and the Savoy and they really went above and beyond to cater for my coeliac girlfriend, they even baked my partner fresh gluten free bread and gave her some to take home at the Ritz as she said it was the best gluten free bread she‚Äôd ever had.  At a similar price point this hotel is miles behind, the staff in the rooftop bar were shocking and could have caused serious illness if we had trusted what they originally said.  

All in all, very disappointed and shocked.",1,2023,05,22
148,The BEST place to stay in London,"This is our second visit to this hotel and will be our go to hotel for our trips to London moving forward. First and foremost the aesthetic of the building is one of the best I‚Äôve seen. It is modern and classy, and the reception area is quite stunning. The service is an absolute ten. When checking in our receptionist went above and beyond to explain the perks of the hotel and even gave us a personalized tour of the room. I wish I remembered her name (I remember she mentioned she is originally from Morocco), because she is someone who deserves recognition for her outstanding service. Our room was spacious and modern and even on the third floor the windows were so sound proof the room was absolutely quiet and peaceful. We went during our honey moon and the staff was so accommodating they brought up a complimentary bottle of champagne and sweets and even wrote a special message in our living area. These small touches do not go unnoticed and is the reason why we will continue to book here. Everything from the cucumber water and chocolates in the reception area, to the welcome drinks, and bath salts in our room. To note this hotel also has a beautiful rooftop bar and restaurant not to be missed and is super walkable to some of the best restaurants in London. Due to service, location and aesthetics of this hotel we will absolutely be back. Thank you so much for an amazing stay! ",5,2023,05,19

148,Awful service for ¬£2600 a night,"Just such awful service! 

Paid ¬£2600 for 1 nights stay in penthouse suite so expected at least some service bit got none.

Called to ask for something to be pressed (I apparently had 2 items free) but because the lady didn‚Äôt understand what pressed meant (I tried ironed and everything) she just put the phone down.

Then tried to call for 90 minutes to get room service but nobody picked up. Eventually got through and they bought it but they forgot to open the coke bottle. I called down for a bottle opener 3 times. It arrived 40 minutes later.

Food was really awful.

On check out they said I‚Äôd be emailed my bill - of course it didn‚Äôt happen and I had to call again to get it.

Just wouldn‚Äôt stay there.",1,2023,05,11
148,Fantastic experience,"We booked this hotel for one night , Last minute due to failed plans for our 25th wedding anniversary . 

We arrived hours earlier than the check in time of 3pm. I contacted the hotel prior via email to enquire if they could store our luggage of which they could. 
When we arrived we were escorted to check in to enquire if the room was available early . The concierge was extremely  welcoming,Professional,polite and friendly. During the conversation he asked if we were here for an occasion . Unbeknown to us he was making check in aware of our silver anniversary . 
We were checked in by the delightful Tawii . Advised our room was not quite ready but offered a welcome drink. Everything was explained in great detail and we were made to feel like VIP guests . The check in service was impeccable and all the staff are a credit to the ME brand. Had it not been our anniversary our room would have been ready but the staff organised a lovely surprise with a very personal touch in the room .
The hotel is very contemporary in design and stunning . The mood lighting on the corridors are very dark and a stark contrast to the bright rooms - we loved this! 
The room cleansed to an excellent standard . Well equipped with added extras like a Nespresso machine and pods . All the amenities anyone could wish for. 
All the staff are professional and friendly . Nothing is too much trouble. We were made to feel very special and noticed this is given to all guests . Breakfast was excellent and the staff called us by our name - a very personal touch !
The hotel is in an excellent location and a few minutes walk from Covent Garden.

The hotel's location was perfect....just a short walk to the metro station, or a perfect base to explore the West End.  Our terrace room was everything I was hoping for...modern, clean, spacious, and what a view!  From the moment we arrived and were given a welcome drink in that awe-inspiring reception area we knew we made a good choice.  Breakfast was in the lounge on the top floor overlooking London and it was delicious. This same lounge turns into a party space at night with a deejay and tons of locals looking to unwind.  I was concerned that I would hear the party from my room terrace as another reviewer had mentioned, but I did not.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Congrats to Meli√° on an amazing property!",5,2023,05,09

The decor is modern -- lots of black and mirrors.  Our room was a standard and it was clean, comfortable, large for a city hotel, had great amenities and was quiet.  The English breakfast includes a lavish buffet as well as selections from the menu. 
The roof top bar was lovely, with great views and drink options, but limited food choices. The theaters were across the street, and it was an easy walk to stores, pubs and transportation. 
Definitely a great place to stay in the London. ",5,2023,05,04

148,Fantastic experience !,"I stayed at ME London and from the moment we arrived till the moment we departed was faultless.

The lounge when we entered was spacious and was perfect for a coffee.

 The reception area was amazing and you need to look up and admire the view.

We were showed to our room we booked a Superior ME River View and was explained all about the rooms and the view was amazing.

 We had booked dinner in STK, the place to eat of my option for Steak, Food and Service was perfect.The DJ was great which gave it a brilliant atmosphere .

 We then had a drink in Radio, again the service was great and another view to die for.

 Breakfast the following morning was relaxing and was nice to admire the view again.

148,Customer service went WAY above and beyond the expected!,"The care we were shown at ME London was amazing!

Before we arrived, I asked if they had a weighted blanket I could use during my stay. (I rely on a weighted blanket at home to sleep soundly.) They secured one for me to use. Amazing!

Sri Ronitha Dhulipudi, an Aura host, was an incredible resource for us. Every day during breakfast, she'd check in with us to see if she could help in any way. She recommended the Citymapper app to help us navigate public transportation in London (game changer!), encouraged us to take the bus over the tube, because the views were much better (so true!), and even ensured fruit was in our room on mornings we had to leave before the restaurant was open. 

All of this -- and more -- went so far beyond expected customer service. 

We will be recommending the ME to any friends who visit London in the future. ",5,2023,04,13

The ability to blend multiple rooms and spaces together makes this the perfect hotel for families. We were within walking distance to all of the sites. There are multiple restaurants and a phenomenal rooftop bar all within the hotel. The hotel prioritizes their guests. Even though we didn‚Äôt have reservations, they‚Äôd ask if we were hotel guests and immediately were able to accommodate us for dinner or drinks. Justin and Victor were also incredible and were able to get us last minute tickets to many local attractions. The ME London set the bar really high.

I would not hesitate to stay here again when visiting London.  ,5,2023,04,09
148,Very rude and mean security staff,"We were celebrating a milestone birthday and enjoyed a fantastic meal at the STK. I cannot fault STK at all, it lives up to its hype. It's part of the ME hotel and for the toilets, you have to use the hotel's so you have no choice but to enter the lobby to head downstairs for the toilets. I recognised the lobby from social media and appreciated the interior so like most people, I wanted a quick photo. As soon as the phone came out to snap the photo, the security guard stormed towards us and said ""Stop, stop stop. Come on man, you shouldn't take photos in here."" We told him we didn't just stroll in for a photo and that we were dining in their restaurant. He said and I quote ""So what? Doesn't matter. You shouldn't take photos here, come on man."" and mumbled something else while making gestures as if there was something wrong with us. Of course we stopped but shocked by the way he condescendingly spoke to us. 

There was no signage and he somehow expected us to know this rule. When we went back to the restaurant, they told us we were allowed photos just outside the restaurant but there was a perimeter. Honestly, I would not have even bothered if I had known in the first place. I obviously did not need a photo. It's a private property after all, but speaking to customers like that at a 5 star hotel is rude and unprofessional. I wonder if z-list celebs and love islanders who frequent the place gets treated the same way, considering they are always taking photos at the lobby. All you have to do is go on Instagram and see the plethora of location tagged photos. Unless of course we did not look the part? When there are so many luxury hotel options in London, it's easy to filter out which ones not to stay at based on how you're treated.

We've stayed and dined at other high end hotels, like Claridge's and Landmark, where they have no issue with a quick photo to commemorate the visit (just don't over do it). Even non-guests who come in just to have a nosy get treated well. I have also come across many security staff who are incredibly lovely and just doing their jobs. As an immigrant, I appreciate that people from other countries have different mannerisms, but being polite is not much to ask for, especially at a high end hotel. 

Luckily, the staff, including security, at STK were wonderful and made my milestone birthday very memorable. I cannot wait for the next visit.",2,2023,04,08

I would stay here again however. I recommend this hotel
I booked two adjoining rooms for my two nieces and me, a birthday celebration for one of my nieces.
The staff member at check in who provided the complimentary glass of champagne is a credit to this hotel, she was attentive, friendly and professional.
As expected, the rooms were wonderfully proportioned, clean, very comfortable beds. Fluffy towels, wonderful showers, good provision of decent toiletries, wonderful view of London from the rooftop bar. The location is superb for the West End. The team wrote a birthday message for my niece in her room and provided a small treat even though I declined the extra paid for birthday service (Thank you so much for this! I misunderstood the emails which state that the birthday message is written on mirrors, it is actually written on the surroundings near the TV unit so mirrors are not affected - to note if you are short on time to go out and need your mirrors :-) )
Staff are friendly and the concierge took time to explain the art work in the entrance to my nieces which I really appreciated.
Wonderful communications prior to our stay.
The reason this is a four star rather than 5 star review is due to the four points below:
1.	The reception area is incredibly hot, I feel very sorry for the check in staff who are wearing suits with only a fan to cool them behind the desks. The heat and dark reception were bothersome as I had just walked 30 minutes through London and was already feeling hot and sweaty. I then had to wait for check in due to the issue below.
2.	When I was checking in I was told I needed photo ID, but at no point was this mentioned in any pre-checking information (it is noted that you need the card that you secured the booking). Luckily I have a jpg of my passport saved on my mobile, but there was five  minutes of confusion as to whether this was acceptable or not (I am British, I do not routinely carry photo ID with my in Britain) In the end, after initially being asked to email a copy of this jpg to reception, it was then decided it wasn't needed.
3.	On the evening we returned to the room we requested ice to deal with an injury (sprain). Non was forthcoming. Reception did not answer the call from our room so I eventually called from my mobile as an outside line. We had to do this twice before ice was delivered.
4.	At check-out someone else‚Äôs rooftop bar tab had been added to my bill. To sort this I had to look on my own mobile phone for the rooftop bar menu to check prices of the drinks we had and detail this to reception. Reception did not seem to have access to the rooftop bar‚Äôs menu (which is online). I was not convinced they would correct this so I also visited the rooftop bar to ensure this would not be charged to by account later. I wish I had the confidence in reception to have sorted this as visiting the rooftop myself made me very late for leaving London.

148,Excellent Customer Service,"Brilliant Staff service throughout our stay. Excellent Ambience. Brilliant/smiling service from Tawi, nothing was too much problem. From check in to check out...faultless.

The location of the hotel is also first class.",5,2023,03,27
148,Perfect romantic getaway,"Perfect romantic getaway 

My boyfriend  surprised me with a romantic getaway here and I loved it. Our room had rose petals on the bed and balloons and champagne. It was beautiful, we had some great cocktails on radio rooftop and dinner at STK and it was the perfect place for a romantic getaway. Service was 10/10 a beautiful treat.",5,2023,03,25
148,Disappointed after all the glowing reviews,"We checked in on the 23rd March 2023 and were really excited at the prospect.
It was my husbands 60th birthday and as such, we booked the Beyond ME+ suite to help us celebrate.
Here's what happened and what we found:
1. My husband made the booking for us as he loves to plan holidays and breaks and yet all of the communications coming back to us were addressed to Mrs Scott - and to make matters worse, in our room they had written a welcoming message stating 'Have a happy happy birthday Mrs Scott! HOW can the hotel get it so wrong, as all of the comms with the hotel had been from my husband
2. We paid our invoice on the morning of leaving for the hotel - when we arrived at check-in, we were only advised to pay again!!?? What was going on? After doing some further checks which took about 10 minutes - and please remember that we'd already checked-in online the day before, we were eventually advised that everything was in order - yes it was, because we'd paid several hours earlier and upfront
3. Our suite was large, which was great and yet...... could this room do with a serious refurb - yes it could - from curtains that were almost hanging off the runner rail; to a hole in the bottom of another; to rust stains at the bottom of both base taps in the bathroom; to no check-in directory to help you with gadgetry etc
4. If you go on their website, you'll see that for this suite, there should be two of the rooms with mini bar alcohol and nibbles displayed on a run of shelves at the side of each room - what did we find - BOTH totally empty - Oh and no coffee or tea anywhere
The one positive amongst the above, was that when we returned late afternoon to go into our room and having been to a show, we found a lovely bottle of champagne to help celebrate the day, which was very much appreciated. We then went out for a meal in the evening, to find upon returning, the champagne glasses had been removed and there were no wine or champagne glasses whatsoever available in our room to continue celebrating!
5. Finally, you'll read lots on the website about ME+ benefits - for us, there were none and indeed our only contact with the so called Aura team was a day or two earlier to our stay, to basically 'flog' other packages to us - we never heard from anyone in the aura team whilst we were there - no hello at check in; no check to see how things were going for us - simply nothing and indeed if any of the Aura team had stepped into our room before we visited, why on earth did they not spot all of that mentioned above and actually do something about it and enhance our stay - so please don't believe it will add any value to your stay apart from trying to get more money out of you
As you can see, it was a pretty disappointing stay and we feel that as a true review, it's important to share - was it worth the money - absolutely not",2,2023,03,24
148,Excellent hotel in a super location!,"Great hotel with nice, big and clean rooms.
Staff was very helpful and offered a complimentary upgrade.

Michael from Reception and Victor at the concierge were particularly attentive and made the entire stay very memorable; also nice Cava brut at the reception.

Hotel is situated within walking distance of where one wants to be in London. Highly recommended!",5,2023,03,11
148,Mega Hotel in London,a great modern hotel.  great atrium and lobby.  great service.  we had the 2 bedroom suite at the sixt floor. great view of the city.  room service also very good and everything perfectly clean.  Breakfast was perfect too.  we had everything included.  you can sit on the roof terrace and look out over London.  Breakfast quality was great.,5,2023,03,06
148,Luxury near Covent Garden,"The hotel is in a brilliant location near Covent Garden and most theatres. It's definitely a luxury hotel - for example, we were offered a glass of bubbles while checking-in (make sure to look up when in reception as it's very cool!). Our room was spacious and clean with a fresh feel.  The bathroom in particular was large, with a double rain shower. Staff were extremely conscientious and friendly. The reason I've given four stars is because the decor in communal areas is extremely dark, which I didn't like, and the room lacked a certain cosiness. We also didn't have breakfast given the price of ¬£30 each, compared to other local options.",4,2023,03,05
148,A modern luxury in the heart of London,"Great vibe, the hotel is modern and dynamic and perfect for the Gram.  Loved our room especially the terrace, the views of London were on point. We got some champagne in our room which was a nice surprise. Location was perfect, right in the centre near convent garden. Staff were super friendly and welcoming. 100% we will be back!",5,2023,03,03
148,Five Stars all round,"My wife and I spent our first wedding anniversary here and I can‚Äôt express how grateful we both are for the amazing custom and service. We felt so welcomed and looked after.
They did an incredible job in decorating our room and making it feel special.
The service in their bars and restaurants was equally warm.
Brilliant staff and hotel on a whole
Five Stars indeed.",5,2023,03,01
148,Pet-friendly review,"Pet-friendly review: Planning my stay in London with my girlfriend Aimee we decided to bring along our Chihuahua ‚ÄúTruffle‚Äù. Me London by Melia was not my first Melia group hotel experience so I booked it due to the renowned quality of the hotel chain, the perfect location on the Strand facing Somerset House and the pleasing previous stays I had the opportunity to enjoy in different parts of the world (Wien, Zanzibar, etc.). The modern interior design and the outstanding awe-inspiring cathedral-like reception were up to the expectations as well as the hotel personnel, always kind, competent and ready to satisfy all our and our dog needs (Kudos especially to Jaime from Aura Team). We had a 30sq.m. ‚ÄúVibe Guestroom‚Äù room (1304.03‚Ç¨, 2 nights) which was decorated with nice welcoming messages for our dog as well as a bone-shaped toy and soft foam bed. Consider a 50¬£ per day additional payment is needed to account for end of stay cleaning and collaterals related to the dog stay. Unfortunately we immediately noticed a damp smell in the room therefore asked for additional cleaning which was promptly organized but not sufficient and eventually we asked to move room and that was also arranged without additional costs. On the positive sides We then enjoyed the rooftop bar overviewing London‚Äôs skyline and we had dinner at the famous upscale STK restaurant located within the hotel premises. In addition on the negatives what ruined partially our stay was a fire alarm that went off both nights for the entire hotel: once at 10:30pm ca on our first night and the other at 05:30am ca on our second night ‚Äòcausing us an immediate anxiety reaction and eventually difficulties in getting back to sleep. We anyways appreciated the staff deducting from the expenses part of the costs incurred from in-room dining service for us and the dog to cope with the disappointment that such alarm provided. In a nutshell the hotel is great and the staff is nice and welcoming but unfortunately our experience was not deserving a full 5 stars rating.",4,2023,02,26
148,My Favorite Hotel in London,"This was my third stay at ME London.

It is a beautiful and superbly run hotel. It ticks all the boxes, stunning room and comfortable beds, excellent shower, excellent breakfast and decent location with Embankment, Charing Cross, Chancery Lane and Covent Garden all within easy walking distance. However, what sets it apart is the level of friendly and personal service in such a large hotel. Special mention to Justin and Kai who took exceptional care of me. And apologies for my failure to tip as I left in a hurry.

",5,2023,02,26
148,A truly outstanding experience,"A truly outstanding experience from start to finish. Every moment at ME LONDON was like no other. At every turn ME LONDON made me feel attended to and special.  From the pre arrival email that was personalized with my name,  got me so excited for my trip and was filled with all information I needed to entering a master piece of architecture which is the ME LONDON building. I was left speechless walking into the atrium but I was greeted but the kindest most attentive team who immediately offered me a glass of cava and let me sit relax and take in this remarkable feet of construction. Pol one of their incredible hosts greeted me, he asked me about my plans, I told him I was going to see Mama Mia with my mother something we had wanted to do for years I did not think much of it but when I retuned to my room after the show someone had written the most wonderful mirror message about Mama Mia next to my TV. This really sets them apart from other establishments, excellent service but even more staff that listened and always made me feel special. I wanted for nothing with the lovely ladies Jelvie and Eunice calling asking if I required any assistance to the incredible reception and management team.  Even at breakfast I was met by Jaime the charming duty manager who without me saying asked me how MAMA MIA was it just filled my heart with joy and made me feel so special. I wish I could stay there  single day! ",5,2023,02,18
148,ME London,"Visited Me London last year - amazing experience. 

The atrium is very unique and mesmerising. The decor is also stunning with a contemporary feel.

They have food 24/7 and they have 3 restaurants in the hotel. Everything I have was delicious. I loved my stay and would love to go back sometime really soon. ,5,2023,02,09
148,A wonderful stay from beginning to end,"Amazing stay from beginning to end!! I was upgraded to a suite without asking for my birthday, it‚Äôs good they recognise a valuable customer as Iv been staying here every year for my bday!! The room was amazing with a bottle of bubbly & balloons in room. 

811 was  Quiet room even though I was on 8th floor near the roof top bar.  

Reception staff are lovely even though checking in and out was a bit longer than wanted.  But cannot fault their customer service.   
Breakfast to the room was very good

You really made my stay special and I will be back again very soon. 
Thank you

148,Has gone down hill massively!!,"We've stayed here before as well as many melia hotels around the world,
My daughter booked us a show in London this weekend, so myself and my wife thought we'd make a weekend of it and book the Me hotel as we had such a good experience here before...
What met us wasn't what we had experienced before!
No concierge on the front desk, 1 lady at reception, it was like a ghost town!
Interconnected room, with very noisy people in the other room, but they eventually settled down at a reasonable time which wasn't to bad, and to be kind of expected.
The worst part was the condition of the room, last time we had a suite, and it was fantastic, this time we had a superior room, and it was shocking, ¬£400 for a crack den!
See photos, broken bed, sunken mattress, stains on bed side tables, scum and filth all over the bathroom, finished off with dried piss all around the toilet.... lovely!

Doubt we would return.",1,2023,01,29
148,An experience Beyond the accomodation!,"Awesome Hotel in a really convenience location, near many theaters and London Eye.

148,Fabulous Hotel in the heart of the theatres,"Me and my sister had a wonderful 2 night stay in January 2023.  There was an issue with the door lock on our room and we were upgraded and moved to a river-view room and had complimentary drinks in the rooftop bar.  When we returned from seeing Mamma Mia there were balloons, wine, dessert, slippers and a lovely message on the board for us, made is feel very special.  The hotel is very modern, with lovely decor, the reception atrium is stunning and the staff are super helpful and friendly.  Fantastic location, 5 mins walk from Covent Garden and right in the heart of the theatres.  ",4,2023,01,23

148,Beautiful hotel and friendly staff,"I was celebrating my anniversary and the team made us feel so welcomed. Could not recommend more this Hotel, the room was beautiful but what makes this place is the staff, super friendly.
The bed was the best out of all of the Hilton‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed in!",5,2023,01,13
148,Fantastically Dig Friendly,"Looking for a place to take your dog? This is the hotel for you! We have been on three occasions - lovely hotel and bar. You get treats, toy, poo bags and the use of a doggy bed 
You can‚Äôt take your doggy into the restaurant but the bar area has a nice menu and you can eat there ( which is very nice) 
Local transportation is also great - underground and buses nearby plus great taxi response",5,2023,01,13
148,Bizarre Experience - make sure you have your credit card people!!!,"Having stayed numerous times at MeLondon, enjoying good customer service, especially the Concierge, I have found my most recent visit rather confusing.

Paid through Booking.com before arriving as couldn‚Äôt get their website to work (annoying but not worth complaining about).

Flew into London, and arrived at MeLondon at around 10am (they accepted early check in after I called previously). I was told I was being upgraded for free, so far so good.

They required (as per their information on Booking.com) a credit card to pay for any potential incidental spending and proof of ID. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem normally, however on this occasion I did not have my cards (as it turned out later my wallet was missing).

I was abruptly told that I needed it to protect the card holder, so I presented my passport, as proof of who I was, and was happy to pay through my Apple Pay. (Remember, the room was already paid in full and I had a photo of my card)

I was then told, it was then it was company policy. And indeed, it says in the Booking.com website, you need to present a credit card.  I believe I was polite and calm, but the lady started shaking her head (later she said was the manager), saying nothing she can do. She wondered off to to the General Manager, whilst still shaking her head (why be aggressive like this?) who 5 min later confirmed they won‚Äôt check me in.

I attached the photo  of the letter I asked the lady to confirm this. 

Although, Booking.com confirmed that MeLondon would refund the money (the manager at the desk couldn‚Äôt issue the refund it directly, which I understand), the manager simply wanted to get rid of me, rather than looking to assist (at that stage) a paid up guest with alternate options. I explained that I have been coming for years, and you have lost a customer. Wished her a good day and left.

As it happens, I checked-in at the Ritz who found MeLondon‚Äôs approach rather counter intuitive too.

Conclusion‚Ä¶.

If you have a physical card stolen or lost, it is impossible to check in at MeLondon. They do not make exceptions nor allowances if a crime has been committed against customer who has paid in full already for the room. They seem to not care and management have aggressive (maybe frustrated, who knows?) body language do a customers misfortune.

The Ritz, on the other hand, great. Go there.",1,2023,01,12
148,Excellent hotel,"We have recently stayed twice over a few weeks at this hotel and both times have been exceptional!
We chose the hotel as it had secure parking but were so impressed the first time, we booked again.
The reception area was amazing, the check in staff very helpful and the whole ambience of the hotel was suberb! We were upgraded both times and on the 2nd visit as we had signed up to the IHG rewards, were greeted with a glass of champagne. It was my husbands birthday and they had put balloons, prosecco and chocolate cake in the room. The location right in the heart of the west end was fantastic and our room overlooked the Novello theatre.
Couldn't have wished for a better stay and will definitely return!!",5,2023,01,07
148,"Good service, fantastic place and excellent personal","The restaurant is a rooftop on the top of Hotel Melia, it's very beautiful and comfortable, we feel like our house.

Special mention for Jaime, he's an incredible person, and very helpfully and kind. Thanks xoxoxo",5,2023,01,04
148,Ultra hip architecture but really disorganized,"Cool enough architecture and good location, but terribly disorganized staff. Virtually impossible to spend less than an hour or two trying to modify a reservation.  Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to use the room phones to call the desk, no instructions for that or the high tech TV or even the confusing shower. 
After I checked out (a booking of several suites over several nights), I discovered I‚Äôd left a small item in my room, and when I called to see if I could get it, I was referred to Security, which actually had the item in Lost & Found. They told me to drop by and get it (as if I needed a hotel room if I lived in London), but I was already out of the country. But after several emails and phone calls to try to organize getting it back - at my expense - I kept getting pushed off to the Concierge with promises they‚Äôd get in touch with me. I live in the States so couldn‚Äôt just go pick it up. Suffice it to say, they never called back and it was never returned, so had to pay $135 for a new one. Can‚Äôt tell whether they‚Äôre dishonest or just incompetent or lazy. But at those room prices, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel for Americans.",2,2023,01,01
148,Fantastic Venue,"Went with a group of friends for a birthday, and it was incredible, impeccable service, beautiful view of London and outstanding food and drinks. Will recommend for all occasions. Will definitely be coming back soon!",5,2022,12,22
148,Starting to feel like I should change my regular hotel,"Stayed here many times and never had to complain before. Unfortunately this visit was dissapointing. The breakfast service was terrible, didn‚Äôt bring the food we ordered or the condiments we asked for. When complained, different food was bought but cold and didn‚Äôt seem to care. I got my invoice via email and found I had been charged for services which should be included in my rewards and I don‚Äôt normally get charged. When I queried they said I should of always been charged for parking but that was after ringing over 5 times to get through to someone. When I eventually spoke to a manager and told him my disappoint, he did apologise and said he‚Äôd look into the events and come back the same day - it‚Äôs now 2 days later and still no reply. I must say the general staff at this hotel are very good but the managers seem to let it down enormously. Really disappointing especially after bringing a friend along after saying how good it usually is.",1,2022,12,22
148,ME London,"Always a great stay at ME London. Rooms, scenery, staff all 10/10. Also got a complimentary upgrade which was a nice touch. 
Been a couple of times and definitely will be returning as it's one of the best hotels in London.",5,2022,12,21
148,"Great hotel, service and location","Hotel has a modern interior. Nice and clean room with a wide bed and good shower. According to the website it should be a longer bed, however that is not the case. it is a 2m long bed, too short for a 2m guy ;-). it is however also 2m wide ;-).

Hotel bar is very nice with a nice view on London. We've staid for 3 nights during our 13 yr anniversary and they have awarded us a free upgrade , a beautiful decorated room with balloons and roseleaves on the bed and a nice personal message which made a grand entrance!!
On top of that we also received a bottle of champagne and a cake! 

Dear people of ME London, Thank you very much for this wonderful surprise and we will definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to London!",5,2022,12,21
148,Amazing visit as always,"I vist the ME a few times a year with work and the hotel is amazing! The first thing you notice when you walk in is the lovely aroma.

 Last time I stayed with my husband for a night away,  we arrived just before 3pm and our room was not quite ready, we were offered complementary champagne whilst we waited and the room was available to us within 10 minutes, great service. 

The rooms are a great size for central London  and the  bathroom has a double sink and rainfall shower. 

One of the best things I like about the hotel is the Rooftop bar where you also have breakfast , there are great views of Waterloo Bridge, Somerset House and the city .

I would like to give a huge shout to Alan who looks after us everytime we stay, nothing is too much for him and he is always at the end of the phone when I need him.

I am looking forward to my next visit in the new year.",5,2022,12,20
148,ME London return,"This is the second time I have stayed at ME London, this time we stayed as a group of Friends. Everything was amazing from the start including the usual Cava on arrival. During our stay we visited both Radio rooftop for breakfast and also Jamie was able to arrange a table for us at STK on a Friday night last minute. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and we were well looked after by the host Jose! We will definitely be returning for a third time in the near future.",5,2022,12,18

148,Amazing,"Have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel. We have visited a few times now and it never disappoints. 

The hotel is absolutely stunning,  in a perfect location.

We will be returning on our next visit to London.",5,2022,12,16
148,Great stay - lovely host,"ME London is a sensational hotel - the entry into the hotel is spectacular and sleek. The hotel is extremely stylish and modern.

You are greeted at the front desk by a polite individual who takes you up to reception, you are then met with a glass of bubbly and the hosts are very polite - even when it is busy.

Whilst you wait during busy periods, you can remain entertained by the light show in the atrium and the drink.

A personal note: Tina was without a doubt the best front of the house I have ever dealt with. Her interpersonal skills are next to none and she is a lovely lady. She is polite and welcoming, a true master when it comes to the art of hospitality. 

Something to note: Guests that complain about this hotel is likely to be very rude and expects the workers to fall to their feet, if you are kind to the staff, generally staff will reciprocate this. All the ME London staff were great.

Special shoutout to Tina and I look forward to returning.

148,Great service,"We traveled to London with our one year old recently. The Me Hotel was a great home base and provided a nice crib for her. When we weren‚Äôt able to check us into our suite early as we arrived in the morning off a long flight, they provided us a different room to freshen up in and let our daughter nap in until ours was ready in the afternoon. 

The view from our room was beautiful, everything was very clean, and it had everything we needed. The staff went above and beyond to try to make our stay special, delivering champagne and fruits on our first day with balloons for our daughter, and then coming with surprises on our additional days like new animal balloons, a popcorn machine, and a gingerbread house kit. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. 

The location was also very convenient to most parts of London and cabs were easy to snag. My daughter was very impressed by all of the buses that were visible from the room windows!

The attached Italian restaurant was also very nice for an easy dinner. ",5,2022,12,03
148,Hotspot in London ,My hotspot when traveling to London. The beds are awesome and the location is superb. It is located near the tube and touristic attractions. The rooftop bar is great for pre or after dinner drinks both in and outside. ,5,2022,11,30

We had desserts waiting on us. The bathroom is spacious. The bed was very comfortable. Our room was very spacious. We had city views from the terrace. The only downside is that I found the safe very hard to open due to the heaviness.  If you have mobility issues this could propose a problem.

Just a thank you note for a wonderful few days in London, without mentioning the super location in the middle of everything:) ",5,2022,11,24
148,Lovely stay.,I stayed here a few days and it is a lovely place to be.  The location is perfect for visiting London central to most of the sites. The room was very clean and the deco was modern. The breakfast was very good and multiple options to choose from. The staff were very helpful when it came to my allergies. Would highly recommend,5,2022,11,24
148,Vacation made perfect,"We decided to celebrate our oldest turning 18 in London and a family of 5 (three kids) for 5 days could not have asked for a better stay. Let me tell you why.

Pros:
1. Location - right in the center of theaters and restaurants and a 5 min walk to Trafalgar Square. The Hop on Hop off stop was right across and the train station just 3 mins away! The perfect location also meant that it was extremely easy to flag down taxis and Ubers could drop n pick at the front door. And when the time came for us to leave at 4am, when Ubers are far n few and public transportation isn't working, the front desk had already booked us a taxi, waited for it outside while we were told to stay warm inside and loaded us into it when it arrived. A+

2. The rooms were minimal and modern and very comfortable. The bathrooms were well lit and chic. And the views from the room were an extra treat. And all rooms are made that way - you will not be stuck with a parking lot view.

3. The concierge (very informative and extremely helpful), the reservations staff (upgraded us to ensure the 5 of us would be comfortable), the Radio Rooftop staff (very friendly and attentive) and the housekeeping staff - each went above n beyond to make the stay special - without us asking. They checked up on us every day, came in to freshen up the room at least twice followed by a pillow down service with candles lit everywhere and little chocolates left bedside. 

The best part was they made my eldest's 18th birthday extra special with a surprise treat, balloons n all.  

Cons: This is not a little kid friendly hotel and no pool but they still did their best. Installed a PS4 for the kids to play and were very attentive to them in the restaurants. 

We are glad we chose ME.",5,2022,11,24

148,Great hotel and friendly staff,My husband surprised me with a birthday trip to London and this hotel. I have never heard of this brand before as we always stay at the Edition or in Shoreditch. This hotel was incredible. Its dark and mysterious so you either love it or hate it. We loved it. The team made a surprise in our room as they discovered it was a birthday celebration which was so nice. I forgot to take a photo. The team were great from Otto in the radio bar to Remus at reception. Thank you very much and see you next year. ,5,2022,11,22

148,Me experience 5* ,"Lost count of how many Melia hotels I‚Äôve stayed in now but ME London is where it‚Äôs at. Fantastic charisma from all the staff, I felt welcome at all times. Nothing was a problem and they looked after me like they always do. 

Top notch hotel. ",5,2022,11,22
148,Great team,Stayed for a week for a business meeting. Omar leads a great team at the ME. Omar goes above and beyond to care for guests' stay. The only constructive feedback is to provide a Business Center. Great location as it is very central.,5,2022,11,21
148,Lewis,"Super stay at this hotel, great staff always willing to help and go the extra mile. Would definitely recommend staying here.

148,ME London and  receptionist officer Tina - you got me at Hello!,"I have recently visited the ME London following my colleague‚Äôs recommendation following a recent stay for an anniversary. Photos I have seen were amazing!! I decided to pop in given I was in London due to my work commitments and I am considering making a booking next spring 2023 for team building or even maybe Christmas drinks! I was greeted by Tina on reception who was enthusiastic, friendly and knowledgeable and who was happy to give me a tour of the hotel and the rooftop bar is a big bonus with fantastic views across London! The reception area is stunning with futuristic visuals. I‚Äôm looking forward to my stay & team building. Tina is absolutely amazing - she talked me through about hotel history and marbles and I was absolutely in love with the gallery and lovely art displayed around bar & lobby area. I managed to speak with my management at work and we will surely email reservation team about our inquiry. ME London and Tina - you got me at Hello! Thank You. ",5,2022,11,20
148,Birthday Weekend,"Excellent  hotel, great location for Covent Garden and Theatre District. Staff very helpful, friendly and efficient.
 We had 2 rooms, the Passion Suite and Vibe Room which were both upgrades from our original booking.  
Slight issues with the heating in the bedroom - didn't seem to heat up no matter what heat setting was chosen.  It was quite mild for November when we visited so it didn't matter too much. The beds, in my opinion, were a little too hard.  However, we didn't let those things spoil our stay.",4,2022,11,15
148,ONE OF THE BEST HOTELS IN LONDON,"Unique and Exceptional atmosphere.
modern cozy rooms.  Helpful, friendly staff...especially Tina Bauer.  impossible not to have an exceptional experience in london.  
By location, trendy, dynamic restaurant with a cheerful  staff and a great selection on the menu.  
The rooftop terrace...perfect for breakfast and perfect for a few drinks in the late
 evening. ME London....the best option in london",5,2022,11,14
148,Fabulous Weekend,"Absolute wonderful Hotel and had a great two night stay with my family ,2 adults,2 Kids 

Have stayed here previously as a family and again enjoyed the facilities 

My only slight issue is that the hotel bar shuts rather  early and you cannot  get a drink whilst your with your children 

We had been to see a show and got back before 10pm and the bar was shut 

There is bars where adults can enjoy , 

Overall a fantastic stay

148,London for theatre,"Visiting London for a weekend of theatre shows and decided to stay at the ME London hotel. The hotel is conveniently located across the street from the live theatres. 

The hotel staff is absolutely amazing. Manager Omar in particular is a star and very kind and superbly professional. The concierge staff are excellent, the reception staff are welcoming and the kitchen and staff provide great dishes and a brilliant breakfast service. 

Highly recommend ME London for the incredibly convenient location and super staff service!",5,2022,11,13
148,Amazing,"The staff were so welcoming and friendly, the place was immaculate, and I genuinely couldn't have had a better stay. Jamie in particular was incredibly lovely. Breakfast was also delicious, would recommend to everyone.",5,2022,11,10
148,Amazing weekend,The service was amazing and all hotel staff were very helpful always going an extra mile which made me and my girlfriend feel extremely comfortable.

148,Miss Drummond,"I recently stayed at the ME London and my stay was absolutely fantastic. This is my second girls weekend stay. I love everything about this hotel from the rooms to the rooftop restaurant. The staff and security are so lovely and have so much patience (even after the girls day drinking). The breakfast is absolutely amazing and the views are stunning. To add to this the Lady at reception Tina is amazing, welcoming and so lovely and will do anything to help you. Thank you and See you again on our next girls trip xXx",5,2022,11,06
148,Fantastic stay at the me hotel,"What a fantastic location 
The staff were absolutely first class all of them I wish I could remember names but the occasion was made so much better by the kind bar staff and everyone working at this amazing hotel

I would recommend this hotel for the views alone but coupled with the fantastic staff and great food 
 And excellent atmosphere I know I will be back soon 

A big thank you to all the great staff in the radio bar",5,2022,10,31

148,Birthday celebration ,"We have stayed at this hotel many times over the years and I have to say this was one of the most memorable yet!!!
The complimentary room set up for Lucy‚Äôs birthday was absolutely brilliant!! Rose petals, champagne, chocolates and balloons!! (A big thank you to Jaime) 
A lovely balcony room on the 9th floor and everyone from the Aura team we dealt with were outstanding!! 

Can‚Äôt wait until our next visit!! 

",5,2022,10,25
148,"Perfect location, a statement hotel with as much emphasis on the room as the foyer","This is our 2nd stay at ME London, it‚Äôs located on the strand next to Covent Garden. For London, you could get a much better location.

As soon as we entered the checkin foyer we knew it was a special hotel. This was repeated in the rooms where we have a chic suite. The room was grey, white and black tones and felt very modern, clean and comfortable

The staff were very helpful and did all they could to make our stay comfortable

The best part of ME London is the rooftop bar where we had breakfast every morning and cocktails each night. The view is sensational and staff were attentive and made you feel comfortable.

Unfortunately it will be a while before we return as we have other places to go and see but we do plan to come back",5,2022,10,24
148,Birthday Stay,"I stayed at ME London to celebrate my birthday with my friend and our visit to the hotel was outstanding. 
Vanessa, who checked us in, was warm, friendly and knowledgeable and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. Our room had a balcony overlooking the West End, with a table and stools to enjoy the atmosphere, and it was spacious with everything we needed for the weekend. 
Vanessa booked us a table at the Radio Rooftop Bar, which had fabulous views over London. The cocktails were expensive but very good. A beautiful hotel with very friendly staff-I‚Äôd definitely go back.",5,2022,10,17
148,Excellent,Superb hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Our room was incredible. I haven‚Äôt got anything negative to say about this hotel. Everything about this place is excellent. There are two fabulous restaurants and the roof top bar with incredible views. The staff will make sure you are accommodated. The location is perfect so central. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.,5,2022,10,17
148,Michael is excellent,"We were checked in and in contact with Michael during our two night stay at this hotel. 

Michael is an exceptional person and made the whole stay an amazing experience. Nothing was too much to ask and he handled everything we needed. Would come back to this hotel and recommend based on him alone!",5,2022,10,16
148,Style over substance,"Our expectations were high after a relaxed check in with a glass of wine in an amazing reception area ( hint, look up), but the rest of the experience failed to deliver. Believe it or not, the hotel staff asked us to complain publicly because they are sick of handling complaints from customers. 

Whilst there were a number of issues the best was that the phone system didn't work, and we had to order room service by walking down to reception. After being told that it was ""user error"" a staff member finally admitted they had multiple issues with the system. The duty manager asked us to place room service orders through a WhatsApp number, but then never called back and gave us the number. He was too busy telling me that the faulty jug had been repaired, when it hadn't.

Felt like lots of communication and quality issues that you might find in a brand new hotel as it settles down - I understand a new GM has been appointed recently to fix these issues.

On the positive, great location, rooftop bar and mainly very attentive staff who were openly embarrassed by the service the hotel was providing.",2,2022,10,15
148,My new favourite hotel in the heart of London! ,Stunning hotel and impeccable service! This really is a destination hotel with the wow factor and I can‚Äôt wait for my next stay. Great location in the heart of the west end and the rooftop bar and breakfast was amazing. Huge thanks to Derek for his care and attention to detail. Was also so impressed with the lovely welcome at check-in! The tradition of bubbles on arrival really set the tone for a wonderful stay! ,5,2022,10,15
148,Fantastic hotel,"An excellent hotel, with wonderful and friendly service on the edge of Covent Garden.  A perfect location for exploring London.  The rooms are modern, clean and very well designed - it really is a pleasure to stay there. The rooftop bar is amazing, unfortunately closed at 11pm the night we arranged to go there, but the views are fantastic that we want to return.",5,2022,10,13
148,Wonderful views,"My friends and I stayed in this fabulous hotel last summer. Jaime was great (reception) always friendly and helpful. The rooftop is highly recommended, the views are amazing. The location is very convenient, right in the city center and very close to the station.",5,2022,10,12
148,AWESOME!!!,"Our first time experience was GREAR and ALL the concierge were GREAT ESPECIALLY DEAN & JOHAN and MIGUEL OMG!!! PAR EXCELLENCE!!! We WILL be back thank you.
Oh yea the manager was nice as well 
Mr.& Mrs.Peterson ",5,2022,10,11
148,Above and Beyond for Son's 18th Birthday,"I didn't stay here - I booked one of the ""Chic Suites"" for my son's 18th birthday to stay in London for the weekend with a friend.  When booking the room, I informed reservations it wasn't for me but for my son's birthday and wanted to make sure his name was on the reservation record.  That was the last of it - until I got photos texted to me from my son after arriving in the room to find it was filled with birthday balloons, chocolates, and a lovely message written on this fancy dry-erase board above the TV.

I had absolutely no idea they were going to do that - I didn't assume anything - they just took it upon themselves to do it, and in so doing started my son's birthday weekend off on such a happy note it just set the tone for the rest of his weekend.

Thank you, ME Hotel for this unexpected surprise.  This kind of service alone is deserving of a 5 star review, and you earned me major Dad points! 

We shall definitely visit this hotel again.",5,2022,10,10
148,Not what you would expect from a 5 star rated hotel,"The reception of this very particular and is really really impressive, but past that first impression, the rest is deceiving.  The hotel has a particular style, its mono colour, it's black everywhere, from carpet to walls, doors and even the lights are dimmed in the corridor and that's a bit wired, but you may or may not like it.
The room itself is ok in size, but there is absolutely no storage place for your clothing, just a few hangers and not one drawer or shelf.  There is a bed which was comfortable and a small work desk and chair and that's it, so space to but your stuff was very limited.  Bathroom was quite big with separate toilet and bath with a rain shower, but the issue was that the water pressure was so low that the rain show experience was not there at all.  The corridors are so dark that when you at the peephole in the door, you couldn't really see who was behind the door clearly.  One day, a guy knocked at the door saying that he had an instruction from his manager to remove everything from the minibar, the guy though very nice had no uniform and had only a plastic bag to carry all the bottles and snacks.  I was staying there with a group of people for a conference and many of us did not had breakfast in the morning as service was so slow, waited more than 30 minutes for an omelette.  Many of us had to leave the table without breakfast as the event was starting. Last but not least, the hotel charged me a deposit of GBP 200 for a 2 night's stay though i was part of a conference with prepaid rooms. So instead of taking an authorisation of 200 pounds, they actually debit your credit card for that amount, which was eventually, but coming from overseas, the exchange rate the bank charges me for the debit and the refund were different and ended with a difference of GBP 16 on my credit card.  Would not recommend this hotel to anyone as i travel a lot and see better 3 or 4 star and am inf act extending my stay in London after the conference and staying at cheaper hotels that are more comfortable and have a better service with better locations.  Nothing in my experience except the reception area and welcome of the staff there was like what you would expect from a hotel at his price point.",2,2022,10,07
148,Trip to London from US,First rate experience all the way around. The staff is beyond helpful and very knowledgeable about the city. The beds are a little stiff but nothing I could not live with. Our room had a Great balcony view of city of Westminster theater district. Bathrooms are large with separate room for toilet which is good when traveling with spouse. Breakfast on the rooftop was a great way to start each day.  Not far away from all of the big attractions.  10-30 minutes by taxi depending on time of day.,4,2022,10,04
148,5 Star all round!,"Everything about this experience was nothing short of 5 star. From the booking process, information given and questions I had all being answered well in advance of my stay, nothing was too much trouble. My staying experience felt like it actually mattered to the hotel and everyone inside it-  that was quite humbling. 

Every staff member felt genuine and built a rapport with you, nothing was too much trouble. It was indeed a very friendly hotel. The Location was just incredible and the theatre district felt like crept in off the streets and added such character to the stay. The interior design and rooftop bar were so beautifully crafted, a real wow feel! I was staying for my wife and I‚Äôs 10th anniversary and being from the countryside, always feel a little intimidated by the value for money of going to the city as everything seems overpriced. But I can hand on my heart say that every penny I spent here was worth it! 

Without a doubt have breakfast included as the view was great but the food and service were second to none! No matter what time of day, every interaction we had with every member. From lovely house keepers to friendly concierge and caring f&b staff to just name a few. 

I went to the shard for a dining experience during my stay and even though it was worth going once and a good thing to tick off the bucket list. I have to admit we just didn‚Äôt feel half as welcome as we did at ME, they have just mastered the high standard of professionalism without losing the genuine feel of care and you can‚Äôt put a price on that in my opinion. 

Safe to say, anytime I travel back to london or anyone I know does‚Ä¶ I will be recommended ME as the ONLY place to stay for a quality experience with a little more heart and care.",5,2022,10,04
148,One night in London,"We stayed at ME for one night as we were seeing Tina Turner the musical (go see it, it is amazing!) at the Aldwych Theatre which is just two minutes walk away.

Although expensive, the hotel is fantastic, clean, modern & has a great ambience.

All of the staff are so friendly, they treat you like royalty and cannot do enough to make your stay relaxing and enjoyable. 

We were greeted by Johan, who was so helpful, showed us around the facilities and made us feel very welcome.

Our room (102) was on the first floor, facing a very busy junction, but we never heard any road noise at all, or noise from other guests. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Everywhere was spotlessly clean.

The location is perfect, near Waterloo Bridge.

The roof top bar is fabulous and has amazing views of London.

Will definitely stay again!

Peter & Jeanie",5,2022,10,04
148,Honeymoon,"We visited ME London in our honeymoon this week, and we have nothing to say but simply AMAZING!!! Although we did left notes saying that it would be our honeymoon stays, we didn't expect ME London have prepared such wonderful decor in our room, such as the tailor-designed welcome mirror! The food and drinks were also superb on both STK and Radio Bar, and trust me you have to visit the Radio Bar it was literally the eye on the sky, which we could see the views of London in 360! Overall the stay is definitely a 5/5, and surel3 we will be back very soon!",5,2022,10,04
148,Another excellent stay,"Love this hotel.   My ‚Äúgo to‚Äù when I stay in London.  Very modern and classy.  Fabulous location.   Rooftop, Radio bar the place to be seen!   Very elegant.  Tiny hitch with our room, but immediately upgraded.  
Luca and Omar couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful.   
Will be back soon!",5,2022,10,03
148,Like being down a coal mine!,"Very trendy but!! The corridors are black with minimal lighting, totally depressing.
The rooms are adequate and the beds are comfortable . Our bath tap would not work and the bath had to be filled with a hand held shower attachment. Then the bath drainage would not work. Had ‚Äú do not disturb‚Äù on the door and the housekeeper knocked on it, probably so dark the poor woman couldn‚Äôt see the sign.
Not a very easy hotel to relax in. Style over substance.  Two of the ladies toilets on the 10th floor in the restaurant would not close, toilet seats were all lopsided.  My husband was given cold poached eggs, the toast was late and arrived with no butter. The staff would do better to stop preening themselves and concentrate on giving good customer service. So much better 5* hotels to be had in central London.",2,2022,09,30
148,Amazing anniversary break,We stayed at the me hotel from 9th September until 10th for our anniversary it really was special all the staff were absolutely amazing so welcoming so nice. I could not fault the hotel was absolutely beautiful.  Had a hiccup before I arrived and Derek manager spoke to me on the phone honestly don't hesitate to stay here had 5 star treatment and was made to feel very special. Also STK was amazing below I had a fantastic staff member who helped with allergies. Another amazing experience. Thank you so much keep up the good work.,5,2022,09,27
148,Fantastic Hotel at the heart of London,"We stayed at the ME London for two nights. The hotel is very comfortable, staff is very kind, the views from the top are amazing... just one thing, it's too dark inside, sometimes it was difficult to find the doors :)",4,2022,09,27
148,Fantastic Luxury Property at the Heart of London for a Great Value,"We stayed at the ME London for four nights after a cruise and had a fantastic stay.  The hotel has a very modern feel to it with beautiful d√©cor and well appointed rooms.  They are very large for a European hotel, and had very high-end amenities.  Rooms were cleaned daily and offered turndown service at night.  The rooms featured mood lighting, plush robes, and a wonderful rainfall shower. 

There is a beautiful rooftop bar and an STK in the lobby.  There are lots of little plusses like complementary bottled water, candies and flavored water in the lobby, and champagne at reception.

The hotel is located in the heart of London, and only a short walk to Covent Garden and many West End Theaters.  There are lots of options for great meals quick and sit down in the area.

The best thing about this hotel though is the staff.  They went above and beyond to meet our needs.  Their concierge and Aurora (front desk) teams were available 24/7 to meet any request.  I challenge you to try and hail your own taxi at the ME; it's not possible because they are so quick to jump outside and take care of it!

We had fantastic service from everyone but Matt and Justin at the concierge desk were simply fantastic and went above and beyond to assist us with requests.  They were also very easy to reach and responsive to email before our stay with recommendations and willingness to make arrangements on our behalf. 

This property was a bargain compared to other luxury properties in the area offering the same level of service at a quarter less of the price.",5,2022,09,26
148,See above,"The views from the top are amazing. This is what sells this place. 

You get a 90 minute slot. Ordered our drinks quickly. Waited nearly 15 minutes for them. Food came and looked like it came out of the freezer of Iceland stores. 

Food - poor, tiny portions, hot dishes also cold, bland. Then they forgot two dishes.

Service incredibly poor. Very slow. One speed‚Ä¶

Over rated and over priced.",2,2022,09,25
148,My go-to most excellent hotel in London,"A wonderful stay - I won't stay anywhere else.  Don't worry, it's worth it!  Wonderful design, great hospitality and a terrific location!

I've been staying here for years and it's my go-to place.  I look forward to my visit next month.",5,2022,09,21
148,What an amazing hotel,"The mode room was super big, clean, super comfy,  and with an amazing bath!
The room facilities - so good! Coffee machine, with wine for the birthday!
Great location and the staff- the best! Helped with all of our requests",5,2022,09,21
148,Worst London experience- this is a substandard hotel,"The worst experience I have ever had 
This hotel is sub standard and I recommend not to book it .
1. It‚Äôs claustrophobic (closed windows , dark interior and dark hallways ).
2. Bathrooms are horrible with some sort of a metal grate over aluminium base that never gets cleaned and smells like a sewer opening . 
3. Beds are short , your legs will pop out I‚Äôm 180 and it‚Äôs too small for me .
4. No help at reception , all problems should be resolved online (I actually had to do an online booking for another room to prove that it is available in front of the receptionist . 

I am leaving after 3 hours at this hotel and I strongly recommend not to get near it",1,2022,09,21
148,Dark and Confusing,"This is a love/hate hotel. Love it because it is located close to everything - SoHo, Westminster, HopOn bus, tubes, Big Ben. Hate it because of its layout. When you enter the hotel on the ground floor there is the concierge desk and a big vacant bar area. You are directed to the check in desk one floor up. It is very, very dark inside the hotel. Almost like you are in a 70s disco or a hotel for vampires, once you get off the elevator you find your way to the front desk. While we had prepaid reservations including a daily ""English Breakfast"", the receptionist couldn't find our reservation. Okay! then when she finally found it, debated us as to the breakfast inclusion even after we should her our Travel papers. Finally things got straightened out but we had to put a 450 pound deposit down for incidentals. $450pounds ?? Our room was on the second floor and once we exited the elevator it was pitch black even in the early morning. Very dark place, we joked this must be the place for vampires. Our room was sylishly modern and comfortable. One exception there were 'NO DRESSERS'. Where do you store your clothes beyond the small wall closet????? Unreal. We lived out of our suitcases for a week. NOT COOL. the daily breakfast was less than good but the view from the restaurant was priceless. the restaurant staff was excellent. thank god we didn't have to pay for breakfast since it was vert pricey. Good side the concierge and staff were terrific and the hotel was near Covent Garden, restaurants, Theatre and SoHo. Oh yeah, it took many days to get our deposit returned but we got it.",3,2022,09,20
148,Back on the favourites list,"I‚Äôve stayed here many times before and written reviews in the past. The last time we stayed was in August 2021 and I was disappointed with the way the rooms were. We thought we would give it another try and I‚Äôm pleased we did - the room we had was much better and the rest of the hotel was as good as it always was. The staff were great, particularly Jaime. We are pleased to say the hotel is back amongst our favourites. We will stay again.",5,2022,09,17
148,AVOID this hotel at all cost. Not worth your Money,"We booked multiple rooms as a Group as it was our friend's stag party in a pub in Charing Cross. We were advised on the phone that everything will be ready and they are happy to accommodate the group with all rooms on same floor as requested. 

When we arrived, First, the rooms weren't ready and the receptionist wasn't friendly which was a massive turnoff. We waited in reception area and were offered drinks. After nearly 30 mins, the rooms weren't ready and we were advised to wait longer.  A manager, Jamie, came and apologised and offered to leave luggage at concierge & it will be shifted to our room. 

We went upstairs to RADIO for drinks however the staff was rude and couldn't deliver drinks on time. We decided to leave hotel and book somewhere else as what we were promised, has not been delivered. 

We came at reception to speak with a Manager. The same guy, Jamie, came and apologised for overall experience however he was quite dismissive about our experience and didn't pay attention to what we were asking for. At the same time one of my friend was over the phone to reservations and realised that they are not based in UK but Spain. While I was speaking with Jamie, my friend approached receptionist who rudely advised to speak with Manager and not her. This was quite arrogant and rude from a receptionist in a Hotel where we booked multiple rooms and spent thousands.

We waited another 30 mins (90 mins in total) and then we went to our rooms. To our surprise, all the rooms were on different floor and not on the same floor as requested. Moreover, the rooms were quite hot and cleaned in a hurry. I called reservations and they kept apologising only. 

We went for drinks and then sat in Bar next to entrance of hotel on ground floor. While we were having a conversation and drinks, we were approached by one of the security individuals asking us no to be loud. I explained to him that we are all hotel guests and having our friends wedding so we are having drinks and enjoying. He was quite dismissive and very arrogant in terms of what we can or can't do. 

I went upstairs and spoke with the same and guy, Jamie, and wanted our refund however he was quite dismissive as well. 

We went out for the rest of the day but when we came back later at night, a gentleman opened the door and offered us drinks. We asked for booking in different hotel plus refund and he advised us the process and explained Hotel policy and why security was involved earlier. He also apologised about the experience during the day and offered complimentary drinks at night. There was no one in hotel apart from him and few cleaners and he delivered the drinks to our room himself. Due to Aircon not working, he moved our room and shifted our luggage.

Apart from the duty/night manager (who addressed our issues immediately), the rest of the experience was absolutely Abysmal, full of rude and arrogant staff, third class food with delayed in-room service and security staff chasing us all the time.  

The receptionists and their manager, Jamie, were rude, arrogant and dismissive. They didn't had a clue about customer service in a Hotel plus reservation miscommunication was a massive turn-off. Whenever I am in London, I stay in hotels but this is the first 5 star hotel where we, as a customers, we treated in this manner.",1,2022,09,17
148,"Stunning hotel, great location, a few issues.","Stunning hotel in a great location.
Very modern and ‚Äúmoody‚Äù with lots of shiny black walls.
The black shiny walls can be a bit of a problem as it would be easy to walk into a corner after a few post theatre drinks ü•¥ check out the basement entrance toilets and you‚Äôll see what I mean!
The room was very clean and well appointed, albeit a bit small in the width.  It leads to minimum space for clothes and no room for a proper desk and chair.  An extra metre would have sorted that out.  
The safe is a nightmare as the the lid is so heavy and the handle is so small.  All the numbers etc are worn off.
We had a 9th floor room with balcony, the latter we really enjoyed.
The roof top bar and restaurant was right above us and there is a very small amount of noise from it.  Great views from the roof top though.
The thing we really hated was the way they take 100pds/night from your credit card.  It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúhold‚Äù amount in case you do a runner without paying for the empty mini bar, it‚Äôs an actual withdrawal.  The money, or what‚Äôs left of it after paying the bar/restaurant bills, is put back into your account when you check out.  This is really unusual and I guess for UK residents it‚Äôs OK but if you are from overseas as we are, it means double the bank transfer fees and a double hit on the exchange rates.
We did object and they reduced it to 50pds/day but really, this is money spent with nothing to show  for it.
For this reason alone, we will not return to this hotel.  Pity as we enjoyed our 4 day stay here.",4,2022,09,15

148,Mrs A Park,"Myself and my husband experienced an outstanding stay at the ME London. All our expectations and needs were met, with friendly, and personable  staff. Everyone ensured we experienced a memorable stay throughout. The Aura team ensured I enjoyed and was amazed by a romantic welcome within our suite, balloons, chocolates, candles and music ensured an atmosphere which encapsulated romance and something I will treasure forever. I would highly recommend a stay at ME London, the location is perfect for sightseeing in London, and Luciano‚Äôs restaurant and the rooftop bar completed a perfect stay.",5,2022,09,13
148,Great location but not a 5 star hotel,"The hotel is in a great location, close to everything! The overall service and hotel I would not consider 5 star. Max 4 star hotel. 

The rooms are spacious, guaranteed connecting rooms is great,  location, and service form the concierge department is 5 star.

Service from the front desk and operator was lacking. We would make a request and have to keep following up with them to get an update or find out what happened on several occasions.  Check in took a while, AC was giving us issues, hot water was more like warm out of the shower head.

The night manager we spoke to was horrific, making excuses when we told him the issues we were having when he asked how our stay was. Its like dont ask if you dont want to know what's going on in the hotel. Telling us he had to investigate the issue and it may take him 2-3 hours to figure it out, then by the time we left the desk and got to the room he had a solution basically telling us we were incorrect and offered us water bottles for the inconvenience. Told him he could keep them. We spent $900/night at this hotel and someone offers you $2 water bottles. Who does that at a 5 star hotel! Didnt appreciate that at all.",3,2022,09,11
148,Not 5* but still good,"I paid such a lot of money to stay here. Do I think the rooms are worth that amount of money? No. Was it a good hotel? Yes. 
After reading the reviews for Radio rooftop bar I was so worried about going for breakfast but the staff were lovely! Very accommodating. 
We had a balcony which was fab but the rooms are tiny. Reception staff were great, very attentive. I did say a few times via email and phone call that it was my sons birthday while we were there which wasn‚Äôt acknowledged by anyone or in the room but they did help us a lot with an extra bed. Room service is a bit slow, waited an hour and 30 mins for some food to be delivered. 
It‚Äôs an ok hotel, staff were great but it‚Äôs not 5*.",4,2022,08,15
148,Absolutely Fabulous!,Stayed at the ME London with my daughter in a Chic Suite. One of the nicest hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The staff were so friendly and professional and the hotel itself is just WOW!!!  I can‚Äôt wait to return next year for another Mother/daughter trip.,5,2022,08,08
148,Best day,"We booked into this hotel as we had tickets to theatre and didn't want to travel home after, best stay in a hotel we have had in a long time (and we have stayed in many this year) staff were lovely room was super comfy ,connected the Bluetooth and had our music on full volume. Only small thing we didn't like was the rooftop bar although very beautiful they had a very strict policy on no dancing even a little movement by your chair was frowned upon...to the point security came over to the people on the table next to us, who were really lovely and just there to have a god time.. I think if you like to sit and be boring a take lots of pics for insta you will be OK there. I have been before for lunch and that was lovely, but just thought they were a bit ott especially as the dj was playing dance tunes...over all fantastic place to stay loved it and would definatly return x",5,2022,08,08
148,"Hot, Eggy, Sex Dungeon","Whoever‚Äôs idea it was to design the hotel with numerous pitch black corridors ought to be arrested. Between the overwhelming aroma of rotten eggs that persisted through your week long stay, and the overbearing heat in the room, I felt nauseous from start to finish. (Also windows don‚Äôt open). 

Service did nothing to fix the problem after numerous complaints. Though to be fair, even if none of those problems existed, the room still wouldn‚Äôt have been worth more than 10 pounds a night. This, of course, is entirely due to ungodly discomfort provided by the beds. Do you like laying on springs? Sharp, hard, uncomfortable springs? What about sleeping on two twin sized beds pushed together and often falling into the canyon between the beds? 

Now for the price of a luxury hotel, and the cost of a chiropractor and pain meds to compensate for the beds, I never felt more ripped off in my life. I‚Äôve stayed on nicer motels in the USA.",1,2022,08,07
148,Good 4 stsr not 5,"Let me start off with the positives

The hotel is very chic,  modern with clean lines and the art in the lobby is excellent.
Views from the 10th floor bar over London.
Shower fantastic
STK restaurant excellent, the staff fantastic, I highly recommend.

Now for the negatives.
Aldbourne n arrival we had to wait 10 mins for someone to show up at the front dest to explain we're we had to go for check-in.
Check-in staff not that friendly and appeared to be there to work not care about the guests.
Our room was ok,  bed very uncomfortable as the sheets.
AC kept cutting out throughout the night and had to be reset several times.
There was mildew in our shower as well as our other 2 rooms our kids were staying in
No AC on floor hallways,  extremely hot,  in fact like a sauna.
Cleaners woke us up at 9 to clean the rooms both mornings
10 th restaurant, staff are terrible, untidy with shirts hanging out. We even got told after dinner around 10:30/11 we couldn't get cocktails , just wine, mixed drinks and champagne WTF.
Breakfast was just as bad there, staff not friendly, messed up our order (food was good though), took forever for service.
When coming and going the bellmen or whatever they are called didn't even try to assist you with catch a cab.
It was worse when leaving,  collected our bags from the room,  left them at their desk on the ground floor,  when we collected they wouldn't even assist us again to get a cab. Definitely not 5 star service. Check out staff were confused with our bill and didn't understand how to deduct out deposit from our account extras. 

If you want a trendy hotel with crap service. I'd highly recommend staying somewhere else.

We definitely won't return to stay at the hotel but will return to STK as this is one of our favourite steak restaurants in London and this was the only reason we stayed at ME. ",3,2022,08,07
148,Amazing,"A very nice great located hotel. Cool interior and nice staff. The only thing was the AC in the room that wasnt 100% working, we told the frontdesk and they promised to send someone up but nobody came. Great breakfast on the rooftop.",4,2022,08,02
148,Gem of a hotel,"After a disaster at another hotel, we booked this online then turned up 5 minutes later. We‚Äôd booked a Chic Suite for 3 nights. Due to our late booking, on arrival we were told we had been allocated an accessible room on the first floor. This wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the booking. The reality was that there was a few extra handles in the bathroom, and the window wasn‚Äôt floor to ceiling being on the first floor. Other than that it was fine. However, we did ask the manager if we could have an upgrade instead and we were graciously given one night in one of the passion suites. Both rooms were great. Beds were comfy; view was good; air con was good. Bath in the passion suite was huge, a 3-4 person size one. Minibar was well stocked. Showers were great but slightly blocked at the head (if you have a rain-shower you‚Äôll know what I mean).

The booking includes 2x free cocktails per night at the rooftop bar- we took these one night but were out the rest. Cocktails were nice and view was good. Also included free laundering of 2x items but we didn‚Äôt use this.

Lots of good amenities are provided. Body wash, shampoo, conditioner, shaving kit, dental kit, vanity kit, hairdryers, straighteners (GHD is passion suite and Remingtons in Chic suite), and a steamer.

Only downside was general ‚Äúfaffing‚Äù at reception- when we checked in and when we moved rooms. It might be because they‚Äôre trying to react to arrivals, but it just seems to take a long while. They have multiple seats and free cava/water, which is nice, but gives an indication of how long it takes to check in.

Hotel is opposite Novello theatre (Mamma Mia) and next door to Lucianos (Gino d‚Äôcampo), and walking distance to all local theatres.

Tips-
-Buy bottled water and bring it with you. Mini at water was ¬£10 a bottle.
-Book a chic suite or passion suite- both were great.
- book your rooftop cocktails early and ask for a seat with a view- it‚Äôs booked up early otherwise.
- Loads of cafes within 50m of hotel do breakfast for two for ¬£20 instead of ¬£100.",4,2022,08,01
148,Great 5* Hotel with amazing views of London.,"Stayed in this hotel kick off my husband‚Äôs birthday in London. I have been into this building before but only to use the rooftop bar. This time I was able to experience the hotel itself. On arrival, you are greeted with a beautiful scent with fragrance fruity notes of watermelon and a hint of vanilla. The reception area was quite futuristic. Minimalist but the design is very clear- a shape of a pyramid with walls being projected with hologram of images such as sea creatures and moving lights. The hotel has a dark interiors around using only spotlight of lights to where you need access such lift areas and doorways. We stayed  on the 8th floor and there is another scent when the lift opened, it was more like a velvet rose and oud scent. The room is a great size overlooking street leading to covent garden. They wrote a birthday greeting on the wall and a few silver and black balloons which was a lovely touch. We went to the rooftop bar in the evening and it was buzzing. We managed to secure a table outside with an amazing view of London in the evening. You get a good view the London eye and the Westminster. Drinks were very good and the atmosphere was great.

Our room comes with breakfast and this was served on the top floor. Again, the view were incredible. The breakfast has a good continental selection with cold meats and smoked salmon and fresh baked croissants. You are allowed to order a hot meal from traditional full English breakfast, eggs royale and avocado on toast with poached eggs. It was indeed a very good experience and we be back in the near future.",5,2022,07,30
148,Great hotel,"Lovely futuristic hotel at the heart of London, reception staffs were nice and helpful - big spacious rooms with air conditioning. The breakfast staffs were superb and always willing to help.

148,Amazing Hotel amazing location,We Stayed in this gorgeous modern hotel in the Passion suite with our 3 children. Greeted at reception with a glass of bubbles and nothing was too much trouble. We were running late for our dinner reservation and the hotel dealt with it and amended our time at the local restaurant which enabled us to visit the fabulous rooftop bar. The location is fabulous. Staff and service was great. They even arranged balloons last minute in the room for a suprise.,5,2022,07,16
148,Wonderful Stay at ME London,"I highly recommend ME London. The location is excellent.  The room was lovely    The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and courteous.   The concierge went above and beyond whether we needed help with dining, directions, getting a cab, or even when I need the use of a business center for a few hours.   The bar and restaurant upstairs were wonderful.",5,2022,07,12
148,Terrible service. Avoid.,"Stayed here for 4 nights in July.  This is NOT a five star hotel. Service levels were so bad I may as well have stayed at a motel.

Couldn't ever manage to get in touch with the front desk when I called (literally not one time).  Tried to order room service 5 or 6 times (including during daytime hours), managed to get through to someone just twice.  I've been trying to call the front desk for days to get them to send me an itemized bill, haven't gotten through even once.

I was staying at one of the more expensive river facing rooms on the 9th floor with a terrace and it felt a bit shabby and run-down.  Views from the terrace were nice though.  Before the first turnover, bathrooms weren't fully cleaned.

There's a tiny gym in the basement that is well enough equipped for a short stay.  

I suspect they are just massively understaffed.  But that's not guests' problem.  The hotel isn't charging guests any less because the service they are able to deliver is far below what they promise.

Giving it two stars because the location and restaurants are good. But I'm unlikely to even consider staying here again.  Avoid if you can.",2,2022,07,12
148,Incredible stay,"The ME in London is only getting five stars because I can‚Äôt give it 10. Outstanding hotel, location is PERFECT in Covenant Garden, the staff knew our name after the first 10 minutes, they gave amazing recommendations, saved us time on the tube and helped navigate through train shut downs, kids with appetites and found car services at the drop of a hat.  The room was perfect - wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else.",5,2022,07,02

148,Amazing Place to stay,we recently (June 22) had a 2 night stay at Me. It was a fantastic experience. From the glass of fizz in reception whilst in awe of the view up inside the vast room (pyramid) to the excellent service standard of the hotel staff. Our room was very comfortable and had a great view out toward the river. Very convenient to get to some wonderful places too. Well worth a visit,5,2022,06,29
148,A cursed room in a Covent Garden hotel that doesn‚Äôt work,"First, there are several features of a stay at ME London that are very positive indeed. The location is marvelous‚Äîconvenient to other places in London you may want to visit, and the local opportunities for shopping, eating, and just walking around are great.  The beds are very comfortable and the linens high-quality. The staff is uniformly pleasant and helpful in the moment.  The housekeeping staff does their job well.  There is some unpredictability about what will be left or taken away every day, but the room is very clean.
Since these are all important dimensions of a hotel stay, it may be argued that two stars is an unreasonably negative score. Perhaps, but given the other issues, I just didn‚Äôt enjoy my week in this hotel.  
It seems that style is an important selling point for ME London. The abundant candles in hurricanes, the distinctive reception area‚Äîdark and with enormous white walls on which are projected large moving images (whales, stars, butterflies)--is dramatic but didn‚Äôt really outweigh for me the dark hallway with unexpected dips in the floor level.  I may not be the target audience.
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong.
1. The room was oddly configured and didn‚Äôt work very well.
Hotel rooms in London tend to be small, not surprisingly, but hotels need to design furnishings and build-ins that function in the space available. On the website, the photo of an Aura room (what we booked) has 2 chairs and a small table in front of a window that extends to the floor. This would have been nice, especially for the rare times we wanted to eat or drink together in our room.  
Our room, in contrast, had one chair next to a built-in shelf/desk above which there was a much smaller window with a sill about 4 feet high.  The desk extended so close to the bed almost the entire length of the room that there was no way to fit the chair between them and, say, eat or work at the desk.  It could be squeezed in at the corner by the foot of the bed, where it blocked getting to the other side of the bed‚Äîwe had to shift that chair around constantly.
When we checked in, the only lights for reading in bed were spotlights in the ceiling, which provided very harsh lighting.  A complaint elicited the information that there should have been bedside lamps, which appeared later that evening.
The fridge/mini-bar is on the floor at the back of the built-in wall structure. The bedside table prevents you from getting in front of it and from opening the door all the way. Getting something out of the fridge is a very awkward maneuver.
The sliding closet doors don‚Äôt quite block the entire opening and the closet lights are on a motion-sensor. So, if you roll over at night too close to the edge of the bed, the closet light clicks on.
One wall consisted almost entirely of a shiny black panel (which was very ugly and made the room seem even smaller).  Mounted on it was a flatscreen TV that stuck out a bit too far into the narrow passage at the end of the bed at a very awkward height.
There were no blinds, just sliding glass frosted panels‚Äîso the room was never very dark.  (In fairness, we could get it darker once we realized that there was a second panel on each side that could be slid in front of the other‚Äîthe staff might have mentioned that when we asked if there was any way to make the room darker.  Perhaps it seemed obvious.)
Oh, and the shower.  Actually, the shower deserves its own section.
2. I confess, sometimes it takes me a bit of fiddling to figure out an unfamiliar hotel shower, but this one defeated both of us for a week. The nice large shower stall included both a hand-held spray and an overhead fixture. The controls included 3 knobs/dials, two of which we expected to be hot and cold, and the third which appeared to be the usual dual system control.  But that‚Äôs not how they worked, and the whole system was unreliable and difficult to keep at a stable temperature. The cold water control seemed to have the sole effect of making cold water dribble from the ceiling rather than cool down the flow from the hand-held (even if the dual control was set on handheld only). One day, unable to produce anything but freezing cold or incredibly hot water, I gave up the whole shower idea for the time being.
Not being terribly confrontational, we confessed on the second or third day to being confused by the shower and asked the staff to leave us instructions. They cheerfully agreed, as usual, and then did nothing. The next day, we asked for the shower to be fixed. After this, we were able to reliably get a warm enough and barely strong enough shower from the handheld only by turning on the hot control just a little bit and not touching the other two at all. It was a pretty sad excuse for a shower, even then. The ceiling shower we never used. 
3.  We only tried breakfast in the hotel rooftop bar/restaurant once because everyone working there was clearly on their first day on the job and very nervous about it.  We were overcharged about ¬£10 (charged separately for items that were included in a breakfast combo) and, unable to find a manager to approve a change in the bill, the waiter asked us to sign it as is and she would get a manager to approve the change ASAP after we left.  We reviewed the bill at checkout and found that no change had, in fact, been made.
4. Basic hotel services tended to malfunction. 
Once, the water was turned off late at night. No warning, but the toilet and sink didn‚Äôt work at 3 am.
Occasionally, we would notice that the room seemed warm and would find that the AC had clicked off and would need to be manually restarted.
On the last night we were there, a loud alarm and flashing red light on the ceiling went off at about 1 am. It lasted only a few seconds, but was quite frightening.  
That was essentially our final experience with ME London.  We were very happy to check out the next morning.",2,2022,06,26
148,Lovely hotel in a fab location,"I'd read the reviews for this hotel and was excited to stay. On arrival, we were greeted rather brusquely by a member of staff in the lobby who directed us upstairs for check in.  Upstairs there was a queue and after standing around a few minutes with others, we were asked to take  a seat. It wasn't long before we were invited to check in. We were next up so we went first, and I heard the couple behind us being offered a glass of Asti while they waited. I said 'oh - I'd love one!' but my comment fell on deaf ears.

Our room was beautiful. I didn't book anything special, but the bed was HUGE! Bigger than Super king size, you could get 4 people in that.  We were overlooking the Strand and directly across the road from the Novello and the Duchess theatres.

Back to the room.. it was by far the biggest room we've ever stayed in, particularly for London. The bathroom was divided up into the toilet,  double sinks and double showers. There's a sliding frosted glass door to pull across for privacy. Plenty of storage for our things and some handy make up essentials in a box in case you forget anything.

The desk area had a plug and USB sockets (handy for straighteners) and I was impressed that we both had bedside tables and that a multi-use phone charger was plugged in ready for use provided by the hotel. Nice touch.  There was a panel above one of the units for controlling the lights & air-conditioning.

Good coffee from the machine, and we enjoyed our brew sitting by the window in the lounge chairs, with ambient music playing on the TV.

We'd been told that breakfast wasn't included in our room rate which I had wondered as it wasn't mentioned anywhere, but prices were staggeringly high so we skipped it and found a cafe elsewhere.

Checking out this morning was far more professional than our check in had been, the gentleman referred to us by name, asked how our stay had been and was friendly & polite.

So the good bits:
Super location & good views
Huge comfy bed
Great showers - especially the handheld shower if you don't need to wash hair
Great coffee
Robes provided
No noise from other rooms
Stylish, arty environment 

The things they could improve on:
Check in. Reading reviews mentioning a glass of fizz on arrival admittedly set my expectations high but to see it sitting there and hear it being offered to others was a tad annoying.
The toilet in our room was very low. Hubby reckoned it must have been 15"" off the floor. We're in our fifties and we struggled to lower ourselves to it.
The shower floor was in 4 pieces. I wouldn't usually have noticed that but they were uneven so I did. 
The little round table had a pump, so I thought it could be raised and lowered but it didn't work. 
The air con didn't go very low - and it was a warm weekend.",4,2022,06,26
148,Service not 5*,"The hotel is beautiful and in a fantastic location, but service want what you‚Äôd expect when spending so much money. 

I arrived at reception just after 6pm and was told they needed to check my room was ready, after waiting for 15 minutes I was given my room key. When I got into the room I waited another 10-15 minutes before having to call down to ask for my luggage to be brought up (I had asked and given my ticket when I checked in). The gentleman that brought up my luggage was lovely and offered to show me the room‚Äôs facilities, but after both of these delays I was rushing to get ready for dinner. 

In the morning, housekeeping tried to enter the room twice whilst I was getting ready (both prior to 9am, so I was nowhere near check out time), and was then waiting in the hall when I did leave the room. Reception on check out was again underwhelming, with no conversation or asking how my stay was. 

Also, air con couldn‚Äôt be set lower than 18, which wasn‚Äôt low enough on such a hot day.",3,2022,06,26
148,"Many, many good points but some sour notes.","Arrived at 9pm on a Tuesday night and you couldn't fail to be impressed with the stunning lobby. The reception area upstairs was just as amazing and after a long journey the welcome drink was, well very welcome.

The hotel is very stylish in black, grey and white and this extends to the well appointed rooms. I was on the ninth floor and the view from the terrace was amazing, looking over the river with the Houses of Parliament in one direction and the City in the other. Even though it was directly below the rooftop bar i couldn't hear any noise from above, although this might be different at weekend? 

Breakfast was on the roof terrace, couldn't have been a better location on a sunny summer morning but there were plenty of tables inside if outside doesn't appeal. Breakfast was lovely with a wide variety of food. The eggs benedict was delicious. Staff couldn't have been more helpful with requests. 

That was the good stuff, however somethings should be mentioned.
After a long day of travelling I wanted some food. After trying to contact room service at least 5 times over an hour only for it to be engaged constantly. After trying Reception to no avail I gave up and went to bed.
When I mentioned it the next day when I checked out I was told no chef had been available, this should probably have been mentioned at check-in! 

The remote for the tv in the room (934) was missing the back cover and a bit of black tape was holding the batteries in (not well either), which didn't scream 5 star hotel and more cheap b+b!

These issues did make think Me London has a hint of style over substance but these could have been a one off. The fantastic location, views and delicious food would make me return, especially if i was on a longer stay to make use of all the facilities.",4,2022,06,25
148,A wonderful modern hotel in London,We stayed overnight in celebration of my daughters 30th birthday and could not have been more delighted with this Hotel.

The bed was amazing to sleep on
All the amenities you could need with a great selection in the mini bar
Would recommend but possibly a bit pricey",5,2022,06,23
148,"Fabulous hotel, would highly recommend.","Stayed here for 2 nights as a couple and had a thoroughly enjoyable stay. We arrived later than planned owing to bad traffic and the concierge provided a great help, sending someone out to show us where the car park was as roadworks made it a little difficult to find! They were also very helpful, informing the STK restaurant we would be late for our pre-theatre dinner. 

The restaurant was also fantastic, understanding that although we were late we had a show booked so the service was quick & accommodating of this. The food was exceptional (my steak was incredible, I would go as far to say the best I‚Äôve ever had) and the waiting staff were very informative, attentive and friendly, and for this alone I would highly recommend the STK. 

The hotel staff gave us a warm welcome with a glass of champagne offered & happily taken! The hotel itself is of a very high standard, with very pleasing modern decor & striking artwork on display. Our room was spotless & beautifully laid out-it took us a while to realise the mini bar was there due to the clever design! We liked the bathroom lay out and the shower was truly superb with sublime toiletries available to use throughout our stay (nice to have full size bottles available rather than mini ones too). 

What made our stay so enjoyable was the staff. As a hotel guest you were made to feel special without the staff being overbearing, nothing was too much trouble and there were little perks such as easy access to the rooftop bar (again another place I‚Äôd recommend for a visit) and when we went up for a late night drink we were quickly welcomed and informed of last orders so we wouldn‚Äôt miss out! Brunch on the rooftop terrace was delicious with enjoyable views over the city.

We will definitely be returning especially as it‚Äôs such an ideal location for Covent garden and the theatre district. Right off to book the babysitter now‚Ä¶..",5,2022,06,22

148,Beautiful hotel and Amazing location,"The hotel and staff are absolutely incredible. I'd like to use the word ""Modern"" to describe the hotel. 

The ROOFTOP BAR is incredible with some amazing views of the city (inlcuding big ben) The menu i great and the drink variety was impressive also.

We found this hotel by comparing multiple brands in the area. This one is centurally located between: Big Ben, Tower Bridge, SOHO, and the Beckingham Palace. We got a good workout in by walking to all those places but there are other options too.

It was a short walking getting off the underground from the airport also! (About 10 minutes) and we also were bringing out rollerboards with us.

The room was cozy, with some pretty cool tech. They have bluetooth speakers that you can hook up to in the room and it plays over the speakers in the ceiling. The TV area has mood lighing and there is a panel that you can change the colors. etc etc etc

DEFINITLY give this place a try. Compare the price to their actual website, as we found it a lot cheaper.

You wont regret this place!!!",5,2022,06,13

Breakfast is served in a beautiful top roof restaurant with views to Thames, Big Ben and further. At night, this becomes Radio cocktail bar, with a very modern and trendy atmosphere.

The Me Team is great, helped us with a couple of doubts and provided accurate information. Always friendly and giving us the feeling of being at home.

In a fabulous location close to theatres restaurants etc.. would recommend as a luxury stay in Covent Garden",5,2022,05,09
148,Hands down the best hotel EVER,"I just want to start this off by saying as soon as we checked out we was already looking at dates to come back in the summer‚Ä¶

From the moment we checked in we was welcomed and provided with exceptional service (not to mention the delicious Champagne upon arrival) 

The service did not stop there. The standard of the room was absolutely amazing. Everything was to perfection and I can‚Äôt fault it in anyway. The staff made us feel so welcomed and were on call at all times which made this unforgettable experience even better.

The location is perfect with STK downstairs which we had an amazing meal at and I just to point out the staff even acknowledged we was staying at the hotel and checked on us while having our meal that everything was all okay. It‚Äôs the little gestures like this that have made this trip unforgettable.

Not to even mention the Radio Roof Top bar which you don‚Äôt have to book a reservation for if your staying in the hotel as they will accommodate for you which was a perfect way to end our evening. 

Before checking out we enjoyed a delightful breakfast with the stunning views of some of Londons landmarks such as Big Ben and the London Eye.

148,Amazing hotel and the best staff,My boyfriend purposed to me last weekend at ME London.

We ordered one of the Jubilee cocktails that I recommend everyone to try. I will definitely be back!,5,2022,05,03
148,Amazing Hotel,I had a wonderful experience at the ME Hotel. The whole experience was lovely from the decor to the staff. The radio rooftop has one of the best view in London too! Whether it's a romantic trip or for work the ME Hotel really caters for everyone.,5,2022,05,03
148,Great location and staff,"The location is just across from Somerset House and a short stroll into Covent Garden. The reception staff were very amiable and helpful, and the welcome drink was indeed very welcome!

The hotel oozes style with its dramatic atrium, and black and white interiors. Unfortunately, there is definitely a case for style over substance. Our 'Vibe' featured a drawer safe which was almost impossible to open due to the weight of the door and lack of a proper handle. The glass toilet cubicle was extremely small and most of the glass panels in the bathroom were ill-fitting. There was also quite a bit of wear and tear. 

On the plus side, the overhanging glass balcony was something different and we were given priority outdoor seating at the very popular Radio Rooftop bar. 

Ultimately, it was the excellent level of service we received at the hotel which we appreciated the most.",4,2022,04,30
148,Stunning Time at ME,"Couldn‚Äôt ask for more. The location of the place is extraordinary. The building is full of magic and just being inside feels like an immersive an unique experience.

148,Great Hotel... great location,"I've stayed in this hotel twice now and love it.  The rooms are comfortable and large (i stayed in the Aura room category).

And the staff are courteous, helpful and seem genuinely happy to have you as their guest.  Highly recommend.",5,2022,04,25
148,Highly recommend! Modern design with excellent service.,"I stayed for one night to celebrate my sister's 18th birthday and we had an amazing stay. As soon as we entered the hotel there was someone available to welcome us, we didn't wait long to go through to check in which was good (shout-out to David who was really friendly and helpful). 

There was a separate floor for checking in, which was very impressive with a high ceiling and relaxing sofas while we waited. A complimentary glass of bubbles was also served to us while the paperwork was being sorted out. 

Soon after they showed us to our rooms and gave a little tour to show us where everything is and how to use certain features, I found that very useful. The rooms were really modern and spacious with excellent, high quality toiletries. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and I slept very well (it was also really quiet, even though it is located in central London)! 

After we unpacked we went to the radio rooftop bar, really beautiful decor and the views of London were nice. In the evening we went to STK (booked weeks in advance), where we had a great evening! We had a separate entrance and exit linked to the hotel which I liked as well. 

Location is excellent, right in the middle of central London so everything was easy to get to.

Throughout the stay the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They made us feel important and special, and I would highly recommend this as a place to stay for anyone who has a special occasion to celebrate!!",5,2022,04,25
148,"amazing service, beautiful hotel, just all round perfect!","the room was beautiful, every member of staff was soo lovely and welcoming, they really made our stay special. We wanted to book a last minute massage and they made this happen!

148,A unique experience,"The MeLondon located adjacent to Covent Gardens is a perfect start for an amazing vacation. My wife and I just returned from London with our two teenage granddaughters. From the moment we arrived at the Me London, we were consumed by the magnificence and royal treatment of the hotel staff. We were greeted by Tassos who assisted us with our luggage and for the next 9 days, he went out of his way to make us feel part of the family. Victors, the head concierge had been assisting me with our pre arrival plans, sightseeing, guides, restaurants and interesting places to visit. He shared his cell number with us so he could be available to make suggestions on his days off. He is an extraordinary leader on the hotels staff. The interior design and decoration of the public areas has architect Norman Forster‚Äôs eye for magnificence, through the hotel. The second floor atrium reception area is an awesome example of his brilliance. Not only is the space spectacular but the constantly changing light show rising among the walls of the atrium had us all raving of its beauty and excitement.   One of the front desk staff, Veronica, was particularly accommodating, pleasant and most helpful. Excellent  accommodations with a king sized bed, large bathroom and a continuation of the clean design of the hotel. The Radio lounge, restaurant is a fabulous environment for meals, cocktails and fun. We will be back.",5,2022,04,22

We stayed one night for my husbands 50th birthday and it was just perfect. The staff were super attentive from the minute we arrived, handing us a glass of champagne as they dealt with out booking. 
We were met by Ellie who was there to greet us and show us to our room.
Ellie, being new herself, was just delightful, she explained how everything worked and talked to us about hotel and its personal scent‚Ä¶ can you guess what scene it is‚Ä¶? 
Thank you Ellie for your attention to detail in our room! and for being so welcoming x

148,Sexy Hotel,"This hotel was perfect and incredibly sexy. Loved the slick design and how the rooms can change color. David was above a beyond at the concierge desk.

After a terrible experience at another hotel in the area, we rung this hotel 4 days prior to a big family visit and from the very first phone call, they were nothing but accommodating. From booking with reservation team, to arranging valet parking with the concierge, and getting one of the best greetings we have had at a hotel stay in London - everything from start to finish was fantastic. The rooms are clean, bright and modern, the restaurant food was delicious and location of the hotel is perfect for any direction you are heading in London - let alone the 2 minute walks to many theatres. Valet parking was brilliant, also able to charge my electric vehicle during my stay ready for our journey home.  A very special mention to David (concierge) who was so helpful, polite and knowledgeable. The hotel should be aware how great he is, a vital part of their team in my opinion. He looked after me and my family throughout our stay. We were a party of 10 (6 adults and 4 children) and all staff members made us feel welcome. Thank you once again to all the team, especially to David, this was a very special occasion for our stay and one that we will never forget...for all the right reasons!

Everything feels modern, stylish, upscale and fresh. Great service from all staff. Radio Roof bar is great for early eve drinks and next day breakfast. Lovely views over the Thames. Trendy vibe in the eve - DJ, music, buzzy: quality food at breakfast and efficient, friendly service. Rooms are minimalist and modern but with all the facilities you would need. Mini-bar, tea/coffee, chill music from hi-fi system; links to your own music if needed. Comfortable, large bed. We had the rooms this time with balconies and views over thames. View is a bit restricted from within the room because of high balcony walls but good to sit outside on bar stools/table for an eve drink. Best London hotel for couples leisure trip.",5,2022,03,27
148,Great location. Attentive management. Comfortable rooms,"I have decided to edit my original review (see below initial posting) after speaking with the hotel 'Front of House Manager' who addressed my concerns and shed light on their efforts to improve communications. 

Independent of our first impression, I truly appreciate the hotel's management care and attention to detail. In our conversation, we discussed some specific suggestions that can resolve some of the internal communications issues. I will stay at ME on my next visit to London since beyond rooms, location, and amenities, people and their dedication to their job are the most important ingredient of any business.  
---
Outstanding location. Nice vibe. Comfortable, well-equipped, rooms.
We faced a few issues related to internal communications among staff. It took over 40 minutes to get the luggage to the room (only after I had to come down three times to follow up with the concierge). Check-in was later than we expected and while the front desk made an effort to expedite, the message was not received by the relevant team responsible for cleaning the rooms.
One of the more pricy options in the area so value for money is questionable.

The place gets busy over weekends as the rooftop bar is a popular spot.

Great breakfast menu with high-quality food.

None of the issues are major and it looks like with some basic training and improved procedures, this hotel can be a great choice for travellers. They are just not there (yet :))",4,2022,03,26

148,Always Excellent - wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else in London,"We stay at the Me every time we are in london, it‚Äôs perfect for business, for us as a couple or when we take the children and have an interconnecting suite. 

On this occasion we took friends for her 40th and Toby and the team were amazing in organising every last detail, from messages on the mirrors, balloons and a fab table at the radio rooftop for both cocktails post show and for breakfast! 

The rooms are always super glamorous and bedding and towels feel brand new every time. The toiletries are superb and no small sample rubbish but proper options to have a luxe shower in the super bathroom facilities.  

The service at the concierge is always faultless, they work so hard and nothing is too much trouble, we always appreciate all the team do when we stay, even from the basics of organising baggage and taxi‚Äôs to booking tables etc. 

Toby organised a special welcome for us and our friends and it meant the whole stay started and finished with a wow. 

We have already booked our next stay (which I think must be our tenth or eleventh) and as I said, we wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else in London.

148,Fab hotel with great staff,"We had a night away in London to finally renew our love of theatre after the  pandemic and chose the ME hotel in London after a fun dinner at their rooftop restaurant a couple of months ago.  The hotel is perfectly located and is fantastically cool but what made our stay particularly special was the warm welcome from the team, no more so than the concierge, Laura, who welcomed us with a glass of Cava at reception, gave us ideas for our night out and also took the time to take an interest in our next vacation.  This happened to be to her home country of Spain and when we returned that night she had written down some excellent ideas for that trip and left them in our room with a lovely note.  Laura truly went above and beyond, people like her make the bricks and mortar of a good hotel great, we need more of her after the last 2 years! Breakfast at Gino Di Campo‚Äôs in house restaurant was delicious, all in all a great couple of days.",5,2022,03,15
148,Amazing hotel and staff,"Visited last month with my partner for valentines weekend and wanted to share positive feedback regarding our stay, the staff are amazing from the start we were well looked after by everyone! We also visited STK and Radio rooftop and both were fantastic.",5,2022,03,14

148,Amazing stay.... just WOW!,"My partner and I stayed here last weekend and it was the most wonderful experience.  A special mention has to go to Jaime the Concierge who was attentive, kind, knowledgeable and just plain lovely!  It is one of the very few times that I have been sad to leave a London hotel.  The Chic suite was exactly that... perfect.  We will most definitely be staying there again.",5,2022,03,11
148,Most wonderful hotel with the most exceptional service I have ever received!,"From the minute my mum and I walked in to the hotel, we were greeted by staff who couldn't wait to help us and throughout our stay the service we received was exceptional from the concierge, check in desk, bar staff and breakfast service the next day I can not fault anyone. Easy check in with a glass of fizz, and we were taken to our room and shown all the facilities.

The staff all knew it was a belated birthday celebration (only from a passing comment at check in), and during my stay they all came up to me and asked how my weekend was and if they could do anything for me!

We went to see Pretty Woman, and on our return to our room there was a bottle of champagne on ice, a box of chocolates, a birthday balloon and a message wishing me a happy birthday from all the staff -  a complete surprise and so lovely to come back to - thank you!

Great rooftop bar full of a buzzing atmosphere, drinks were amazing we have cocktails and the live music was a bonus - totally recommend booking a table here

Overall this hotel exceeded my expectations and I will definitely return in the future",5,2022,03,11
148,5 star experience,"Me and my partner stayed here over Valentines weekend. We were welcomed with a glass of bubbly and shown around the hotel, including radio rooftop and STK. The staff were extremely helpful and managed to get us last minute bookings to both places on what I imagine was a very busy and booked weekend.

The rooms were immaculate and spacious and had even been decorated with balloons and rose petals.

Remus, Otto and Byron went out of their way to ensure our trip was special and I cannot thank them enough.

We will definitely be returning in the future.",5,2022,03,11
148,Amazing stay from start to finish,"Absolutely excellant stay from start to finish fab hotel, fab food, fab room and derek the restuarant manager went above and beyond to help us enjoy our stay, the views from the rooftop bar are amazing, the rooms are so spacious and comfortable, Could not fault our stay",5,2022,03,08
148,ME and us,"ME is not just a hotel. It's a complete experience. Beautiful modern design, spacious well equipped rooms (we had Vibe Room), incredible location, alongside a collection of restaurants and bars that really compliment the vibe. Particularly enjoyed Radio Rooftop and Luciano's. Our visit was for 2 nights at the beginning of March 2022. From the first contact, till the last, the customer service is what makes ME shine. All the staff were incredible, nothing was too much trouble and they always had time to talk. They clearly have the space and confidence to allow their indervidual personalities shape the service... I have to make a special mention of Victor and Gurcan at the Concierge desk. The first and last faces you see when you come and go, always smiling and always ready to help with anything you need. They really are stars! ",5,2022,03,08
148,"Enjoyable, modern, clean","Very good stay super easy check in slight negative we wasn‚Äôt inform of breakfast times and location upon check in but apart from that we had a smooth check in 

The room was very clean and we had selected the romance package which was placed out in the room with petals, balloons and personalised anniversary message. 

TV worked fine would have been nicer to have access to all channels on Sky including sports but something for the team to look into going forward 

Radio Rooftop bar for drinks was lovely super easy to get to the 10th floor and was seated straight away without having a reservation and it being a Saturday. 

24/7 room service unable to provide the ice cream flavour which was on the menu but the desert arrived very quickly. 

Breakfast included in my room rate was in Gino restaurant. Breakfast would rate a 7/10 could be better but nothing wrong with it. 

Check out was seamless and held our bags for us until we arrived back later in the day 

To mention we drove and did the valet parking at the ME it cost ¬£49 for the overnight stay we had the lovely David park the car and saw it through till the following day who assisted us in getting the car back when it was time for us to leave. 

Would I recommend? 
Yes

148,Our New Favorite London Hotel!,"We stay in London 3 or 4 times a year, never in the same hotel...The price, the service, the location, the staff, always something not quite right.

All of that changed with our stay at the ME. Stunning architecture and amazing rooms, fantastic roof top bar, ideal location, great price and above all, the best hotel team, with a special mention going to Jaimie, who could not have made us feel more welcome. My number one tip - Book a suite and book direct, you wont regret it.

Oh, and we will be back!",5,2022,03,07
148,Stunning hotel with matching service. You must stay here.,"Stunning hotel as expected from Foster & Partners. Although fairly modest on the outside don‚Äôt be fooled. The reception is where it starts for me what a room in the central hub of the hotel. The decor, ambience and location is second to none. Service is impeccable right from valet parking, concierge to check in staff and more. Couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. Passion suite room was amazing with great views, didn‚Äôt want for anything. Thanks ME London",5,2022,03,06

We will definitely be back.",5,2022,03,06
148,"Amazing hotel, really clean & lovely staff - loved it!","Thank you for such a lovely stay, the hotel is amazing and there‚Äôs nothing negative that I could say about the hotel or the experience. I have already booked to come back again later this year & I really look forward to visiting again.

It‚Äôs a great location which made everything really accessible and we were able to do lots during our short stay, covering lots of different parts of the city. 

I would like to mention your employee, Gurcan. He was really polite & professional in assisting us & he made us feel very welcome during our stay. He is a credit to your hotel and to the team. All of the staff were lovely & very helpful, I look forward to coming back to the hotel.",5,2022,03,03
148,A Great Place for a Theatre Stayover,"Chose the venue due to its great location next to theatreland. Staff were welcoming, room was comfortable with a great view, breakfast really good. Late night bar with views over the Thames. Decor really stunning. Recommend for an overnighter when going to a show but would be good for a longer stay as well.",5,2022,03,02
148,Weekend stay,"Thank you to everyone at this amazing hotel. My wife & I couldn‚Äôt of wished for anything more from our stay. In particular we would like to thank Lidia for all her help with the amazing room setup. Great hotel, amazing staff, first class service. Thank you",5,2022,03,01
148,Luxury - Could not have enjoyed anymore!,"Couldn‚Äôt recommend enough. The facilities and concierge service were so helpful for what was a reasonably stressful stay in that I was proposing to my partner! 

Both Guiseppe & Lidia were so helpful on Check-in and assisted with all my needs to make the event go ahead smoothly. 

All staff made the stay special including the ones I didn‚Äôt catch their names - even a congratulations card from everyone. 

Will be back for sure.",5,2022,03,01
148,Exceptional service!!!,"Excellent is the only word that comes to me when describing Hotel Me. 
From the hotel's interior to the superb service, notably from manager Ante, who greeted us and took the time to tell us bit more about this beautiful hotel and history behind.
The reception and bar areas are both breathtakingly stunning. 
Otto, who found us a table at the rooftop bar in less than a minute (despite the fact that the bar was fully booked) and served us, just added to the list of exceptional service. 
Thank you for the wonderful time we had at Hotel Me; we will surely return!",5,2022,03,01
148,First Class,"Throughly enjoyed a luxurious weekend in a high end hotel. No need to leave the hotel, excellent food in the lounge, Radio and Lucianos. We tried each bar, delicious cocktails by quality mixologists. Try the Cosmo‚Äôs in Radio or the Bomboloni in Lucianos!
Lots of special touches, turn down service, attentive staff. Remus and his Team looked after us very well! Thank you thank you :) Can‚Äôt wait to revisit!",5,2022,02,27
148,Birthday celebration,Stayed at the hotel to celebrate my sister's birthday. We both had a lovely stay at the hotel. Food was amazing at STK highly recommend anyone to go there. Enjoyed the beautful views at the Radio Rooftop bar.,5,2022,02,27
148,Amazing hotel and service,"What an amazing hotel and service from the staff at ME hotel. From the minute I first booked the room, I received an email asking me how the team could help me with my booking. It was mine and my husband's 20th wedding anniversary and we were made to feel like royalty. The room was decorated with balloons and petals and a special message from the team. A very special touch along with the glass of prosecco we were offered on arrival. The highlight however was the exceptional service we received from David, the concierge. Due to a lot of roadworks, we struggled to find the car park and so David came and met us personally on the road and guided us there. He then parked our car for us and came back to meet us to check everything was ok. Nothing was ever too much trouble for David and he was the highlight of our stay. Thank you to to the ME hotel for a wonderful stay and a special thanks to David who made it even more special. We will definitely be returning when we are next visiting London.",5,2022,02,25
148,Surprise 50th Birthday,"From the moment we arrived we was greeted with extremely professional staff at reception. It was very welcoming and tranquil. We went to the room and it was decorated with balloons etc. A very nice touch for the surprise. We had a few afternoon drinks at radio bar. The GM was extremely friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough to make us feel more welcomed. So much so we returned after dinner. The atmosphere in the radio bar was outstanding along with the service. From start to finish the standards of the room, the service and the hotel in general was 5 star.",5,2022,02,23
148,Extremely Pleasurable experience,"So, we was recommended ""Me London"" as we normally stay in others on the Strand and Whitehall.  We were over the moon with both the staff and their attitude to my wife and I upon arrival 19th February 2022. They could not be any more helpful if they tried. The hotel is extremely clean with modern rooms which we believe are of exceptional value, especially given their A1 positioning in Central London.  The rooms were very modern and up with the times.  We used their valet parking which was a very smooth experience. We called the hotel on our journey to understand how we get to their car park, which they kindly suggested emailing without hesitation a full detailed map showing how to arrive via roadworks. When told are room location at check in, Giuseppe ran to the lift and joined us to show us how the lifts operate. Then into our room and took us through everything we needed to understand on how all their facilities worked. Very helpful. We also booked a table in both Luciano's restaurant and the Roof-Top Bar. Both were great experiences. Again, we would highly recommend both venues within ""Me London"". Great stay and will be booking again for mid March 2022 for another stay at The Me Hotel.

Many Thanks for making our stay a great experience.
Best wishes,
Andrew & Stephanie H of Northampton.",5,2022,02,22
148,Wonderful staff,I booked this Hotel again for a Christmas gift for family and friends . We have just returned and I can honestly say we were looked after like royalty.

148,EXCEEDED EVERY EXPECTATION !  ***********,"From the moment we walked in the service was faultless . 

Reception check in  was  first class  - Ante Salapic and the team made us feel like royalty - cava at the desk was a great touch . Balloon in room special message wonderful bespoke touch.

148,Valentines Break,"It was our third visit to ME London, the first since the pandemic hit in 2020. It was pleasing to see that the welcome we received was still excellent, with complimentary bubbles a nice treat after the journey.
The hotel provides a much needed sanctuary from the busy streets, and is excellently located for the theatres.
There is everything you need from this hotel, and it represents good value for money in the Capital.
The Design has the wow factor, and great views from the upstairs bar.
Will be definitely returning soon.",5,2022,02,17
148,Amazing birthday experience,We stayed at this hotel for my partners birthday and what an experience it was. We were giving the room with the biggest balcony and the staff went out of their way to add balloons which my partner loved! The hotel itself is stunning and in amazing location. We couldn't have asked for a better host and would therefore like to personally thank Laura Alberti for making our stay even better. We were unsure between two rooms and Laura took the time to show us both so we could decide for ourselves. She even sent us a complementary bottle for my partners birthday which was really touching. 10/10. Definitely coming back.,5,2022,02,17
148,5* personal experience!,"Let‚Äôs just start off by saying this is the place to be in London. You have spacious rooms, Radio rooftop bar and STK all under one roof. 

Start to finish was 5*, every member of staff was fantastic. Special thanks to Remus, Otto and Bryon for going the extra mile to make it special. 

We arrived to glasses of sparkling wine on arrival and greeted by Remus the hotel Manager. He was polite and enthusiastic, he was genuinely pleased to see us. He also was kind enough to show us around and helped us book tables for the evening at Radio rooftop and STK. His knowledge of the hotel was exceptional as he was explaining the different spaces and some history behind the building itself. The hotel is a work of art, everything has its place and it even has its own smell! 

The hotel room was faultless. It had everything one would need/expect a 5* hotel to have. There were small gifts along with a personalised message all done by the Aura Team. These are the Pro‚Äôs who go the extra mile to make sure the experience is not just 5* but personal too. 

I am throughly Impressed, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2022,02,16

148,Best Birthday Ever!,"I stayed with my partner for my 21st birthday at ME in early January in an energy river room- this was my first time ever staying at a Melia hotel and I was not disappointed!

The Aura team was very attentive and accommodating in helping us celebrate this special occasion, from offering a glass of champagne upon arrival to decorating the room as well as a room upgrade! I couldn‚Äôt fault the room- it was exceptionally clean with a range of amenities and a selection of snacks and drinks in the minibar. We loved the view of the city from our balcony!
I booked a breakfast inclusive rate where me and my partner enjoyed a delicious breakfast!

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and will definitely come back again! A special thank you to George Melton and the rest of the Aura team for making my stay so memorable!",5,2022,02,04

148,The perfect stay in a perfect hotel,"Perfect stay at the perfect hotel - I booked the ME hotel as a surprise 30th birthday trip for my sister. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by the friendliest concierge I have ever met. He kindly took our bags and stored them until check in (we arrived at 10am, check in is at 3pm). We went on our merry way and returned later in the day to check in. The hotel smells and looks amazing. We were presented with a complimentary glass of fizz whilst checking in, then shown to our room. The gent who escorted us to the room gave a detailed explanation of the hotel and how everything works, what‚Äôs where etc. when entering the room the hotel staff had arranged for balloons and a lovely happy birthday message to be displayed, all complimentary. These little touches made our stay, and my sisters birthday extra special. The hotel is located 2 mins from Covent Garden, it‚Äôs the perfect hotel in the perfect location. I cannot recommend this hotel enough!!!!!",5,2022,01,26
148,Great night away,"We booked a room at this hotel, primarily because of a Rocketmiles promotion (I'm an avid airmiles collector!).  We were coming to London to see 'Tina - The Musical' The hotel was ideally placed for the theatre, literally a 2 minute walk away.  It is also ideally situated in the heart of theatreland and just a short walk away from Covent Garden and so many other London sights.
Our room was spotlessly clean and fresh with a view onto the Strand and Aldwych.  
Staff were all friendly and accomodating.  We couldn't book a table at STK via the restaurant booking service, but the hotel concierge managed to book us in.  Great service.
We wouldn't hesitate to stay again, highly recommended.",5,2022,01,26
148,5 star experience,Me and my partner stayed last week for two nights. When we arrived we were greeted by the concierge team and escorted to reception to check in where we were offered champagne on arrival. I had planned this trip for my partners birthday but only mentioned this at reception just as a comment but when we returned from our meal that evening we found an amazing birthday setup in the room and we loved it. Jaime met us the next morning at breakfast to ask about our stay and plans for the day which I thought was really nice. Overall fantastic experience 10 out of 10.,5,2022,01,24
148,Incredible,"My partner and I stayed here to celebrate my birthday. We were blown away with the overall experience from start to finish. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly and welcoming man named David, who led us to the reception. At reception we were able to check in 2 hours early - which considering we had not requested in advance we were pleasantly surprised with. The reception area in itself is simply wow! By far the best physical feature of the Hotel. At reception we were also
offered complimentary champagne. When we arrived at our room we were once again ecstatic with what awaited us - a beautiful and very spacious room where every little thing had been thought of.  We had a balcony with our room which had lovely views of the Covent garden area. The ME team has also made additional arrangements for my birthday which included a hand written message, balloons and a phonecall wishing my a happy birthday. David also booked us a table at the Radio Rooftop Bar for that evening. We can‚Äôt thank the team enough for making our stay so special and cannot wait to revisit. It‚Äôs by far the best room we have ever stayed in!",5,2022,01,23
148,Excellent location,"My parents always stay in this hotel every time they come to visit me in London. The hotel has the perfect location for them as it is very Central, just right in the middle of Covent Garden. The deco is very modern and although we have visited several times, we always get a wow feeling when we walk through the lounge. 

The rooftop bar is great too and has an outside terrace with heaters which is perfect for winter.

The service is always excellent and professional and they will continue to stay here.",5,2022,01,21
148,My 60th birthday,"What an amazing hotel with amazing staff.

148,The perfect experience,"This was by far the best hotel experience I have ever had in London. The purpose of this trip was a 2 night getaway to London to celebrate my girlfriends birthday, which couldn‚Äôt have gone better thanks to ME London.

A mention to Arnaud Bourguignat the duty manager, who initially helped me with my booking and then arranged a reservation for my girlfriends birthday in Radio Rooftop with the most spectacular views of London. He constantly went above and beyond to meet my requests and also introduced me to an Aura host to discuss a celebratory experience. Arnaud was so attentive throughout and always ensured everything was running smoothly, he even came to say hello during one of my reservations which was very welcoming.

George Melton our Aura Host, arranged an amazing celebratory experience for us. He had organised a personalised mirror message and balloons in the room for our arrival with some music in the background, which was such a great touch. This level of service continued throughout the stay from George, which was a running theme with all staff members. Very impressive. 

Everything about the room was fantastic, from views out onto Catherine street and the theatres, smart room controls next to the bed, double sink / double shower head in the bathroom and a huge comfy bed. The list goes on. 

Every single member of staff we came across was so friendly and helpful. The concierge and check in staff took genuine interest in how our stay was going and also engaged in detailed conversation, which I feel always makes the experience more personable and enjoyable. 

The attention to detail and finesse in everything Arnaud,  George and the whole team did was top draw. I can‚Äôt rate my stay highly enough and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in London.

Big thanks to Arnaud, George and everyone at ME London who made this a memorable visit. We will be back soon!",5,2022,01,18

148,Exceptional Service,"My sister Booked STK restaurants for 25th birthday celebration with friends  last minute.
Couldn‚Äôt fault anything with the food , drinks or the service. 
We all had lovely time celebrating birthday. Food was good  cooked to perfection , ambiance was nice . All staff were friendly . Must admit had a fab time there . When we finished, it was very late . I was unable to book Uber , drivers kept cancelling one after other and then my phone battery died . 

We all were shattered and frustrated. Zakar observed our situation. He promptly offered his assistance. 
He showed a genuine respect and care to his customers  , charged my phone , helped us with booking our taxi and ensure we were ok . 
Truly treated like celebrity 5* customers from 5* manager. We felt blessed and thankful of his professionalism and kindness .  We will be staying without doubt in future.
This was a huge unexpected help and made it that extra special. 
We all will be back 100% soon and will thank Zakar  in person.",5,2022,01,17
148,Just a perfect night,Me and my boyfriend had a great stay at ME london over the New Year‚Äôs Eve. Staff and service was outstanding while hotel is great with all its trendy decor and great vibe. Team welcomed us with a glass of cava in magnificent atrium and we used the opportunity to make loads of cool and memorable pictures. Later on we enjoyed the celebration in Radio rooftop bar with best views on New Year‚Äôs Eve fireworks. Shout out to Derek who welcomed us in Radio at midnight and was also waiting us with a smile next day for a breakfast. We had a fabulous time at ME and we are definitely coming back!,5,2022,01,16
148,Fantastic Review,Stayed at the ME Hotel during the NEW Year Eve celebrations and I had a great stay. From the entrance to the check in all the stuff was amazing. You are greeted with warm welcome and offered a glass of champagne at the reception. The room  was fantastic. I had a great view from my room facing the waterloo river side creating a great romantic ambiance a perfect way for my partner and I to cheers into the NEW YEAR.,5,2022,01,15
148,Loved our stay at the ME hotel!,"I booked the ME hotel as a surprise for my boyfriend‚Äôs 30th birthday. I told the hotel when booking that it was a celebration and wasn‚Äôt quite sure whether they would do anything. We received champagne on arrival after being taken to the reception by the lovely concierge. The staff were incredibly helpful in checking in and showing us to our room. In our room, the staff had gone to so much trouble with huge 30 ballons, a personalised message on the wall above the tv and other decorations. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything like that and was so pleased with their efforts as it made our stay feel personal and even more special. They couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and accommodating when we needed to use an iron. Within minutes of requesting one, it was delivered to our room. The hotel itself was modern and luxurious and the room was gorgeous with views of the theatre and the strand. The location was perfect for heading out into central London. We loved our stay and would 100% recommend. Thank you for making my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday so special.",5,2022,01,14
148,New year 2022,"A Lovely hotel in a great location which I personally highly recommend. It has the benefits of great views and a fabulous rooftop bar where music is played and cocktails are divine. Our room was perfect and welcoming, a great place where I definitely would be back.",5,2022,01,14
148,No longer for ME,"I stayed at ME London twice in December, and have to say that there has been a huge erosion in upkeep and service.

This is a 5 star property that we s clearly suffering with the recruitment issues within hospitality (although this is not reflected in the room rate).

I feel the property is more interested in attracting the instagram crowd that share a meal and drink to post on socials without actually staying overnight. 

Rooms are starting to show signs of wear, reception only had one person on.

People pouring out of STK in main lobby (to use the toilets) were swearing and hollering, hey nothing said by security team.

On a positive the concierge team are excellent and assisted with valet parking (following the recent roadworks) and I was recognised/welcomed back when walking in the door.

Maybe after 10 years I‚Äôve simply outgrown the place (or too old). I find it a shame as this property has a great location, easy drive in from Essex.

148,Excellent,"I stayed at ME London for my girlfriends Birthday. I cannot fault the service from start to finish, even as we entered, they knew it was her birthday and they were all saying happy birthday from the get go.

As well as this i organised the parking which was easy and simple and professional. I also ordered the celebration package for the room we were staying in and I was impressed with the balloons, champagne and chocolates!

10/10 i will be coming again!",5,2022,01,11
148,Stunning hotel,"Stayed at ME for a friends birthday, the hotel is absolutely stunning. The rooms are amazing with everything you. 
From the moment we walked through the doors the service was incredible. 
Was given a glass on bubbly while checking in, and informed lidia we were there for a birthday. 
To which we was in our room and she surprised my friend with birthday balloons which was so lovely. 
Lidia is absolutely amazing at her job and made our stay so welcoming.
Massive thank you to lidia and the aura team for making the birthday weekend so special.

Will definitely be returning in the future",5,2022,01,10
148,Birthday Getaway,"Thank you to all of the team at ME London for making us feel so welcome and special.  From the concierge, reception team through to the restaurant staff at Radio Rooftop  the ME London team treated us like special guests. 

This hotel is in the perfect location for shopping (Regents Street, New Bond Street a short Taxi away) we were close to the theatre and Savoy (2 min walk)  and we had the Radio Roof top bar and STK along with Covent Garden a 5 min walk.    

This was the perfect place to stay, modern, clean, 1st class service.  The staff treated my wife like royalty on her Birthday, and I can't thank them enough.

Thank you, we will be back soon.",5,2022,01,06
148,Fantastic hotel and service,"We briefly mentioned to the lad checking us in that me and my partner had gotten engaged the night before and upon our return from our meal at stk we were greeted with a congratulations message, rose petals on the bed and a small bottle of champagne all complimentary and from a passing mention. Brilliant and kind thing to do and we would've loved to thank him personally for the gesture ",5,2022,01,05
148,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel with fizz on arrival. The staff were excellent both in reception and in the rooftop bar. I must give a special mention to the concierge, who went above and beyond for us, thank you.
The room was nice with a balcony on the 9th floor. Room amenities were excellent. 
The hotel location was great, as was the valet parking. 
All in all a very pleasant stay.",4,2022,01,05
148,Great London Hotel,"Very trendy slick hotel in a great part of London. Hotel parking facility very handy, we own a EV and it was charged overnight. Breakfast was good and a great view of London from the 10th floor restaurant. All in all a fantastic hotel I would highly recommend!",5,2022,01,01
148,Marvellous stay in top location!,"Stayed once in 2019 and never wrote a review but this time I see myself force to share my memorable experience. My husband booked one night this year for my birthday and I simply loved it. The room was spacious, clean and stylish. If I have the opportunity next year, I will definetely come back and this is thanks to the Aura team who made my stay unforgettable! I can¬¥t remember some of their names but they are extremely polite and pleasant. Thank you guys for making me feel so special on my birthday!",5,2021,12,24
148,Wonderful experience,"We stayed in the hotel for a couple of days and we really enjoyed our time there thanks to the attention received since the very first moment. Everyone was so friendly and careful and we found all of the hotel facilities homelike and beautiful. Also, our room was really comfy and we were able to enjoy some spectacular views of the city from our room facing the river. 
 
With no doubt, the best part of it was the attention given by the staff. It was notable how they took care of every detail, making our stay an excepcional experience. 

We‚Äôll definitely repeat, hopefully soon.",5,2021,12,23
148,Memorable stay,"My partner and I stayed last weekend for our anniversary and everyone made us feel so special. As soon as we got to the hotel, the doorman took our luggage and gave us directions to the reception, which is an incredible pyramid. As it was busy, we were asked to take a seat and we were offered a glass of cava. Laura came over and arranged reservations in STK and the rooftop Radio for us. They all knew of our celebration and we also got some balloons and a lovely message in our room. Such a nice touch! The room itself was so modern and clean and the bed was very comfortable. We have found our place to stay every time we come down to London and I would recommend it to everyone.",5,2021,12,23
148,Absolute Stunning hotel,Stayed here 3 times now & love it every time. The hotel is stunning & the service is outstanding. Came for a friends 40th & the hotel & staff went above & beyond to make it special from surprise decoration in room to a surprise cake in the evening rooftop bar. Love that everything is in one location but also you have so much on your doorstep. Perfect location for Theatre shows also! ,5,2021,12,15
148,mini break,This Hotel is amazing from checking in at the reception desk with the amazing laura and the team to checking out the total experience was truly memorable and we will definitely be staying again very soon i hope.The location is great for walking to all the sites and theatres.Totally recommended 5 star treatment and service,5,2021,12,13
148,Always a Great Stay at the ME London,"Always a great stay at the ME, thanks to the amazing asset to the hotel Jaime Ferraz the Assistant Aura Manager. 
The customer service is second to none and each stay feels like the first time we are visiting the hotel. The standards never drop and it never fails to deliver . 
All reservations and requests are handled in a beat meaning you dont have to worry about making them yourself. 
The front of house team are equally as excellent. A glass of Cava is offered immediatley on arrival to make checking in even more comfortable and luxurious. Luggage is taken care of and any transfers that are required the hotel will also arrange. An all round plesant stay and would definitley reccomend.",5,2021,12,10
148,Awesome,"Just like being in Ibiza : amazing Hotel Radio Rooftop , STK + Gino D‚ÄôCampi restuarants on site all with DJ‚Äôs playing out . If your looking for a lively , buzzy place you‚Äôve just found out . With Covent Garden minutes away . We stayed with friends Fri/ Sat thoroughly recommend",5,2021,12,07
148,Fantastic stay!,"We we‚Äôre celebrating our 5 year anniversary, the staff made us feel really welcome. The bubbly and balloons in our room were such a nice touch! Would highly recommend, clean, modern, central location and amazing staff. ",5,2021,12,07
148,Extremely poor customer service,"We stayed here for one night as part of my 40th birthday celebrations and have to say it was extremely disappointing for the money we paid. We had dirty towels in our room (covered in make up and hairs that were not ours!), hair all over the bathroom floor, the coffee machine did not work, and there was an absolute lack of any kind of useful communications in the room. Consequently we had no idea of timings for breakfast or checkout, we had to spend an age working out how the lighting and tv worked, and no idea of what was included in the pre-paid breakfast or whether it could be taken in our room. When we went to checkout we had to wait 25 minutes whilst 4 other members of staff other than the only one on reception desk were milling around apparently doing nothing. Whilst waiting everyone else in the reception area was given a glass of champagne but apparently we weren‚Äôt worthy of being offered a glass as we were checking out‚Ä¶. It would really have been courteous and good service to have offered us a glass of bubbly and a seat whilst we waited at the very least. Consequently we missed our booking for cocktails because we were too late to take the table we had reserved elsewhere. When we told the receptionist our stay was just ok and advised of the problems we had encountered, she just smiled and presented us with the card reader to pay in excess of ¬£400 with no apology whatsoever for our ‚Äújust ok‚Äù stay with you. We stayed elsewhere in London in a beautiful and clean room for half the price just a couple of months ago and the service was far and away better than our experience here. So very, very disappointing. And to top it off we have found no contact details on the website where we could address our disappointment with the management.",2,2021,12,01
148,Cool hotel,"From the moment you arrive this place is different, the service and all of the staff are excellent. The reception is out of this world, pictures don't do it justice. We stayed two nights for our wedding anniversary and Laura from the Aura team personalised our room with lovely messages and fresh rose petals, a lovely touch. We ate in the Radio Bar on the tenth floor which has stunning views of London. We have stayed before and we'll definitely be back again.",5,2021,12,01
148,All aspects of our stay were lovely! I have no complaints whatsoever; looking forward to staying with you again soon!,All aspects of our stay were lovely! STK & The radio rooftop bar we‚Äôre both perfect & very much in theme with the hotel as a whole. I have no complaints whatsoever; looking forward to staying with you again soon.,5,2021,12,01
148,another great stay,"another visit and standards still very high. great staff especially the concierge, always smiling and helpful . Hotel is great location for the theatres and Covent garden . we would certainly recommend it",5,2021,12,01
148,One of the easiest 5 star reviews I‚Äôll ever write!,"I booked this hotel for a weekend away with my girlfriend - and wow.

Instantaneously blown away by the style of the interior right the way from the entrance, to the elevators and finally to the reception. The lady checking in behind us on her own literally gasped out loud (she couldn‚Äôt help herself) as she entered the room! We were a little more internal with our emotions but still - absolutely stunning.

Staff were friendly and attentive throughout our stay. Always a smiling face, always a hello, always offering to help. The small things that mean a lot.

A special mention to Laura Alberti who arranged a beautiful package for our anniversary in our room.. which leads me to the room which was also stylish, modern, spacious and overall excellent again.

The location of the hotel is a 10/10. 

We have stayed in London a few times and to be honest we have always been looking for a new place to stay to freshen things up and do something different. We won‚Äôt be doing that again as we will be returning here over and over again.

One thing we might do differently is eat somewhere elsewhere than STK, which was a solid 7/10, but we‚Äôve eaten in nicer places.

Another special mention to Gurcan who assisted us throughout our stay and was super friendly and helpful.

Overall an absolute gem of a hotel, a true work of art with foundations. Excellent staff. Excellent location. 5/5",5,2021,11,30
148,Weekend Away,We spent last weekend at the ME London and what a great time we all had.  The staff were excellent and very helpful.  They made our stay a weekend to remember.  The rooms are comfortable and very clean.  Breakfast was excellent.  Would recommend this hotel to family and friend,5,2021,11,30
148,Nice location and luxurious rooms,"Really enjoyed the location and well-appointed rooms. 

Complimentary glass of cava at checkin was nice, as were chocolates at turndown. 

Rooms were large, quiet, and luxurious. Really liked the walk-in shower. Comfy bed!

Rooftop restaurant was nice for food and drinks, though the service was slow. 

Only complaint is that the lobby bar and rooftop make the place quite loud and busy weekend evenings. We had to wade through crowds to enter, had long waits for the lifts, and did not feel that overnight guests were prioritized.",5,2021,11,30
148,Stunning hotel in fabulous location,A really stunning entrance with bar and a very minimalist hotel reception area with a really wow ceiling.  The glass of fizz whilst checking in went down very well with my daughters!  The rooms are super modern and very spacious.  We had 3 in our room with plenty of space.  The Happy Birthday balloons and message written on the mirror was a lovely touch.  The roof top bar is a must even if just to go outside and look at the view!  We loved it.,5,2021,11,28
148,"Charged me twice, ignoring my emails","Beware. They take a ¬£1000 deposit from your account on arrival, and then charged me twice the day after we checked out. As yet have ignored all my emails. ¬£799.20 booking and we currently have ¬£2598 missing from our account.",3,2021,11,27
148,Birthday Celebrations,"Our stay was simply wonderful. From the glass of champagne on a arrival, the lovely birthday balloons and the extremely helpful staff! Huge rooms, wonderful view, great location! Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better place to celebrate. Really wonderful and will be looking for more hotels in the ME group! #teamAurau",5,2021,11,25
148,Fancy but uncomfortable,"The entrance and check inn look very grand and interesting however the rooms (we stayed in a more expensive one) weren‚Äôt very cosy or inviting. The balcony was great with incredible views over London, but the bed was the most uncomfortable bed I‚Äôve ever slept on, not only was it hard but it felt like one of those cheap futon beds. 
The television was complicated to work so we gave up and the plastic chairs, side tables etc as well as the design of the bathroom just wasn‚Äôt great. 
We‚Äôve stayed in all sorts of hotels and the closest to this one in terms of quality was the budget travelodge in Brighton, however that had a much comfier bed. 
Don‚Äôt stay here if you‚Äôre wanting a decent night sleep. You‚Äôll be able to hear your neighbours, take ages trying to work the lifts and wake up with a bad back. Such a shame.",2,2021,11,24
148,Excellent as always,"Fantastic stay in this uber cool hotel.
From check-in to check-out.
Impeccable service with happy staff, a rarity these days!
Great location for theatreland, bars, restaurants & shopping.
Looking forward to returning asap!",5,2021,11,24
148,"Great location, Fab food amd wonderful staff","Fantastic location, awesome vibe to the hotel with a great rooftop bar. The food was excellent along with all the staff.
A special thanks to the concierge team who greeted every request with a warm smile.
Would highly recommend this hotel for a central London stay",5,2021,11,22
148,I wouldn't stay,"I wasn't welcomed, the breakfast service was frustratingly slow. There were a few broken things in the room, user experience had not been considered, just wasn't a great experience. Personal taste, I didn't like the darkness, weird walls and doors, and the overall design but some may like that. ",2,2021,11,22
148,"Flashy but disappointing, don‚Äôt book breakfast!","The welcome was very warm and inviting, it is clearly a very impressive hotel with interesting architecture and artwork.

Our room wasn‚Äôt ready as we were early, but the concierge took our bags ready for our return in a few hours. 

We checked in a few hours later; where we were greeted with a sparkling glass of cava. 

We were given a free upgrade but there was a delay on our room being ready. We enjoyed the delay with our cava!

The room was clean and the private balcony provided us with an outstanding view of the London skyline! It was very overwhelming!

In the evening we quickly realised the entire hotel seems to turn into a nightclub. The private balcony suddenly wasn‚Äôt private at all, with drunk party goers on the floor above hanging over and shouting down to us. Cutting our evening short, as we retired inside. 

The bed was too firm and so we didn‚Äôt get a very good night sleep. The sheets lacked softness and so were ‚Äòsqueaky‚Äô. 

The breakfast was the most disappointing. The continental part was average. The cooked breakfast was simply awful. Inedible in fact. 

Burned bacon, undercooked hash brown, the scrambled eggs smelled and tasted like salmon (there was no salmon on the plate), the beans were too sweet, black pudding inedible, sausage was average, mushroom was overcooked. 

They then forgot my coffee. After waiting 30 mins, I needed to go. 

For ¬£25 per person this was hugely disappointing.

On reflection it was impressive to look at and out from, but lacked substance. 

We won‚Äôt be back unfortunately.",3,2021,11,21
148,Disappointed,Disappointed specially with food selection and price. Hotel overal I wouldn‚Äôt stay there again. From own experience just feel like you have to wait for everything specially was 4 couples and we couldn‚Äôt stay on same floor. ,2,2021,11,16
148,Amazing Hotel,"The hotel is amazing, from the staff to the design of the hotel. The staff make you feel extremely special providing you with a glass of processco on arrival. I upgraded to have the romantic experience for the room for my partners birthday and it made the experience even more special. Can't fault the hotel at all, will be returning soon hopefully.",5,2021,11,16
148,Excellent Stay,"The hotel is so well situated, the staff are very professional and the service is second to none, nothing is too much trouble. We have stayed here a few times and the standards never slip, rooms are comfortable, breakfast is great and if you are looking for a luxury weekend away this is certainly the hotel to visit. Even with the road closures around the hotel, the concierge parking was so easy and makes life a lot easier when driving into London. Well worth a visit.",5,2021,11,15
148,Stay,"Paid for location rather than the room, ¬£385 paid for the night and had to pay ¬£47.00 on top for breakfast. Not good value for money when our evening at the Shard Hotel the evening before only cost ¬£100 more.",4,2021,11,09
148,ME London unbelievable stay,"The ME London hotel was outstanding in every way. From advice with booking purr rooms with the booking line to the checkout everything was perfect. My party stayed in a chic suite, passion suite interconnected vibe rooms and an aura room so we had an idea of the standard across different budgets. All rooms were spacious, comfortable, clean with everything you could possibly need. David the concierge was extremely helpful friendly and polite from the moment we parked our 3 cars to sorting taxis for my family on the day of my wedding. Fabulous hotel in every way.",5,2021,11,06
148,Amazing service and food at Radio rooftop bar!!!,We went today to celebrate my sisters birthday and I have to say Henry was an amazing host it was the best service we have received.  The food was delicious and Monica was also an excellent host aswell. My sisters and I really enjoyed it. We will be back again soon for sure! Thanks to Henry !,5,2021,11,06
148,Lovely evening,"I went last Friday with a friend and we had a lovely evening. The seafood platter was really good. Henry and Monica were so attentive, they checked on us regularly and made sure we had everything we need. Definitely coming back!!",5,2021,11,06
148,Birthday Weekend,"Beautiful hotel. Top quality service! Amazing location! The rooftop bar offers amazing food, drinks and breakfast with amazing views of London!

148,Wow - 5 star service ,"Wow wow wow - what an unbelievable hotel, I‚Äôve been fortunate to stay in a number of 5 star hotels and this is certainly one of the very best. The service is what makes this hotel so special, everyone we meet there couldn‚Äôt do enough to make our stay special, but special mention to David and the rest of the concierge team they are absolutely fantastic. From the moment we walked through the door we were treated like VIPs

This hotel has everything we could have wished for - fantastic rooftop bar with amazing cocktails, the amazing Lucianos Italian restaurant and the lively STK‚Ä¶.yes it has dark corridors, yes it‚Äôs loud and lively but that exactly what we wanted.

Me London, thank for making our wedding anniversary weekend so special - you‚Äôre awesome üëèüèªüëèüèª",5,2021,11,01
148,Mills Family,"Luxury hotel in a perfect location. We stayed for 2 nights bed & breakfast. Couldn‚Äôt fault anything! We took our daughter to see Frozen which is literally a 2 min walk away (if that!) the rooftop bar for breakfast is lovely! Everyone is very friendly and the breakfast menu choice is amazing‚Ä¶something for everyone! Our room was very modern, light, clean, fresh and relaxing. The bed is very comfortable and you can‚Äôt hear the noise of the London traffic (which I was concerned about). we will definitely be coming back!",5,2021,11,01
148,Amazing stay once again (Daughters 3rd Birthday),"Once again an amazing weekend for our daughters birthday. We have used this hotel for the last six years regularly and it is a true asset to the hotel group, great location, great staff and nothing is too much trouble from start to finish. We have stayed in some fantastic hotels all over the world but this is truly a favourite for our family and we look forward to returning in December.",5,2021,10,31
148,"Fantastic Service, futuristic ambiance","This hotel was a fantastic choice to end our honeymoon. The lobby was literally breathtaking, the room was beautiful and they went the extra mile to make it special for our honeymoon.

The Radio tower bar on the roof was an amazing experience and the drinks were top notch.  Highly recommend.

Gurcan provided phenomenal service to us during our checkout and made it a smooth, seamless process. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2021,10,31
148,Perfect Honeymoon Welcome,"This is the absolute best service we have ever experienced and we have stayed in top hotels in the world- this now being one of them on our personal list. Dayvid Antonio was immediately present upon walking in for door and brought our many bags (2 week honeymoon :) ) upstairs to the beautiful lobby where we were handed freshly poured sparkling wine and then brought seamlessly to our room which was decorated with rose petals, romantic quotes written on the mirrored walls, and an adorable heart balloon. Jamie and Dayvid made us feel so welcome and we are so happy we found Me Hotel. Thank you!!!",5,2021,10,29
148,Birthday stay,"Another nice stay at ME LONDON hotel..
 
Back to some sort of normality with a nice glass of champagne on arrival and a lovely staff welcoming.. 

Back up to the first floor reception in the lovely setting of the view up to the London skyline.. 

Did ask for a nice birthday surprise in our room but it was a very busy weekend so I understand the issue In getting it in time‚Ä¶ 

Our slight annoyance with our stay was our constant dripping shower valve, but to be fair I put a towel under it as it was Keeping us awake and that solved the problem.. 

I did go down to reception but it was very busy and to be honest I didn‚Äôt want to hassle them over an minor issue all though I probably should have for the next perhaps not so understanding Customer that stays in this room‚Ä¶ 

This was our 9th stay in this hotel and I have always recommended it to friends but I think next year might be time to try somewhere else, only because the service/atmosphere at the hotel has always wanted us to book again for next year but I‚Äôm afraid not the last couple of visits....",4,2021,10,27
148,The best hotel and the best location,"very nice and helpful staff, the roomswere big and clean, very comfort bed (we were in twin superior rooms). the location is 4 minutes walk from covent garden, exellent location.
The bar roof is super you nust go!",5,2021,10,27
148,Amazing stay,"Lovely hotel, great location, polite and attentive staff. Stayed for two nights for my partner‚Äôs birthday. The staff is extremely helpful - Emiliano and Gurcan on concierge were amazing. Going above and beyond to make sure we had the best stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for that special experience. 11/10 we will definitely be back! Highly recommended!",5,2021,10,26
148,Not as good as before!,"Have stayed at this hotel many times pre COVID, and it didn‚Äôt fail to impress.
So for this reason I booked it again for my whole family, and booked 4 rooms. The rooms can not be faulted, comfortable beds, very clean and quiet.
The hotel is now lacking the excellent customer service it used to have.
Check in staff are very good, but if you visit the radio bar for drinks or breakfast then you will be very disappointed!!!
As a family we didn‚Äôt want to sit in the very noisy radio bar after our theatre visit, but this is the only option available, as the downstairs quiet bar closes at 10.00!!
Breakfast was an absolute joke. Waited over half an hour for tea and coffee. 
When the rest of the family joined us, they too waited over half an hour for coffee.
For ¬£25 pp for a sub standard, cold breakfast is not my idea of a so called good quality hotel. 
Restaurant staff were not helpful at all. On previous visits they have always been amazing. 
I will say that the Manager was very helpful when we checked out, and did listen to our concerns. I gave him the heads up as nearly everyone in the breakfast room had the same problems!!
We are due to visit London in February, and I would to say we would book to stay here again, but unless it makes a lot of changes, then unfortunately it will have lost my business.",3,2021,10,25
148,Not for me better options elsewhere,"While you cannot dispute the reception wow factor it went downhill from there.
The hotel is so dark literally felt like I was a mole in a tunnel. The room itself beautiful modern, but with no instructions on how to use the fancy lighting it felt wasted on us. The lifts are so slow we sat waiting for 20 minutes and with no other route down (no staircase) this was quite stressful sitting in the dark.
Breakfast on the top floor with spectacular views is lovely but you pay the ridiculous price tag. ¬£50 for me and my daughter for 1 waffle, toast, fruit and 1 orange juice! 
It is perfectly located for the theatre district which is why I chose it but after staying at Waldorf Astoria hotel opposite last time I would stay there again it has a much more welcoming happier feel than this one.",3,2021,10,23
148,Lovely room with balcony.,"Comfortable room, great bed and shower.  Loved having a balcony with a city view.  Fabulous breakfast options.  Friendly staff.  Luciano restaurant within the hotel - great vibe on Friday and Saturday evenings with wonderful DJ and fabulous food.",5,2021,10,20
148,007 Inspired weekend,"Absolutely incredible hotel!! Really felt like a VIP, when really i'm a nobody. We thought we'd spend a little extra on a plush hotel with a balcony and a nice view for our James bond inspired weekend away to see the latest film. The overall appearance inside and out is fantastic, every time we walked into the hotel we said WOW!! the reception area is insane with champagne on arrival and the huge pyramid above, down sides were breakfasts was a bit down on quantity and not what we're used to I'e full English that fully covers the plate. We did have a small problem with our room, we used the complimentary hair drier stored in the bathroom, when plugged in we had a small explosion and the power cut off, a quick trip to reception where we were offered even more champagne and we had our power back on in the room, although i fear they didn't take the hair dryer out to be repaired. Would i stop in this hotel again??? Yes, i would like to live there, the whole place is just stunning, and the staff are so friendly. Our train home wasn't for another 8 hours after check out, but the lobby staff kindly looked after our luggage while we did some sight seeing.",5,2021,10,19
148,This Hotel is a Gem!,"What a fine hotel in this spectacular area!
The concierge (Aman, Victor and more are extraordinarily!
Friendly,  competent and fast!
What a treat to gave them! The even hit us tickets for the RAH sold out concert (Gregory Porter)!!!
The house Keeping just perfect. The receptionist LAURA did good to us, because we celebrated our wedding anniversary!
Thank you Laura. Roof 20 floor great location and meeting point.
The architecture or the ME LONDON is one of its kind.
This is the right place to stay and to enjoy the friendliness and services of the employees!",5,2021,10,16
148,"Wow Wow Wow,,,,Thank you","Just spent 4 nights there with 3 rooms visiting family for the first time in 2 years.
Firstly I manage a Boutique property in NYC so Im in the business, originally from London.
We were attending a Gala dinner at The Savoy nearby and were blown away with the Me.
Large Quiet rooms, so very well appointed and very clean. We spent a lot of time in the Rooftop Bar entertaining and Catching up with Friends and Family.
Staff were so helpful all across the board, especially the friendly familiar faces at Concierge.
I cannot wait to return, I think that we have found our Happy Place in London and will ensure that we stay in their other properties worldwide.
Thank you for an Amazing Job!
Julian, Catherine, Christopher and Charlotte",5,2021,10,13
148,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Excellent Service!","Visited last week for business. Booked last minute, and booked the standard room. Upon arriving and checking in it exceeded my expectations in every way. The reception is stunning with the pyramid, and the staff are so friendly. The champagne on arrival is an amazing touch.
Upon checking in I received an upgrade to the Energy Urban Guestroom (booked Aura). It was amazing and the balcony was great. The only one 'issue' I have (which is likely my problem/fault, but if I was able to miss this then perhaps it can be addressed closer as maybe others have too) is that I did not actually know the room had a Mini Bar and Coffee Making Facilities. These facilities are hidden in a cupboard with no handle in the TV Surround. I did think it strange to not have these but overlooked them until after check out. I would have loved to have purchased a souvenir that I see was in here too but simply did not know it existed. Maybe a small 'Open Me' or 'Open Here' sticker could be stuck on the surround.",5,2021,10,11
148,Mostly good - great roof bar,"Fabulous brunch in the roof bar on a sunny October Saturday, fabulous cocktails too. Very friendly helpful staff and concierge. Fantastic shower in the bathroom. . . 

However, . . .Very small room & very small double bed and although there was the added bonus of a balcony, I‚Äôd have preferred a kettle with T&C making or even a beside table (only 1 provided - it was just the floor on the other side) and a plug socket on my side of the bed would‚Äôve been nice too. 

Probably the darkest hotel (takes mood lighting to a whole new level) we‚Äôve ever stayed in. Would‚Äôve given a 3.5 but had to choose a 3 or 4 was better than a 3 because of the staff. Glad we stayed here but there are other hotels we like better.  Next time we‚Äôll just book the roof bar.",4,2021,10,11
148,Absolutely fabulous,"Stayed at this beautiful hotel last night and it was an absolute pleasure from checking in to checking out.The staff are wonderful and make sure everything runs smoothly.Stunning room with a lovely balcony.My husband and I had a drink in the rooftop bar which was glorious before heading off to the theatre.Had a few drinks out and about as this hotel is in such a great location,then returned to the hotel and asked if we could eat in the STK restaurant.Everything sorted for us and even though we‚Äôre 62 and 53 we loved the music and vibe of this delightful restaurant.Food and service was excellent and I now have to bring my 22 year old daughter here as she now wants a ‚Äú treat‚Äù.So definitely will be booking for us and I can‚Äôt wait.Thank you so much everyone.",5,2021,10,11
148,Didn't quite live up to expectations,"Good location, new modern smart hotel.  A few niggles though - phone in room not working, inconsistent heating/air conditioning.  Bars closed early.  Not many staff around and inconsistent service. Gino D'Acampo restaurant excellent.        ",3,2021,10,11
148,Disappointed‚Ä¶..lost its spark!,"My husband and I stayed here in August when we were experiencing a heatwave. We booked a room with a balcony so we could enjoy the sunshine. We have stayed at this hotel numerous times before and it was, for some time, my ‚Äògo to‚Äô choice in London. Unfortunately on this visit the room seemed in real need of a refurb. It is quite a pricey hotel but it has a marvellous entrance and atrium reception, the staff are always very attentive and the rooftop bar is lovely, however this is not enough to justify the price when the rooms are in clear need of an update. If they were back to their clean fresh appearance then I would still love it here. For example, the wood furniture was chipped, the TV was scratched and the coffee pods are no longer Nespresso pods but cheaper versions. It‚Äôs the little things like that that make the difference when you book a luxury hotel. The balcony we paid extra for wasn‚Äôt great, there were no cushions on the seats and given the heat, we could not sit on them as they were too hot. It looked as though some of the balconies did have cushions but ours didn‚Äôt. Such a shame as that is the reason we booked that room.
I almost gave 3 stars but I think as the lobby and bar areas are still nice it should be 4 stars, but only just I‚Äôm afraid. I will go back but only if the rooms are refreshed.",4,2021,10,10
148,Just for young drunk people with great eyesight.,This is a very over priced hotel which tries too hard to be trendy. The result is a strange dark place with creepy corridors and areas just black and poorly lit. Bed was not comfortable. Rooftop bar was dull and covered in so there was no view. My recommendation is to go to the Savoy down the road and spend less! ,3,2021,10,08
148,Great,"Service was excellent, they always make sure to check if everything is going well! They are kind and I would definitely go back! 
Love the design of the hotel and the rooftop bar is also really nice!!!
",5,2021,10,08
148,weekend away,"very nice hotel fantastic rooms had a  really good weekend 
would recommend this hotel to family and friends.
only down side was the very rushed check in and very little detail on my room  
would definitely be staying here again though",5,2021,10,08
148,ME London: SAVED my 1st YEAR ANNIVERSARY!!!,"Jaime Evora Ferraz and Marco, what legends! Me and my wife were rudely ejected 30mins before check-in from ‚ÄúThe Bailey‚Äôs hotel‚Äù through no fault of our own (imagine the whole day ruined as I had a cascade of surprise events lined-up for my wife). We turned up at ME and put as easy immediately, Marco the manage stowed our luggage await and we just about made the first event with 5mins to spare. We came back to a room beautifully decorated, thank you AURA-Team.",5,2021,10,04
148,Fantastic stay - we will be back!,"One night theatre break which was a belated birthday celebration. Very conveniently located near theatres. Staff were very friendly & welcoming. Offered a glass of champagne upon arrival. We were also upgraded to the Passion Suite where a bottle of champagne & chocolates were waiting. Shown to our beautifully appointed room by Jaime, the assistant manager who was agin very friendly & helpful. Surprisingly quiet for a London hotel. Enjoyed lovely a lunch, dinner & breakfast at the Radio Rooftop Bar with only one minor negative in that service was a bit slow (waited 20 mins for first drinks & over 30 mins for breakfast to arrive). That being said staff were very apologetic & the food & scenery lovely so it didn‚Äôt ruin our stay nor would it deter us from going back. We were also offered a later check out so we didn‚Äôt need to rush our breakfast. Overall we had a great stay with our only regret being that it was just for one night. We will be back!",5,2021,10,04
148,Me hotel,"I booked this hotel for me and my boyfriend for date night. We had an amazing stay. The room was perfect, the food at stk was amazing and drinks at radio rooftop was the icing on the cake. Hotels location was perfect. Staff were friendly and helpful. We will definitely be coming back!!! ",5,2021,09,27
148,Stunning!,"OMG this place is fantastic.  The reception itself is mind blowing. 

As you enter the hotel there is no reception, just some guys stood around asking if you need to hotel or the bar etc.  the reception is on the first floor and is MINDBLOWING.  It's like a pyramid through the hotel to a massive skylight on the top.  They project various images around the pyramid, it's just stunning.
We had a room with a balcony ‚Äì it was well equipped with TV, mini bar, loads of toiletries etc. 
We ate at the Radio Rooftop car which was fantastic, I loved everything about it, the food, the cocktails, the drinks, the vibe.

Later there was a lot of noise (aircon? roadworks? who knows) outside our room, I called reception to ask for some ear plugs, they came up so quickly, I was genuinely shocked at the speed.  The next day they gave us breakfast for free as an apology for the noise, which to be fair had stopped about 10 minutes after it started and then called us when we got home to apologise again.

That is service!

Would definitely stay there again.",5,2021,09,27
148,ME London superb hotel,"We stayed at London ME hotel we often go to the Radio rooftop bar but never stayed before, we thought we would treat ourselves and stay a couple of nights and expectations did not disappoint.

148,Excellent experience at ME London !,"I booked the ME Suite at ME London for a surprise proposal for my girlfriend. The Aura team (in particular Jaime) went above and beyond from the date of booking, up-to and on the day. They liaised with radio rooftop bar and their staff to enable the surprise to go ahead flawlessly. They were able to facilitate me to come earlier to set up the proposal as well as to let my photographer to come in after giving his name at reception. They enabled my family and friends to make their way to the suite also for a further surprise. The entire team and experience from check-in to housekeeping went above and beyond my expectations. All in all, they helped me plan and execute this magical day for my fianc√© and I- which we will both cherish dearly for the rest of out lives. Thank you!",5,2021,09,26
148,Perfect Birthday Weekend!!,"I stayed for a weekend this year (2nights) and I think they were the best nights of my life. The service from the entire team was incredible. Walking around the hotel and the staff so open and welcoming, even remembering your name throughout the stay. Nothing was ever a problem for the concierge team, when it came to reservations they were on top of their game. They can recommend some incredible places to go to for any occasion and they do not disappoint! They also reserved me tables at restaurants that said they were fully booked online!! 
This hotel is a must to stay in whilst in London. I appreciate everything that the team did for my birthday this weekend and I will 100% be back next year!! 
Special shout-out to Ante, Arman and Ana, all three went above and beyond to make my stay perfect in every way!!",5,2021,09,26

148,"Great hotel, perfect location.","We booked the energy urban terrace room.
Loved our stay at the hotel, perfect location a few minutes walk from the Covent garden.
Modern,  wide and spacious room.
The radio rooftop at night is a must for dinner, STK is good place to try out, both are located inside the hotel. 
The staff at the concierege and reception are excellent, helped us with everything throughout our stay, even when I tried to book for a train ticket they managed to help me doing it. 
Special shoutout to Gurcan for his excellent service and help.
Definitely would consider the hotel whenever I come back to London.",5,2021,09,20

The staff went above and beyond for my friends 40th Birthday celebrations, from decorating the room to arranging our table at the Radio rooftop.
Lidia especially was so helpful as part of the Aura team they couldn‚Äôt do enough for us.
All the staff were lovely and so helpful.
Would definitely recommend staying at this beautiful hotel and it‚Äôs not just a hotel it‚Äôs a complete experience. 
Hope to see you all again soon!",5,2021,09,19
148,Amazing!,"My husband and I stayed at the ME hotel in London for a couple of nights and it was amazing! On arrival we were given champagne while we waited in the most gorgeous reception I‚Äôve ever seen (we were early, so they were just finishing off our room). We were made to feel so welcome. The room was gorgeous and breakfast was lovely. The rooftop bar had the best views. The location is the best, so central for everything. Definitely will be back.",5,2021,09,14
148,Worst hotel I ever stayed at,"For 400 punds a night I didn¬®t expect to have to dust the wardrobe before unpacking. Coming back to the room at 6 o`clock in the evening, the room wasn`t made up yet. When they finally came late at night they didn`t fill up any toilet paper and I had an unpleasant talk with reseption in the middle of the night. 
I did receive a long apology letter from the assistant manager, but there are no excuses and I`m going back to the Hari.
The room was also small and unpleasant and there are no toiletries etc in the room.
Still wondering what I paid for.",1,2021,09,12
148,top quality hotel that didn‚Äôt disappoint,"a great stay here, the upstairs lobby is incredible the staff were amazing writing a happy birthday message and leaving balloons in the room. our room was lovely with great interior and balcony with a wonderful view, an all round great stay here",5,2021,09,09

148,Thank you to Aleks,"We visited the Me hotel in August for my husband‚Äòs 50th birthday celebrations, we could not have been made to feel more special from the moment we walked in the door. Aleks was on hand to give us welcome drinks and take us  to our beautiful and very clean rooms, that were specially decorated in celebration of my husband‚Äòs birthday, my youngest son was given a popcorn machine to make his own popcorn much to his delight! we then went to the rooftop bar for lunch with wonderful views across London, with attentive staff and glorious food. We stayed for two nights enjoying lovely breakfast in the rooftop bar also. 
the concierge staff were also attentive hailing us caps when necessary. But we would like to give a special mention to Aleks and the reception staff for their wonderful hospitality and making our few days memorable.
The hotel itself is beautiful, the reception area in particular being extra special with its lights display, and the dark corridors that make you whisper in Hushed tones, making sure this Hotel it‚Äôs quiet and peaceful. it‚Äôs great location means easy access to everywhere you want to explore. 
Many thanks from very grateful Vernon family.",5,2021,09,03
148,4 STARS ONLY BECAUSE A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER,All hospitality is suffering with staff shortages.Quite a few problems with our stay this time mainly down to poor staff training with a lot of new staff.thankfully it was put right after complaining on our last day. Nobody seemed to be in charge. Wake up Melia plenty of competition...........,4,2021,08,31
148,Luxury Experience,"I've always love staying at this hotel, the location is great which is right by Covent Garden. The interior design is beautiful. The hotel rooms are very spacious and setup very well. I look forward to visiting again!",5,2021,08,31
148,Made to feel uncomfortable due to social status.,"Would only stay if upper class, made to feel uncomfortable when checking in. Poor front desk service of manager and spoken to with no respect. 
30th birthday surprise - disappointment!
Room was exceptional and birthday package was amazing! Guest experience Alex was lovely!",3,2021,08,30
148,Fantastic stay as a group of 10 ladies,From arrival to check out the hotel lived up to my expectations which were high. The friendly staff and excellent communication made everything very comfortable and easy. Special thank you to Ana who made everything very personal and very accommodating to any requests. ,5,2021,08,30
148,Terrible Experience,"We stayed here for our wedding anniversary in May and we were really looking forward to it as we had stayed previously and really enjoyed it.  We booked 2 nights costing almost ¬£500 per night and that didn‚Äôt include breakfast.  You obviously expect quality and good service when paying this kind of price.  What a disappointing stay!! The service was non existent, it took ages to check in, when we eventually got to our room it felt run down and unclean, there was even a stain in the bed sheets! After the first night and a few things that we weren‚Äôt happy with we decided to check out and go and stay somewhere else.  We didn‚Äôt really get an apology from reception and they were happy for us to leave, obviously we paid for the night we stayed.  After leaving the hotel I immediately realised I left my dress hung up in the wardrobe which I was going to wear for our anniversary meal that night.  I tried calling the hotel several times, some calls going on for over 30 minutes a time and I just couldn‚Äôt get through to anyone at all.  The next day I tried again several times and still nothing.  I sent an email and after 3 days someone finally got back to me and called me to try and locate the dress.  The dress couldn‚Äôt be found and the manager basically told me that no one had entered the room apart from the very trustworthy cleaner and she said the dress wasn‚Äôt there.  He basically told me I didn‚Äôt leave my dress in the room which I can 100% guarantee that I did! If someone had actually answered my calls maybe this would have been resolved and wouldn‚Äôt have gone missing !! There was no resolution to this and the most frustrating thing is that I loved that dress and it‚Äôs now sold out and I‚Äôm unable to get it again.  I will never return to this hotel !! Very very bad service",1,2021,08,29
148,A truly amazing stay,I stayed with my 2 grown up children for my daughter‚Äôs 21st as I had stayed before and loved the hotel. The service is exceptional and the rooms and hotel are beautiful. From the drinks in Radio to the dinner at STK everything was perfect and the staff could not have been more welcoming. Declared by my daughter as the best hotel she‚Äôd ever stayed in and the best steak she‚Äôd ever eaten - you really can‚Äôt argue with that. Definitely my favourite London hotel.,5,2021,08,29
148,Birthday weekend,I would like to thank all the staff at ME London for making it a very special weekend. I would like to especially thank David for going the extra mile. Fantastic staff great hotel and location. Thankyou K Tansley and family,5,2021,08,29
148,Birthday weekend,"Booked family weekend to celebrate my daughters 24th birthday. Rooms were very clean and modern Chic Suite was massive for London Hotel.
Staff were very welcoming and friendly, special thanks to George who went out of his way to make our stay a memorable one.

Would 100% recommend to others",5,2021,08,28
148,Wonderful wedding anniversary,"My new husband took me to London for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary and reserved at ME London. We were welcomed like stars at the ground floor reception by Emiliano, and even more so on the first floor reception by Elsa with a welcome glass of delicious bubbly. We were accompanied to our spacious room, and were delighted to see a hand written note to wish us a happy anniversary with a bottle of chilled champagne.
Our room was immaculate and the bed and quality of bedding and bath linen were high end quality. During our weekend all the staff were very attentive and friendly. It was an amazing experience to be in this modern hotel with it's original reception area ...I'll let you discover it! The location is perfect for discovering London, either by foot or public transport, the buses and underground are nearby and frequent. I would definitely return to this hotel for a longer stay to enjoy the quality service and the delicious food (we ordered breakfast in bed one morning and it was copious and well presented). The toiletries are also to be noted, the ME London ones are natural essential oil products that make you want to spend ages in the luxury marble bathroom. We were able to leave our luggage with reception after check out so that we could enjoy our last hours in the city. A most memorable experience in all! I highly recommend !",5,2021,08,25
148,Available every step of the way,"The team were amazing from before arrival and arranging for the room to be set up to celebrate our anniversary. Champagne served upon arrival, proscesso welcome drink at the rooftop bar and complementary cocktails included with the room. The staff were so friendly and attentive throughout. Our breakfast order was unfortunately not picked up from outside our door so we had to call reception to place a the order. They were very apologetic and quickly got it brought up to us in less than 20 minutes. Fantastic stay. ",5,2021,08,25
148,100% recommend,"You would not get a better hotel in a better area. If you are willing to spend the money then you have to go. Stayed for an anniversary and they had petals on the bed, romantic music playing in the room for check in and a anniversary message written on the wall. ",5,2021,08,25

148,Beautiful designed hotel.  Breakfast needs to up game a little,"Amazing hotel.  Best hotel I‚Äôve stayed in the city.  Some incredible design features.  Reception projection of a Whale was breathtaking.  Dark halls. Beautiful bathroom and room. Location perfect.  Reluctant to give 4 not 4 star.  Breakfast, being offered / charged high end was disappointed.  No selection  of breads, toasts or baked goods.  Juice from cartons not freshly squeezed, picky but      This is high end.  Service lovely and amazing views.",4,2021,08,23
148,"We stayed in the ME Suite, it  was absolutely amazing !!","The hotel is so well placed for everything that you would want in walking distance in London, it is just amazing, I cannot fault it, and I book here whenever I need to come to London, the staff are so kind and helpful, all the Radio Roof top staff were just so amazing, could not do enough for us, and anyone else who was there, they even changed the music for us (Daff Punk anyone !!!)",5,2021,08,22
148,MeLondon Hotel,"We stayed at this lovely hotel for five nights, we could not have chosen a better hotel. The location was amazing we walked to every touristy location and the night life was great. The roof top restaurant was out of this world with the great views of the London, great food and drinks. But the most amazing part of the hotel was the staff and specially the amazing concierge (Emiliano Del Pizzo) the most helpful concierge ever. We are truly great full for all his help.Thank you for making our first trip to London amazing!",5,2021,08,21
148,Recommended,Very enjoyable stay with lovely rooms.  Some corridors are dark which can be disconcerting.  I would definitely book the hotel again.  The Staff were welcoming and friendly.  Brilliant location for the theatres ,4,2021,08,19

148,Wonderful hotel- lovely stay,"We stayed here as a family for 2  days and nights the first week of August. The bedroom was beautiful with very comfortable beds with a lovely bathroom, with a huge shower. The rooftop restaurant served a good breakfast with lovely views. The location was perfect for walking to Covent Garden and beyond. All the staff were friendly and helpful. We had great service from David with the concierge/porter service when we checked out. He was so very helpful with all our bags and hailed us a taxi too even knowing I had zero change left  to tip him! Lovely guy.
We shall return soon!",5,2021,08,14
148,"Great location- sleek, modern hotel","Fantastic location as it‚Äôs on the edge of Covent Garden, by the river and near plenty of theatres, shops, restaurants and transport links. The check in area is on the first floor rather than ground which I found a bit odd. The hotel is mostly black and white with artwork scattered. A little sterile in the room as a result- if you want rich, opulent surroundings you May prefer somewhere else. That said the room was clean and comfortable with a great bathroom and double shower. We had a balcony with views over Covent Garden. Staff friendly. Would say it attracts a slightly younger crowd- perhaps because of the bar/club. Our room however was very quiet despite being near the lifts and the top floors where the bar is! We didn‚Äôt do breakfast, there is a Pret, Greggs and Tesco express opposite. Would return if the price is right.",4,2021,08,13
148,Review of Hotel and bars,"an all round excellent experience staff friendly great rooms and service good food and cocktails they had it all covered...

we would definitely stay again it was a great hotel we had Thames view rooms would recommend these  they are on 9th floor great views over London",5,2021,08,13
148,My new favourite hotel in London!,"Amazing stay from start to finish! We travelled for my partners 30th birthday and booked a balloon package for the room it was fabulous! We felt like VIP‚Äôs from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out. Special mention to all the concierge team for looking after us, especially Aleks who was amazing, thank you! Room and breakfast was both fabulous, highly recommend",5,2021,08,11
148,Couldn‚Äôt want for anything,"We arrived late on a Friday evening and were welcomed by the concierge desk and directed to reception on the 1st floor. Wow I have never seen such an impressive reception area. Look up and see the skylight tunnel 9 floors above. The lighting display across all the whole area was amazing and when I commented on it the chap behind reception changed the display to show what could be shown. It was like an underwater experience. 

The rooms were faultless and there was absolutely nothing you could want that wasn‚Äôt provided. Everything was there, in the right place and accessible. The double sinks, double shower heads, smart room control screen by the beds, turndown service and room moved into ‚Äúevening mode‚Äù with soft lighting and chill music through the sound system. It was faultless and thoroughly enjoyable to be in there. There was no noise from rooms above or to the side which meant a very quiet sleep. Everything in the room had COVID sanitised stickers on from the coffee machine, mini bar, toiletries and even the tubs of popcorn. 

Breakfast is served at the radio rooftop restaurant on the 10th floor and was excellent. Service was attentive but not intrusive and food excellent quality. 

An indication of a good hotel is the staff that remember your name. This happened all over the hotel from the restaurant team to the concierge desk. The concierge team were excellent, arranging a battery charger for our camera, restaurant bookings and always on hand with brollys etc with the wet weather. Walk in with shopping bags, they will take them straight off you, suggest a drink and the bags are taken to your room. 

The hotel is very trendy and modern - but sumptuous and  comfortable with the black, silver and grey theme running throughout. Location in the heart of theatreland and 5 mins walk to Covent Garden is perfect. 

Without doubt this will be our go to London hotel. Thank you to everyone there for an amazing stay and experience.",5,2021,08,10
148,Great stay.,"I stayed at the ME for one night on my own whilst waiting for family to arrive in the city. It was a treat to myself and did not disappoint. A drink on arrival was a lovely touch and my room was ready early which was great. The staff were very attentive and regularly called by my name which was very welcoming. I ate lunch at Radio Rooftop which was expensive but a nice experience. I had dinner via room service which I thoroughly enjoyed. I had issues getting through to reception/radio rooftop to order this, however the hotel WhatsApp service was ideal to solve this issue. My only regret was that there was no streaming/casting facility on the TV in the room, but this in no way dampened my stay. 

I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel, and thank you to the staff for such an enjoyable visit! I felt very well looked after, which was a comfort too when on my own. I look forward to returning for another stay!",5,2021,08,09
148,Felt like a VIP!,"We stayed for just the one night for a birthday. Alek was absolutely brilliant with helping arrange all the pre arrival stuff, nothing was too much bother, this place really made us feel special. Although the breakfast came with a lovely view, service was very slow, the breakfast was missing items and it was hold which was disappointing but overall a cool place with great staff and a perfect location ",4,2021,08,09
148,One night at ME,"We stayed here last night. We ate a family of five and had two room - Chic Suite and Vibe . I must say that this was one of our favourite stats in London. Staff are excellent, very attentive and polite. We enjoyed lunch at Radio Rooftop when we arrived which was very enjoyable. Our rooms were very good. Breakfast served on the rooftop terrace was excellent. We recommend this hotel. Thank you to all the staff for making our trip so memorable",5,2021,08,07
148,Excellent,"Hotel was modern and very clean and the rooftop bar and restaurants were superb. What raised the overall experience were the staff. From the door personnel to the cleaner's, everyone was so polite, courteous and professional. Check-in/out was efficient and helpful. Special thanks to Emiliano and the Concierge team, nothing was too much trouble and any request was acted on immediately. We did have hassle trying to phone the hotel prior to arrival ( similar to other review ) so that is a legitimate issue for the hotel group to address but I haven't marked it down as I want full marks for the staff.",5,2021,08,05
148,Amazing Hotel in the heart of London!!!,"This is our 6th visit to the ME Hotel and it just keeps getting better! The staff are incredible and the attention to detail is spot on from the welcome at the door, to the food at the Sky bar! Thanks!",5,2021,08,04

148,Great stay,Booked this for my boyfriends birthday! I asked if they could do anything for the room they went beyond what I expected very impressed. The cleanliness was beyond great and service excelled. Will be back and will tell others about this place. ,5,2021,08,04
148,Westley,"Stayed at the ME Hotel last Friday to celebrate my wives delayed birthday. Mentioned this to the hotel team during booking and they kindly decorated the room for her with beautiful flowers & bottle of champagne which was really lovely and thoughtful by the ME Hotel team.

First class Hotel with First Class facilities and staff. Stay in London many times a year and wouldn't stay anywhere else 

Thanks again......

148,Oustanding all round!,"Our whole stay was fantastic throughout. Aleks from guest relations was superb, her organisation and attention to detail made our stay even better. Cannot be more thankful. 

Will 100% be retuning and if you need anything Aleks is your go to person!",5,2021,08,03
148,Extremely terrible,I went to the motel expecting it to be the same on Beyonc√© as the one in Ibiza.  I also wore the hat that I had got from the hotel in Ibiza  they took my small handbag with a few things and search through it.  Event took me a long while to get into my room they fed me some flat Prosecco.  I had then complained about the room being too hot and a member of staff had gone into the room without my say so and went through my bags.  I then went out to buy some Prosecco because the drinks were horrible and they didn‚Äôt want to serve me any more in the bar on the roof.  I then had a drunken man sexually harassed me and then physically kicked me in the face I had asked him to call the police and help me.  They refused to call the police and said it was not their problem basically they didn‚Äôt even give me any words they just wanted me to leave without even calling me a taxi.  I then had to take my small dog and myself and luggage to another hotel in the middle of the night and find a taxi all on my own.  They gave me no validation that they had refunded back the money which was the last thing I wonted.  Before all of the situations that happens I‚Äôve gone out for a cigarette and a member of staff had gone into my bedroom and going through my things and I realise that my door keys from my home that I can‚Äôt stay in had been thrown around the room.  Beforehand I‚Äôve stayed at this hotel and had similar issues this is one of the worst hotels in London .  If you want to have a stressful horrible experience go there because it‚Äôs not me is them ...,1,2021,08,02
148,The team members make for the customer experience ‚≠êÔ∏è,"As a hotelier of 40 years, I‚Äôm fully aware of how team members can make or break a hotel and it‚Äôs reputation.
I am a platinum loyalty member of this hotel group, who probably expects the extra mile, however when you have dedicated team members like the duty manager Emilio Del-Pizzo, You know that all your requests are in safe and dedicated hands.
I had a special request for special people that were staying at this hotel, I wanted to send them a gift from myself, but in uncertain times the procedures are complicated and sensitive.
However the professionalism and caring nature of this very special team member took care of everything.
I would‚Äôve been privileged and honoured to have such a dedicated member working under my stewardship,.
He is a credit to the company.
I can only recommend and endorse this very special hotel group and it‚Äôs team.‚≠êÔ∏è",5,2021,08,02
148,Wonderful anniversary stay!,"We celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary staying at the hotel with our 9 year old daughter. The hotel was amazing, the staff in all areas are the best I have seen in London for some time and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. 
The rooftop restaurant is fantastic and the rooms are of a very high quality. 
The Front of House Manager, Ante, offered exceptional service from start to end of our trip, and is a credit to the hotel. 
Thank you ME London!",5,2021,08,02
148,Amazing hotel and Emiliano is brilliant!,"My partner and I stayed at the ME Hotel on the 16th July for my birthday.  I was thoroughly impressed with the amazing hotel and how accommodating the staff were, especially Emiliano who went above and beyond to help us. We had such a nice stay and enjoyed the in house restaurant and bar STK and Radio. I would highly recommend and look forward to staying again in a few months.",5,2021,07,31
148,Wedding anniversary,"We had an amazing time at the beautiful ME London! They are very good professionals providing high standards of care. They welcomed us incredibly well and they prepared nice decorations for our anniversary. We were excellent treated! The rooms are spacious, modern, very comfortable and also very clean. Espectacular rooftop bar/ restaurant! It was a great pleasure to spend our anniversary there and we will are looking forward going back with our family soon.",5,2021,07,31
148,Quick stop in ME London Hotel,"The service was impeccable at the hotel. We were welcomed by the lovely Aura team with a glass of Cava. 
The whole team is very kind and aware, any assistance needed is treated right away. 
Also, it is a big advantage to have a rooftop bar and a restaurant on the spot. I highly recommend having breakfast and drinks/food at night at Radio Rooftop to enjoy both views during the day and night.",5,2021,07,29
148,"Highly recommend, attentive staff, great views, central location","I don‚Äôt normally write reviews but this weekend we spent a night at the Me London Hotel and it was amazing. From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble. We managed to get an early check in which was great. We were offered a glass of champagne on arrival which was a lovely touch.  We chatted to Victor on arrival and we explained we had come away for a belated birthday treat as due to pandemic we couldn‚Äôt travel. 

Victor paid particular attention to what we were saying as we had booked afternoon tea at the Ritz for later that day and he called ahead to arrange for us to be given some champagne on arrival. 

We also layer in the day had some balloons, champagne, chocolates and the most incredible birthday messages with a token postcard with words from the closing scene of Pretty Woman from Aleks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶blew me away! 

The room was clean and tidy and there was everything we could think of. Only negative comment was that we had booked a room with a balcony and there wasn‚Äôt any balcony furniture.  We did mention this on checkout and had we asked we would have been given some‚Ä¶lesson learnt. 

We enjoyed the rooftop bar on 3 occasions, one being breakfast. We had the most stunning view and our waitress  serving us was awesome. 

Overall an exceptional visit and will defo return. Thank you for having us.",5,2021,07,18
148,Very average - stay elsewhere,"My wife and I have been down in London for the last couple of days and stayed in two hotels - first the Langham - excellent and now Me by Melia...if you want to feel like you‚Äôre in a nightclub, love loud music and have an average room, this is for you. We paid an extra ¬£100 for a ‚Äòterrace‚Äô and the photo explains what we got! This is a four star hotel at best and they seem more interested in getting people into their rooftop bar, which having been there for lunch, is massively overpriced and doesn‚Äôt reflect the pictures one bit. The smallest amount of ham with a couple of bits of manchego cheese for ¬£22 is a little bit of an insult - it would probably cost less than 50p to make! Anyway, stay at the Langham, Hotel 41 or someone else!",2,2021,07,17
148,"Hotel is great, aftercare is terrible.","We recently stayed here on the 29th June 2021 for my partners 31st birthday. Everything was fantastic, greeted warmly and even had complimentary birthday messages and balloons around the room, which was a nice touch. We were eating away from the restaurant which meant we were away for a large part of our one night stay, however, we did try out the rooftop bar when we arrived back after dinner which is fantastic. 

Upon checking out, the receptionist who took our card payment asked me about 7 times whether we had taken anything from the mini bar, which we hadn't touched, but seemed to not believe me, so i asked him he can go and check which he responded with a weird look and a reply ""i'll take your word for it."" which i found to be extremely weird and a little rude.

Once we arrived home, i had realised they have double charged me, i contacted them straight away and after days of no reply they said they will look into it. It is now, 13 days later, and i still have not received my money back and the replies get longer and longer. At over ¬£400 i believe they should take it rather serious, however, i don't think they are. 

Overall, hotel nice, service can be hit or miss, aftercare awful. For this reason, i wont be coming back, you can get better experience at a 5* hotel in london for the same price. Check out and after care has let this hotel down massively.",2,2021,07,13
148,The Best London Stay,"Just wanted to pop on here and review and say Thankyou to the absolutely amazing staff that made my trip so special! Unfortunately I ended up being on this trip on my own but still didn‚Äôt stop me enjoying the trip with the help of Aleks, Monica & Lorenzo! You were absolutely incredible! I dined at STK in the evening and Aleks came down to check on me and how my stay had been so far. Then she tried to fit me in upstairs which was lovely anyway she then came down and informed she couldn‚Äôt get me in which was absolutely fine. I just appreciated the thought and effort! She then explained that she‚Äôll leave something special for me in my room. When I finished dining with STK (in which the staff where amazing too) I popped up to my room and I was given an incredible plate of desserts, a balloon and a card with such a beautiful note that literally made my year and was so so thoughtful. This sums up the saying going above and beyond. I can‚Äôt thankyou enough. Will 100% be staying again and probably staying at the ME every time I‚Äôm in London! Thankyou again!

148,A warm welcome back.,"Another amazing stay at Me Hotel. We were warmly greeted on arrival and as we were particularly  early our bags were looked after whist we were out for the day. There were some lovely personal touches in our room to welcome us back which were greatly appreciated and made our stay extra special. The room was a generous size, exceptionally clean and with comfortable and cosy beds. The staff were always welcoming with a friendly and relaxed manner. After corresponding with the manager last year to postpone our repeat visit  due to lockdown,  it was lovely to meet him on this occasion. He made sure we had an exceptional stay and was keen to meet us and to ensure that we were having an enjoyable visit. We will definitely be back, the staff were amazing, the rooms were spectacular and we valued the extra thought that went into our stay. Thank you for a fantastic break.",5,2021,07,10
148,A memorable trip for all the right reasons,"Having searched for a hotel suitably impressive in which to celebrate my 25th wedding anniversary I decided to book the ME London and I was not disappointed.  The hotel is in a great location, close to many attractions within easy walking distance.  We booked a room with a balcony which was modern, spacious and with an excellent large balcony looking out to The Strand.  We were very impressed by the team working at the hotel, we were warmly greeted when we arrived, a glass of champagne is always a nice welcome!  Throughout our stay, and without exception every member of staff acknowledged us with a smile and a hello, great service.
I booked a celebration package for the room, a greeting written on the glass above the tv, a bottle of champagne, chocolates and balloons, my wife was so impressed and loved it.
Cocktails on the rooftop and breakfast each morning, both were excellent.  I don‚Äôt think we could of had a better time away, thank you to all the team at the hotel, we will definitely return, hopefully for a longer stay.",5,2021,07,06
148,Wonderful stay at ME London,"What a fabulous stay , welcomed on arrival with a glass of champagne.Our host Aleks was there to greet us as well and what a credit she is to the hotel.
Nothing was too much trouble , Aleks was fantastic.
We visited both STK and Radio ,both were brilliant.
We even had Chocolates and a ballon in the room again down to Aleks.Thank you so much for a wonderful stay, we will be back.",5,2021,06,30
148,"Excellent Hotel, with helpful, welcoming staff","Stayed again with the ME and once again we had exceptional service, great room and excellent location. This hotel is really very good, from the concierge through to the waiting staff nothing was to much trouble. We will without doubt be staying again very soon.",5,2021,06,29
148,Magnificent stay for our Anniversary,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start...ME London is by far the best hotel in London with impeccable service. My bf and I already put reviews for the experience we had at STK but there was no way I was going to miss to give the review on our overall experience at ME.We are extremely grateful to Aleks who made sure that the whole experience from when we first made the booking to checking out was unforgettable. Just before we checked in Aleks phoned and ensured my partner and I got spaces for dinner at STK despite it being busy and later at Radio. We were treated so amazingly with the best tables and treats. Aleks met us at check in with a glass of champagne üçæ then we got to our room to find it was decorated with balloons which was just lovely. The room was also really clean and everything was beautifully placed. When we got to STK Aleks passed by to check on us and we were offered another glass of champagne with our meal. Thanks so much once again to Helbert and Erica for taking care of us and for the little anniversary cake which was so tasty. We later headed to Radio roof top bar where again the staff had been briefed by Aleks to take care of us and wow it was such an amazing experience. We enjoyed drinks at the rooftop til late but were back in the morning to be met by Lorenzo who ensured we had a magnificent breakfast. It‚Äôs like the whole hotel knew who we were. ME London you have amazing staff and Samatha please give Aleks a raise she is just a breath of fresh air :-) Although not a completely luxurious hotel, this place hands down has the best service you will ever get in London. Thank you Aleks, ME London, STK and Radio for such an unforgettable anniversary for me and my boyfriend. Highly recommended and will definitely come back.üòä",5,2021,06,29
148,My 30th birthday,"Where can I start Me London is a beautiful hotel. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve stayed in one of there hotel but this one was my favourite because i had a lovely opportunity meeting Aleksandrina Atanasova she is such a lovely warm person. She made my weekend so special everything I asked her she mange to sort out. She really worked behind the scene  with my cousin to decorate my room beautiful. She even went a extra mile and brought me some chocolate, ballon and a lovely message free of charge which was very thoughtful. Guys if you ever stay at ME London ask for Aleksandrina Atanasova she‚Äôs the best!!!!  And the hotel is beautiful can‚Äôt fault nothing everything was just epic. Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again.

148,ME not sure??,"First trip back to London after lockdown and having had great experiences here before we had to return once again for my daughters belated birthday.
We were truly welcomed back with open arms and Tomas (think it was?) could not have done more for us on checkin. Our thanks and appreciation too goes to the Aurora team for making our stay once again so special! Our room 901 was brilliant and knowing how hot it was to be the extra for the balcony was well worth it. Tomas was a star getting going out of his way to get us a table at a busy Radio rooftop and our stay got off to a fabulous start.
Love the simplicity and quality of the rooms and the cleanliness was covid enhanced with clear labels to seal items for single use.
Having dined out we enjoyed the views from our very own rooftop bar and went to bed after midnight. Now for the next 3 hours or more I was kept awake by what I can only describe as industrial noise?? a banging, thumping, slamming sound?? Had I have not known I was on the 9th floor I would of said I was above the basement and someone was putting the trash out all night. It was not regular guest noise and I would of contacted reception but as my daughter slept through it I didn't want to disturb her. On leaving the room I noticed we were opposite the door to the carpark which was also adjacent to the lifts so maybe coming from there? I didn't mention it at check out either as my daughter would have been upset I had not slept so we left our bags to collect later.
At around 1700 when we return for the bags and ask if it would be possible to visit Radio again as it had quietened down last night at this time, we were told they would be very busy and it was not possible to ring them we would need to speak to the guys on the door. So we walked around and spoke to the guys on the door and were told they would be very busy, they could not ring them and to speak to reception........needless to say we didn't and found a place over the road, but someone needs to ask Tomas how he managed it, did he run up? 
Our departure didn't ruin things for us but it would appear you've checked out BYE! 
I left my feedback via the survey but no-one as yet has responded so hoping Tomas and room 801 can shed some light!?!?!",4,2021,06,27
148,"Just ok, wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a 5* hotel","Stayed at the ME London for my 21st, I have worked in a hotel before and I am going to give a very honest and truthful review of my stay. Personally I would say the hotel was just nice and wouldn‚Äôt say it is a 5* hotel. I just want to mention the nice little touches before I get on to the actual reason why I wrote this review. We were greeted which a complimentary glass of Prosecco which was nice and in the room they had set up a couple of balloons and had written happy birthday in the room along the wall which was nice of them. So to be honest with you that‚Äôs why I had given it three stars for those three little things.

When we checked in the staff were just nice, nothing more nothing less. Now my boyfriend had booked to stay for 1 night and was charged over ¬£400 plus an extra ¬£100 just in case we used the minibar which was no where in sight because it was in the least obvious place ever and we never found it in the end as it was in a panel in the wall next to the tv!  Now to me that seemed way overpriced considering the rooms were pretty plain and basic, along with the bed being very uncomfortable and the tv being VERY outdated for a ‚Äò5* hotel‚Äô along with a scratch over the tv screen, also the phone wasn‚Äôt working when we tried phoning reception.

Another thing I would like to mention which was so unprofessional. Was that whilst me and my boyfriend were in our room we got a knock at the door by a staff member in which we answered ‚Äòwe‚Äôd be there in a second‚Äô as we were getting dressed. However the staff member proceeded to open the door to our hotel room from the outside and my half dressed boyfriend quickly got to the door and told her we were getting dressed and she decided to open the door even further! Just to ask us if we wanted a bottle of water! Now this was very worrying and very unprofessional and I literally just had no words as I was so in shock.

Later on in the evening we went up to the rooftop bar we only had one drink as we were going out for dinner that evening. Again I understand that this is a ‚Äòluxury‚Äô hotel/bar but again it was so overpriced! My boyfriend and I had a vodka lemonade, pimms and a potion of chips which came to a total of ¬£47 which I was really shocked by as we could‚Äôve used the money to get about 5 cocktails at another bar. When I scanned the barcode to look at the menu on our table it said that a pimms was ¬£11 on the menu but when it came to getting out bill they had changed us ¬£18 for a bloody pimms! And then charged us about ¬£8 service charge when it took them forever to come over and take our order in the first place. And they don‚Äôt even give you the chance to look over the bill as they are shoving the card machine in your face ready to take your payment even before being able to question the two things.

Now because I have worked in a hotel/restaurant before I didn‚Äôt want to complain at checkout as the stay was just okay and I really don‚Äôt like to complain and what not, however after coming away from that experience and thinking about everything, I had to leave this review as it was not up to the 5* rating as it claims to be. I felt sorry for my boyfriend having to pay all that money for a one night stay which was so basic I was somewhat shocked to see how plain the room was and how outdated the tv was, you‚Äôd think with the amount of money people spend to stay in this hotel they‚Äôd at least have a smart tv where you could link up your own Netflix account to watch off and have a complimentary mini bar!

Don‚Äôt think I would return to this hotel if I was to receive the same sort of experience. I would like to mention that the hotel is in a great location though but at the end of the day that was not a 5* experience unfortunately",3,2021,06,22
148,The perfect stay - Thank you Aleks,"The perfect stay! Thank you Aleks!

From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. This was a special weekend for us as I planned to propose to my girlfriend. Aleks made everything so amazing and was so helpful arranging everything that I wanted prior to us arriving. The room was huge with an amazing view and all the romantic touches in the room that she had prepared were just perfect. I would definitely return here, it‚Äôs the best hotel experience we have had.",5,2021,06,21

148,Birthday weekend ,"Firstly, I‚Äôve been to this hotel every year for my birthday for the past few years but couldn‚Äôt last year due to covid. I booked this year and had to postpone it due to lockdown but finally came in May. There was a lot of issues with the booking system. I was due an upgrade but the system wouldn‚Äôt let me allocate it etc. When we got there the valet parking worked well. Although no one wore masks and no one enforced it either. We had further issues at radio rooftop and STK where no masks were being worn. Only after we complained to management did something get done. Room service was really good. Our room as always was lovely. Special mention to Alan and Aleks who went above and beyond to ensure everything was rectified and made an extra special effort putting balloons etc in the room for my birthday. I believe they are working on bits and we will be happy to come back later in the year. ",3,2021,06,15
148,Perfect Birthday get away!,"Amazing stay at this gorgeous hotel in the most perfect location. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and well looked after. Literally every member of staff provided an outstanding service and couldn't do enough for us. 

The hotel is superb, the room was great and the food and drink in the restaurant just perfect. We booked the romantic get away and the effort made presenting the room with balloons, chocolates, mirror message, rose petals, champagne and a card made the stay extra special....it was so good we felt quite emotional in a happy way :-) 

Whilst the d√©cor, atmosphere and facilities in this great hotel are outstanding, what really made our stay that extra special was the attention to detail from the staff.  Aleksandrina Atanasova our host for the stay was simply amazing!!! Nothing was too much and right from arrival to departure she ensured we got the absolute most out of our trip and made us feel so comfortable and relaxed. 

The run up to this time away had been stressful and we arrived very tired but thanks to her outstanding service along with everyone in reception we were instantly transported to a weekend of relaxing luxury. We will most certainly be staying again and I would highly recommend for special occasion...or just because...because we are worth it :-)",5,2021,06,15
148,The best anniversary of our life!,"We visited this beautiful modern hotel at the end of May and truly enjoyed our time there, I would highly recommend to book the outlets in advance as they get extremely busy over the weekend. We celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary and the room was well decorated for us by the guest relation team. The duty manager Emiliano went above and beyond, met us on arrival and booked a last minute table in Radio and arranged for a lovely dessert plate to celebrate our special occasion.
We will definitely be back at the ME.",5,2021,06,15
148,Disappointed,"I have always held this hotel as my go to place in London its not cheap .
Rooms as always 100% top class and same this trip. 
There are two outlets here Radio rooftop and STK . 
Had my Birthday lunch(STK) for 3 ¬£100 a head but food and service was good . 
Radio rooftop has lost the plot staff look well off there game and lots of mask dropping and general bad attitude its like everyone is doing you a favour allowing you to pay ¬£18 for drink and be served by staff that are not dressed well bad uniforms and the Girls that show you a table think they own the bar. So its off my list now plus no smoking get a life its an open space  . They treat everyone the same (badly) if your paying ¬£400 anight and ¬£18 a drink you expect a lot more than a walk in off the street  .  Downstairs bar not open . Good luck ME you lost me.",2,2021,06,11
148,The best night away,"ME London is an awesome hotel. I booked the romance decoration package for my boyfriends 25th birthday. The staff went above and beyond to make this perfect. We had balloons, champagne, chocolates, rose petals, pictures or the bed and mirror messages in the room! Tommaso and adrianna helped me out so much in preparing and planning my stay. We were given champagne on arrival/check in and our bags were taken to our room for us. Overall a fabulous stay and we will definitely be returning.",5,2021,06,11

148,Most epic birthday party EVER!!,"I would rate this hotel a 20/10 and we CANNOT WAIT to stay here again. I had organised my husband‚Äôs surprise  birthday celebrations to be held here and I asked the team at Melia to help to make it perfect and wow they made sure that everything ran smoothly and there were no lengths they wouldn‚Äôt go to to make sure everything was absolutely PERFECT!!! The price is extremely reasonable and worth every single penny 

We would HIGHLY RECOMMEND",5,2021,06,07
148,Radio Rooftop - needs tweeking.,"This is our third weekend visit to the hotel and had a great time. Though we can never seem to get a booking in the STK restaurant and my only gripe is with regards to Radio Rooftop- I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs the only bar for residents and at one point we fancied a mid morning coffee though did not open again until noon. The service especially during breakfast was chaotic and not sure if they use table numbers as staff seemed to be wandering with drinks and food a lot of the time. We all like a photo though so
many girls using Radio Roof top as a photography studio one girl and her friend must have taken about 50 photos each posing and actually blocking a thru fare whilst doing
so. I presume if your not a resident and you dine in STK you can have access to Radio Rooftop. Another bar would be great for residents perhaps a lounge style bar.",4,2021,06,07
148,Well below expectations,"Lots to be disappointed with...! Terrible service in terms of between the booking and arrival. Found it very difficult (impossible) to reach anyone on the phone at the hotel to plan our arrival in terms of car parking for our electric vehicle and an infuriating 'the mailbox is full' message when trying to book a table for lunch on the day of arrival at the radio rooftop. Only way in the end was to contact reservations but even that took 3 attempts. Room was smaller than you'd expect for a near thousand pound two night stay in their river view room. Tired bathroom and antiquated TV and entertainment set up. Bed was comfy and view was good, STK was a great dinner and breakfast was good at the radio rooftop but very let down by the communication experience and quality of the room in comparison to lots of other hotels in London. Go to the Dean Street Townhouse or even The Waldorf over the road for a better room and service experience. Will definitely not stay again. ",1,2021,06,07
148,"First class service to detail, made to feel like a VIP the whole stay","From the minute i booked this hotel online I called to ask about dinner and drinks reservations and spoke to Lydia who was amazing from the start..
i booked last minute on a Saturday morning to stay that night and Lydia not only managed to get my wife and myself into STK restaurant at 6pm but sat us at what i would say was one of the best tables in the restaurant, then also managed to get us booked into the rooftop bar at 8pm..
On arrival we where greeted at reception and offered a glass of champagne while we checked in, then Lydia personally came to the desk to greet us.
Check in was smooth and quick and we  also used the Valet parking option so no walking or looking for parking spots in a busy westend area..
Once in the room again there was a nice surprise from Lydia with a lovely box of chocolates and half bottle of champagne waiting for us..
We had an amazing evening and breakfast the following morning on the rooftop terrace was delicious..
Highly recommended for a top class experience and a romantic night away",5,2021,06,07
148,Amazing stay! Made special by the Aura team,"We visited for a bank holiday mini break, and the location couldn‚Äôt be better for London Eye and Covent Gardens.

The check in experience was great, Tommaso was super friendly and made the process a breeze.  We visited STK for lunch, and the happy hour menu is a must do to try a variety of options and cocktails.  The place was very busy which is a good sign to see in London, and very COVID secure with spacious booths.

We checked into our room and Alisson in aura team had decorated it with balloons and drew a spongebob welcome.  It made my son so happy, really appreciate it.  The chic suite is worth an upgrade, the extra space over the mode room is worth it.  It also includes complimentary drinks at radio rooftop with amazing views.

It‚Äôs a great place to visit as a melia gold reward member as the breakfast for your companion is also free.  Can‚Äôt wait to stay again in a few weeks.  All the staff are super friendly and a big shout out to the manager there who was very welcoming.",5,2021,05,31
148,A fantastic hotel,We only stayed one night for my girlfriends birthday and it was just simply amazing.

148,Wonderful Birthday Weekend,"We just spent a long weekend at the Me London for my birthday. We arrived armed with a 6 month old, and a 4 year old, and all the gear and luggage that entails! The staff were absolutely superb from start to finish, making our weekend really special. From little Birthday messages, and complimentary drinks, to a random knock at the door by Allison, with a little toy car for our 4 year old. Every member of staff we met, from the door & reception, to the lifts, and the restaurant was so warm and welcoming, and it made it whole weekend a delight. Even though it‚Äôs a bit of a party spot given the rooftop bars etc, we could not have had a better venue for our family trip. Also felt ‚Äòcovid safe‚Äô the whole time.",5,2021,05,24
148,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed here recently for a work trip and found the hotel to be amazing. From the moment we checked in, courtesy of the fabulous Beatrice at reception, everything was first class. The rooms were spacious and comfortable and the areas all around the hotel were luxurious. They have a great restaurant and rooftop bar on site which are well worth a visit too. I will definitely return.",5,2021,05,23
148,Tranquil spot in the centre of London and a really lovely hotel.,We received a very nice welcome by the reception team and experienced superb service throughout our stay. The hotel is ideally situated for most theatres and it is very close to Covent Garden. The hotel is very modern and luxurious. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was excellent. We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel restaurant because our friends had prebooked a restaurant in Covent Garden but we will definitely try the hotel restaurant on our next visit. We enjoyed a cocktail on the roof terrace bar (before retiring to bed) with superb views of London. It is clearly a very popular venue. Once again all the staff that we encountered were welcoming and very helpful. We would highly recommend the ME London. p.s.  the room service breakfast was as good as it gets.,5,2021,05,20
148,Amazing stay after a very hard year,"I booked a romantic stay with my partner as a valentines present and booked to stay on the first day of reopening after lockdown which just happened to be our 2nd anniversary, and what an amazing stay we had! 

The staff were amazing and could not do enough for us, especially a lovely girl on the front desk called Alex, who made it a point to check we were having a lovely time and had all we need several times as we were having dinner at STK and drinks on the rooftop.

The room was fantastic with some wonderful surprises i have never seen before ( i wont spoil for you) and we are very used to staying in 5 star hotels all over the world.

We will 100% be back very very soon.  I have left my ipad charger (was a little hungover lol) but have emailed so hopefully can track it down.

In short i can not recommend the romantic break package enough",5,2021,05,19
148,Different,"I loved the location.  The tube was a few blocks away. Good restaurants and pubs nearby. We were there 2 years ago and booked it thru Costco. The room is sparsely decorated in black and white, comfortable king size bed. Large double sink area in the bathroom. The toilet and shower doors only had an inch by 2 inch metal bar on the inside for a handle. If you slipped you could easily be impaled. Shower had wooden slates  for the floor and was slippery. No safety bars in the shower. A small closet contained a safe and two very small self like drawers for two people- definitely not enough room. Desk area and mirror were nice. Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to work the lights during the whole stay. Breakfast was included and the best part of it was the toast that I made at the ‚Äòbuffet‚Äô. We saw the bar tender make the coffee and it was always cold and were never asked for a refill. The waitress did her best not to look at us and avoided everyone after she took the coffee order. Would I stay here again‚ÄîNO!  We talked to another couple in the elevator, asked them what they thought of the hotel, ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù. Was their answer. The clerks at the desk immediately inside the lobby were very helpful. The maid left dirty wash cloths in the bathroom. I complained about it and the manager apologized and the next day we had a chilled bottle of wine and pastries in the room. The couple in the next room got in a huge screaming argument and broke a glass wall. The room was closed the rest of the week!",2,2021,04,26
148,Exceeded my already high expectations!,"I had urgent work in London and had to fly in the middle of the pandemic and was understandably terrified. Tier 3 was also announced the day I arrived so it was an incredibly high stress trip. HOWEVER, the hotel and their exceptional staff made me feel safe and secure. They took care of my every need while still maintaining the appropriate COVID precautions and went above and beyond to make sure I could enjoy my trip in the best, yet safest way possible. This was my fourth stay with ME London and I had high expectations and they more than exceeded them!!",5,2020,12,21
148,ME London stay 10.12.2020,"Highly recommend this hotel.  I booked it as a surprise for my partners 40th.   The service from booking the hotel to checking out was excellent.  Hotel extremely clean, very modern, rooms are great.  I booked the balcony room overlooking the city and Thames which was amazing.  Rooms are soundproofed, they have stereos built in so would need this!  Room service excellent.  I paid ¬£100 for the romantic package where you get a message on the wall in the room, balloons, chocolates, champagne and rose petals scattered around the room.  lovely touch.    We even arranged for breakfast in bed which was great!  Location is excellent.  Highly recommend staying at this hotel.  Oh and the Valet service is a must. Arrive at the hotel, go to reception, hand over your keys and away the car goes off to be parked, no stress at all in having to find a car park around the area as they do it all for you at a cost of ¬£49.  Well worth it if you ask me.  ",5,2020,12,14
148,Thank you ,"I just wanted to say a huge thank you to Sofia Revez, Emiliano and all the staff who were working this weekend at ME London. I chose this hotel to propose to my GF, and absolutely everything was perfect. The attention to detail from the staff, the way they made us feel from start to finish was outstanding. I will most definitely be back, I am so grateful that she said YES üíçüôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è it was magical. THANK YOU. ",5,2020,12,13
148,"Superb, luxurious and professional","Amazing stay recently at ME London. Excellent location, central for shops and restaurants. From the minute we walked in the door the staff were attentive and professional they couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. Beautiful and stylish hotel and everything you could wish for in the room.",5,2020,12,12
148,Great hotel and staff,We have stayed at the ME hotel twice now and both times have found the staff and service first class. The attention to detail is wonderful. I would like to thank Alan and Adrianna particularly for looking after us so well. Cannot wait to come back soon. Merry Xmas to you all.,5,2020,12,11
148,Such a Special Stay,"I would like to ay thank you to the staff at ME London in particular Emiliano Del Pizzo for such a wonderful stay. From the moment we arrived we were treated so wonderfully. It was a stay for my 50th Birthday celebrations and I was truly spoilt. Our room was spotlessly clean and beautiful with every amenity you could wish for. The staff had left me a bottle of bubbly and balloons and lovely messages for my special day. Lunch and breakfast at the Radio Rooftop bar was a treat and STK was buzzing. In a year of stress, sadness and uncertainty the ME hotel  cheered us up and truly made our weekend . Thank you thank you. look forward to staying in the future.",5,2020,12,10
148,Family Birthday treat ,"Lovely experience from start to finish. Alan & his team looked after us extremely well from the smooth check-in to the birthday greetings, sorting our lunch reservation. Overall a great stay. We will definitely be back after the new year. During these COVID times it‚Äôs nice to see a hotel doing there absolute best. Thanks again. See you soon ",5,2020,12,10
148,Great Hotel,"Myself and my husband spent 2 nights at the MeMelia, it‚Äôs situated on the Strand and within a 10 minute walk into Covent Garden and all that it has to offer. 
The hotel itself has a very modern decor, with lovely lounge area, we had a very comfortable room with a supersize bed.
The level of cleanliness was of a high standard, which in today‚Äôs climate was our concern but we needn‚Äôt have worried as every precaution was taken by staff to ensure we were safe. 
I would like to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to Adriana who went above and beyond to make our short stay memorable, thanks also to Sophia on Reception and to the girls in the Dining Room where we enjoyed a fabulous breakfast.
I would definitely recommend this hotel, We look forward to our next visit.",5,2020,12,09
148,Get your glad rags on and be ready to party!,"We have just had a long weekend at the Melia which even given the careful and very thorough attention to the present Covid pandemic was excellent in all respects!
Our room was spotlessly clean and the bed was the ideal place to spend an exra hour recovering from the previous nights excesses!
We were shopping during the day but each evening had booked a table at the famous rooftop Radio Bar - (booking is a must!) - we enjoyed spectacular views over London, great service and an excellent food offering of individual and sharing plates.

On our last night we dined in the ground floor STK Restaurant - a fantastic vibe - with excellent varied background music and a vibrant atmosphere created by mixed parties comprising couples or groups of friends.
The food was fantastic - I have to mention the King Crab Legs - I have never seen anything like it - they were huge - beautifully presented and so tasty. We were a party of 4 and all ordered different dishes enabling steak, seafood and pasta dishes to be sampled.
I could ramble on for ages about the decor of the public areas, the location, the secure atmosphere at night but better you try it for yourselves next time you're in town!",5,2020,12,09
148,A perfect place to stay,"Even in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic the hotel staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and safe. Rooms and all areas are spotless and clean and safe. All staff were respectful . In particular, Elisa who works in reception went the ‚Äòextra mile‚Äô for me. As a regular traveller, I really appreciated her excellent customer service. 

I cannot recommend this hotel enough for a stay in Central London. These guys know how to run a hotel and make you feel special!",5,2020,12,08
148,Stay at this hotel all the time.,"Always stay at the ME in London and don‚Äôt have any issue recommending to all my friends. Customer service is always second to none, in particularly Alan Ante & Emiliano & always make me feel welcome !",5,2020,12,06
148,Amazing overnight stay ,"We have just returned from a 5 night stay exploring London. Our first night we spent at ME London to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. 
We absolutely loved our stay at ME, felt very looked after on arrival, special mention to Vittoria for her extra efforts to decorate our room for my girlfriends birthday , it was a lovely surprise.
Our room was on the 9th floor with a balcony and was amazing, lovely views. The room was clean, spacious with extra modern touches.
We are at STK LONDON which was a lovely experience ( please see separate review ).
Breakfast was included with our stay and was possibly the best English breakfast that we have had, good quality and not greasy at all, along with very attentive, friendly sercice. 
My only negative would be that we wanted to explore the Radio rooftop bar just to look ( not a drink) at 21.45 before it closed at 22.00, but we weren't allowed. We were met by security from the lift who made us feel uncomfortable, when we only wanted to look at the view. But I suppose it's down to COVID.
Overall, we had a great overnight stay at ME, thank you for making our stay extra special and memorable. 
",5,2020,11,05
148,Lovely Stay,"Stayed at this hotel for my birthday, staff put birthday decorations in the room which was a nice touch. Staff were polite and very flexible to our requests. Further, the room was beautiful with a lovely view.",4,2020,11,05
148,Fantastic London Hotel,"A fantastic hotel in a great location very close to Covent Garden. Room and all facilities were of a high standard which made for a very enjoyable 3 night stay, but what made the visit extra special were the hotel staff, particularly the reception staff - Adriana & Sofia who were very friendly, efficient and really made us welcome.
A very enjoyable stay and we would definitely recommend this hotel for any visit to London.",5,2020,11,04
148,Birthday surprise,"Really don‚Äôt like leaving a bad review for this hotel that we have had so many lovely weekends away in, Especially in these testing times we find ourselves in..
 Check in and room experience was good.. 
 Lovely personal message In our room with a nice bottle of champagne.. 
 Had an email a few weeks before saying we would receive 5000 points on check in for booking with Me London which didn‚Äôt happen,
We‚Äôre supposed to receive 2 complimentary cocktails in radio of which I have paid ¬£22 for, 
As a silver member I was under the impression I receive a complimentary breakfast for my companion which I have also paid for.. 
Also paying for a suite and supposedly having ME plus benefits Surprised me as I couldn‚Äôt really see what they were.. 

I‚Äôve only ever given 5 stars for previous stays at this hotel and have introduced many people to them over the years so it really saddens me to only be able to give 3 this time round... 
",3,2020,11,03
148,ME Hotel London - The best I have ever stayed at,"I conduct hotel inspections and contracts for a large Middle Eastern airline so will provide an honest review.
The hotel oozes luxury, panache, style and excellent customer service.
At check in, I was greeted by the lovely Vittoria who was warm, friendly and most accommodating. She upgraded me to the Mode room and saw to my every need and was extremely quick to address my requests and service was fast and smooth.
The room allocated to me was 32 squared meters, spotless, superb, luxury, comfortable, modern, stylish, the furnishing was sleek modern, comfortable. The bed had Egyptian cotton and was extremely comfortable (I slept like a baby), it had sound proofing, a finger tip control panel to control, AC, ambient lighting and stylish night lamp which were easy to use. The cleverly located mini bar had all you could want, including complementary Nespresso coffee, tea and the making facilities. The bathroom had twin sinks, fluffy large towels, and a very spacious large rejuvenating  twin rain shower with luxury amenities. The closet space was all you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The colours were a simple black and white, with frosted glass for privacy and mirrors which set apart this hotel from its competitors. The interior design not just of the rooms but the entire hotel had been given significant thought to make it look like you were in another world.
Alan the Business development manager, very kindly showed me around the hotel, as it was Covid, the projection system on the 1st floor was switched off but he very kindly switched it on for me and nothing was too much trouble.
The Radio Rooftop bar was superb for cocktails , superb views of London main landmarks and scrumptious food, the lobster was out of this world.
The service in both the room and restaurant bar was quick, efficient, friendly and would definitely keep me coming back for more.
The location is in the heart of London, with theatres, restaurants and shops very nearby, Covent Garden is a stones throw away.
I didn't have time to try STK grill and that is definitively on my to do list.
Please view my Youtube video at HolidayAirlineMan where I have a review of the entire hotel.",5,2020,10,30
148,Fabulous ,"We were booked to stay at the Meli√° White House but it is yet to reopen so they transferred our booking to Me at no extra cost. I checked in online and was delighted to get a free upgrade to an Energy Terrace Room.
We received a very warm welcome at check in which was quick and efficient. The room (806)was fabulous with a very large, comfortable bed, all the amenities you could need and so very quiet.
Breakfast was absolutely delicious and the service outstanding. I can highly recommend the avocado & poached eggs on toasted sourdough and the ferme des peupilers yogurt. The Rooftop Bar was the setting for breakfast and we saw the sunrise over the London skyline on our final morning.
Location is excellent with Covent Garden on your doorstep and both Embankment & Charing Cross Stations a short walk away - ideal for Euston. 
This hotel is perfect and we would happily stay here again ... thank you to all the wonderful staff.",5,2020,10,28
148,Cherry on top to celebrate a milestone birthday!,"We stayed at ME London hotel for one night to celebrate a milestone birthday.

Upon arrival we were kindly greeted by the helpful team to help us check in and they explained clearly what services were made available to us during our stay. I mentioned at time of booking that we were celebrating my fiance's birthday and I felt that they have listened as when entering our room, we were presented with a lovely surprise of birthday wishes and a bottle of bubbly waiting for us to start the celebrations! The room itself was very clean and had all of the amenities that we needed for a relaxing stay. I had made a couple of requests during our stay and they were met timely and at a very high standard.

We had also booked dinner at STK and breakfast at the Radio Rooftop Bar and both were very enjoyable and easily accessible within the hotel so we didn't need to go outside. It was great to feel that I was somewhere different even though I know the location very well.

We both really enjoyed our stay at ME London and would definitely come back hopefully to celebrate my birthday next!",5,2020,10,27
148,Anniversary ,Wow from check in to checkout this place was amazing room was something else radio rooftop bar was amazing this was a lot to do with salla on front desk a absolute star couldn‚Äôt be better STK restaurant on site  brilliant waiter was the best Darius thank you.. must say all staff were brilliant but didn‚Äôt get there names.. 5 STAR,5,2020,10,26
148,Delightfully surprising,"We stayed here for our 1st Anniversary and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I left with a beaming smile ear to ear. They had our room ready with a personalised message, bottle of champagne and the cutest pink heart balloons which I want expecting at all! From that moment on I knew I was about to have the best stay! After dinner at STK (which was superb 5*) we asked if we could have another bottle of champagne sent to our room which I was happy to pay for the lovely receptionist sent it to us complimentary. I couldn‚Äôt thank the team enough for what was a fantastic stay they really did make sure we had a great time. I wish I could of stayed longer. ",5,2020,10,26
148,Excellent hotel,"We booked directly through the hotel which had a personal touch and on arrival we were greeted by warm and friendly staff.
Our Vibe room was spotlessly clean and comfortable with great facilities and an amazing view of the Strand through the quirky, triangular shaped full length window. We requested some items for the room which were delivered promptly and the room was serviced to a high standard whilst we were there.
We enjoyed a delicious breakfast at the Radio Rooftop Bar with fantastic views over London.
All the staff were approachable and professional and we will definitely be returning in the near future.",5,2020,10,24
148,A good 4 Star,"This is a very good 4* hotel. On paper it‚Äôs a 5* hotel but I don‚Äôt think that it offers either the luxury or the opulence that the term 5* conjures. 

The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful and accommodating. They really go out of their way to make sure that you enjoy your stay. Therein lies one of the problems. There are a vast number of small problems (not enough to complain about in themselves but annoying) and the staff is very keen to make sure that we know how sorry they are that those problems (things like items missing at breakfast, turndown being missed, no milk in the room, etc) occurred. If they spent less time apologising and put as much effort into getting things right in the first place the hotel would improve greatly!

The hotel was built in 2007 (?) and would have been a modern, contemporary, hotel when it was built. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been a great deal of updating done since then and many places are starting to look tired. The walls in the bedroom have the odd scuff, the TV is scratched, the taps in the bathroom are looking worn, the plug in one of the washbasins has lost its chrome finish, there‚Äôs no handle to open the shower door from the inside, there are far too many points to list individually. 

Breakfast (in Radio Rooftop) was good. But there were far too many silly errors. Things not toasted when they should be, the wrong kind of tea, bacon cooked to the point of being dehydrated. Why is the milk they serve with the tea a vague brown colour?

The location of the hotel is excellent. If you want to be in the heart of theatre district then this is it!

It‚Äôs also good value for money. We want a room with a balcony in a central hotel. The charges here are very reasonable for what we want. (However we normally stay in a flat in Mayfair - it‚Äôs slightly more money but far more luxurious!).
I would stay here again (we are planning to do at Christmas) but it‚Äôs not a hotel that I feel I have to rush back to. It‚Äôs done its job but this isn‚Äôt a hotel where I feel I have a strong attachment.",3,2020,10,23
148,Don‚Äôt be fooled,"I have been criticised and verbally fooled by the staff. I have a medical condition I don‚Äôt have to share with anybody especially with the employees of the hotel. I paid for a room and later during the day I have rudely asked by a short manager to wear a mask. I tried to explain that I was exempt and when I checked in I explained to the lady at the reception but he insisted and it reached the point that he called the security. I never felt more humiliated. I am sorry if I don‚Äôt have a perfect health but I cannot wear a mask, whatever the settings. I‚Äôll never come back",1,2020,10,22
148,Superb Location,"Stayed for 3 nights in a balcony room. Location of the hotel is second to none. Hotel itself is nice, dark interiors, good scent throughout. Room was spacious by london standards and had all mod cons. I would say toilet is a bit low to the ground for my taste but a minor thing. Rooftop bar for breakfast was nice with good views. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",4,2020,10,22
148,Friendly and professional service,"Lovely family stay at this hotel. All of the staff were really helpful and friendly. We used the rooftop bar and STK restaurant. Great service and quality. The rooms were very spacious, clean and stylish. Great location. Particular thanks to Emiliano who went above and beyond when sorting out a communication issue that was created when booking through the central reservations. I recommend booking direct with the hotel.",5,2020,10,19
148,Daughters 21st birthday celebrations,"Stayed at ME London, drunk in the radio bar and ate in STK London.  All excellent. Hotel, bar and restaurant pulled out all the stops to make my twin daughters 21st birthday special from the moment we arrived to the end of our stay.  Special mention to Emelliano who made sure all the extras happened.  Thank you ME London we will be back!",5,2020,10,19
148,Excellent location  -,"Thank you for the great stay, exceeded my expectations!
The staff was incredibly professional friendly at all times.
Safe Covid measures made us feel comfortable to stay.

The room was done to a great standard and had a balcony overlooking the river.

The unique luxurious atmosphere made the stay feel particularly special.
We also experienced dining at STK and the Radio rooftop which I would also definitely recommend!!",5,2020,10,17
148,Stylish rooms and magical moments created by Adriana,"Stayed the weekend at the Me London. Great central location just seconds away from Covent Garden with really stylish and modern rooms - beautiful showers, great mood lighting, and modern decor. If you have a chance go for dinner at the STK hotel restaurant which is a fun place with good music and nice steaks. 
However the highlight of the stay was Adriana - aura host (a super personalised concierge) - she was able to create two magic moments that will make the stay forever memorable (she got us a last minute reservation at STK - but what was really magical is that when we got back to the room - she had organised mood music, wrote some Very inspiring messages on the mirrors and left us a balloon with a really nice note  - making it a truly amazing highlight. So would really recommend the ME London (also love the ME Ibiza) but in particular once there find Adriana who made our stay truly special. ",5,2020,10,16
148,Great location- be prepared to show off wealth,"Very nice, would consider staying here again but not a fan of judgmental staff and other guests. Key cards randomly stopped working halfway through our visit. Security almost wouldn‚Äôt let us back up to our room at the end of the night (sorry we didn‚Äôt have our designer clothes and money to flaunt around with us when we came back in from a quick bite to eat). Rooms are clean and loved the mood lighting. Great views especially if you pay extra for a terrace room. Only other complaint is that toilets are very low to the ground. Lovely hotel. Fairly comfortable beds- could be softer, also may want to request extra pillows if you choose to stay here. Excellent location, close to lots of restaurants, pubs, and things to do",4,2020,10,15
148,May as well have been at Butlins.,I want to add that this review is being wrote when the 10pm curfew has been introduced and it is terribly hard to go 'out' for a drink anywhere without prebooking. Whilst walking in to the hotel we was made to wait over 20 mins to check in whilst a group of 6 very drunken people was trying to sort out rooms. 20 mins later we walked into our room which we had may as well went into STK downstairs as the party next door was so loud. We then complained to the manager only to be moved to the room the other side of the noise. We was then told not to move and the  other room would be moved. This is a luxury hotel - this should not be happening. The party next door was not moved and luckily we managed to fall asleep before they got back as at 5am again we was awoken by loud music. The bed was broken in the corner of the room and to be honest I wanted to get out of the room ASAP so cannot really comment on anything else except it was clean but isn't that to be expected. If the ME hotel wants to go down the route of party hotel then that is fine and would work due to STK and radio but this should not be advertised the same as luxury experience it once was famous for.,1,2020,10,12
148,Luxury ,"I stayed here for one night in February and can‚Äôt fault the hotel. Valet parking upon arrival and the staff were friendly and helpful. 
Located in central London not too far from the tourist spots. 
Our room (city view & balcony) was immaculate and clean, the bed was comfy and the overall aesthetic was modern and fresh. 
The rooftop bar is also a great addition to the hotel and has a good atmosphere. 
As we stayed during a valentines weekend they added some nice finishing touches to the room such as a bottle of wine & roses in reception. 

The hotel itself deserves 5* as I cannot fault my stay, and I will be returning very soon!",5,2020,10,08
148,Water leak in room,"We paid over ¬£800 for one night in the suite. We found that the suite was rather basic and disappointingly lacked the basic amenities such as tea bags and milk so we had to call for these items to be sent up to our suite on numerous occasions.

In the morning after our night stay, we realised that our suitcase was soaked through and the whole carpet area where the iron was positioned in our room was totally wet and damp due to a leak by the windows. 

We called to inform reception of the leak as we were concerned of the safety aspects and a manager was sent up to inspect the leak, this manager was rather rude and unapologetic towards us by immediately stating that it is strange why the carpet was damp as they have never had a leak like this before and he doesn‚Äôt know where the leak was coming from, to this end, he made us feel like we had intentionally made the carpet damp. However, we quickly pointed out to this manager that it is clear that the leak came from the ceiling and he could feel that the ceiling is still wet. 

Still rather unapologetic, this manager continued to make us feel worse by saying that we should have informed reception last night as they would have moved us to another suite. With all due respect to this manager, we didn‚Äôt notice the leak until we packed up our belongings to check out and for him to say that we should have noticed the leak earlier is rather unpleasant and not how paying guests should be spoken to. 

We left the hotel rather disappointed in the service we received, especially from this so called manager, after paying a large amount of money for a suite to celebrate a special occasion in this so called five star hotel.",2,2020,10,08
148,Amazing stay!,"Booked one night for my bf‚Äôs birthday and it was a perfect stay. The staff, especially Adriana Rossello, went above and beyond to make it special, even inviting us to a free breakfast. Can‚Äôt thank them enough. Will definitely be back!",5,2020,10,06
148,All front - no substance,"On arrival the hotel and rooms look 5 star -  then the issues.
Poor design is everywhere. 
You have to kneel on the floor to adjust the temperature. The tv is so low you can't watch it without your feet getting in the way. The walls are so thin that you can join your neighbours conversations whenever you like. None of the taps work properly, the safe is so badly located you need two people to hold it open while the other puts things into it and if you want to flush the toilet be ready for a 30 minute stay.
These are not problems with the management of the hotel, they are basic errors in design that obviously no one ever cared to check which is scandalous.
3 star hotel pretending to be what it isn't- avoid.",1,2020,10,03
148,Overcharged ,"My partner booked this room for ¬£170 for one night. After we had checked out he‚Äôd been charged ¬£240. He tried to call hotel immediately but no response. I‚Äôve since emailed them instead and awaiting a response. To put their guests in this position is sheet embarrassment. 

Other points..
The bed is just a large sprung bed with a topper on it. Not what I expected from this type of hotel! We have a Tempur bed at home so we expect something on par in a five star establishment. Very hard bed. 

Long dark hair found in hand towel. My fianc√© has short hair & after having chemotherapy this year I have no hair so this was definitely not ours. Made me feel a bit sick & wondered after that if towels had been changed at all. 

The rainfall shower head didn‚Äôt work properly the heads had never been cleaned so my partner had to unclog the jets himself. My partner is a man that notices the details & none of this is what you expect from this type of place. No robes or slippers either. Even some four star hotels provide them. 

Tv was a waste of time, no smart TV & no sky channels or even pay movies so coming back at the current 10pm curfew was made even more boring. 

Overall the decor was nice but you can see that from online. The actual experience was far from high end. ",1,2020,09,30
148,"Great central location, huge bed","Spent a night in London to have afternoon tea and dinner. ME upgraded our room which was very nice - very modern style, not a huge room (this is Central London) but a very large comfortable bed. Very centrally located.",5,2020,09,28
148,Birthday weekend,"A night stay at ME London after our original hotel is still closed (Melia White). Service was amazing, reception staff friendly & helpful. Front of house manager great service, spoke to him while waiting to check in and he came and found us the next morning at breakfast to make sure everything was ok & that we had a good night out. Room was lovely, bed very comfortable, best night sleep I‚Äôve had in a while. Fabulous breakfast in the rooftop bar. Great views. 
The only problem was waiting for the lifts, 2 of the 3 seemed to not be working. Sometimes a long wait to get one, but nothing major. ",5,2020,09,27
148,Shocked at service we received.,"We stayed here for two days and from the minute we arrived were shocked a 5* hotel could get things so wrong, we're were supposed to have two rooms booked for 2 days next door to each other we were told that only one room had been booked for one night and we had to phone out company up to see what was going on, my son was given a room on the 8th floor and was told a holding deposit of ¬£100 pounds had to be put on his credit card before he was allowed to take the room he was in fact charged ¬£750 pounds,then after waiting on reception for over a hour and my phone calls later they finally found our booking but as the PA from the company had booked it in her name for us we were also charged the holding deposit,we meet work colleagues at the precooked rooftop bar where after service that I will say I have received better at a travel lodge and far speedier a d more efficient and very much cheaper we tried to get back into my room on the 5th floor not next to my sons, the card would not work in the lift or the room had to travel back to reception to start the whole debarcale again about not being the named person on the booking even though I had signed and paid on my card after phone calls again room numbers given and a manager called and paperwork finally found I was allowed another key to my room, just when we thought nothing else could go wrong as we were checking out the next day we were told that we needed to pay another ¬£333.60 for the room that had already been pain for on trying to explain again to them it was like knocking in nails on granite I paid again as we were made late for another meeting what should have been a stress free few day to sort out a really big contract turned into a nightmare we left it to the PA to sort as to be far am supprised they have any customers at all as waiting in reception to collect our luggage on the way back we were clearly not the only ones with issues, had on heart I have stayed in London my times on many different places and this has to rank as the worst customer service I have ever seen definitely would be the last place I would ever book again totally appalling.",2,2020,09,24
148,Brilliant stay!,"Great location, minutes from Covent Garden! The hotel itself is stylish and has a great atmosphere. The rooftop bar is great for drinks. The rooms have everything you need and the bed is comfortable. Would definitely stay again!",5,2020,09,22
148,Very Enjoyable Stay,"Stayed for one night for a London weekend away and had a really good time. I couldn't quite award the excellent status however as for the price paid it didn't really hit the 'luxury' spot! Great location, lovely looking interior, very modern and sleek. Check in took forever unfortunately, we must have been waiting over 10 minutes before we were even next in the queue. We booked a balcony room, the room was a good size and very clean with good amenities. The thing that let the hotel down from a luxury perspective would be the service, we could have been at a Premier Inn and receive the same level, it was just pretty average. Also small details like only having one English Breakfast teabag rather than two?! No fresh milk?! I'm not sure I'd stay again as I wasn't blown away and I think you'd get better 'luxury' service elsewhere for the same price.",4,2020,09,21
148,A great tay in a fantastic location,A great hotel with superb staff. Very comfortable room. Everything worked and breakfast on the roof top restaurant was outstanding. We used the valet parking service which was good too and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Overall a brilliant stay and can't wait to go back,5,2020,09,21
148,It's decent ,"A modern hotel at a prime location. We booked a luxury room with a river view and  balcony, but the river is so far in the distance that I'd say a 'river view' is false advertising. The room could have been slightly cleaner for the price but nonetheless the hotel is okay. Some hidden sliding wall dotted around, so take time to properly explore the room so that you can locate things like the mini bar. We wish we were told where we could find this ahead of our stay as we had no idea! ",3,2020,09,19
148,Superb stay.,"Have just had a fabulous stay at the ME on The Strand. Very comfortable, well appointed spacious bedroom with lovely temperature bathroom. 
Had a super lunch in the Rooftop bar on arrival and delicious breakfasts each day all with fantastic service from Mercedes and team. All the staff were incredibly professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. 
The weather was scorching and it was a real oasis to come back to each day, cool, calm and efficient not to mention how nice it smells!!! A real treat, thank you everyone.",5,2020,09,18
148,Loved my stay here!,"My daughters treated me for my 50th birthday, the hotel was amazing, the room was more than big enough for the three of us, the bed and pillows were sooooooo comfy I would go as far as saying probably the best I‚Äôve ever slept in apart from home, the bathroom was big enough for us three girls to all get ready at the same time, loved the lighting in the room, the only thing I would say is the breakfast is so overpriced but literally as you come out of the hotel cross the road to your right and there is a cafe next to Greggs that make the most delicious sandwiches as you wait, we had 3 x bacon and sausage sandwiches all hot and cooked to order for under ¬£10 and brought them back to our room in less then 2 minutes, I cannot remember the name but as I said it‚Äôs next to Greggs you won‚Äôt miss it, staff were great.",5,2020,09,06
148,Bank holiday stay,"Hotel staff very helpful and friendly - went above and beyond to accommodate our requests and needs throughout our stay. Special thank you to the manager for all your efforts to ensure that we had the best experience.
Only criticism is the radio rooftop bar yet again - we arrived for our table booking at 10pm to find last orders are at 10:20! Take care to check closing time for your stay as you will have to finish your drinks in your room as no where else in the hotel is open. Also late night bar staff can be discourteous and abrupt - not up to the same high standard as the rest of the hotel.",5,2020,09,02
148,One night getaway,"Had a very enjoyable one night stay at the hotel. The room was spacious and luxurious, coolly designed. The bed was huge and really comfortable. Great view of theatre land from the room.

We ate in the rooftop Radio Bar and the views were amazing. Food was delicious, service was friendly but a little chaotic with long waits perhaps down to staff struggling with Covid controls. Great atmosphere with the bar/restaurant mainly frequented by young, lively crowd. We were by far eldest there!

Valet parking a godsend, really efficient.

Breakfast was disappointing. Service great, but food and tea were lukewarm. Not good considering how expensive it was even after the Eat Out To Help Out deal (¬£56 for two of us).

Overall, we had a lovely stay and would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,08,30
148,Superb hotel and stay,"We arrived to a warm and friendly welcome from the reception staff. Check in was speedy and efficient having already checked in online. We found hotel staff in all departments and roles to be highly personable, helpful and customer focused. All areas of this very modern  hotel are immaculately clean and the bedrooms are very spacious too. The 'rain' shower is amazing and further enhanced our experience at this great  hotel.  Situated a very short walk from Covent Garden the location of the hotel could not be better and despite being on a busy thoroughfare the hotel was totally peaceful inside.and had a calming feel to it. Although we would have preferred a lower floor, the hotel is working under the current difficult constraints and we  are confident that the hotel staff  would do their best to accommodate this request on our next visit. Highly recommended.",5,2020,08,27
148,The best hotel in London ‚ò∫Ô∏è,"Me and my boyfriend have visited the me London 3 times now and they never fail to impress we have stayed at the shard, Marriott county hall & the Park plaza but this is our favourite hotel and we will continue to keep coming back. The staff are amazing so warm and welcoming and friendly throughout the whole of the stay to staff taking your car to reception to cleaners they are all amazing & so kind, the hotel is so beautiful laid out amazing and very well spaced everywhere we love going at Christmas time especially the decorations are beautiful everywhere and the rooms are amazing they are clean, we‚Äôve stayed in there normal room twice (which is amazing) and one of there rooms with a balcony view which is also amazing we can not say 1 bad thing about both. The rooftop bar staff are also amazing and it‚Äôs a lovely place to have drinks they fit us in anytime as we are staying in the hotel. Also the hotel is in an amazing location with a shop across the road and 5 minute walk from Covent Garden :) We love this hotel and we can honestly not pick at 1 bad thing to say about it if your thinking about booking here please do not hesitate. We look forward to our next stay here ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5,2020,08,23

Suite. Contemporary decorated very spacious beautiful suite, with an extra large corner bath with endless hot water.  Separate shower & separate twin sinks, 2 toilets.  Beautiful sitting room with dressing table.  The bedroom had the largest, comfiest bed I‚Äôve ever slept in, the size of 2 double beds, however it was only one huge mattress, incredible space! 
Lovely food, drinks & cocktails served on the hotels rooftop bar, with spectacular views along the River Thames. 
Perfect location for our 4 nights stay. ",5,2020,08,23

148,Very satisfying despite Covid-19,"Had a pleasant stay with my family (total of 4)
Clean, nicely decorated, valet parking
Friendly staff. Breakfast was very good
Only con was the inability to dine in any of the hotel restaurants -all fully booked",4,2020,08,18
148,Our 2 star stay at 5 star Me,"The only reason we are giving this a two star is because the location and views are spectacular and the staff were so lovely to us. Especially the restaurant staff.

My husband booked us a two night stay here on the 9th floor for my birthday. The first room was lovely however he hot water didn't work in the taps or shower and on trying to use them both him and myself were sprayed with stagnant yellow water in the face, twice. The hotel did sort it and after asking moved us to the adjacent room however, the room they moved us to was dishevelled and unclean. There was a stain inside and on top of the toilet. The towels had marks on them, the shower gel hadn't been refilled etc. I understand that they may have been short staffed because of the crisis however, as the price was the same, customers will expect the same standard and to not have a clean room during the outbreak is terrible. A staff member called to speak to ask if our room was OK and my husband listed the problems. However, when we came back after housekeeping had been in, the toilet was still unclean and shower gel empty. I also had to laugh when the steam in the bathroom revealed a message from the last occupants.

The water or the cold breakfast on the first morning were probably to blame for me feeling unwell the first night. That being said the breakfast on the second morning was incredible.

The issues also delayed my birthday plans and we didn't get to do all of the things my husband had planned for us. The hotel refunded our parking but in hindsight really should have done more considering the amount of problems we faced on a special occasion.",2,2020,08,12
148,Great huge rooms with private balconies in an amazing location!,"Wonderful helpful, polite staff and a spotless, huge room helped make this a memorable stay. 

We chose a balcony room with a city view that helped make our stay a bit more special. Each balcony is private and has a table and chairs which made it feel like being on holiday in our home city. 

Our room generously proportioned, shower was great and powerful + lovely amenities provided.",4,2020,08,05
148,Nice hotel in a good location ,"We arrived on a Sat afternoon for one night. Booked a room with balcony, city view and breakfast included. Check in was quick and courteous. Staff were wearing face masks. There was a quick mention of us celebrating a special occasion in passing. It was our 36th wedding anniversary.

Our room was on the 8th floor with a view of Covent garden and theatre land rooftops. Not the city as we know it. The room was lovely though. The Bali shower was great and we had a good night's sleep. Tea and coffee are complimentary, however, we only had herbal tea so I asked for ordinary tea bags. They wanted to charge us over ¬£5.00 for the priveledge. We refused on principle and this was quickly sorted. There was not an iron but a hand steamer. Hairdryer and some toiletries provided. If you want slippers, dressing gowns or a shower cap these are on request. We didn't bother as we didn't want more unexpected charges. We worked out for ourselves how everything worked in the room as there were no instructions provided.  The bed was comfortable and we had a good night's sleep.

When we checked in, we were told they would try to book us a table for dinner at Radio Rooftop for 9pm as nothing was available earlier. We then received a phone call telling us that wasn't available either and the next time slot was 10.15. In actuality, we didn't get to sit outside until gone 11pm and by the time we were able to order food, light snacks, it was gone midnight. Please book ahead if you want a table there.

Breakfast is served on the rooftop. It wasn't busy. The service was good, staff are really nice but the food wasn't cooked very well.  I ate as I was hungry from the night before. There is good variety on the menu but it is pricey if not included in your booking.

We ate lunch at the Sky garden and received a surprise free dessert with a lovely message. Sadly, for this hotel, unless you pay for the priveledge, there is no special message, not even on the tv as a welcome. Disappointing. 

Although all the staff were nice, we expected more for a 5* hotel. It is super convenient for covent garden, theatre land and you are 

in walking distance of the National Gallery, St. James's park, Trafalgar square, Whitehall and the Royal Horseguards, Parliament, Westminster, and Big Ben. Westminster Abbey, Waterloo station

 and the Thames.  For us though, we will try somewhere different next time.",3,2020,08,03
148,Perfect,"This hotel is very beautiful; the decor and atmosphere is perfect. The staff were welcoming and attentive. We chose a balcony city view room 9th floor; seating area on the balcony which was lovely; great views. The room itself was so beautiful and the bathroom area is luxury. An extremely clean hotel. Located near convent garden which has many restaurants, bars and interesting things to see. No complaints. My partner and I will return.",5,2020,07,25
148,Not worth the money,"

Hi

We stayed for one night for  our anniversary and I have to say I was extremely disappointed.

We usually travel abroad for our anniversary but due to Covid we thought we would treat ourselves to a night away in London. At ¬£324 a night I would have expected a much more luxury experience. I have stayed at many 5* hotels both in the UK and abroad and I have to say this is by far the worst hotel I have stayed at. It felt more like a Premier Inn than a 5*.

We were not told any details of the facilities such as the rooftop bar or restraunt or advised of the opening times. We found this out by chatting to another guest near the lift. There was also no information regarding any of the hotel facilities in our room. I understand due to covid you may be reducing on paper but at ¬£324 a night im sure even¬† a print out could have been arranged.

I came across the mini bar by accident in the morning. We were not advised of where anything was in the room, how to use the safe etc..had to ring reception 4 times to find out where the iron was.

No robes or slippers were provided in the bathroom which is the least I would expect from a 5 star hotel.

I feel we were robbed being charged ¬£324 for this room and I hope you will consider reviewing your prices or providing a service that warrants the price for this room.

",1,2020,07,22
148,Not good value for money,"We stayed here for 1 night for my birthday we have stayed here a couple of years ago & loved it but I think it‚Äôs gone down hill & would not go back. The rooms seem quite dated now & the balcony you pay extra for was dirty. The double bed was 2 single beds pushed together!!!! & not comfortable at all. We booked a table for the roof top bar the service was shocking & staff were very rude. Have stayed in much better hotels in London for a lot less money. 
Would definitely not recommend the radio roof top bar either there is no atmosphere & it looks like you only get an outside nice table if you have an argument with the manager that‚Äôs what we witnessed. Drinks are ridiculously overpriced we had champagne yet again service was shocking had to re fill our glasses & paid ¬£157 for the privilege so would avoid",1,2020,07,20
148,Not a 5 star hotel,"Room was in a terrible state if repair. Not what id expect for spending ¬£300+ a night
Room was very dusty, bed had been poorly repaired, Glass tables in room were filthy.
We asked for these to be cleaned but nothing seemed to change",2,2020,07,20
148,Great hotel but radio bar experience mixed,The trip was a gift for a hard working key worker but sadly the radio bar disappointed .... I cannot help but think his age played a part and he did not experience the best of the hotel . Not a big issue just disappointing.,3,2020,07,18
148,Excellent Hotel (and vegan friendly!),"I've just spent three nights at ME London to celebrate my son's 21st birthday. We had two interconnecting 'Vibe' rooms on the seventh floor, a king and a twin and they were beautiful and spacious with excellent views across London. The beds were comfy and the rooms were extremely quiet so we were not disturbed by the comings and goings of other guests at all. The wardrobes contained plenty of hangers and when I requested an iron and ironing board, they were brought to the room within minutes.

The staff displayed a high level of professionalism and I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. Every-one from reception, breakfast and the Aura team was so kind and friendly and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. I booked the rooms less than one week before we arrived (as the coronavirus epidemic meant we had to cancel our original holiday plans) and explained it was for a special birthday; Antonio was very helpful. I arranged for one of the celebration packages and it was better than I expected when a lady from the Aura team turned up with not only champagne and multi-coloured balloons but also two giant silver, helium '21' balloons. It was a great start to our stay!

We arrived at the ME just 8 days after the hospitality sector was allowed to re-open after the coronavirus lockdown so measures were in place to protect guests and staff, meaning that some services had been suspended or changed. There was no prosecco on arrival (which I only know about from reading other reviews) and there was no turn down service, for example but these are minor points and did not affect our experience. I'm not sure whether breakfast was previously served as a buffet but during our stay it was an √† la carte arrangement in the rooftop bar and we really enjoyed it. Breakfast was included with our package and we could choose whatever we wanted from the menu. The choice was excellent and the food was high quality, excellently presented with vegan options. I had the vegan cooked breakfast with scrambled tofu,which was delicious and soya milk was readily available. The staff was attentive and regularly asked whether we would like anything else. The setting too was stunning.

We loved  this hotel and I'm hoping to return next month with my daughter which is an indicator of my satisfaction. Below are several tips for potential guests:

No milk was provided in the rooms but there's a Tesco Metro diagonally opposite where you can pick up some.

Book the roof top bar in advance of your stay if you really want to experience it in the evening as one of the reception team who checked us in thought it was already full on the day we arrived so, due to prior arrangements, we did not have another opportunity to go there at night.

Although I booked 'Vibe' rooms, we did not have the 'floor to ceiling walk-in window' that was in the website room description. This was perhaps because we'd requested interconnecting rooms (including one twin bedded) so if you specifically want these special feature windows, then it might be worth ringing first to confirm.",5,2020,07,15
148,Good room but otherwise poor,"Hotel room was very nice - but a cooked breakfast was served stone cold.

Trying to contact the hotel afterwards with a query has totally failed.  As you are open, I think there is no excuse not to answer the phone at all over 6 attempts during a 24 hours period.

Overall I'd expect better.",2,2020,07,13
148,The hotel has a strong W vibe,"Th hotel is very well designed. Don‚Äôt know why this hotel reminds me a lot of W hotels. This hotel also has a strong nightclub vibe. The room is very comfortable and clean. The hotel location is good, it‚Äôs in a walking distance to the London Eye, Big Ben, etc.. put some put in the bathroom is badly displayed. Front desk needs some improvements as well. ",4,2020,05,17
148,Great Customer Service; London Cancellation,"Unfortunately, we had to cancel a trip to London and all of the staff at ME London were extremely helpful in working this out but especially Emiliano Del Pizzo who is the Head Concierge.

We hopefully will be able to reschedule our trip to London and in the event we are, the only place we would consider staying is the ME London.

148,London Cancellation,We had the unfortunate situation where we planned an overseas vacation to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. With the outbreak of the virus we were forced to cancel our planned trip. The ME London staff were very helpful in regards to the canceeling of our booked accomodation and I would say they were both professional and respectful and i would have no hestitaion in using their facility when we are able to travel again.,5,2020,04,22
148,The warmest hospitality in the darkest times,"When the world is under immense stress, little acts of kindness and people going out of their way to make your life easier have such a profound impact - this was our ME experience from start to finish. Thank you.
A late minute booking was required as our ski holiday was cancelled due to the virus, instead of being met with a rush, we had a super warm welcome (complete with glass of bubbles), and were given a delightful room. After we returned from our evening meal out we found in our beautifully turned down room a small bottle of bubbles and a birthday cheesecake, complete with candle and hand written card. The thoughtfulness of Dimitra and the ME staff was heartwarming in such worrisome times.
We look forward to our next visit in slightly more planned circumstances. Thank you so much for making this rushed alternative the best UK based birthday choice!",5,2020,03,25
148,Above and beyond perfect!,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough, the staff were amazing and we were so fortune to be upgraded which made the experience 1000x better! Everytime we come to London we will be staying here! Thank you for an amazing experience and helping us out with whatever was needed! Beautiful hotel!",5,2020,03,24
148,Perfect stay!,"From the moment we arrived here I couldn't fault anything! Upon arrival we informed the check in worker it was a birthday celebration and she upgraded our room free of charge which was a nice touch. All of the decor in the hotel is unique and the overall ambiance is amazing. Everywhere is completely spotless, including the room. The room itself is very sizable, has a very nice big comfy bed with a big bathroom. Breakfast was lovely, at a good price and with many different options. All of the staff we interacted with were extremely friendly and accommodating. I can't recommend this hotel enough, I will certainly be returning.",5,2020,03,23

148,Engagement / 50th Birthday,"Despite the lock down due to recent events my girlfriend and I decided to keep our trip to the ME London hotel and we are glad that we did! The restaurants may not have been open which couldn't be helped but the staff did their very best to make sure that we had a lovely stay. Antonio was amazing, he gave us an instant upgrade to the Passion Suite with a bottle of champagne on arrival as well as showing us around the views from the radio rooftop bar and the penthouse. We asked Antonio if we could take some evening photos in the penthouse which has a stunning view of London in which I whispered to him that I wanted to propose. He was very Happy to help and took photos for us and gave us another bottle of champagne to celebrate which made our evening very special! 

We would highly recommend this hotel as it is stunning and the staff are all lovely making us feel very welcome and we shall be returning to see it at it's full capacity once things return back to normal in the UK. 

Thanks again Antonio for making our stay a special one.

148,Great Hotel,"Stopped here earlier this month for the 2nd time and on both occasions it has been excellent. The hotel location is in a great location which allows easy access to theatres and shops. It is very modern and stylish inside and very different to an average hotel. The staff were all excellent at check in and made us feel very welcome. We stayed in an Aura type room this time and one with a balcony and amazing view previously. The rooms all good, not huge in terms of size but well appointed and perfect for a couple. We used radio rooftop for drinks and had a great time, very handy that they allow residents in to have a table even when its really busy. The drinks aren't cheap but the venue is great and well worth a visit. Breakfast is served here and it again is excellent, good service and the food itself great quality. I'm sure we will be back soon.",5,2020,03,20

148,All around great place,We came to London from the States solely to see the new show Magic Goes Wrong. Stayed at the ME for 2 nights. Everything was great and the architecture was really interesting. If we ever come back to London we will save time researching a place to stay and simply stay here again.,5,2020,03,14
148,Amazing,"From the moment we arrived we were treated like the most important guests. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable maintaining a relaxed and friendly and very efficient atmosphere.The room was beautiful, modern, comfortable and spotlessly clean.The triangle windows jutting out onto the street were a lovely fun feature. 10/10 for the breakfasts and service in the rooftop restaurant continued to be excellent. The views were astonishing and my daughter even commented we can see nearly all the sights from the hotel..why leave! I have to agree I could have sat there all day! I will definitely stay again next time in London.",5,2020,03,12

148,Me London,"My partner and I are huge fans of the Melia chain and on our travels enjoy visiting, the Me being a more ‚Äòupmarket‚Äô side of the brand we thought we‚Äôd treat ourselves to a stay to round off our honeymoon! This hotel would not be out of place on the Las Vegas strip, everything about it reminds me of my stays in Vegas, from the grandeur lobby, to the clientele and obvious party vibe.  When we arrived after travelling back from Europe I had severe envy that I wasn‚Äôt glammed up and getting ready for a night out, it was easy to get swept up in the atmosphere.  

As with most Melia hotels, check in is accompanied by complimentary prosecco, which is always welcome and we checked into our room without issue, our luggage was later brought up to the room by the porter.  As we were celebrating our honeymoon, the wonderful team had left us some treats in the room; brownies, champagne, rose petals on the bed and a lovely handwritten message on the wall, which we found to be a lovely touch.  The room itself was very funky, coloured lighting which you can control, floor to ceiling mirrors giving it a futuristic vibe, very spacious and a wonderful view over the bustling London theatres below.  The bed was massive and so comfortable, we both woke up and commented on how well we slept, which is always the key thing for me when I am staying at a hotel, sleep quality here was not an issue.  

Breakfast was brilliant, a menu choice of cooked dishes and continental breakfast with bags of choice, all super tasty.  The team at breakfast were particularly friendly and helpful.

The only downside to the experience was cleanliness, in particular that of the bathroom, the hotel is pricey and in the bracket of luxury, given the rest of the hotel itself and the bedroom I was surprised to see mould/mildew in the shower and an overall grubbiness in the shower cubicle itself.  I would say re-sealing is required and a deep steam clean as I found it slightly unpleasant.  

Overall we enjoyed our stay, the little touches and welcome made it feel special and the sleep quality as I mentioned was amazing, however given the issue with the bathroom, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd stay here again.",4,2020,03,10
148,5 Star Birthday treat,"My wife and I stayed for one night midweek to celebrate my birthday, taking in a show. My decision to choose the hotel was based on its location to the West End (the show was Carmen at the Coliseum) but mainly the positive reviews concerning the hotels recognition and treatment of its MeliaRewards guests, of which I am Gold. (All the other Meliia Hotels I had looked at around Europe did not have much recognition so stay with Hilton and IHG normally as I have their highest status with both and usually well looked after as a result)

Pre-arrival email was promptly replied to and on the day after a short walk from Waterloo station across Waterloo Bridge we arrived at mid-day. As I had mentioned this in my email was told that our room was ready. The room was not the upgraded one I had hoped for as I was unable to check-in via the app or online due to the Melia I.T. playing up. I mentioned the problems checking in online to the lady at check-in and she promptly upgraded us to the next level. Check-in was flawless and we were treated to a glass of Cava whilst doing so. As we had messed up the Aura Team's work preparing our first room with complimentary half bottle of Cava, cheesecake and decorations with handwritten birthday wishes card, we were asked to wait on the rooftop Radio Bar where we received a complimentary glass of Champagne to enjoy whilst taking in the London 360 degree skyline. 20 minutes later got the call from the front desk that the room was ready and returned for the keys.

The room was on the 4th floor looking out onto the Aldwych, and as with the rest of the hotel, I would describe it as contemporary Chic. It was a spacious room with a huge comfy bed, big bathroom, large TV, Nespresso machine (though as previously mentioned in another review, uses third party capsules which are not as good as Nespresso ones), robes and slippers. It had a hair drier though instead of an ironing board and steam iron, had a garment steamer which I found to be useless. I am led to believe though that they are available on request but I didn't have the time to wait. There are plenty of drinking glasses and an ice bucket, though no ice machine requiring a trip to the ground floor bar for ice.

We were both impressed with all aspects of the trip and would recommend it and though a different type of architecture, the service was comparable to London's Conrad, Waldorf or Kimpton and will be returning in the not too distant future.",5,2020,03,09
148,London Gataway,"Hello Lidia,
First of all, I would like to thank you and your entire team, especially Francesca for the very kind attention you had towards my wife.
We have been very sensitive to this and would like to thank you for it.
The welcome on arrival was very warm and very professional.
And again thank you to your staff at the reception who always knew how to be attentive and knew how to advise us on the planning of our stay
Our stay in your hotel was perfect. Our room equipped with all useful, beautiful, functional utensils.
The fairly futuristic decoration is surprising but beautifully integrated.
Bravo and thank you again for having made us have a great time with you

This hotel offers a safe bet for an excellent stay in London",5,2020,03,09
148,"Stunning hotel, wonderful check in experience","This hotel would be on the top of my list for its stunning looks and the attentiveness of  all the staff - truly five star,
The let down is the fact that the whole vibe of the rooftop bar and ground floor restaurant in particular has a very young clubbing and Instagram posing vibe, and I encountered young girls being sick up the walls and some definitely worse for wear sitting  all along the hallway, we had to step over a couple ( while asking if they were ok! ) which is fine if you are aware this is the case but would not recommend this hotel for older people and definitely not families I'm afraid.",4,2020,03,08
148,Magnificent building cleverly converted to 5* hotel.,"What a brilliant conversion from the original Marconi building into a classy 5* hotel. 
From the moment you are greeted at the front door, escorted to reception on the first floor then met by a hostess with ice cold fizz is a memorable experience. Marco, the guest relation executive at the reception desk was extremely polite and helpful. Once checked in we went straight to the Radio rooftop bar/bistro which was buzzing with lunch diners. We sat outside and absorbed the fantastic views. The club sandwich was the best I have ever eaten and the service attentive and professional considering the restaurant was full with queues waiting. 
We enjoyed the facilities of the executive super king size bedroom on the 7th floor which has a magnificent bathroom. Nightly turn down service with bedside chocolates is a nice touch.
Overall, stylish 5 * hotel offering exceptional service located near theatreland.

148,Lovely welcoming hotel ,"We recently stayed for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday. On check in we were advised we had received a room upgrade which was a surprise.    Also on check in we were offered a cold glass of cava which is a lovely touch for guests.

On entering the room it was decorated beautifully with bottle of champagne.      We were there with my daughter and her partner also staying at the hotel.  Whilst there my daughter got engaged which was a complete surprise.   I informed the hotel if there was anything they could do to decorate their room and the duty manager who was on duty on Sunday 1 March contacted me and organised a beautiful breakfast for us in the rooftop restaurant and decorated their room.

The service we received from start to finish was excellent.  This was greatly appreciated by us.   The location of the hotel is very good but the staff are genuinely so helpful.

We will definitely be returning to this hotel again 

Mr & Mrs Wakeling ",5,2020,03,05
148,Bit of a let down,"The hotel is fantastically stylish and the room had great amenities. The STK restaurant was excellent and the steak was the best I‚Äôd had in a long time. Waiting staff were very attentive, friendly and good at their job. 

The only issue we had is that the air con wasn‚Äôt really effective in our room (the temperature set on the air con was never achieved)The temperature was too uncomfortable to have a decent sleep. We called the reception where we were told that he would be fine with the temperature being 22 degrees. They sent out maintenance to take a look but nothing could be done about the temperature. The only solution was to have a really cold shower before bed but it was still too warm for me. 

On check out we received an apology but given that this is a hotel in the high end market I would have expected more from them. Not a financial award but maybe a chance to show that the night receptionist who was utterly unhelpful is not a true representation of their brand.

In short, nice hotel, let down by the receptionist who felt he would be comfortable and therefore I should be. Disappointed. ",3,2020,03,04
148,Another great stay at a great hotel,"Having stopped here many times before The ME has become our go to hotel for visits to London, and they never let us down. Infact each stay seems better than the last .
From the minute you go through the door the service matches the amazing surroundings . We were there this time for my wife‚Äôs birthday and were surprised to receive an upgrade on room on arrival. If that was a pleasant surprise what greated us in the room was nothing short of amazing . A welcome message along with balloons and a bottle of champagne . A really nice gesture that goes a long way. 
We often find ourselves spending time at the hotel due to the sky bar on the 10 th floor and also excellent food choices on offer .
Overall another excellent stay topped off when we realised we had left an item in the room. A quick call to the hotel and it was being posted up to us , no fuss just another example of the excellent personal service.
We would highly recommend this hotel to everyone looking for somewhere to stay in excellent location and who appreciates good quality service in excellent surroundings. Although there was just the two of us this time , we stay there when traveling as a family with equally pleasing results . Another great stay and we will be Definately be back soon.",5,2020,03,02
148,exceptional,"First i would like to thank Antonio, Super helpful and definilty ensured our visit was perfect. 
The design of the hotel is stunning as you would imagine from Norman Foster. The location is perfect for the opera and Covent Garden. The views from the balcony of our room were awesome and the view from the radio bar (breakfast) were even more spectacular. ",5,2020,02,28
148,Anniversary ,"Me and my wife stayed here for our anniversary and was, overall, a bit underwhelmed and disappointed, the staff are great and the reception area looks amazing but it was the room that disappointed me the most, it was clean but small and the so called ‚ÄòThames view‚Äô from the balcony was pretty much non existent, I just felt, after staying in various other 5 star hotels in London on previous anniversaries, that it was over priced for what you got and for that reason, I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again.",3,2020,02,25
148,Weekend stay,"Absolutely amazing hotel, may look pricey but worth every penny when you see the rooms and little things in there. Staff were incredible. I can‚Äôt wait to be back in the summer for another weekend. Brilliant weekend away",5,2020,02,25
148,Good hotel but  with a few downsides,"I had a hard time to decide if I give it 4 or 3 stars. I was close to give it 4 but in the end it can't compete with some other properties I've been to where I would rate with 4 stars. 

So let me start with the positive aspects:
- Everything up to the arrival is great. Booking was convenient and easy. Pre-check-in including an upgrade (used a birthday voucher I got as Melia Gold Member) worked fine and the app is easy to work with.
- Upon arrival I was greeted by the concierge who took my bags, reception is on first floor and there was absolutely no waiting time and very friendly staff.
- In general the staff is very friendly and provides great service.
- The room (Mode room) was big and had plenty of space. The showers are extremely spacious. The windows are nice as well but basically the people from the opposite house can directly look into the room unless you close the blinds.
- The STK Restaurant provides great food and is a great place to go for dinner. (be aware however of the club music)

Now to the points I didn't like:
- The entrance area and Marconi lounge pretty much serves as the Instagram hot spot for young party folks during the weekend. While I am young myself and understand this, it is not something I want to walk through as a hotel guest. 
- The room keys constantly stop working. I think I had to exchange mine roughly 5 times in only 4 days. Other guests seem to have faced similar issues.
- The working table in the room was unfortunately not in a very good state. The aluminium or metal that covers the back area of the table was loose.
- On most tables there either was damage below the glass surface or dirt (couldn't identify if it was one or the other).
- The big showers had a floor made out of strips of metal. Unfortunately this is not very comfortable.
- The corridors were all very dark. While this is a style element it wasn't for my taste.
- The quality of the scrambled eggs for breakfast varied. Sometimes they were good, sometimes they were pretty bad.

Overall I would finish by saying that the hotel is made for a younger audience. While I myself belong to this audience I had to figure out for myself that probably I will have to revert back to some of the more classic hotels in London.

When it comes to the price I would say I paid a fair price. However, I have to mention that I had a 20% discount voucher as part of the Melia Gold Status and also got a free upgrade. If you don't have these two benefits I come to the conclusion that there are better money for value hotels in London.",3,2020,02,25
148,Birthday Weekend,"Just spent the weekend at this wonderful hotel celebrating my birthday.From the moment we arrived everyone went out of their way to make us feel special and make sure we had the best possible time.
Special thanks to Antonio from the team for the warm welcome at making us feel relaxed and welcome from the moment we arrived
Highly recommended",5,2020,02,24
148,A real VIP ME Experience,"We visited ME London for our four‚Äôs night stay in London and our conclusion is easy to describe in just some words: Incredible, Unforgettable, Awesome, Unbelievable, etc... 

Our sense of arrival was a VIP one even having arrived late, a girl at the front desk has attended us very good, being so friendly with us and offering us a glass of champagne and she gave us all information we needed to know about the hotel and the city. Sorry for not remembering her name. Where reception is located, is a real experience with its visual effects. Highly recommended to stay for a few minutes relaxed on the sofa. 

Radio Rooftop Bar: what a great experience having dinner there, good music, good atmosphere and goof food and beer! Spanish tastes on the menu with a high quality on it; about the service was a bit slowly but it was normal due lot of people there at the same time (it seems Radio was the London‚Äôs Epicenter!!!)

Room Experience: the Chic Suite we have enjoyed it was the most experimental room we have never stayed in, good decoration and quality furniture, a confortable and a king size bed was waiting for us. Great double shower for couples and large bathtub with Apivita‚Äôs amenties. We want to remark what the Aura Team has prepared for us: customized welcome with nice and fun messages, a great selection of small cakes to make our stay more sweet and a bottle of champagne. Thanks Sabir, Antonio, Vitto, Lidia and Adriana. 

Breakfast Experience: first day at Radio, the rest of days due a big storm called Ciara was located at STK restaurant. In both places the service was amazing, specially we want to thanks to Yessenia, Rosario and Mercedes who had made us smile since we start our days there. About the offer was a variated one, we have chosen for a continental breakfast, which offered us a great selection of product, many different and with good quality.

Staff: We want to remark that all the staff was amazing with us, since Lifestyle Concierge to the Housekeeping team who also has treated us. 

Finally, we want to say there was a great exhibition which was a fun and a dynamic one. 

We hope to repeat ME London Experience very soon.

148,SUPERB Hotel in the heart of Covent Garden,"The staff were extremely professional and friendly, looking after our every need enthusiastically, My son and I stayed in the Vibe room, which was superb - the most sound proofed room I have ever experienced! The beds were extremely comfortable and the ambient lighting provided different moods for the stay.We were very grateful for the bottled water and mini chocolates provided free of charge as this extra touch made all the difference.The building is EXCEPTIONAL - marble walls and granite floors everywhere. Candles created a relaxed feel in every corridor. This is a top quality hotel well worth five stars. The location was 5 minutes walk to Covent Garden, theatres, the Royal Opera House and more.The only reason why we did not eat in the roof top bar was because my son is 16, not 18 as requested, which is worth knowing. We did however have a quick look at the views up there which are breath taking - especially at night. A VIP hotel that made you feel welcome. Highly recommend!  ",5,2020,02,22
148,Always amazing,"Everyone we encountered at this hotel was incredibly helpful, the men on the door downstairs are wonderful, the receptionists and guest services agents are so sweet, housekeeping do an incredible job.

148,Anniversary trip to Theatre,"Another fantastic visit to Me London, from the glass (or glasses) of fizz on arrival to the lovely message and welcome treat in our room, everything was perfect and absolutely no trouble. 
A stunning cocktail bar on the roof with amazing views of London at night and opposite Somerset House. 
Also only a 10 minute walk across the bridge to Waterloo station. 
This is the perfect hotel for a weekend visit to London, great location, great staff and stunning rooms. We can't recommend this hotel enough.

148,"Strange design, inconvenient lobby","Stayed for only one night on a business trip. Hotel location is pretty good in the heart of Westend. Hotel is very dark, the lobby is one floor up and only to be reached via elevator. This was very inconvenient as one had to wait quite some time for the elevator to arrive on ground floor. Some other guests had apparently waited for almost 10 minutes and were (rightfully) complaining at reception... This is very inconvenient when on a business trip when everything is about efficiency and convenience. I found the lobby decor interesting, front desk service was superb, front desk staff at check in and check out were very professional and friendly. My room was a simple double room, but totally OK; turndown service was very friendly. I did not check out the other facilities of the hotel but heard good things about the rooftop. However, the inconvenience with lobby access alone will prevent me from returning to ME London. ",3,2020,02,18
148,Room Disapointment,"As a member of the Meli√° group rewards scheme and loyal guest I was very disappointed and embarrassed by the room we were allocated. We did not request an accessible room, but got one all the same! I asked at reception to change rooms, but was told I will have to be charged an additional ¬£400 (for one night only) to do so. Apparently they were doing me a favour at that price. Reception staff member very unfriendly!

Used to love this hotel, but realise the standard of service is diminishing sadly. Can only point the finger at the present management.

It was nice to see some friendly and helpful faces at the concierge desk. Obviously trained by the previous management team.

Have stayed here on at least 20 occasions, will I return, not sure that I will...

A very special thank you to Adriana, Lee, Emiliano, Sabir and all the other fantastic team members. 
The pre check in was extremely smooth, the check-in/check-out was just as easy.
The hotel has an amazing vibe and is in a great location. If you want a room with a view of London‚Äôs skyline and perfect service then definitely keep the ME in mind.
We have stayed at the ME Madrid and the property in London is just as efficiently run. Kudos to the GM. Well done to the ME Team and thank you for making our weekend so memorable and making our son‚Äôs stay so magical",5,2020,02,14

148,Great Hotel in Great Location,"The ME London hotel is a fantastic modern hotel.  Excellent service from all the staff I encountered. I was attracted to the hotel by the fact that the description said all rooms had floor to ceiling windows.  The room I was originally allocated did not have this, but I called reception and within half an hour they had moved me to a beautiful room with a floor to ceiling window overlooking the strand.  I stayed two nights which unfortunately coincided with a storm so the Rooftop bar was closed.  The rooms are airy and light and the bathroom is well stocked and luxurious.  I will definitely recommend this hotel.  Thank you for a wonderful trip and I will be back!",5,2020,02,13

I will only continue with the Melia hotels from now on and the ME London will be my go-to.
Thank you very much for this incredible experience!

148,1st class customer service!,"My husband and I stayed here last night for 1 night and wow, what a place! The reason why our stay was so amazing was the people. From walking in the front door we were greeted by the concierge who immediately took our luggage for us and welcomed us to the hotel. 

We then went to check in at the reception with Joaquin who couldn‚Äôt have been more friendly, welcoming and helpful- he knows how to deliver great service! He couldn‚Äôt do enough for us and kindly added some lovely gifts to our room after he picked up on the fact that we were celebrating a birthday and Anniversary- such a lovely surprise and we were really touched. 
Every member of the team said hello and asked us about our day, it just felt like a really personal service. 

The room was amazing, and the food and drinks were superb too. The bed and pillows were so comfortable and the glass of Cava on arrival was a touch of luxury. ME London, you‚Äôve got this spot on.

This is better - everything was just awesome - total quality - better service than the Savoy.

The best bit - the staff !!!!!

We know what that fake service is like in most hotels - everyone is polite but in pain - they do it because the have to. This place - very different ! You can tell the staff actually love the hotel and love their guests. Great staff - smiles and genuine service - nothing is too much trouble. The team that checked me in last night, and checked me out this morning - simply brilliant - couldn't do enough for me and my mate. Can't remember their names - I want to say Jota and Simione - on reception - apologies if I got that wrong !!!

Great job ME Hotel - the Savoy has lost a regular customer and you have gained one (and my USA mate when he is here). Thanks for the caring service and genuine smiles.",5,2020,02,07

Having stayed before, but not recently, Bertran took the time to discuss changes to the staff and the hotel before asking us about our plans for the stay and asking if their is anything more that the hotel can do to make our stay more comfortable? Does the room we booked have a bath? I asked. No, came back the answer to this question, but with in a few moments Bertran had upgraded our room and our wish was granted. I should also add that no sooner than we had unpacked, that complimentary strawberries and champagne arrived to help us relax into the weekend.",5,2020,02,04

148,Absolutely Fabulous,"To celebrate my Daughters 18th Birthday we booked the ME in London. We were greeted warmly and advised that to add to the occasion, our party of five had been upgraded to a suite.
The suite was nothing short of amazing, pristine, beautifully decorated, overlooking The Strand,  for  an extra treat there was a birthday cake and champagne in the room, totally unexpected and a wonderful surprise.  
Despite being in the heart of the best city in the World ( sorry everyone else, but it is!) the room was quiet, our sleep wasn‚Äôt disturbed at all, the beds were super comfy, we all slept like babies and didn‚Äôt want to get up in the morning. Bathrobes, slippers and toiletries were provided which was a lovely touch. We went the whole hog and had room service for breakfast. 
We enjoyed the Rooftop bar, with panoramic views of London, and ate in the restaurant, the food was fabulous as was the service, the only little niggle was that the drinks were a bit  slow in being brought to the table and we had to ask a few times, but that‚Äôs all. 
All in all a wonderful experience, the staff were welcoming, efficient, the hotel was superb and smelt amazing.  Would I go there again?, you betcha I would, in a heartbeat. Go there, you wont be disappointed.

148,ME London,"Amazing hotel! Highly recommend a room with a balcony. Perfect location, cannot get any better with Covent Garden being a stones throw away. Hotel in general is very clean, smells great, staff are helpful and rooms are a good size. STK (from my stay in Nov) is amazing, the food is quite pricy but very good and also the rooftop bar is quite swanky but again had a quality vibe and drinks aren‚Äôt too overpriced. 

ME has become my destination for stays in London now. Top top hotel. ",5,2020,01,14
148,Night away with my daughters,"Amazing hotel. All the staff we met were just lovely, professional, attentive and appeared happy.
The reception area is contemporary and beautifully decorated with perfect lighting.
The room was maybe a little small, but worked well. It had a large mirror over the two basins in the bathroom so the three of us could apply makeup at the same time....handy. And the mood lighting was a nice touch as we could choose the colour of the glow of the room.  Also a choice of playlists to choose from on the tv.
Breakfast was on the roof and was one of the best I‚Äôve had. I opted for the vegan cooked breakfast which arrived nicely presented and very tasty.  The buffet had a delicious choice of yogurts, pastries, cheeses and juices etc    Very well run restaurant with just the right amount of attentiveness.
All in all a lovely contemporary hotel.",5,2020,01,13
148,We will come back!,"I booked this hotel for my daughter's 21st Birthday and it was a surprise for her after a delicate year for the family.
Thank you for making my daughter's birthday so special Andriana from Aura Team!
We will come back",5,2020,01,12
148,Great Acommodation at the ME Hotel London,"We spent a beautifull weekend at the ME Hotel. The Hotel was great, very clean, modern and very confortable rooms. The location of this Hotel is perfect, very close to the main places in the city. The personal was very profesional, friendly and they take very good care of us.

148,Wonderful visit from start to finish!,"Wow! I visited ME with my partner in December. We had the most amazing stay here.

148,Vacations,"Great location, Service and Rooms .
Amazing reception and Concierge.
Good Room Service.
Wonderful Design.
Just in the center of Convent Garden Heart.
just a little note about the bed mattresses and pillows: they are a little hard for my taste.
everything else is great!",4,2020,01,09
148,Highly Recommended,"We had a fantastic 2-night stay here. Very friendly staff, couldn't have picked a better location in London, and the service was exemplary throughout. The rooftop bar is the icing on the cake! We'll definitely be back.",5,2020,01,08
148,Fantastic Hotel ,"We stayed at Me London for a night in the beginning of January. The hotel has a fantastic service, excellent location and beautiful rooms. Me London has an amazing rooftop bar (Radio) which has a perfect view overlooking London!
Would definitely stay again and recommend 100%! ",5,2020,01,08
148,Great Stay,"Very nice hotel, excellent pre-booking and check-in. Concierge very helpful and security for the roof top bar now blend in more to the hotel product. Extremely good value with a lovely room and view. Will return.",5,2020,01,06

The hotel is in a great location with one of the best Roof Top bars in London 

Cant wait to visit again ",5,2020,01,06
148,50th Anniversary And New Years Eve,"We stayed 4 nights at the ME in London and we were very impressed with the hotel and the level of service we received.  We were greeted in our room with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.  Our bed had an inflated Love balloon and rose petals.  Two lovely greetings were written on our mirrors wishing us a special anniversary.  On New Years Eve we received champagne, a balloon and wonderful cookies.
We visited the Radio bar and were given 2 glasses of champagne after we purchased 2 cocktails.
I love the modern decor and the special touches. The room was spacious and the bed extremely comfortable. The location perfect for theaters and transportation.
Every staff member was helpful and genuinely kind.
We will definitely stay again!  Thank you for making our visit so memorable.",5,2020,01,05
148,Ripped off,"Overrated and expensive hotel, rooms are basic and lack character. Bland interiors throughout.  The location is good in the hear of Theatreland but that was it. The rooftop bar is rammed with non-residents so we couldn‚Äôt get a seat.",2,2020,01,04
148,Worst NYE,"¬£730 for one night with super small guest room with no working power socket in the bathroom, dirty carpet, no entry for the rooftop bar(extra ¬£350 per person) and also no breakfast included. Came here for NYE and we knew it‚Äôs gonna be expensive but it was totally not worth it. We live in Covent Garden and came here only for NYE which was totally waste of our money. However the service from all the people was super nice.",1,2020,01,03
148,"Lovely Hotel, Fab Service, Friendly Staff","Stayed here on a points booking, booked an Aura room which had a lovely comfortable big bed. Hotel provided us a cot and turndown service including lovely free bottle of red wine and chocolate strawberries. I am a gold member and had a lovely a la carte breakfast in the rooftop bar. We had drinks in the afternoon before (no children after 5pm)
Would highly recommend the hotel for its friendly staff and service, and free cava on check in!",5,2020,01,02
148,A big loss of money,Stayed for new years and the overpriced room did not offer the service I was expected. For ¬£2000 for 2 nights without breakfast (if I wanted i should have paid more). I paid extra and it was Horrible. never saw anything like that in any 5stars i have been. disgusting.,1,2020,01,02
148,Great hotel but breakfast needs serious improvements!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights on a bed & breakfast package. The hotel is stunningly modern and location is perfect for reaching all the popular areas by foot. The staff were so friendly and could not have been more helpful. Our only gripe was the breakfast served in the restaurant on the ground floor, which was in included in our package. For a 5 star hotel, I‚Äôm sorry to say the buffet spread was nowhere even close to breakfast buffets of this hotel class I have ever experienced. It was very basic and the quality of food was very below average. I asked a waiter if they could make me some poached eggs as all that was on the buffet was undercooked scrambled eggs. They were more than happy to prepare the eggs for me but I waited over 30 minutes for them to arrive and one of them was over cooked! Had the restaurant been busy I would have understood but there were only 2 other tables eating! If improvements were made to the breakfast buffet, this hotel would be our favorite in London, but until then I‚Äôm afraid we won‚Äôt be returning.",3,2019,12,31
148,One of ther best hotels we have stayed in,"We can't say enough good things about this hotel - classy, sophisticated, trendy...it has everything Well located just a a few minutes walk from Covent Garden. We are world travelers and generally stay in hotels that claim they are 5 star hotels - this one truly is. Highly recommended in absolutely all aspects - and make sure you have a drink and appetizers at the bar on the top floor - a great view of the city        .  ",5,2019,12,30
148,Awful breakfast and uncomfortable beds,"We were really looking forward to our stay just before Christmas, on arrival were impressed with the glass of bubbly but then it all went down hill, they didnt have our booking and said we should have been there the day before and had been put down as a no show, however when we showed them our confirmation realised it was their mistake and took a while and communication between staff to be able to confirm our room.  The room was nice, the bathroom one of the best in any hotel I have ever stayed in.  However the put up bed for my son was rock hard and had a really thick duvet.  The hotel was quiet and the location was impressive we looked forward to breakfast to make up for the other things.  We shouldn't have bothered, raw sausage, egg and a toaster that didnt work.  Took an age to get tea & coffee, we ordered bacon and eggs freshly cooked and it would have been quicker to do it ourselves.  Staff were not helpful and you get a much better breakfast at a premier inn.  When we complained on check out the staff didnt appear bothered or to listen.  Wouldn't stay again or recommend to anyone, what a shame!",2,2019,12,30
148,Christmas Day Stay - With Dogs!,"Due to a change in plans, we had to take our dogs with us to London for a Christmas day stay. After a quick search we came across ME London who said that all rooms were dog friendly! The team bent over backwards to accommodate us providing dog beds, bowls and toys along with the doggie room service menu. 

Will definitely be back soon!",5,2019,12,30
148,Nearly Perfect!,"We were a group of 20 staying for one night , the hotel location was perfect as it was a short walk to the theatre where we watched the Tina Turner musical.

The hotel rates as one of the nicest i have stayed in. Check inn was flawless, everyone was handed a glass of bubbly upon arrival whilst they checked us all in.

The rooms are of the highest standard , turn down service was a nice touch as mood lighting is set and the bed and bathroom were freshened up  .

You must book a table on  the roof terrace bar,albeit the drinks are very expensive the service was superb.

As for my rating 4 out of five stars there was one major issue. Our breakfast experience was a disaster. The Zela restaurant is a complete no go for me should we return.
The service was terrible, we had guests waiting an extremely long time for tea and coffee. The hot food selection was non existent with no bacon no eggs and what can only described as under cooked potatoes.
The fresh fruit selection was laughable , the fruit had started to turn.
No offer of a top up on the tea and coffee with no clean glasses should you want a glass of orange juice or water.

This was reported to the hotel manager and apology was offered !!!!",4,2019,12,30
148,Love this hotel,5th time returning before Christmas and as always made to feel really welcome by the staff. This year they recognised it was our daughters 5th birthday and we walked into balloons and a little cake - very lovely. See you again next year!,5,2019,12,29
148,Great Experience,"Staff were 10/10, they were super friendly and kind and were always available to help if needed. Room was amazing as well with a great view of London! Great location as welI! would recommend everyone to stay as I felt very confortable üòä",5,2019,12,29
148,Fantastic hotel with lovely staff,"Firstly, great location. The hotel kindly offered us an upgrade to the standard room we had paid for. The staff on the door and concierge were so friendly, kind, warm and hospitable. However, the staff members in the bar were not so welcoming although the bar itself was beautiful with great views. 

Final thought: great value for money, would 200% stay again and recommend!",5,2019,12,29
148,Birthday,It was fab. Wonderful staff very attentive. Amazing and extremely clean room. Great room service. Perfect location 2 min walk from Covent gardens and lots of shops on the door step. Wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else.,5,2019,12,28
148,Xmas break,"We decided to spend xmas in London thoroughly enjoyed it. This Hotel is like no other and we will definitely be going back. The decor is out of this world. The lobby is so spectacular that the photos don't do it justice. The rooftop Bar is amazing and the food second to none. We initially had a room with a ""noise"" and after a few negotiations had to upgrade to the suite which was great with some free Tattinger thrown in by Sabir. The bed is one of the most comfortable we have slept in. Thanks for a great xmas we will be back soon",5,2019,12,28
148,Covent Garden gem,"We stayed 5 days in this stunning modern building with a spectacular reception area. Our ‚ÄúMode room ‚Äúwas spacious with one of the most comfortable bed we have slept in. Large bathroom with double rain shower heads.This is a perfect location for theatre goers with a myriad of restaurants nearby. A Tesco and pret a manger across the street.For shoppers,Selfridge‚Äôs is a 30 minute walk and Harrods around 45 minutes. Because of the location to theatres and great service all around, we highly recommend this hotel and will be back next year.",5,2019,12,28
148,Christmas In London,"The hotel is gracious and grand, the styling is modern, sleek and clean.

It can't be compared to your traditional hotels as it is truly a one of a kind property and experience. The staff are all eager to ensure a fab stay and go above and beyond to make it happen.

Thank you for an amazing Christmas.

148,Missing items ,"Unfortunately, despite being fascinated by the interior design of the hotel. I was extremely shocked cause my expensive earrings went missing from my suit bag, inside the cabinet on my second night (22 Dce 2019). When I reported that to the security department of the hotel same night and to the hotel manager next morning, I‚Äôve been promised by Both to keep updated about the investigation but no further response at all.. I really expected better action from such a luxurious 5- star hotel!! I didn‚Äôt feel safe or comfortable anymore in the hotel, so I decided to check out and they refund the rest of my stay..

148,"Poor Service, Overpriced, and Pretentious","Beautiful people are ubiquitous at this hotel. A mistake was made at check in, our complimentary champagne was not known of at the bar, breakfast was ho hum, and rooftop bar and steak house were overpriced and noisy. ",1,2019,12,25
148,Expensive but worth it,Top quality hotel with top quality service and excellent modern rooms. Many more traditional hotels do not have rooms that get close. Staff attitude really good now and vastly improved on previous visits ,4,2019,12,23
148,Great night in London ,"Second stay at the ME in London 
Staff are friendly and helpful you can always drop your bags there while you are out all day.

148,Fantastic ME security team,"I visited radio bar in ME London with my friends, unfortunately I lost my phone in the hotel.i called the hotel and I was transferred to the security department, the person I spoke to was very professional,  he made me describe the phone and the exact place I was in the hotel. He then confirmed to me they found my phone  wow I was very excited, I was given a code to use to collect the phone.
When I went to the hotel that same day and 1 officer by name Shadrack brought the phone to the lobby which he took to his time to wait and made sure I was able to unlock the phone before he gave me a form to sign. To my surprise,  my phone was in a seal bag when he brought it, it means my DATA was protected. Once again thank you, hope to visit again this festive period.",5,2019,12,20
148,Beautiful stay,"We really enjoyed our stay at the ME hotel! The location is amazing, so close to shops and theatres! The only downside was the limited breakfast options for vegetarians, there were a lot of sweet things like fruit and pastries but not a lot of savoury! Some tomatoes and avocado would have been lovely. ",4,2019,12,19
148,Couples  break,"Top hotel and location would stay here again next time we visit , rooftop bar was class with amazing views and good ambiance   Looked after and really enjoyed the chic suite and the whole vibe of the room",5,2019,12,18
148,Amazing hotel,"Friendly accommodating staff which were very helpful, the hotel was beautifully modern, and the rooms echoed the modern luxurious feel. The roof top terrace bar offered tasty food and a variety of drinks in a pleasant relaxed atmosphere in the day turning into a more social lively bar of an evening. 

The room offered everything and more one would need, with ample toiletries and facilities for all. The room itself was spacious and comfortable and the arrival treat was a lovely touch!

Will be staying again for sure. ",5,2019,12,17
148,FABULOUS WEEKND IN LONDON,"We had an excellent weekend! London is a beautiful city by itself, but to enjoy this city staying at ME London it was really perfect! The hotel is very cool in every parts and we enjoy also a special dinner at their Japanese restaurant ZELA.",5,2019,12,12
148,Excellent,Wonderful place in a wonderful City. Kindness  and courtesy from all staff. We will certainly return soon as possible in this hotel. Perfect location near Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. Thanks for the hospitality,5,2019,12,10
148,Luxury hotel,"We had a wonderful stay here for our honeymoon. We arrived with the mirrors decorated with love quotes and fresh rose metals decorating our bed. We were also met with chocolate-covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne to celebrate out first night. The staff came back daily with complimentary waters for us. The location is within walking distance to a few tube stations and of course a close walk to Covent Garden. The only misstep we experienced was that our room keycard was accidentally deactivated one day early, which the front desk promptly fixed. A few nice amenities the room has was an umbrella for those rainy days so you don't need to bring one on your own.",5,2019,12,09
148,"nice hotel, but room for improvement","Room was surprisingly nice - I enjoyed the comfy bed and quiet AC. The phone was broken the entire stay so I couldn't call in-room service or reception. Checking in took forever and I was charged a wrong rate. Checking out took forever again. I was given incorrect information regarding the benefits of my Gold Melia status, so couldn't really take advantage of them. I was also given incorrect information regarding breakfast by Sigrid when checking in and as a result missed it.

There also seems to be a bit of a language barrier, as Melia is a Spanish hotel chain - not to mention the website of which half is broken and the other half is broken English so I had not idea what the cancellation policy for my room was as the relevant wording seems to have been translated using Google Translate.",3,2019,12,07
148,Stylish hotel,"Perfectly located in central London. 5 mins from convent garden tube, walking distance from all attractions.
Swift check in from friendly staff, that are stylishly uniformed without being pretentious.
The rooms were clean spacious and on trend. Odd window / blind set up that may make some a little claustrophobic. My room was upgraded on arrival.

148,Beware Hotel Employees Stole Items,"We suffered a grand theft at the hotel as a result of hotel employees going through our concealed items and stealing valuables and cash. Mid level management immediately believed they had identified the thief and pledged to work with police to bring the thieft to justice. Unfortunately, top management intervened and blatantly interfered with the police inspection. Top management quickly concluded that theft could not be solved and then tried to place suspicion on us, the victims, saying that we may have fabricated the story. Worst hotel experience we have ever had. Stay away or risk being victim of another robbery that will be covered up by the hotel.",1,2019,11,26
148,Amazing stay at the ME,"Amazing Stay, Planned a Birthday celebration for my Girlfriend's Birthday, The aura team facilitated all my needs and decorated the room to give it a special touch for my Girlfriend.

Breakfast was delicious and again we were offered the same table as the night before which we liked so much.  A true 5 star experience would recommend highly and would most definitely return.",5,2019,11,17
148,Great find in the heart of London,"London is famous for old buildings, small rooms, antiquated heating systems...but not this hotel.

148,Fantastic stay,"Stayed two nights with my daughter for a catch up as she works in London. Chic suite had plenty of space for us to relax and catch up with each other, huge thanks for the champagne and Halloween treats in our room on arrival. We enjoyed drinks at the roof top bar and delicious breakfast. Staff are an absolute credit to the Melia brand. I messaged to say thanks and got a lovely response from the GM. Will definitely return in the future. ",5,2019,11,15
148,Can this place get any better....?,"I stayed at the ME hotel again as the last time I stayed it was a fantastic faultless experience.
This time was just as fantastic, if not better! 
The kind, attentive staff, the amazing funky rooms, the 'rocking' radio bar, fantastic food at STK, this hotel has everything & to have such a personal touch gives it something not many London hotels have.
Looking forward to visiting the ME asap.",5,2019,11,15
148,all good except credit card issues,"Stayed two nights as a treat for my daughters 21st, perfect location, lovely room, staff made a big effort with decorating the room for her birthday, hotel defintely has the 'wow' factor. However the poor rating is due to what happened when I paid. I booked and paid many months before on my credit card. Arrived with evidence of full payment. However I no longer had the card which I paid with , as it was cancelled due to suspected fraud, so couldn't show them the original card as it had been cut up. They insisted I paid again with my new credit card (same but new number) and I would be refunded on checkout. Of course there was an issue, which I kept saying would happen, as they refunded the stay to the cut up card!!! an hour on the phone and lots of stress later the refunded money has just been found, as I specifically asked them at reception to not refund it to my cancelled card!, and was reassured all the time (they knew I was unhappy to have to even pay again as I had already paid) that that wouldn't happen. So disapointed about this bit only. Breakfast was also a tad disapointing, I had to ask twice for a glass for my bottle of water, and my eggs were cold, as it was my daughter's birthday on that morning I didn't say anything as didn't feel it was appropriate on that morning. Lovely view from the roof top. Not sure if I would stay again to be honest, other issue was the key cards, only one worked, got it sorted once then again it didn't work so we just managed with one and gave up. Daughter loved it though which was the whole purpose",2,2019,11,14
148,30th Birthday,"I can not recommend me hotel enough! I had booked this for my partners 30th birthday. Upon arrival (in the most beautiful reception room) we were offered a drink. We were then given a complimentary upgrade to one of the 9th floor rooms. To make this even more special Adrianna had provided 30th balloons, champagne, cake and a personalised message. This had really made the experience extra special and my boyfriend couldn‚Äôt believe how lucky we had been! We also went to the Radio rooftop bar where we were treated like VIPs again. This whole trip has been amazing and I would come here again.",5,2019,11,14
148,Weekend away,"Great location for theaters and restaurants and bars.  Great atmosphere in the RADIO TOP restaurant/bar.  Very attentive staff.  Nice cocktails and service.  
However there is no breakfast buffet, it is a la carte",5,2019,11,13
148,Great Hotel with great service in a great location,"LOVED the hotel...it was modern, chic, and we had very good service.  The bed was so comfy and the little details made all the difference, like noticing we drank two coffees each morning (great machine in the room) and providing extra coffee with the room cleaning.  Attention to detail was spot on.  Would definitely return",5,2019,11,13
148,One of my favourite hotels,Amazing hotel which is located in a great area in london where you have everything on your door step. The rooms and atmosphere are fantastic and as always the staff cannot do enough for you. As always a brilliant stay and looking forward to my next stay.,5,2019,11,13

The rooms were very nice. I had a wonderful view of London. The beds were very comfortable, and the shower was great with nice amenities. I would definitely stay here again. The hotel had a wonderful location also. It was a perfect stay that I would love to repeat again!",5,2019,11,11

148,Amazing hotel and service,"Visited for one night this week with my wife so here‚Äôs another honest detailed review.

Staff- superb staff, lovely welcome, concierge could do enough for us. We were welcomed with two free glasses of champagne each! I couldn‚Äôt believe it! Everyone was so polite, friendly and helpful. Amazing staff a credit to the company!

Room- we chose a aura room on the front of the building fourth floor. It as immaculate. Good size, great bed, beautiful bathroom, every amenity you would expect. Faultless and spotless clean.

Radio rooftop bar- we have been to this bar in the past and it was jus as good as we remembered. We had a drink there before going out for our meal. Again superb service, lovely atmosphere. 

In summary, can‚Äôt recommend this hotel highly enough. The location is great too. We will defiantly be back when we next in London.",5,2019,11,09

148,Excellent stay and service!,"We spend a lovely weekend at Me London! Very spacious rooms and the interior is fabulous. We have been to London a few times and we love to explore new restaurants and experiences. The last day at Me London we asked Emiliano whom is the head concierge of the hotel for a recommendation near to the hotel. He recommended us to go to Maison de the Mariage Freres, which is famous for their tea! What you can‚Äôt tell from the outside though is that upstairs there is a tea room where you enjoy your cup of tea together with some pastries that have been infused with their own tea! 
All and all the location, rooms, design and service are excellent and I would recommend this hotel to all my friends!",5,2019,11,05
148,Our ME experience,Our first stay at a ME hotel. The overall experience was lovely and fun. The first class service and excellent staff made our stay fun and pleasurable.  The hotel location was perfect very centrally located to many activities. ,5,2019,11,04
148,Fantastic!,"Our stay here was perfect. Beautiful suite! I loved the bathroom complete with makeup area for the girls!
Beautiful mood lighting too. We had a great night at the Radio Rooftop and a delicious breakfast in the morning with great views. The whole hotel is stunning, amazing foyer.
Every member of staff we encountered were very helpful. Highly recommend.",5,2019,11,03
148,Best service ever!,"I stayed at the Me Hotel with my daughter and apart from the central position and lovely room I really managed to enjoy and discover things in London thanks to the fantastic Head of Concierge Emiliano. He was so caring during our stay, suggesting us some really interesting experiences and places to see that we would never have found m=by ourselves. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels but I have rarely found such a genuinely caring concierge. Thanks so much Emiliano I will definkitely be back next time I am in London!",5,2019,11,02
148,Glamorous,"For my Birthday I decided to spoil myself and book a more high-end Hotel. This was definitively not a disappointment. Entering the main entrance there was someone right there to show me the way as the Reception is on the first floor. The reception is quite a grand statement with a roof window and digital art installation on the walls. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I upgraded to a river view room which was definitively worth it as it had a balcony from which I could enjoy the view. The only downside was that I could hear the chairs being moved around at 2AM on the roof top bar which is right above the room, but I do have a very light sleep so someone else might not hear it. Room was lovely and clean and I loved the mood light changing option.",5,2019,10,31
148,Lovely stay and amazing staff !,"It was our first time at Me Hotel London. On our arrival Emiliano Del Pizzo took care of us, and made us feel home, he is been an amazing host to us - the room was beautiful and clean / STK is amazing for dinner and don‚Äôt miss the famous Radio Rooftop bar for a drink at night. We will be back soon!",5,2019,10,30
148,Most Unique and Excellent Experience,"Best exceptional and memorable experience ever!

We stayed at ME London previous weekend and we were hosted by Head of Concierge Emiliano. I would like  to start with that the we had the best experience from the moment we entered the hotel until we (unfortunately) had to go back home. 

When checking in, we received a glass of champagne plus an upgrade! We were already mesmerised of the beautiful interior design and architecture of the hotel and when we heard about the upgrade, we were already feeling very spoiled!

We entered the room and saw a beautiful bottle of Brut on the table with some delicious bites. The room itself was also beautifully designed and we felt already at home. You can also tell that attention was paid to all the details and that the stuff made sure we have everything we need (small steamer, toolkit, and more). I also ordered some pizza and that was delivered with some adorable and high quality miniature bottles of olive oil and sauces.

The next day we received some great recommendations from Emiliano on what we could do in London and we were all sorted! The next day we finished our stay by having a brunch on the rooftop (highly recommended). The brunch was delicious and the venue was amazing. We had a great view and we were lucky with the weather! 

Finally, I would like to note that I have travelled a lot for work and leisure and I can say that ME London offers by far the best service and best stay you can dream of! 

Emiliano, thank you for your amazing service. We had an amazing stay and wished we could have stayed longer. 

Excited to come back to ME London in the future.

KR,

148,A gem in London,"The hotel is unique in its architecture and design, you won`t find any other place similar to this!
More important, this is a true sample of excellent hospitality: you are indeed at the center of all the attentions.
My friend and I have been welcomed by the lovely Vittoria that showed as to the Radio Rooftop bar. In the meantime she told us the story of the building and reveled details that surprised us!
Once we entered the Radio bar we had immediately the feeling we would have spent one of our best night there.
We had a table in the warm terrace, facing all the main attractions of London. I would say the best view ever! It was dark but London was shining, I cannot imagine how it is during the sunset!
We tasted different signatures cocktails and shared delicious tapas, strongly suggested the Gins as well!
Last but not least, a massive thank you to Angelo and Lorena for taking care of us all the time!",5,2019,10,29
148,Alluring Luxury Hotel in the West Side,"I just returned from a weekend stay at this vibrant hotel.  The service level is impeccable.  You will feel like royalty from the moment the door man greets you until the moment you check-out.  The rooms are very attractive with all controls at your fingertips with just a touch of a button.  You can even change the color of the lighting in your room.

All necessities are at your disposal and the shower is one that you will never want to get out of.  I was able to see Mama Mia from my window as it was overlooking the Strand.  The ME London is in walking distance to many area attractions, such as the Covent Gardens and St. Paul's Cathedral.

I had the pleasure of eating at The Zela, STK and the Radio Rooftop.  They are all different and very eclectic but their commonality is the amazing gastronomic experiences!  

I highly recommend this hotel and hope to return soon!",5,2019,10,29
148,Best honeymoon ever,"The team were very welcoming our room was amazing the team did a very nice job preparing nice quotes and red roses all over the room (we were indulged) i kept the little card they left in the room as a memory for our anniversary at the same hotel :)

148,Best hotel experience in London,"Together with my sister we spent a lovely weekend at Me London. The rooms are beautiful and the architecture of the hotel is very trendy. The location of the hotel is very central and just a 2 minute walk from Covent garden where are a lot op shops, restaurants and bars are located. 

The service at this hotel is hard to find in London!  Everyone is very profesional and kind. We went to the concierge desk and Emiliano gave us some great tips where to go, from the Tate museum to see the exhibition of Olafur Eliasson to have dinner at Roka. The exhibition was great and I loved you could interact with the art and the food at Roka was splendid.
Thank you some much Emiliano for your hospitality, you really made last weekend unforgetabble! 

On Sunday we had brunch at the rooftop bar, and the view is just amazing! We would recommend the hotel to everyone and next time we are in London we would definitely book at the Me London again!",5,2019,10,29
148,Great weekend!! ,"Spent a lovely business weekend at Me London. Very nice atmosphere and lovely staff, in particular Lidia which greeted me in the most welcomed way! She was amazing!

148,Loved every single bit!,"Me Hotel is a great place to be. Whether you are there on leisure or business, the location is simply amazing. Just off Covent Garden with lots of shopping, restaurants, bars and activities. The staff was incredible, especially the Concierge team and above all Emiliano, whose professionalism and friendly attitude made us feel always looked after by a close friend. We had dinner both at Zela and STK and could not pick our favourite, they are both incredible for food quality and trendy atmosphere. Do not miss their incredible roof top, with 360 degrees views of London!",5,2019,10,28
148,One of my best experience ever!,"From the moment you step out of the taxi, the service is impressive. From the doorman to the housekeepers, the service provided by each member of the staff is exactly how we were expecting: friendly, polite and, most important, genuine.

We stayed for one night only to treat ourselves but everything was simply perfect! Emiliano, the Head concierge, has been fantastic: he helped us to book a very famous restaurant at the last minute, and guess what? He made it. And, he managed to reserve a table by the window, which is extremely difficult to find. Thank you Emiliano, that couldn‚Äôt happen without you!

Radio rooftop: WOW! We decided to go for breakfast there the morning after, and we loved it: the staff is extremely attentive, the food is exceptional and the view is breathless.

My last words are spent for the hotel: outside, very ‚Äòsimple‚Äô building in the Heart of London but very ‚Äòmodern‚Äô inside: black marble everywhere, simply stunning in every single corner.

I would like to say thank you to everyone for what they did for us, has been one of the best hotel I have ever been and definitely, we will back soon again...

Thank you ME London for the amazing experience!!

148,What an AMAZING birthday surprise!,"Everything about this hotel is as good as the reviews report. I love this Hotel with its boutique style and variety of bars and lounges along with it's great atmosphere. I booked this hotel for my girlfriends 28th birthday but what had surprised me was before i arrived i received an email from the hotels manager (Sabir Taheri) asking about my occasion. At first it was strange but i completely understood why when i arrived to the room. There was a special and unique message for my girlfriend on the mirror in the room which was nice. I had also asked Mr Taheri to place a cake in the room but he did one better, there were chocolate strawberry's with rose petals on the bed. He also reserved a table in the Radio rooftop bar which i have to say was also amazing - food and service were all excellent and I would highly recommend. I didn't expect him to exceed my expectations but he made me feel wowed! Mr Taheri and the team looked after us extremely well and it was a great success. The staff are the gem that make it a great place. Loved it, would definitely stay at the ME London again and again. Thank you for the moment Mr Taheri.",5,2019,10,27

A very modern hotel filled with creative art work and fine furnishings, the room was modern,with a large bathroom and the best shower I have ever experienced! The bed is super comfy with nice linens. There were lots of treats waiting - chocolate dipped strawberries and rose petals on the bed, such a lovely touch to celebrate our anniversary 
We dined in Zela the Japanese fusion restaurant and had the tasting menu- it really was incredible, our waiter Marhi was so knowledgeable and helpful and made the evening for us . The food was sensational,every dish a taste experience so fresh and beautifully presented. The drink menu is comprehensive and my Mojito was delicious 
The Radio bar on the  roof is worth a visit serving every kind of drink and fab views.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for all !",5,2019,10,27
148,Amazing 5 star hotel located on the Strand,"I've stayed three times in this incredible hotel in 2019 and I will definitely be going back in the future as I can't get enough of it.
The lobby is spectacular and the views from the rooftop bar are breathtaking. The hotel staff is incredibly accommodating and will do their utmost best to satisfy all of your demands.
I opted 3 times for a so called ""Vibe"" room because of its huge bed, bathroom and seating area.
The bed itself is really comfy as are the bed linnen. 
The bathroom has an incredible walk-in rainshower and features a big sink too. The Vibe room also features a high-tech light-/mood- and sound system, a fully stocked minibar and a Nespresso coffee maker. Free bottles of water and a turndown service in the evening are more of the perks the hotel offers to their clients.

148,Definitely for ME!,Just finished a weekend break and had a fabulous time. The hotel is amazing and in a great location and a short walk to all the theatres and wonderful sights of London. We had a room on a high floor so lovely views from the room and there was a message written on the wall for us. All the staff were friendly and the manager Paul was very helpful when we needed assistance.

148,Delightfully impressed!,"What a wonderful stay at the ME London. I knew it was going to be gorgeous, but was not expecting how beautiful it is and how well I was looked after! Everyone I met greeted me with a smile. In a world where you can do everything online, this experience just proves the little touches and customer services goes a long way. We had the opportunity to be walked over by Sabir who took the time to show us how everything worked and nothing we asked was ever too much and himself and his team always asked us about our day. This was a wonderful visit where we had a great time. Fantastic rooms with brilliant views and a super impressive reception and rooftop bar!",5,2019,10,27
148,Romantic weekend at ME London,"My partner and I visited ME London few weeks ago for our romantic weekend. Prior to arrival, Victoria from the Aura Team send me an email in order to assist us with anything we may need, restaurant/theater included. As we had few restaurants in mind, the Concierge Team kindly assisted us with everything. Also, upon arrival the Aura Team arranged nice strawberries and champagne and a lovely touch as I mentioned Victoria that our trip was to celebrate our anniversary. The breakfast at Radio is delicious, not to mention the view which is stunning and the staff is really friendly. Can‚Äôt wait to come back! Thanks a million once again to the Aura Team and the Concierge for making our weekend unforgettable!",5,2019,10,27

148,Best hotel and bar in London,"We have visited from Singapore where we have some of the best hotels in the world. My wife and I managed on a few nights to check out the bar which had some great cocktails. Downstairs the hotel was modern, clean and exciting. Highly styled with great features and great staff too. I don't normally write reviews but thank you so much to Sabir and to all of the team.

I and my friends booked a table at the Radio Rooftop Bar with Vittoria, who at our arrival greeted us warmly and let us feel welcomed.

148,"Excellent, modern hotel with fantastic staff","I recently had to visit London on business and chose this hotel as it was near to where my meetings were being held. I came with my wife as neither of us have been to the UK before and figured it would be a good excuse for a short vacation as well as handling business.

The hotel seems to be in the middle of London. The cab from Heathrow airport took some time and was not cheap but this seemed to be the result of very heavy traffic. I am told that the London subway network is an easy journey from the airport but I have a bad knee so opted to use cabs.

There are some great local restaurants nearby, especially in the Covent Garden area. Of note, I chose to experience Afternoon Tea at Whittard which was very relaxing and I imagine would be described by residents as 'delightful'.

Unfortunately I was not able to visit the Royal Opera House but I did pass it many times and this hotel is situated well for visits.

The hotel is very modern, too much so for my own preference. The rooms are clean, if small, and the beds are perfectly comfortable. These are problems that most wouldn't notice though. The quality of the staff is exceptional though. It is indeed the quality of the staff that made me leave this review as I understand how important they are from running my own small business.

Every question I had was quickly answered, the room service was provided exceptionally fast. One member of staff, Sabir Tahir, was very helpful when I needed advice on where to go for everyday items, particularly for pain relief as my knee gave me a lot of trouble on this trip and a replacement head for my electric toothbrush which somehow was broken in my luggage. 

I want to also thank the staff for one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. Absolutely delicious.",5,2019,10,25
148,Top Notch Hotel,Booked to stay here to have a mini break and catch a show in the west end. Turned out to be so handy for everything and was so nice it was difficult to drag yourself away from the hotel. A La Carte breakfast at Radio Rooftop is fantastic and is a must while staying so ensure you book this. The staff were brilliant and couldn't do enough for you. Special mention must go to Emmeric Hurault who is the restaurant manager at Me London. Nice chats with him each morning over breakfast.,5,2019,10,25
148,Great Hotel,"I would definitely recommend this hotel. The location is great, perfectly placed for Covent Garden and the theatres. The staff  were all excellent and provided an attentive friendly service. The rooms and overall hotel design is really cool. ",5,2019,10,25
148,Great time in London!,Stayed at the ME London in beginning of October and it was a great experience. All staff was most accommodating especially Ben from Concierge. He went the extra mile to get us tickets for Tina show in London. It made our night! Thank you. ,5,2019,10,25
148,ME revisited,"The location is excellent although perhaps too convenient for non hotel guests to take over the bars 
etc on weekends. Rooms now getting a bit tired and lacking facilities I.e. No complimentary water, 
having to pay ¬£4.50 for a small bottle costing 0.85 outside, whilst paying over ¬£ 350.00 per night !",3,2019,10,24
148,Magical ME,"Every so often you find a gem. A place that‚Äôs modern without being pretentious, fun without being frivolous and classy without being to... I‚Äôm going to say it... up themselves. 

The ME Hotel in London ticks all those boxes and then some. 

Let‚Äôs go on the journey. A lovely welcome, really great guys on the front door. Then a walk past some excellent art and up to the first floor reception. Then stop. 

Wow wow wow. The reception is incredible. It‚Äôs like Blade-runner meets the Queen of the Nile. A futuristic, mesmerising atrium stretching the full height of the hotel. 

Check-in was wonderful with a complementary glass of delicious cava as we completed the details. 

Our room was very nice with customised messages from the Aura Team written on the black glass walls. 

All the room products were lovely and room itself spotless. 

Breakfast at the Radio Rooftop was good although the Mediterranean breakfast choice was a little disappointing, everything else was delicious. The views are amazing and we are looking forward to dinner the next time we stay. 

Most importantly the staff are fantastic. Energetic, kind and always one step ahead of a request. Just what you need to ensure you can enjoy your stay. ",5,2019,10,23
148,Amazing stay at ME London!,"I have recently stayed with my boyfriend at the hotel, for our 4th anniversary.
Upon check in I was warmly greeted by Marco, who kindly offered us a glass of Cava and promptly sent us up to what revealed to be one of the most spacious and well kept rooms I have ever been in!
The bathroom was spectacular, bedroom so comfy and, as we had the balcony, we could enjoy a romantic view of London.
Marco gave us all the useful informatio regarding breakfast (which by the way was delicious!) and opening times of Radio Bar, the rooftop.
We went there the first night and we had a few drinks. The ambiance was very chic, staff very friendly, and we enjoyed the food too.
Upon check out Andrea asked us how our stay had been, he was genuinly interested to know if everything went well and if we wished to come back one day.
He then recommended us a few places where to eat nearby and he nailed it!
To pleasently end our stay we had a steak in a restaurant closeby.

We will definitely come back!",5,2019,10,23
148,Mr Jon Wright,"We visited the ME London for the 5th time this weekend for 2 nights, it was my girlfriends birthday and I‚Äôd also booked a room for some friends as a surprise for her..  We were really spoilt as soon as we arrived, champagne, rose petals and a cake in the room and a lovely card and message from the Aura team, by far the best, most attentive hotel and staff I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of staying with. Even put a bottle of bubbly in our friends room. 
Anybody looking for a great hotel in the heart of the west end then look no further..
Special thanks to Marco who arranged everything for us..
We look forward to our next visit..

148,Let down by the service,"This is a very stylish hotel with a very exclusive feel. Unfortunately, it was a little too exclusive for us and we struggled to gain entry to the rooftop bar even though we were staying at the hotel. After various back and forth and proving we were guests, we were finally granted access. The interior is lovely and the rooftop bar has excellent views, but it's not somewhere I would choose to stay again.",3,2019,10,23
148,You don‚Äôt want to miss it out!,"Been to Me London twice, first time for drinks with friends on the impressive terrace, followed by a short stay a few weeks after. 
Loved each moment spent at Me, great customer service on each department, great atmosphere and vibe.  
Will definitely return!",5,2019,10,23
148,Amazing hotel and staff!,"The ME hotel is outstanding - I've stayed at a lot of hotels but I would go as far to say this experience was one of the best. All the staff are very attentive and the d√©cor is amazing - it just oozes sophistication.
I mentioned it was our 10th anniversary when making the booking online and during check-in the receptionist advised we had a complimentary room upgrade.
We were shown to our room by Vittoria who congratulated us on our anniversary, she‚Äôd left a lovely message in the room with a thoughtful quote, there were rose petals on the bed and some champagne waiting in an ice bucket!
We cannot thank you enough, you really made our trip away celebrating our anniversary without the children (which doesn‚Äôt happen very often!) very special. Thank you so much and I will be staying again at the earliest opportunity!
I also look forward to trying your STK restaurant soon - I didn't realise that was part of the ME hotel before our stay.
Thanks again to Vittoria and the team! x",5,2019,10,23
148,Birthday weekend,My wife and I stayed here for a weekend break and it was wonderful. The staff were super friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much to ask. The hotel has an amazing design with reception on the 1st floor and Radio Rooftop has the best views. We will be back.,5,2019,10,23
148,Fantastic!,"Had a fabulous stay here in September. My husband had booked it as a special birthday treat. We were welcomed with a glass of fizz during check in and the staff on reception were lovely. The room was great and I would recommend the roof top bar. There were Birthday balloons in our room and it was a lovely surprise when they brought a birthday cake with candle and a bottle of champagne to our room!! It's rare to get such attentive staff, everyone was just so friendly and helpful. Would love to go back even when it's not my birthday!",5,2019,10,22
148,An Absolute Delight!,"After a decade staying at a different London hotel, I just tried Me London for the first time. It is very chic, the room was lovely, soundproofed and quite large...but the real joy is in the tremendous staff at the hotel. They made everything easy and were warm and friendly at all times. I cannot wait to go back!",5,2019,10,22
148,Not satisfied as before,"1. Outdated facilities. Need to be changed or maintain well. This time my sink was blocked and haven‚Äôt been fixed during my stay.
2. Bed was not as comfortable as before. The mattress was over soft and quite rough. I could even feel the spring.
3. House keeping service need to be improved and house keeper need to be trained harder.
4. Sound proofing of the room was bad. ",2,2019,10,21
148,Anniversary,We stopped at the ME for our wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived we were treated as special guests. Couldn't fault our stay one bit. The roof top bar for drinks early evening was fantastic.,5,2019,10,20
148,Not worth the money at all!!!,"I must say everything was going great until check in, the guy who met us at the door an took care of our bags was very attentive and professional, the champagne on arrival was a nice touch, but when we come too check in was when it started to go down hill! The reception staff were friendly but pretty awkward, We were offered an upgrade to a bigger room for an extra ¬£500 which meant the total price of the stay would of cost ¬£1200 for 2 nights which we refused! We finally got to the room to discover it was very small and pretty much bog standard, NO TEA AND COFFEE
NO COMPLIMENTARY WATER
NO IRON
A STEAMER WITH NO WHERE TO PLUG IN OR HANG YOUR CLOTHES TO ACTUALLY STEAM THEM
Before we arrived my partner had made the hotel aware that we would be celebrating my birthday on the day of arrival an would appreciate some balloons, banners etc, this was clearly ignored as there was not a single balloon or banner! Very disappointing! 
The breakfast was ridiculous, ¬£50 for two freezing cold breakfasts and a pot of tea!
Waiting in staff were great, couldnt fault the service!
We stay in a lot of high end hotels and by no means have any problems paying expensive prices for anything but this was a total disappointment and waste of money! 

First and definitely last time at ME London!",1,2019,10,20
148,Fantastic stay,"Just got home from 2 nights break in London. A rare few nights without our 3 children.
The hotel went out of their way to make our stay special. At check in we were given complimentary champagne.
Adriana personally looked after us during our stay and put rose petals on our bed, a small bottle of champage, chocolate strawberries and a personalised note to us wishing us a lovely break without the children.
We even had love heart chocolates in the evening left on our bedside.
We went for cocktails on the roof bar where we were given a complimentary champagne each. 
The roof bar is really modern, has cute outside areas and the staff are all very helpful. We also had breakfast served here in the morning, which was the best breakfast we‚Äôve had in a long time. The bacon is worth a mention as it was that good. Lovely sat on the roof top in the sunshine having breakfast. A treat!
Concierge were very helpful recommending places to eat, but to be honest the hotel is in such a good location we went out for a walk around the Covent Garden area and soon found some good places to eat and have cocktails.
I would really recommend this hotel, I‚Äôm quite fussy because we don‚Äôt get time to ourselves very often I research every hotel before making a choice and this hotel didn‚Äôt disappoint.",5,2019,10,18
148,Mother daughter trip,"The staff were over above helpful and friendly.  The hotel was modern, clean and nice. Didn't have one bad moment.  It was a great location. I would definitely be recommending and staying at Me hotel again. I had a great experience being in London at the Me hotel and mostly due to how amazing the staff are that work there.",5,2019,10,17
148,"Excellent hotel and service, close to theaters","This was our first trip to London.  The ME hotel was fabulous.  We had a good size room with very comfortable king bed and walk in shower.  Room was very quiet, we did not hear any neighboring rooms.  Only sirens from an occasional emergency vehicle were barely heard. 

Service was superb.  Had turn down service with a chocolate daily.  Front desk helped print out a school project for our daughter.  Concierge was helpful.  Had complementary champagne on checkin in the lobby.  There is a roof top bar that has a great view of the city.

The location was excellent.  Right next to the theater district, there were 3 major shows right across the street.  It is about a 10 minute walk to Covent Gardens and Trafalgar Square.  There are 2 other tube line stations in easy walking distance.

Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,10,15
148,Anniversary stay,"My husband booked this for our anniversary as we were eating at the Savoy. We arrived early and left our bags with the concierge on the ground floor - were told no need to collect, that when we checked in they would be brought to our room.
On checking in we were offered a glass of champagne and taken to our room where we were shown all the amenities in the room. A bottle of champagne, covered strawberries and lovely anniversary wishes written on the gloss wall. Fantastic view over the Thames from the 9th floor. We had drinks and breakfast at the rooftop bar and service matched that of the hotel staff. Central position, amazing building and fantastic staff - what‚Äôs not to recommend! ",5,2019,10,13

148,Anniversary celebration,"We loved the ME London. The staff is superb and couldn‚Äôt have been nicer. The accommodations are superb, modern and elegant. We received a lovely bottle of champagne and strawberries as a celebration of our anniversary. My only issue is the hallways, which could use a bit more lighting. We would stay there again!",5,2019,10,11
148,Excellent overnight stay,"Excellent service. My husbands birthday and the staff had balloons, champagne, desert and a card for us. Airy room, with outdoor area, clean and comfortable. Lovely amenities. Would loved to have stayed here longer.",5,2019,10,11

148,Superb ,"I am a business travel consultant and have stayed at many hotels. 
I love the Melia brand. I booked this for a business trip for my husband and combined with a leisure stay for myself.
The customer service is fantastic! From the concierge to the waiter at breakfast. We found the customer service to be excellent. 
Our room was gorgeous on the 8th floor with a terrace. The radio rooftop for breakfast was beautiful. The food delicious and the view stunning. 
I am a Melia gold card holder and they honoured my late check out as requested and even provided champagne and strawberries in our room as we were celebrating!
My advice is book! The location is excellent. You will not be disappointed 
Thank you ME London! ",5,2019,10,10
148,Excellent location and service and a bit quirky,"Before we even arrived at the hotel, we were sent an e-mail by Vittoria Cal√° from guest services welcoming us and stating that the guest services would be happy to help us with anything during our stay.  I replied that it was our 5th Wedding Anniversary and when we arrived the room was decorated with red rose petals and on our Anniversary day we treated to a bottle of champagne.
On arrival we were greeted by a doorman who took our bags and showed us to reception, which is on the first floor.  After checking in, we were shown to our room and our bags arrived moments later.  We asked for some extra pillows and they also arrived moments later.
We ate breakfast on the rooftop twice and the service was excellent and the food tasted great, though not as hot as it perhaps should have been.
We had drinks in the bar on a couple of nights too and the bartender was very accommodating - making up a cocktail for my wife.
We didn't eat at the STK restaurant because it was fully booked at the times that we were interested in.  Perhaps this was fortunate, because as we walked past the door during the evening the noise coming from the restaurant was more akin to a nightclub.  This may have been great inside, but not suitable for a quiet romantic meal, I don't think.
The room was nice and spacious and had a balcony that overlooked the Novello Theatre (which was showing Mama Mia).  The room was quite big for a London hotel.
The location for the theatres is great with many within a few minutes‚Äô walk.  There are also quite a few nice restaurants nearby too if you don't fancy STK.
The rooftop bar was popular, but as a resident you get priority access, I believe.
Finally, our visit to the bar on the Saturday night was spoilt a little by some of the clientele from STK taking selfies and group photos just next to the bar area and making quite a lot of noise.  It would appear that the clientele of STK are not as refined as those for the hotel!",5,2019,10,09
148,AMAZING STAY,"I visit the Me London few days ago and from beginning to the end, it was amazing! The room was perfect decorated with a bottle of champain and a very nice set up! The staff was the best of all! Everybody was allways smiling and with a good attitude. Thank you for the Aura Team ( Antonio) who made our stay an amazing experience always taking care of us. ME London will be for now, our first choise in London! Thank you!",5,2019,10,09
148,Weekend break in London,"This was our third time staying at ME London and it gets better on each visit.  From first contact right through to departure I could not fault a thing.  Welcomed and treated throughout my stay like a family member by friendly and extremely professional staff.  The wonderful rooms, modern design and beautiful art work creates a unique ambience.  ME is a haven of escape from the hustle and bustle of the West End but brilliantly located to enjoy all show venues.  Radio Rooftop was the highlight for a beautiful meal overlooking the night sights of London.  We loved the experience and will return...Many thanks to Allessandro Pila and the wonderful team at ME London.  Keep up the good work and the excellent standards.",5,2019,10,09
148,Excellent location for a high end contemporary hotel,"A prime location for staying, shopping, entertainement, culture and varied good quality restaurants within walking distance.
Avoid STK restaurant though if you plan a romantic evening : it's crowded and super noisy.

148,Memorable stay,"Stayed one night in a city view suite last weekend for a special wedding anniversary and loved it. Room was beautifully presented, with a personalised message for us from Vittoria of the Aura Team. They really made an effort for us which was much appreciated.
The suite was a good size, with a huge bathroom and selection of nice toiletries. The living area had different mood lights and very effective air conditioning controlled from a mini touch screen, plus separate room light switches although we still never quite worked out what light switch did what ! The floor to ceiling windows give good views and the whole place feels quite special and different from a standard hotel with a real contrast between the crisp white rooms and the dark, black marble corridors outside. This was our first visit here, but we will definitely return.",5,2019,10,08
148,A very unique personalised experience,"I arranged a stay at ME London at the weekend for a celebration and I was so impressed with several aspects of my stay. I had called ahead to arrange theatre tickets, which the concierge collected for me and charged to the room, an impressive start. When we arrived my car was valet parked for me very quickly and without delay - my bags taken directly, and were in the room before we arrived. We were escorted to the 1st floor where the amazing reception checked us in offering a cold drink or some sparkles - wow.    We were then escorted by a member of the team to the suite we had booked.  Well appointed on the corner with very good views of the city.  we were shown our room and the facilities, they have a coffee machine, hand steamer, hairdryer and straighteners as standard so no need to bring extra with you.  The room itself was very modern in design, exceptionally clean and decorated for our special occasion with nice amenities, and a lovely message. Their attention to detail was excellent.everyone we met during the one night stay were exceptional and nothing was too much trouble.  The breakfast we had the following day was in Radio their rooftop bar.  It was amazing to have your breakfast with panoramic views of all of London.  Great Selection at breakfast and super attentive service.  Upon departure the concierge remembered we had seen a show and was interested on our feedback, it was so nice he remembered. Car was quickly brought to the door for me - check out was seamless all with lovely smiles.  All in all a very special stay at Me London.  Thank you all at Me London for making it so special.  We will be back as we still have to try STK as there was a private function that night.  Highly recommended. I have a few friends coming into town will recommend they book here.",5,2019,10,08
148,customer service was great!,"I read some reviews that said the staff was slow or unresponsive. I only spent one night here but the concierge, valet, and bell staff were amazing. From the moment we arrived, they took care of us. One thing about the hotel which is very modern and ‚Äúposh,‚Äù all the lights in our room were controlled by one touch pad by the bed. So if you want to go to the bathroom, you have to turn the light on from the bedroom first. A second control would have been nice.",4,2019,10,07
148,Nice stay,"We stayed here for 4 days and would definitely stay here again! Friendly staff. The hotel restaurants & room service were very good. Close proximity to the London Eye with a perfect view of the Parliaments, Big Ben. Walked to Westminster Abbey, National & British Museums. Covent Garden is 5 min. walk. Great hood to walk around in and take in its wonderful vibe with many cool pubs, restaurants , bakeries, ice cream shops & sites. PAUL's cafe down the road is excellent for our daily fresh delish croissants, salads, sandwiches, pastries, coffee & hot chocolate. The Golden Dragon in Chinatown has awesome duck & noodles. Loads of other lovely places close by so perfect for a short London trip.
Can't wait to come back!",4,2019,10,07
148,JUST BEAUTIFUL!,"Me and my boyfriend came to the me hotel for one night for his 21st birthday, 
Customer service, I couldn‚Äôt fault.... all the staff, so helpful, how polite they where, all the beautiful little touches they included for free for my boyfriend 21st birthday was so special, made the experience knowing that they appreciate all there customers e.g. free bottle of champagne and cake for his birthday left in the room,
Room was bigger than expected a lovely space, view not as good as expected but probably would have been nicer if it wasn‚Äôt raining, but obviously that‚Äôs not the hotels fault.
Location, it was lovely to have so much to do in the hotel I would really recommend going to the STK restaurant we both really enjoyed this (expensive), we also went to the radio roof top for breakfast the nice this about this was how they gave a healthy breakfast option as well, it‚Äôs about a 30/40min walk to oxford street but we walked there and back twice and it felt a lot quicker than that, we did also taxi ones due to the rain and it was only ¬£13. 
Parking, it was nice how the hotel offered parking and only ¬£45 for two days and a night I didn‚Äôt think was to bad.. it was quite hard to find somewhere where the valet could pick up the car as the hotel is on a corner on a one way street.",5,2019,10,06
148,"Wonderful facility. Staff and Service were great, so was the room","Visited London for our 15 year wedding.  From the time we entered we were treated with respect and great service.  They wrote a nice message on the wall of our room, laid rose petals on our bed, supplied us with chocolates and champagne and every time we visited the rooftop bar they gave us more champagne.  The room was great, especially the shower with dual rainfall heads.  The balcony door cut down all of the city noise so that we could sleep peacefully.  Marco at the rooftop bar was wonderful as well.  Anytime we needed something, the answer was ""no problem"".  He supplied us with a takeaway breakfast on one of our tour days as well.  The location was great too!",5,2019,10,06
148,The best hotel in London,"Ive been staying at ME London regularly now since it opened (i think almost 8 years ago). I think that says it all. I stay there for work. The location is perfect - as i have meetings all over and from Canary Wharf to Heathrow its easy to get anywhere. The rooms are state of the art and the design (Sir Norman Foster) is effortlessly cool and chic. The Spanish service culture with the local twist is unique and everyone is professional to a very high standard and extremely friendly. If you book direct on Melia.com you get extra stuff and collect points. The roof top bar has some of the best views in London. Sometimes these reviews need a bit of reality of folk don't believe them, so if i had one criticism - its that the outsourced company that run STK don't subscribe to the same service standards as the hotel so (unless you are 21 years old, out on the lash and like your food to shake in time to the beat) try another venue. Also late at night some of the STK guests can spill out into the hotel foyer and im not a big fan of my 15 minutes of fame being in the background of someone else's insta-story LOL. The best hotel in London for the price without question.",5,2019,10,06
148,Amazing!,"It wasn‚Äôt our first time in London but it was the best one. Beautiful venue and amazing staff. I‚Äôve recommended this hotel to all of my friends as I know the won‚Äôt be disappointed.

148,Best hotel in London,"I have been here for the first time and would come back for sure: great location, 5 min walking from Covent Garden, great environment, modern, comfortable and trendy.

My favorite choice in the city for sure.  ",5,2019,10,06

148,Stylish ultra modern hotel in great location !!,"We stayed at this hotel for a two night couples weekend away during September . The hotel is stylishly presented in a very modern design with some lovely and very tasteful contemporary decor. The rooms are comfortable and well featured with good sized bathrooms and generally excellent features .

The location is ideal for exploring sights of London, shopping and visiting many quality eateries nearby . The staff are friendly and generally helpful with one in particular, Marco Zanotto , addressing a problem we had with our room and resolving the issue in a professional and very satisfactory customer focused way thank you .

The only negative was, in our opinion of visiting many five star hotels, the complimentary breakfast downstairs was very disappointing. ( buffet of three pieces of soggy fatty bacon , white anaemic sausage and a congealed scrambled egg don‚Äôt constitute a five star breakfast ). This however wouldn‚Äôt stop us returning as the breakfast in the Radio bar was much better and we would upgrade to this in future by selecting a room only rate and paying for what we wanted.

The radio bar in the mornings and evenings was very pleasant and the staff friendly ( particular thanks to a long blonde hair girl in mid twenties who was very helpful in finding us a nice table outside ) . We enjoyed pre dinner drinks here on both nights and a good breakfast upgrade as offered by Marco mentioned earlier .

Overall an excellent stay thank you and we will be using this hotel and recommending to others for any future breaks in this part of London .",4,2019,10,03
148,Pretentious design but mediocre customer service,"Arrogant / patronizing receptionist; no new bottle of shampoo / conditioner on the second day (seriously?). No one helps you with luggage on arrival (the porter just wants your cab for the leaving people). Not bothering to explain that you arrive to the ground floor so to check in, you need to take an elevator and go one floor up. Not a bottle of water for the guest upon arrival...Wifi that doesn‚Äôt connect easily. Small details but they matter if you call yourself a 5 star hotel. Very specific smell in the room (part of the design probably but if you don‚Äôt like it - well). ",3,2019,10,01
148,"Hip, very modern hotel","If you are into a hip, very modern lifestyle this is your hotel, but if you have a conservative, low profile lifestyle then this hotel is not for you.

148,Great bespoke stay,"I booked a one night stay for my girlfriends birthday. Taking advantage of an early check in we arrived and was greated by Adriana Rossello who took us to the room with a glass of Cava. She had personally decorated the room with a note on the wall, a personalised card and a bottle of champagne, cake, and balloons, after a quick tour of the room our bags were delivered. We had cocktails on the terrace and again were greated with a welcome and the staff knew our names and the occasion. We ate at STK and again were welcomed by name and with a happy birthday desert. Breakfast room service style was exactly that was needed and we arranged a late check out as well. 

Adriana Rossello And her team went above and beyond to ensure the stay was even better than I had expected even for a hotel with high standards. 100% recommended. No cons, only pros.",5,2019,09,30

The ME London is as you would expect a fantastic hotel with a great history. We had an amazing weekend here with friends, Its a great hotel in a great location, a must if you want a friendly, chic hotel to stay in. With in-house restaurants should you wish not to venture out of the hotel along with the renowned Radio Roof Top Bar situated (As the name suggests) right on the top of the hotel with amazing views of the London skyline (Weather permitting obviously).

We were greeted as usual by the wonderful Adriana Rossello our Aura Host, who quite simply could not do enough for us (Thanks Adriana). We ate in the STK again an excellent experience and great place to dine. The food was amazing and with a live DJ fantastic atmosphere. 

The team in general here are extremely welcoming and helpful. Thanks for a nother great weekedn ME Team, see you again soon.",5,2019,09,25
148,Great Place to Stay in London!,"Great location and great staff!
The staff really try to attend to your needs!
They even greeted us with an anniversary surprise in our room!  
Don't bother with STK...over rated and poor quality food. 
However, the roof deck is awesome!",5,2019,09,24
148,Nice room,"We stayed for a night to visit the opera a few minutes‚Äô walk away. The location just couldn‚Äôt be better - on the west facing point of the Aldwych. 

Reception is not on the ground floor but on the first floor. Checking in was a dream, although I did feel that the receptionist was treating us like children but I can cope with that. 

The room was really comfortable but a couple of things did irritate. Why bother with an electronic panel to control lights, AC etc but then locate it attached to the wall on one side of the bed?  Yes there‚Äôs an instruction book but it‚Äôs just too complicated and then you‚Äôre faced with ‚Äúmood lighting‚Äù that makes the room look like a Turkish brothel. No.....just no!  

The other irritation was the lights for the bathroom. Housekeeping leave the robes hung by the door, artfully concealing the light switches. It took us 10 minutes to turn the bathroom lights on. 

I also got the feeling that I just wasn‚Äôt sufficiently on trend to stay here. There‚Äôs lots of black walls illuminated by floor mounted candles, but the decor seemed more suited to an office of Interiors magazine than a hotel. Personal preference I know but I want to feel welcomed and at home, not intimidated by hotel decor. 

We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel.  There are loads of restaurants within 2 minutes‚Äô walk for dinner or breakfast;  I can recommend Balthazar for breakfast. ",4,2019,09,24
148,6th time.. and will keep on returning !,"I have stayed in me hotel multiple times before and the service just keeps getting better. In a city like London where the turnover of staff is quite high in hospitality and where it‚Äôs very difficult to maintain a consistent level of service .. I found it so refreshing to find that me hotel London is still maintaining this excellent level of customer service. 

I checked into the hotel and was not happy with the smell of the room that I checked in into. I decided to go out and then return hoping that the smell will get better after spraying some perfume. But it did not. I went to the front desk to ask to change the room.  

Bertran, the gentleman at the front desk, was present when we checked in did not even question my request to change the room or asked to check the smell that I was referring to. They only made sure they provided an alternative that I was happy with. So I want to thank the hotel for having someone like Bertran who was able to manage the situation very well and turn our experience into a great one! 

The rooms are good sized, the hotel always smells wonderful in the lobby and entrance. The Air conditioning is great. The bathroom is on the large side (relative to what‚Äôs available in London). The rooms are sound proof so even though you are in a central location, you should not worry about the noise.

I love the vibe and service of this hotel. I will always be returning. Worth every penny! Thanks Me hotel for not slipping on the service and keeping it great as the first time!

The rooftop bar: welcoming glass of champagne (didn‚Äôt I say this was 5 star!) against a spectacular view of London! The location: soooo close to everything - West End theaters, Coventry Garden, shopping, restaurants and all very safe!

Beautiful decor, excellent room service & staff.",5,2019,09,22
148,My stay at ME London,"The location of the hotel is amazing and convenient as I was coming on a business trip. Everything about the hotel was great except for the room experience.

148,ME London - Pros & Cons,"Recently spent 9 nights at the ME.  Overall a very nice hotel.  Below are the pros & cons my husband and I found:

Pros - had a lovely Chic Suite - lots of room
-very nice bathroom, loads of amenities
-enjoyed all the wines, water and evening tidbits
-great service, from checkin, to housekeeping and concierge everyone treated us very well
-loads of hangers (I always bring too many clothes)

Cons - no drawers (none) for storing clothes or personal items
-this may be a European thing - but the bed was very hard - woke up with sore hips and shoulders every day
-breakfast - again may be a European thing but hard, cold toast is not our favourite

Really enjoyed the hotel - good location (5 minute walk to several tube stations).  Bus stop and Hop On stop across the street.",5,2019,09,16
148,Needs improvement ,"This is a five star hotel with a great location in London. Our stay started very well. Reception is amazing. Our room was very nice except we could hear people in the room next door, the doors opening and closing in the rooms beside us, the curtain was broken and let in the light. The lobby is a hot spot for insta photo takers. 
The breakfast was very basic for the price. Was more like a buffet. We never got a menu or the offer of eggs cooked to our liking. 
STK the food was very nice but the atmosphere is strange. It‚Äôs like having food in a nightclub. We could not have a conversation or hear our waiter. 
The rooftop bar had the same type of vibe. They state it has a dress code but we got sat next to guys wearing hoodies, baseball hats and sunglasses. That was one guy wearing all 3 items. They messed up our drinks order and then tried to charge for the mistake",3,2019,09,15
148,ME Hotel London - Outstanding,"My wife and I stayed 8 nights in the ME London Hotel to enjoy the city and celebrate life, we can say that ME exceeded our expectations. ME has excellent facilities and outstanding staff genuinely committed to deliver the best possible service, consistently. Additionally, its location is perfect for entertainment, great theaters, restaurants, pubs, etc. are at walking distance.
Finally, we want to give special thanks to Adriana for her assistance in making this a memorable stay. We have stayed in Melia Hotels in Spain in the past, after this experience, Melia is at the top of our choices. Surely, we will return.",5,2019,09,13
148,ME Hotel London,"Overall an excellent Hotel. As they say you pay for what you get, whilst a little expensive the service you get is in my opinion second to none. I had a small problem with my room and the manager Paul Rafferty took care of it and made sure I would have the ME at the top of my list for my next stay in London. If your going to a show in the west end the hotel is a two minute walk from all the major theatres and Covent Garden",5,2019,09,12
148,Luxury lifestyle hotel in central London,"I came together with my daughter to stay in London, one friend recommended the hotel and wow what a choice I made. We had an amazing room with a balcony with views of London Eye, The Shard. The breakfast at Radio was absolutely fantastic but most of all I will like to thank Edward for looking after our stay. It is the best 5 star lifestyle hotel in London I stayed in so far and will be back next year.",5,2019,09,11
148,Excellent/Outstanding/Best experience,"Wow. What a hotel and what an excellent level of service we received.

We book one night in ME to celebrate our wedding and I can honestly say that this was the best decision we made as a couple.

As the availability allowed them, we were upgraded by Marco, a well groomed gentleman who was actually the Front Office Manager. Our reservations were made by Vittoria from the AURA department who was contantly updating us and looking after. We went to STK were the food and atmosphere was fabulous and the staff members really engage with us making sure we are having a great time. There we were also greeted by Paul the hotel manager which was a nice touch seeing that everyone was concerned about our experience. After dinner we went to Radio Roof Top bar and there we spend all night. There we met Antoaine the Assistant Genera Manager of the outlet who made sure with his french charm that we have a great experience. His team did a fantastic job.
We also received a delicious cake üéÇ compliments from Annelisa and Samantha the General Manager of ME London, who made the entire experience possible.

Well, in regards to the room experience I can only say thank you to Sabir, Antonio, Vitoria, Adriana, Khabiba and everyone else who touched that room for us (Please check the pictures so you know what I meant).

This hotel and mostly the staff members made this special day perfect in every way. 

Thank you all for the kind attention and for the flawless level of hospitality.",5,2019,09,11
148,Stylist hotel but could improve on the service,"After travelling for 18 hours, we arrived at the Hotel mid morning.  They were very accommodating with an early check-in....however.  We booked a Vibe room and the check-in staff asked if we wanted to upgrade to a suite for an extra 300 pounds per night!!! I declined, but they asked twice more during our check-in process.  On the last request he stated he could close the gap on the price but I still declined.  The hard sell put me off a little.
The next day a high tea and a bottle of champagne was delivered to the room (a nice touch), however.........we went to get out the champagne glasses and they were dirty (looks like someone used them and they haven't been cleaned), so we drank out of wine glasses.
There was no iron or ironing board in the room, or hairdryer in the bathroom.  I also requested a blown light bulb in the bathroom to be fixed.  The hairdryer never showed up - really annoying.
The architecture and styling of the hotel is second to none.  The light installation in the reception area to memorizing.
The concierge was very knowledge about the local area.  
Overall - a high end hotel that just needs to focus on the attention to detail.",4,2019,09,10
148,Perfect weekend away to celebrate my partners birthday. 5 Star!,"Beautiful hotel with lovely spacious rooms, we stopped in the urban energy room which the views from the balcony with amazing views. I honestly could not fault the hotel or the staff and I‚Äôd like to say a big thank you to Beatriz Flores who really made my partners birthday special leaving a message I chose on the bathroom mirror, balloons in the room we both had the best weekend. Will definitely be back to this hotel. Had gorgeous food a STK for dinner and then breakfast brought to our room in the morning which we ate on the balcony. Throughly pleased with our stay highly highly recommend :)",5,2019,09,09
148,Quality hotel in excellent location,"We chose this hotel for its close location to Covent Garden and having a room with a balcony. It did not disappoint on either account as we had a great view towards the Opera House. Upon arrival we were directed to reception on the first floor. This was an experience in itself with very high pyramid roof on which were projected lighting shows. The room, like the rest of the hotel, was clean with modern decor and for London, reasonably spacious. The only minor criticism of the room was that the safe had a lift up door with a very small handle. Someone with a limited grip could have difficulty opening it.
Nice touches included candles throughout the hotel and nice artwork.
The rooftop bar gave excellent views over London but,not surprisingly, was always busy in the evenings.
The well dressed staff were all very helpful and seemed to be everywhere in the hotel. There was always someone stationed outside the lifts to give any help or guidance required.
Most guests seemed to be young professionals, but, as an older couple, we felt quite at home.",4,2019,09,09
148,Fantastic birthday weekend,"I booked an urban energy terrace room for my partners birthday as I loved the location and we wanted to dine at STK and after go to Radio Rooftop. 

Before we arrived I had requested information about the rooftop bar as regards whether a booking was necessary as we were guests. 

I got an immediate reply and had been booked a table after our meal at STK.

I few days before our stay I was delighted to receive an email from the Aura team to say our room had been upgraded to a Chic suite free of charge.  This is rare to get a significant upgrade for free but it made my partners birthday so much more special . 

We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by lovely staff at concierge and reception that knew it was a birthday break and our luggage was stored with only a short wait for our room.

We were escorted to our room by a member of the Aura team to another surprise of champagne , birthday cake and a birthday message on the tv screen. Again also free.  We were made to feel like VIP‚Äôs and this whole experience would definately make me book again and also look at other Meli√° hotels abroad.

The hotel was spotlessly clean and our room was amazing. All mod cons and the lighting , sound system and high standard of bathrooms and furnishings were even better than 5 star hotels I have  stayed in In Dubai.

We had a lovely breakfast at Radio rooftop and whilst there Adriana from the Aura team came to check that everything had been to our liking which it certainly had been. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone that loves a trendy luxury hotel. Yes we were spoilt with our suite but even if we had a normal room the standard and location of the hotel would make me book this hotel again .",5,2019,09,09
148,Wonderful hotel but disappointing room,"The hotel is amazing and the staff really do go out of their way for you. I was thoroughly impressed with ME London. 

The room was quite underwhelming, however. I booked an energy river terrace room and the view of the river was minimal. The room was very tired and certainly could do with a refresh, there was limescale in the shower, lots of pulled threads on the Egyptian cotton bedding and it looked like someone had used the toilet in my room prior to my checking in. Also, why put an ashtray on the terrace, is it to encourage smoking? Anybody sitting outside would be subjected to smoke from a neighbouring terrace. I was really disappointed about this.",4,2019,09,09
148,Birthday treat,"My husband surprised me with a stay at Me and I cannot fault this hotel in any way. From the balloons in the room to the perfect cocktails at Radio, the whole stay was perfect. Thank you to everyone who made our stay so amazing! We will be back.",5,2019,09,08
148,Great hotel and amazing service,"we stayed for a few days break from home and I say the hotel is in the amazing location. Only few minutes walk to Covent Garden and everything is close.

The hotel is great and have music playing in the evening with very lively atmosphere. The staff are amazing Emilio was fantastic with giving us advice of where to go and even the bell boy was so helpful showing us all the room and bringing is Champagne. They are also very stylish dressed which you don‚Äôt see everywhere that is classical.

Breakfast was not special but the rooftop bar great! The view is fantastic Stefania greeted us and was such a warm and caring person and looked after us both.

On check out the receptionist was very efficient and his colleagues saber had a lovely talk with us. Even saying some words in Norwegian whilst helping us to our taxi.

I can recommend the hotel very much and we will be back very soon.",5,2019,09,08
148,"An excellent, modern hotel in the heart of London.","It is difficult to suggest a hotel with a better location combined with such a modern, yet professional feel. 

Situated right by Covent Garden in Aldwych, this hotel has fantastic access to London theatres as well as being mere minutes from the Thames and the usual London attractions.

The hotel itself is modern and the decor is intriguing. From the moment you step foot inside, you will find your eyes drawn to the fabulous aesthetics. It also makes for an excellent place for pictures, should your social media account require any additions.

My stay delighted me with a clean, comfortable room. If I were to critique the room, I would say it was perhaps not 'homely', but felt more toward the professional side. It was comparatively large considering similar hotels in London but it should be noted that from an international traveler perspective the rooms seem a little small. I would say this makes for a good stay for business or perhaps couples but I feel that the feel of the hotel might be a little less amiable for families.

The staff were extremely helpful. I feel I was fortunate enough to have been greeted by the manager, Sabir, when I stayed. Sabir went out of his way to assist me in opening my case as my lock would not open and also advised me on a few places to see before I had to leave. I was surprised at how exceptionally attentive to my requests Sabir was, especially considering even I felt perhaps I was using too much of his time.

There is a rooftop bar, Radio, on the top level. This has excellent views of the city and makes for an ideal sunset scene. While the interior design of the hotel makes for some good social media pictures, the view from the rooftop is the excuse you need to bring a DSLR. The bar does however cause a little noise during the evenings if you stay on the upper floors as I did but if you're used to living in cities this is of no concern.

I was not especially impressed by the food. I ordered room service and, while it was brought fairly quickly, the best I can say for the quality and taste is that it was ""fine"".

The prices of food and rooms are reasonable considering the location but the service quality really stands out. I have to thank everyone at ME London for a fantastic stay.",5,2019,09,08
148,Absolutely exemplary!,"My wife and I have stayed here quite a few times, the reason we mainly return is the fantastic team. The hotel is very cool and oozes class so that is good enough to draw us back under normal circumstances  but the team, no matter if there is a change of personnel, are always top of their game. This visit was no different! From the moment we arrived at check in and offered a glass of fizz whilst doing so, we were warmly welcomed by Adriana who made us feel so very welcome. The room we had was very cool and did the job for the 2 nights we were there celebrating our wedding anniversary. When we came to check out, we were equally warmly greeted, this time by Sabir, who even presented us with a couple of drinks vouchers to help celebrate our anniversary. What wonderful touches this team offers consistently. If you have not stayed here before then stop thinking and start planning, you should love the experience üòé Chalky x",5,2019,09,07
148,Love it!,"I stayed here a few weeks ago and honestly it is nothing like you're usual hotel.

The minute you walk in your transported somewhere else. The staff were so attentive and really care. The aura manager sabir greeted us and he made us so comfortable and we called him a few times, whenever we needed anything.

Radio is great and the views are so amazing. Seriously bring a good camera. Our whole time here was great! I can't wait to come back again the next time I'm in London.",5,2019,09,07
148,Amazing hotel - both visually and in terms of accommodations ,Had the pleasure of staying at this visually fascinating design hotel. Everything from the lobby to the reception area to the view from the roof top bar and restaurant was a visual extravaganza yet tastefully designed. The rooms a bit small but still nicely designed in good taste so it didn't really matter. Both the bar selection with champagne at night as well as the breakfast a la carte on the roof top was delicious. Also the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. They made my stay the best ever in London. ,5,2019,09,07
148,"Convenient location, 5+ stars","I was traveling with my daughter; did not know much about this hotel, but after we got there we were pleasantly surprised.  Friendly staff, professional, and accommodating.  Centrally located i the theater district with many great restaurants, and shopping areas.
The breakfast in the hotel was very good, and my suggestion is when you reserve get the breakfast included in the package. The restaurant  staff also are very friendly; they go out of their way to make it pleasant.  Mr. Emmeuc  (I hope I am spelling his name right) was so accommodating.  The day we were going to the airport we did not have time to sit down for breakfast, he arranged with the staff to pack it to go, which was very helpful.
Mr. Marco Zanotto, one of the hotel manager also was very kind and helped us to an early checking with consideration of the room requests that we had. The friendly staff and the concierge were great in guiding us to anywhere we wanted to go.
The hotel overall is very clean, and new with smell of fresh air.  We definitely will go back when traveling to London again.",5,2019,09,06
148,Lots of improvements,"This was the second time I visited the ME Hotel and I was impressed with the changes, from housekeeping to the breakfast up in the terrace. On my first visit, I drove in, a guy approached me wearing a grey jumper, I didn‚Äôt even know if he was working there, I was a bit scared about leaving my Range Rover with him, but this time I was greeted by someone wearing a nice grey blazer, I am very glad that the management decided to make this change. The breakfast upstairs improved a lot and you cannot go wrong with their view. The room was clean and comfortable; I will definitely be back soon.",5,2019,09,06
148,"Contemporary, Sexy and definitely Luxury Hotel","We visited London for a corporate event however took a few days whilst there to celebrate my wifes birthday in style. Wow did we have an enjoyable and great stay at ME London. We were greeted by concierge and escorted to the reception area which is where we were greeted with a glass of bubbly. We stayed in a Chic suite which was very spacious with a separate living area and there were cakes and more champagne in the room on arrival. We started our night off with a few drinks at Radio Rooftop before heading out for dinner. We had breakfast at Radio the next morning enjoying the fantastic views.

I was welcomed with a glass of bubbles at reception (which has a really cool atrium and light display). My room had a balcony with great views of the Thames. Also the staff had arranged balloons in my room when I arrived. There was also champagne, cheesecake and a personal message on the mirror. Great stay topped off with some drinks at their rooftop bar called radio.",5,2019,09,05
148,Anniversary celebration... just amazing!,"We stayed at the ME Hotel to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary and it was absolutely perfect from the start. Antonio took us to our room, very knowledgable and friendly.

148,Pleasant weekend break,"I have stayed over the weekend with a friend of mine for her birthday celebration. We have been greeted by the lovely front office manager, Eduard upon check in, he also offered us a glass of bubbly to compliment the occasion. Our room has been upgraded which was a lovely surprise, was also nicely decorated with balloons and personalised messages. Sabir has given us a follow up call few minutes later to make sure everything was fine and I found this a  very special touch. Had a great meal in STK and a drink afterwards in the bar, where we have been well looked after by Germans. All in all had a really good time and would recommend the hotel to friends and family.",5,2019,09,04
148,Sexy hotel in fantastic location can't beat the street,Super clean hotel with a sexy decor. Very professional service and over the top helpfulness. The area is walkable to most theater and you will not be unhappy you stayed here.There was something to see and do around the clock.  We were impressed by the lobby.  Its a pyramid and you feel as if you entered an egyptian pyramid look up as you sip the welcome cava.,5,2019,09,03
148,Excellent Hotel and Great Staff,"We celebrated my birthday in ME London a few days ago. I could not be any happier with my choice. The hotel looks stunning and the location is perfect for Covent Garden. 
The team made the whole experience memorable. Upon check in we were offered a complimentary upgrade to a room with a balcony and a glass of Cava by Eduard which was a great start to our stay. I was extremely pleased with the setup which was arranged by the wonderful Aura team: Antonio, Adriana and Vittoria. I found a hand written card, balloons and personalised mirror messages in the room which made my celebration even more special. They went above and beyond making sure that we are looked after.

A great hotel and team! 

Thank you",5,2019,09,02
148,ME London Hotel - ME by Meli√°,"I really enjoyed my stay at ME. The rooms are top spec and the security are great, as they called up to my room each time one of my friends arrived. I would advise booking the restaurant below, STK in advance and the benefit of having the hotel booked, they treat your restaurant reservation as a priority. The restaurant is lovely also. Please be aware that they hold a ¬£100 holding fee on top of the payment of the hotel room for insurance, in case you use the mini bar, so if you budgeted only for the hotel and restaurant, be sure to add another ¬£100 to that. You will get it back after 3 days or so, when they release it back to your bank, as long as you don‚Äôt use the mini bar or damage the room. I celebrated my birthday here and I would love to come here again for Valentines or another special occasion, possibly every birthday! They were very helpful in putting helium into my birthday balloons, little things like that make this hotel a cut above the rest.",5,2019,09,01
148,Best London hotel,"Taken me ages to write this but... this hotel is Absolutely brilliant, they went the extra mile and upgraded us on my birthday! We had drinks on ice and cake in the room! We even had a birthday message for me on the mirror! Parking below the hotel is super convenient. Stunning interior and the place is so clean. I loved the rooms mood lighting and music system. Then there is the roof top bar! Serving amazing cocktails by night and yummy breakfast in the morning! Comfy bed! Wonderful views. Local to the theatres lion king etc! Can I live there???",5,2019,09,01
148,Birthday Family night out,"We attended STK and Radio Rooftop on a Saturday night as part of a family birthday night out.

The ME hotel Chief engineer Kwesi was amazing at helping us sort the night out. He arranged a table in both the rooftop bar and the restaurant for us. He catered to all our needs and made our overall experience fantastic.

Our experience in STK was brilliant, with the fabulous food, notable mentions to the mushroom pie and Mac & Cheese which were delicious but especially the steak which was delicious.

I would highly recommend and will definitely be returning!",5,2019,08,29
148,Fabulous Saturday night stay,"Had a wonderful stay in a suite - a very romantic break for my husband and I.  Staff left half a bottle of champagne in the room and some wonderful cakes.

Perfectly located on the Strand. Close to excellent restaurants (including Me's own STK). Theater, street activities minutes from St. Paul, Trafalgar Square and Southbank fair ground. ",4,2019,08,28
148,Great Hotel and Great Location,"First time staying at this hotel, and got an upgrade. Great hotel decor and service, wonderful room and view with balcony, great night's sleep in a great bed. Location perfect for Covent Garden. Bar on top of the roof excellent view, food and drinks. Only negative is that one has to go from the roof bar to the ground floor and then back up in the lift to your room floor, but I understand why. The Hotel is quite geared around the nightclub/bar on the roof.",5,2019,08,28
148,Slightly disappointed,"Recently visited ME London for a weekend away with my partner as was recommended by a friend. We first walked into the hotel and it is very nice and welcoming and it is a beautiful hotel main reception and lobby. We then got into our room and this is where the disappointed came in for a 5* hotel it was not 5* at all !! It was quite dirty but the bathroom was not clean at all and the shower door did not shut as was getting stuck on the floor. I also asked for a iron and iron board which was quickly brought to the room to find out the iron board was broke and I was about to iron my clothes and the iron was covered in black plastic that was melted onto it. Which you would expect at a premier inn not a 5* hotel. Also we booked STK and it was too hot in there to even sit comfortable so we had a Few drinks and went to eat elsewhere. When it came to check out we had a few bits from the mini bar and they asked me what I had which I explained and it was a bottle of wine which in the menu in the room was ¬£17 but when I got home I realised they have charged me ¬£49 for the bottle of wine and 2 cokes and took this from my deposit but did not even say a thing at reception, so I did not realise until I got home. Just a little disappointed with the hotel and probably would not be returning unless it was half the price it was as it‚Äôs not worth the 5*.",3,2019,08,27
148,Perfect,"Excellent from start to finish! 
My boyfriend & I stayed here for his birthday in August & they made the whole experience bespoke & vip throughout. Our Aura host Antonio catered for everything that was requested & was a great help, special thanks to him. 
We stayed in the Passion suite on floor 7. It was chic, urban & had all the modern features we enjoy, including a huge romantic bath & lovely views of the strand & London eye. 
On arrival concierge parked our car and escorted us to reception on the next floor up. The reception is stunning! Champagne on arrival and the manager personally came to greet us, our Aura host took us to our room and on arrival had scattered rose petals, special music i had requested, champagne, cake & a personalised mirror message. Perfect. 
Radio rooftop bar has a great ambiance, cocktails & champagne, and our in room breakfast was excellent too, service very respectful & polite.

148,This is not a hotel it‚Äôs an experience!,"I booked this hotel for a surprise for my husband‚Äôs birthday as we were going to a concert at Hyde Park.

From the moment we arrived the lobby staff greeted us and took our luggage, then the wonderful reception staff greeted us and knew all about my surprise. We were given a glass of bubbles and Adrianna took us to our beautiful room which had lots of birthday surprises included. She showed us all the technical features the room had and attentively came and found us in the Radio Roof bar to check we were happy. She went above and beyond making sure our hotel stay was amazing. She even extended our check out time. On arrival back to the bar for a late drink the Portuguese guys took care of us. We ordered room service and the food arrived promptly by a lovely lady with a smile and all the food was delicious and cooked fresh. 

The whole hotel is a 5* experience and we want to thank Adrianna and all your wonderful attentive staff for making it a fabulous experience - one we won‚Äôt forget!",5,2019,08,27
148,Very poor for a 5 star hotel,"We paid almost 3000 euro for 2 rooms for 3 nights. Passion suite and aura room.

This hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in a lot of hotels in many different countries. 
The lobby and reception areas are stunning, very modern and contemporary and the staff were attentive without being intrusive.
When we arrived the team had left Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in the room. The bed had been also decorated with rose petals and balloons and messages written on the mirrors. 
The room was stunning and it was lovely having our own balcony with a view across London. 
We received an email before we stayed from the Aura team asking if they could do anything for us prior to our arrival so we asked them to book a table in the Radio Rooftop Bar for the evening and that was where we spent the night drinking cocktails and enjoying the view.

We have stayed at quite a few differing prices and ratings in UK & abroad but this has to be the best I've experienced in the UK. We arrived & gave our car keys for valet parking which was very simple, then bags to the sweet concierge before being shown to the reception on 1st floor to check in. At reception we were offered welcome drinks, I had cava & hubby had orange. The atrium at reception is epic! The hotel overall is very arty & chic! Room ready for 3pm,my hubby had told them we were celebrating my birthday so we had an abundance of treats in the room! LOVED IT!! Cake,balloons,mirror messages,a card,champagne,welcome music & lighting-wonderful (Thank you so much team!) VERY appreciated! The room itself-gorgeous, we had a balcony too so great views of the city both day & nigh! Toiletries were fab, mainly natural products! Slippers,robes,towels were all great quality. We got ready & headed out to the theatre & when we arrived back we had a few night caps in the bar,the waiter was great! Nuts with the drinks too (in gorgeous glasses!) all very suave & high end. Upon coming back to the room we found the turndown service done so ambient lighting,curtains drawn, choccies & water left next to the bed. The bed itself was very comfy.We also loved the speakers in the room,iPad,lighting & mini bar choices although we didn't need to use those. Overall 100% recommended! Would LOVE to return & looking at other Melia hotels too (this is our 2nd) Thank you so much!",5,2019,08,19
148,One of the best hotel experiences ,"From start to end this hotel continuously made us very happy and pleased with our choice. 
On arrival all staff were so polite and helpful. The reception was lovely, and we were greeted with champagne. Once we had checked in we went to our room were the hotel had left me a bottle of champagne and birthday cake. A real nice touch! 
The rooms were modern and you could connect your phone to the sound system in the room. The room was very tidy and the bed comfy. 
The hotel was in a great location just around the corner from the theatre which we were attending. There was plenty of restaurants and bars close by. The food top bar at the hotel is a must visit!
I couldn‚Äôt complain about anything at the hotel and would recommend everyone to stay ",5,2019,08,19
148,The best hotel experience - Genuine customer service and amazing property,"Let‚Äôs start saying that I personally grew up in the hospitality business and travelled a lot during the past 25 years. My 40 nights ME experience has been one of the best I have ever had, spent lovely time with my daughter who also stayed for 14 nights. The rooms are beautiful, modern and well equipped, the Radio roof terrace is incredible and the breakfast served there is amazing. The most important point which made my stay the most memorable if the ME People, this is how they call themselves, from the Concierge to the Aura team (Antonio) and the Room Service team (Erika), everyone was so professional throughout my entire stay. A special thank you to Emiliano, Arman and Benard from the Concierge team who have been absolutely exceptional, every single morning they were texting me the ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù and helped me arrange anything I needed, and when I say anything I truly mean anything, while in London, Paris, Milan, Rome and even from my wife in USA. Thank you ME and thank you ME People, see you soon. Sattam",5,2019,08,18
148,Fabulous hotel,"I‚Äôve stayed at the ME before but it really is one of the best places to stay in London. The rooms are always clean and the beds are fantastic.

Staff are so helpful and the valet parking is really handy too.

Good location for everything we wanted and breakfast on the rooftop bar is a lovely way to start the day!

Definitely one of our favourites !",5,2019,08,18
148,ME London,"Very central, comfortable and clean
The hotel design is beautiful and luxurious 
Very quiet and private 
Good service and good food in the amazing restaurant on the roof wit an amazing view
If you want to visit the center of London, that the perfect hotel ! ",4,2019,08,17
148,Great Stay,"My first stay here, but not the last! Very good location and great vibe around the hotel. The room was cool and we were lucky enough to have a small balcony, which offered an excellent view of the city.",5,2019,08,15
148,Exceptional service,"This hotel stands out by its impressive customer service: When we arrived at check-in time our room wasn't ready. Instead of making us wait we were offered an upgrade and could move into a higher-category-room right away. This kind of uncomplicated attention was noticeable throughout our short stay: Service at breakfast was swift and efficient, our room was cleaned within a very short time after we had gone out, everyone was very considerate in a nice unfussy way. We gave the staff another big chance to prove their excellence when we left a jacket in the room after checking out and didn't notice until days later when we had travelled elsewhere. Not a problem for ME's security team: Andrei Vasile Vrasmas sent the jacket to our home adress without missing a beat - and without even charging us. Thanks to Andrei and to his colleagues at ME who make this a special place!",5,2019,08,14
148,Last minute stay,"My husband & I rarely stay in London as we only live half an our away. It was his birthday and I booked a table for dinner and last minute decided to turn it into an overnight stay.
I am so glad I ended up choosing the ME hotel, the service we experienced was outstanding, that staff couldn't do any more for us to celebrate my husband's birthday, with a lovely touch in our room.
The rooms are spacious and very quiet, with everything you need to enjoy your stay. 
I will be using this hotel chain again in the future. ",5,2019,08,13
148,Birthday stay,"Great space, had the passion suite with three bedrooms.
Decent enough space, sound system a bit quiet considering it‚Äôs a sound proofed room.
Radio bar was a bit low key for a Saturday but overall facilities great.",4,2019,08,12
148,INSANE HOTEL! BEST IN LONDON!,"WOW! what an experience this hotel really is the best I have ever stayed in- true 5-star luxury! Super chic, cool and classy. The chic suite was to die for! Super friendly staff also! Great for an occasion or as a treat!",5,2019,08,12
148,Great place and location ,"This is a great place to stay. Rooms, lobby and roof top bar are all amazing, with great service from all staff. Can‚Äôt wait to come back.  The rooftop bar is great for breakfast, but it‚Äôs turned into a funky bar with dj at night, with 360 views over London ",5,2019,08,12
148,How Fun is this place,"With a very modern, simplistic style to it, this experience offers something different that the usual hotel decor of the usual marriott or hiltons I'm used to frequenting. Halls are dark with little or no natural light with still a feeling of luxury. Reception is on first floor, interestingly decorated, I doubt it will disappoint. My room on the 6th floor, room was all white, with a very modern feel, with mirrored fixtures for the feeling of space and luxury. Bed was comfortable and pillows were great, shower was good, amenities great. I went to the roof top bar for my cocktail called Pink One, its for a the gin lovers. Its a popular bar with great views of the city. Great experience, already booked my next stay.",4,2019,08,11
148,August Musicals,"Great hotel and fantastic location for what we wanted to do. We attended musicals at the Novello - Mama Mia (just over the road) then wicked at Victoria -  few stops on the circle line.

Fantastic room with great facilities. But, would be great if TVs in the rooms could allow ""Casting"" from phones so could play Netflix for instance",4,2019,08,11
148,One of the best,"Stayed here in August.   Room 810 fantastic view of the strand 
Service is great from the moment you arrive until departure
Car is parked for you and collected  food is fantastic

Have stayed in many hotels in London and this was our first stay and certainly won‚Äôt be the last

Great location for theatre land 

",5,2019,08,10
148,Still the best,"Visited ME London this summer again, and the staff and service was amazing, as usual. Special thanks to Marco, he paid special attention to us and was attentive throughout our stay. Will definitely return again!",5,2019,08,09
148,Excellent Service. Special thanks to Adriana.,"Our stay was made special and personalized by Adriana. She prepared a surprise mirror message, sweet treats, balloons and petals all around the room for my spouse's Birthday. Excellent Service!Thank you!",5,2019,08,08
148,Fantastic hotel and great staff,"Really enjoy our weekend break here at the ME.. really great staff, radio bar is a must .. room and hotel were super clean.. location is perfect .. particulars good service in the Radio bar and would love to return soon ",5,2019,08,08
148,A gem of a hotel,"This was our third time in this hotel, and we keep coming back because it is really one of the best in the city. Location is perfect, next door to Covent Garden and the river,  the rooms are spacious and beautiful, the rooftop bar is the best place to end a day in London, and the staff is just amazing. There are no downsides to this hotel, if you can afford it, of course. We highly recommend it!!",5,2019,08,07
148,Concierge excellent!,"During my stay at ME London I was again blown away by the impeccable service displayed. The concierge desk assisted me with every single question and did not need to consult a computer at any time. Restaurants, activities, hidden gems, you name it and they know the best options imminently! Emiliano leads by example and really goes the extra mile to look after his guests. During a busride my wallet fell out of my pocket. As it was a bus passing the hotel I called Emiliano if he knew a solution. He called TFL who then contacted the specific busdriver in order to check if the wallet was still on my seat! Emiliano did all this while waiting at the busstop hoping to collect my wallet from busline 9. And guess what?! He returned my wallet with everything in it üòä. Without him I would be stuck without cards, drivers license etc. Nothing is too much for him and i am forever grateful! Try lunch with the best views over London in Radio Rooftop or the steaks in STK. Roast on Sunday is an amazing price and you won‚Äôt leave hungry either!",5,2019,08,06
148,N Dennis,Well what can you say or can‚Äôt you say about this fantastic hotel the decor is modern with a capital M the staff are so welcoming and nothing is to much trouble as they always putting you first I stayed here for my 27th wedding anniversary and I would like to give Adriana & Antonio a special mention for the nice touch of champagne & rose  petals in my room would I come back for my 28th YES DEFINITELY,5,2019,08,05
148,2 nights in the city,"I'm all about ME London, just returned following two great nights in this amazing city and vibrant hotel. Service is simply sublime, discreet and seamless. Radio (The rooftop bar) is a stunning location to enjoy a wonderful cocktails as you watch the sun set over the skyline.

A special mention to Emillino and the front of house team who organised a number of clubs and hip hang outs. whilst we were in town, cant wait to return.     ",5,2019,08,05
148,perfect weekend trip,"Our whole stay in ME London was perfect! The Vibe room is beautifully furnished, spacious with room-height windows and a big bathroom. We loved the modern architecture of the room but also the whole hotel. 
Not only the room was perfect, also the staff was  great! Everyone we met was welcoming, helpfull and friendly. 
We also booked a table at the Radio Rooftop Bar for drinks. Also at the bar, the staff was amazing. The barkeeper took his time to help us choose the right drinks for us. Drinks were delicious, prices a bit higher but worth the price. 

We can highly recommend staying at the ME London and looking forward to our next stay!",5,2019,08,05
148,Unexpected Hotel & Experience!,"This is definitely the best contemporary hotel in London.
We love it for so many reasons; from the great service to the beauty of its unbelievable and unexpected reception, its up and coming contemporary art exhibitions, its technological and modern/minimalist design rooms and also its strategic location just in the heart of London.
This amazing place was designed by Norman Rober Foster who also designed, in London, places like Millennium Bridge, The Gherkin, Wembley Stadium, 8 Canada Square and Moor House.
ME London is not just a hotel but it's also home to the renowned ""Radio Rooftop"" (a Cafe with a 360¬∞ panoramic view of London skyline), to ""STK"" (a world-famous steak house), ""ZELA London"" (fusion of Mediterranean products and traditional Japanese cuisine techniques) and ""Marconi Lounge Bar"".
I have already recommended this place to some of my guests and it has always gone beyond their expectations so far.
Unexpected is not just the special reception but also Emiliano, head concierge of ME hotel, who will make you feel at home with his kindness, professionalism and congeniality.
But that is not all because Emiliano will make your stay extraordinay if you follow his tips about things to do and see in London.",5,2019,08,05
148,Best 40th Birthday Stay at the Suite ME,"Alas it was a very special occasion and I went all in. Stayed at the Suite ME with 2 friends. Emiliano Del Pizzo at Concierge could not have been more helpful with my last minute car service arrangements both pick up and drop off. Even upon arrival at the hotel, we immediately received a warm personal greeting from Emiliano, who just took care of our bags and let us proceed to the reception which is on 1st floor. 

My party at Radio Rooftop started at 4pm so guests starting arriving then and some had arrived by car. Emiliano and the entire concierge team were just incredibly helpful with 'beaming' up my guests to our floor and sorting out the valet parking. 

When I got back from the make-up and hairdresser whilst the room wasn't quite ready yet, Emiliano made sure we were looked after at the Marconi lounge and pampered us with champagne - oh how I felt spoilt already. 

Then came the Aura team. First it was Antonio who greeted us so warmly and again, just made sure we had all we needed and even took my jacket to be placed in the room once it's ready. Adriana Rossello - who personally decorated the room for my 40th (see pics). I mean afternoon tea, champagne, our suitcases were so perfectly unpacked (I would have done a worst job at unpacking!!!!). It was the best home away from home I could have asked for. 

There was nothing too much for the entire team. I must have called reception, concierge, the team God knows how many times but our stay was just perfect. We slept so very comfortable. The room was stunning. The 360 living room is to die for and certainly more than suitable for an unforgettable party at the Radio Rooftop. 

I felt sad for having to leave as the hospitality, the warmth of everyone in the team could not have been better. I have been to ME Milan and the same level of service is also being done here in London. Now I have to try ME Ibiza ...... 

Again, thank you very much to the entire team at ME London - you have made my stay and my birthday truly unforgettable. ",5,2019,08,04
148,The best hotel,"This hotel is incredible, I have stayed at ME London several times now and each time gets better, the staff are friendly and can‚Äôt do enough for you, Adriana in particular was amazing and made our stay very special and memorable, also personally remember as I returned to the hotel. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again!",5,2019,08,04
148,Fantastic hotel if you place less value on sleep and internet,"The resort has fantastic decor and location.   The problem was that the rooms have hard closing doors and panels that connect you to your neighbor so you get loud crashing noises at odd hours.  Additionally , the internet was impossibly slow (making getting any work done near impossible ).  When I conveyed the door issue with the front desk they did apologize but there was not further follow up or concern with compensation for the issue.  ",2,2019,08,03
148,Choose wisely.  This place may or may not be for you.,"It's a beautiful hotel, with some stunning design elements, but it's more suited for Moma than a relaxing hotel experience.  In my opinion anyway.  I booked this spot as it is across the street from the UK office I was visiting.  However, I chose to check out and move to a different property after my first night.  I'm a pretty typically plainly dressed middle-aged guy and I felt entirely out of place whenever I entered.  I wanted to stop at Ted Baker to get refitted just to go back to my room.  It feels entirely too overtly pretentious to my sensibilities. Simply walking the hallways to your room feels like a foreboding experience out of a horror movie, and as others have said, you'll often find a queue of elites lined up at the elevator waiting to go to the rooftop.

It IS however, a very nice hotel, with very soundproof rooms, with a lovely comfortable bed.  The room overall, however, was very dark, with one small window, and ergonomically strange.  Light panels at knee height all over the place.  

If you're at home in a ultra-hip, Las Vegas hotel, you might like this place a lot.  If you just want to feel relaxed and comfortable, you might want to look elsewhere.",4,2019,08,03
148,A great hotel and wonderful service !,We stayed here 2 weeks ago. It was my husbands 50th and I was very precise and fussy. As I wanted his birthday to be very special.  Vitoria really helped me and met us in person as well. Each thing I asked for was done on time and exactly my way !  Thank you Vittoria. I could not have done it without you. !  We was allowed to check in earlier. Lunch was simply great on rooftop bar. Breakfast the next morning was lovely too.  Vittoria did go out of her way and thank you so much !  The decor is great. Very clean hotel.  Very expensive but well worth it. Thank you once again. Definitely returning. ! X,5,2019,08,01
148,Five star luxury in London,"I arrived here early with my wife, about 11.15, expecting to leave my bags so that we could go out. The gentleman on the check-in, much to our surprise, told us that our room was ready straight away. All the staff here were very friendly and helpful and they have a wonderful rooftop bar/restaurant. The room was great and very high tech, with keypad controls for lighting and air-conditioning. It is very expensive but it is London and it is also five star.",5,2019,08,01
148,Reunion with friends,"Excellent experience at the Me hotel. The staff was wonderful, kind and helpful. They remembered our names and activities. It was overall a very positive experience for myself and my friends traveling from multiple areas of the states to enjoy London and our reunion.",5,2019,08,01
148,weekend away,"Hotel was lovely and very clean, staff were all friendly and very helpful. Had drinks on the roof top bar which was really nice. Didn't need to booked for the bar as we were staying in the hotel and the views were great",4,2019,07,31
148,Not 5 stars,"Wish I had gone to the Corinthia, which is a true five star hotel. This is nowhere near that. Lacks polish and professionality.

Pros:
- Great location
- No trouble with noise though next to a busy street and I was on the 1st floor
- Staff, though young and not always competent, are smiling and friendly. When I told them about some issues I was having, they apologised which was nice (but they didnt fix the issues)

Cons:
- Breakfast buffet is really lacking in choice and quality. The croissants look like long life ones from Lidl, there is no honey or granola, weird things like a small frittata, a quiche (but no pain au chocolat!) and only cocoa puffs, cornflakes or branflakes for cereal. The cooked breakfast was not cooked - the sausages were not brown, the bacon was underdone and the scrambled eggs looked antique. Very surprised at how poor this is considering it is supposed to be 5 stars. On the several mornings I ate there, there was hardly anybody else there, unsurprising.
- Decor - dark, dingy halls with dirty carpets that need a good hoover, and small bedrooms with padded white walls that make you feel like you're in a padded cell! Bathroom is small and inside a sort of 'closet' with sliding doors. The shower is really annoying - you have either a rainshower which I couldn't use on the days I didn't want to also wash my hair (the boxes they provide saying there is a shower cap, is entirely without any shower cap). The hairdryer is stored in the bathroom where there is a mirror but no plug for it, so you have to blow dry your hair in the main room where there is a plug but no mirror. To do your makeup there is a tiny cosmetic mirror but no shelf at the appropriate height to put it, without leaning right over the sink, so when I hear 'design hotel' I think it must mean 'pretentious' because they certainly were not thinking about functionality. Nowhere to store your suitcase except inside the wardrobe meaning any long items you want to hang get crushed.
Hygiene - The toilet was dirty when I got in, and the toiletries had been already used by a previous guest. When I pointed this out, the staff immediately sent staff to clean the room though I asked them to wait till I had left for the day, so I couldn't finish getting ready. And though they cleaned the toilet, they left the half used toiletries behind. Sorry, but I don't want to use mouthwash someone else has swigged from! I appreciate the cava and strawberries they left with a note in my room to apologise, but they didn;t actually fix the issues. (And I am severely allergic to strawberries so those gave me a good giggle)
- Phone was not working in my room. I could make a call and hear the other person but they couldnt hear me. I asked them to fix it, and someone definitely had a look, but it still wasn't working when I tried it again the next night - better but it kept cutting out. So annoying!
- Room service menu is very small and they bring your order without any covers on it at all and no standard things that come with it like bread and butter with your main. For that matter there were no starters just a few medium dishes. Couldnt get a bowl of soup for example, something simple. Quality of the food was poor, a burrata and fattouche salad was iceberg lettuce drowned in pesto with a ton of cucumber and two tiny pieces of burrata.

My last issue is when I looked through the other reviews before writing this one, I could see the manager just copy pastes a standard response, thank you, sorry, we will review your comments. Yet some of the issues I raise here have been raised by other guests as well- so clearly nothing is changing soon.",3,2019,07,31
148,Not the best of starts,"Me and my two sisters stayed here a few weeks back for one of my sisters 30th birthday. It was our first time staying at this hotel and we had traveled from Dubai so we were really looking forward to staying in London. 
As we entered the hotel we had a lovely welcome from ground floor staff and they told us where we needed to go to find reception. 
As soon as we got to reception we were greeted by a member of staff who wanted to help us check in and unfortunately this is where it all went down hill. 
Even though it says in the email once you have booked a room you need the card you used to pay for the room for check in I did forget to bring that card as I changed banks and I told that member of staff that Im sorry I have forgotten my card. This member of staff thought he would like to remind me more than 3 times that this is hotel policy and im going to have to take the same amount out of another card etc. And as he is telling us all this over and over again and he was giving us attitude, speaking to us in an unprofessional manner and I found myself shaking as I was so upset with how we were treated I had to let my sister talk to him. We were there to celebrate and we ended up having the worst start to our vacation. We had asked for the manager and he said I am the manager and we were in complete shock once we heard this. We thought if this is how the manager is then what are the other staff going to be like throughout our stay. As I work in a customer service company we strongly believe to never make the customer feel as if they are in the wrong but in this case we were made sure that we knew we were in the wrong and it was all our fault. (yes I did forget the card but there wasn't anything I could do and I did apologize a few times) He completely forgot about customer service, we completely felt unwelcome and we even said this to him and he said this has nothing to do with customer service. And once again he answered us back. (Something was telling me, would he have spoken to us this way to someone older than us, he wasn't taking us seriously) 
After a very long argument he finally came up with a solution for us (which should have been done at the beginning of the conversation) so once that was sorted we went out for the day until our room was ready. 
Thankfully once we returned to the hotel to get to our room we had a lovely man from the Aura group who showed us to our suite and he honestly turned our frowns upside down, his service was amazing. So friendly and well spoken, he kept making us laugh and he showed us around our suite which was a really nice touch. 
We booked the Chic Suite, it was incredible and perfect for 3 people as we ordered an extra bed. You could change the lighting in the room, you can listen to your own music connecting to the Bluetooth in the room and we also booked a little 30th birthday surprise which is in the room as we entered. Even though I booked the package with sweets, champagne, popcorn and a message on the mirror we actually got 30th balloons a cake and champagne which was even better from what I originally ordered. 
The beds were so comfy and we loved all the messages that were written in the bathroom, so unique. 
From our surprise as we had such a terrible welcoming to begin with, every other staff members were amazing they all smiled at us and they helped us with any of our questions, they were great. 
We also received free drinks at the rooftop bar as we were staying at the hotel. The rooftop bar was fantastic, such a great view, lovely staff and yummy cocktails. 
We did happen to see the Manager again and he was a completely different person, he did apologize about his service which we then said was ok but really it did leave us with a bad impression with the hotel and it didn't really need to happen. 
Even with what had happened we really did enjoy our two day stay with ME London and we would go back again (with the right card) and I do recommend it. 
Also there was champagne in the reception area which i am thinking was welcome drinks, which we saw people have and we didn't get any unfortunately.",4,2019,07,31
148,Lovely hotel with over complicated tv/audio system,"As soon as you walk in to this hotel it has the WOW factor. Our bags were taken from us by the friendly concierge team and were told how to get to reception. I didnt get his name but whilst in reception we were offered complimentary champagne and was given Birthday wishes as it was our 30th Birthday celebrations. 
The room was lovely. We had two rooms which were interconnecting as there was 5 of us and there was plently of room for us all. We had complimentary champagne, cheesecake and balloons in our room with a cute message above the TV from the Aura team.
The beds are HUGE and very comfy. I didnt bring phone speakers as I knew there was a sound system in the rooms but oh my goodness it was so confusing. In the end we gave up as we had already connected it 5 times and it kept disconnecting. We couldnt even figure out the over complicated TV and its not like we are of the older generation who dont know how to use technology (no offence).
Shout out to Adalina. I thought we didn't have slippers in one of our rooms and she was so friendly and happy to show me that they were there but were in a different place to the other room. 

We went up to the roof bar for one drink, quite pricey but you are in London. We had Magic Mike Show booked at the Hippodrome Casino which was only a short walk from the Hotel.

I have left one star off because of the over complicated tech system and also upon leaving we were taking photos next to the flowers by the entrance. There was a member of the concierge team standing outside who I tried to grab attention from so we could get a group photo before leaving. He was avoiding any eye contact and also was ignoring my 'excuse me's' to get his attention. Maybe he just didnt hear me but I felt like eventually when I did get his attention he was not willing to help and didnt want to be there. Its a shame as all the other staff members were great.",4,2019,07,30
148,Really Beautiful hotel & modern.,"We had a 2 night mid week break as we planned to see a show one of the nights.
The hotel is very modern and the decor is beautiful, all the staff that we met were polite and courteous.
We had one of the top rooms overlooking the city with a terrace which was perfect. Upon entering our room we had a personal message and bubbly left for us as it was booked originally for our Anniversary, there was an option to pay for these extras but i never got round to organising it so a big 'thank you' to Adrianna for making our stay memorable by leaving a message for us on the mirror, bubbly and a strawberry sweet selection it really made our day.
As the hotel offers so many options to help make your stay we took advantage and pre booked the Radio rooftop bar for lunch and STK for dinner on our last day/night 
I would 100% stay here again, location was brillant as we were seeing a show on our first night and the theatre was literally opposite.
Highly recommend",5,2019,07,29
148,"Calm, discreet, luxurious and great service","My daughter booked us a night at the ME in London for my birthday and it exceeded my expectations. She booked us the room with balcony which was very nice. The room was very well designed and even though the room wasn't large it felt very spacious because of the way they have set it up and the play with large mirrors, use of sliding doors etc. The beds were very comfortable and there were both UK and EU plugs next to the bed. Very comfortable bathroom with double sinks and a luxury assortment of bathroom products. Next to the bed you handle the light, the airco and the mood-lights with one touch on an electronic pad which is very handy. I feel that whomever designed the rooms did it with the frequent traveller in mind, I feel this sometimes is overlooked hotel designs. It can all look pretty and flashy but it's the opposite of practical if you travel a lot. Little details like the availability of a mini toothbrush and toothpaste in case you might have forgotten it is very smart and highly appreciated. The hotel interior is sleek and sophisticated and oozes discretion. Staff is exceptional helpful and very discreet. The room was peaceful and quiet although we were right under the radio bar, which had worried me when we first arrived. The location is perfect, central London, with Covent Garden around the corner and The Strand on its doorstep. During the check out process my daughter mentioned that we had stayed there for my birthday and promptly the receptionist went and got me a nice bottle of their ME perfume as a birthday gift which was very attentive and generous. We had a late night snack and asked to make us something that was not on the card which they did without discussion.The presentation of the tray was exquisite and the food was delicious. In the morning we had ordered breakfast on our balcony and again everything was perfect. Even for someone who has grown quite critical judging hotels, I can find nothing to fault. Perfection from beginning to end. If I can make one suggestion, it would be a nice idea for the rooms with a balcony to have the availability of a throw or a small blanket that you could use while sitting on the balcony on colder days or evenings. Well done ME, you're my favourite hotel in London now!",5,2019,07,28
148,Average hotel in good location,"If you stay here you should be aware that the hotel star system is based on the number of facilities a hotel  has to offer. It does not necessarily mean the quality and service is 5 star. It is in a great location, right by Covent Garden in the heart of theatre land ",3,2019,07,27
148,"Young, clean vibe - exceeded expectations","I stayed at ME London on business last night. I arrived early yesterday and London was hot 29 degrees. The hotel staff, in particular Oleg, were able to check me in early and look after the luggage and check in experience efficiently. We made drinks and breakfast reservations and nothing was a problem. The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel has a very modern and young vibe and might not suit all preferences, but that‚Äôs no criticism. We loved the modern decor, modern clean vibe and the Radio Roof Bar is superb. We had cocktails on the deck, later gins and then had breakfast today. That‚Äôs not to say that the hotel doesn‚Äôt have plenty of other options. The rooms were spotlessly clean, comfortable and are very modern. Work meetings were all in the legal district, so ME is perfect for that. No more than 5 minutes walk to where we needed to be. The checkout, again with Oleg was a pleasure and efficient. We had some fussy requests and nothing was an issue. I will definitely be back and I guess quite soon. If you want fun and a young clean vibe, ME is the place to be.",5,2019,07,25
148,great hotel,my wife and I stayed at ME hotel for our anniversary. we were looked after and felt spoilt but all members of staff from the moment we arrived. would highly recommend staying at this hotel if you are in the west end.  so convenient if you are going to see a show or shopping. ,5,2019,07,24
148,Great hotel in an amazing location!  You won‚Äôt be disappointed!,"Stayed here with my family this week and I was so happy with our choice to stay at this hotel!  It is situated minutes from Covent Garden district with tons of restaurants and shopping and it felt extremely safe.  Then in the other direction a 5 minute walk past Sommerset House takes you to the bridge over to Southbank Centre and The London Eye. The Stand also has tons of coffee shops, restaurants and shops and leads to Trafalgar Square. It was the perfect location.  We stayed in 2 interconnecting Vibe rooms and it was plenty of room, nice bathrooms, big rooms.  Their reception area is the coolest I‚Äôve ever seen and I travel a lot.  If you can book it, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.",5,2019,07,22
148,Fabulous modern hotel,Had the best time for my birthday. Everything was lovely. The rooftop bar with amazing views was a great place to drink and eat. Cocktails by Martin were amazing. Rooms clean and modern with the best pillows.,5,2019,07,21
148,Lovely as always!,"Love this hotel.  Modern, spotless, wonderful ambiance throughout.  Staff can‚Äôt do enough for you.  We always get a wonderful nights sleep and enjoy the small details such as turn down service.
Expensive, but worth it.",5,2019,07,19
148,Couldn‚Äôt recommend more ,"My boyfriend surprised me with a night stay here with dinner booked at the hotels restaurant STK and rooftop drinks after. It was one of the best hotels we‚Äôve stayed in!

Right from walking in, the staff were polite and friendly. Our bags were taken on arrival and delivered to our room later. Reception is on the first floor and is stunning, with a beautiful . We were then greeted with a glass of Cava each whilst checking in. 

Our room was lovely, nice and clean and a big bed. We happened to mention to the receptionist that we were visiting on our 6 year anniversary and after about 30 mins of being in our room, we had a complimentary bottle and strawberries delivered and a hand written card wishing us a happy anniversary! The simple things like this gesture are what will be remembered. 

We also had room service delivered for breakfast; which was just unreal. The food was delicious and if only I could have that every morning! 

We had a lovely stay, and will definitely be back!  ",5,2019,07,19
148,TASTY AFTERNOON TEA,"I enjoyed the tea but the service was not uniform by the team that served our table of 3. I asked one female server for more hot water for the tea pot and she never returned, I asked a male and he came back with one lot of hot water I pointed out that my teapot must have had a hole in the strainer as the leaves were appearing in my cup, nothing was done about that. The views from the rooftop restauurant/bar are amazing. One customer asked for the sliding roof to be pulled back but as it was a very hot day our afternoon tea was in danger of melting or or wilting in the hot sun, our request to put it back over was answered.",4,2019,07,19
148,An excellent night . whatever you're after,"One of the best nights' sleep I've ever had in a hotel.  A super restful space, welcomed by soothing music and chilled lighting.  There's activity downstairs for those looking for nightlife, and of course the location is excellent for the best that London has to offer.",5,2019,07,19
148,Great Location ,"Perfectly located right by Theatre district and short walk to Covent Garden and Soho area. Also, right by Waterloo Bridge and walking path along Thames River. Lots of pubs and restaurants near by to walk to. Lovely decorated. Roof top bar is very happening place with wonderful views. If you are staying at the hotel make sure you tell them because some tables say reserved, but they are available for hotel guests. House keeping did a great job in cleaning the rooms every day. Highly recommend this hotel and this area for a stay in London. 
",5,2019,07,18
148,Could have been so much better,"Great location, fabulous decor and style. Rooms lacked any element of luxury. Had complimentary upgrade to suite but was totally underwhelmed. 
Breakfast was mediocre at best, some staff rude but others very polished and professional. Drinks and parking extortionate but hey that‚Äôs London!! ",3,2019,07,17
148,Amazing,A lovely and amazing modern hotel. With a central location walkable to arts culture food and sightseeing. Great rooms with amazing views of london. Had the best weekend in london. Highly recommended with a great rooftop.,5,2019,07,17
148,very stylish hotel,"Very modern and stylish hotel, stunning reception on the 1st floor.  The breakfast in the Zela restaurant was buffet and was not 5 star standard as we would have expected. We had  a few problems here ie we were expected to pay for our breakfast extras eg. poached eggs, pancakes or anything cooked fresh in the kitchen, but this was resolved by Renata the assistant Aura manager to our satisfaction. Our room was very bright and spacious, quiet and spotlessly clean. The staff were very helpful and friendly from Albert who brought our cases to the room to the Managers and Bar staff. The STK restaurant was nice but more of a niteclub than eatery. The Rooftop Bar was very expensive for drinks (¬£17 for G&T plus 12.5% service charge). We would highly recommend this hotel for its location right in the middle of Covent Garden within walking distance of lots of pubs and restaurants.",4,2019,07,17
148,"Sensational Hotel, Rooftop bar and Steak Restaurant","We stayed here for a one night stay.
Wow!
The staff, rooftop bar and steak restaurant were simply amazing. 
The one bedroom apartment was sensational. 
Very pricey but recommend as a super special treat.
This will probably be one of the best places you likely to stay in your life. 
It‚Äôs Amazing!!",5,2019,07,16
148,Great Stay,"I am a corporate client, and have stayed at this particular property often. The service is great, the location in my specific case couldnt be better as my office is 5 blocks from the hotel. Highly recommend the hotel!",5,2019,07,15
148,Modern hotel yet comfortable to come back to after a long day,"Beautiful, modern hotel with a balance of dark (hallways and elevators) and light (lobby and rooms).  The room was very clean and roomy with everything we needed.  Large bathroom and comfortable beds.  I loved the rooftop bar for breakfast in the morning.  Their coffee is fantastic and the views were amazing.  The location is perfect with many of the attractions that I wanted to see within walking distance.  Emiliano, the concierge was extremely professional,  helpful and friendly.  He booked last minute tickets for me to several sites.  I especially loved coming back to the hotel and being greeted by Antonio,  the friendly bellhop with an amazing smile who always asked me about my day.  The ME is successful in blending a modern, trendy atmosphere with a friendly, warm one...which can be difficult to do.",5,2019,07,11
148,Awesome hotel,"Everything was great, the place is beautiful, incredibly well located, had a great time. We loved it and we will definitively go back when possible. The food was great, excellent attention. You have great shopping, two blocks from Covent garden. Beautiful.",5,2019,07,11
148,All that glitters is not gold,"If you‚Äôre looking for a ‚Äútrendy‚Äù hotel ready for a night clubbing in the West End, then this place (at a hefty price!) is probably just right for you. 

The gloomy, dimly lit corridors, the dance music in the lobbies and lifts (morning, noon and night), and the partygoers making their way to their rooms at all hours do not make for a restful stay. 

The bedrooms are large and peaceful enough, but for business travellers, do yourself a favour and choose a less stressful option. This hotel is a serious case of style over substance. 

The WiFi is so slow as to be unusable. Even trying to answer emails was a chore let alone attempting to stream video. The need for instructions to operate the bedroom lighting, coffee machine, and (absent) media hub (whatever that is) tells you all you should need to know. None of these should need instructions! 

Music is everywhere!! Even your bedroom forces ambient club music on you when returning from a long day at work.

On the plus side, the hotel does at least seem spotlessly clean - but at in or around ¬£450 a night, you‚Äôd hope so.

I‚Äôll never return. There are far classier options without the need for a degree in bedroom operation at a far more reasonable price nearby. ",3,2019,07,10
148,The stuff that recurring nightmares are made of ...,"Black sloping walls, triangular corridors, barely any light and no chance of finding your way back to your floor once you‚Äôve left it.  Elevators packed with rude drunk 20-somethings over-ride your floor selection, keeping you stuck in limbo between the techno-booming rooftop bar and the street level, with no alternative way out and no access to stairs. Eventually after riding up and down repeatedly missing your floor and conclusively failing the escape-room test, you have a panic attack and a member of the security team blithely confirms that ‚Äúit‚Äôs a known issue‚Äù and offers to escort you back to your room which you dare not leave again. 

The room itself was surprisingly quiet; the decor interesting if somewhat dated - white leather walls, mirrors and glass and no USB outlets. We paid for a roof deck that was huge but sparsely furnished and could have used a fake boxwood or three to brighten it up. The California king bed was actually two singles stuck together so one of us ended up sleeping on the join if we wanted to snuggle (we are newlyweds after all). The huge sloping bathtub was the highlight of the stay, although we were informed on check-in that there was only one room of the type we‚Äôd selected that had one, so perhaps these are being phased out.

The biggest disappointment was the restaurant; while the reviews - and views - were stunning, we found the food to be greasy, unseasoned and overpriced, the service inattentive and slow and the techno soundtrack migraine-inducing after only 5 minutes. At the end of the day, Meli√° needs to decide whether they want this property to be a hotel or a nightclub and stop trying to be both. And for God‚Äôs sake sort out those elevators.",3,2019,07,10
148,Total support,ME excelled themselves to give my son in law a lovely time to celebrate his 40 birthday. I used my frequent stay points to book his room and breakfast for him and his wife.Total hotel service at its best,5,2019,07,10
148,KR,Very clean and spacious rooms. Beautiful hotel. The service is really good. My daughter loved that she could listen to her music through Bluetooth. Bathroom very clean and both bath and shower. Very luxurious hotel. ,5,2019,07,09
148,Fantastic stay at the ME Hotel in London,"My husband and I recently stayed at the ME London as a birthday surprise. I would like to thank Adriana Rossello and the rest of the Aura team for making it such an excellent sexperience. The champagne, cheesecake and lovely balloons were a wonderful surprise. The room was high standard, with a huge bed and the balcony was a great addition, particularly given the wonderful weather we had.
 
We also had breakfast at the rooftop bar. The food was excellent and served in great surrounding with a fantastic view over London. The reception and concierge staff were very helpful and attentive and we were given a glass of Prosecco whilst checking in. The overall design of the hotel is very trendy and it is perfectly located, being literally 2 minutes walk to Covent Garden. I have stayed in hotels all over the world for business and personal holidays and I would rate the as one of my best experiences in 30 years of travelling!",5,2019,07,09
148,Wow,"This was our first stay at ME and we were blew away by it. We arrived a lot earlier than our check in time to put our bags in and to our surprise we could actually check in. We were took to our room and shown how to use the various functions etc.
our room had a terrace with views of Covent garden which was brilliant.
When we came back to the room late afternoon the hotel staff had left us a bottle of champagne and some cheesecake as we were celebrating whilst there which was brilliant.
Breakfast on the Rooftop bar was delicious we had the full english and eggs benedict.
Literally couldnt find a fault with this hotel and we will definitely be back!!",5,2019,07,08
148,The best,"This is the best Hotel to stay in London if you want a cool and trendy hotel near Trafalgar Square and Convent Garden. The staff is extremely warm, the room and bathroom are very good. The hotel has 2 of the most coolest places in London: The STK Restaurant and Radio Rooftop, a must go in London on summer times!!!",5,2019,07,07

I would like to thanks to Jessi who was very friendly and professional providing a good service. Having this kind of service, my day will be continuing fine and positively.

We will come back for sure.!!!",5,2019,07,05
148,"Excellent concierge, over-the-top modernity","Booked stay via Costco Travel. Beautiful room, very well situated hotel (walking distance to British Museum, in theatre district, good restaurants, etc.). One major plus was the concierge staff who recommended excellent dining choices that failed to disappoint. The building itself is very modern, very dark ... almost ominously dark ... but with strategic lighting so that directions were easy to find. Breakfast offered by the hotel was generally very good but did have terrible service on one day of our stay.",5,2019,07,04
148,Weekend break,"Great location, lovely rooms just a shame about breakfast! Really let it down for us. Very little choice, very little fruit, ok if you want a continental breakfast and that‚Äôs about it. No egg menu available. Wasn‚Äôt busy either so can‚Äôt use that excuse. Real shame!",3,2019,07,03
148,Good hotel stay,ME is comfortable with great service and comfortable rooms. Breakfast is great. I really liked their English breakfast.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  I enjoyed the stay and recommend this hotel. ,5,2019,07,01
148,Superb at every level,"The only place in London to celebrate my 10th wedding Anniversary, location, staff , rooms and the very classy  Roof top bar. We had a room on the 8th floor with a  view over the River Thames. We could not fault the ME and would highly recommend it. ",5,2019,07,01

I have never had such ease of booking reservations with attention to detail and incredible communication and you have gone above and beyond.",5,2019,06,28
148,New Modern Hotel in London,London has plenty of Hotels but only a few are new and modern.  I usually don't stay at old hotels and ME London was perfect for us.  The location is very good as its location is not very busy compared to Trafalgar Square or Picadilly areas.  The hotel is near Covent Garden where a lot of shops and restaurants are located.  Service is good and the rooms are bigger than most hotel in London.,5,2019,06,25
148,What a place!,"A brilliant place to stay, close to EVERYTHING! lovely room and a view to die for
roof top bar is just fab and all the staff were so very friendly and helpful

thankyou, will return as soon as possible",5,2019,06,24
148,World's most uncomfortable 5-star hotel,"The hotel is designed for people under 30. No one older than that should stay there. Our room had a beautiful view of London, worth a lot, but the rest was a disaster. The bed was almost on the floor. The toilet flush didn't work properly. We could never control the heat and fan in spite of several visits by staff. We got hot and we got cold, and eventually we got sick. There is nowhere to hang a coat or a suit. There is no armchair, only a hard work chair, and the bed on the floor. There are noisy concerts on Saturdays and Sundays that could not be shut out of our room, making it impossible to work and think. The electronics were incomprehensible, even after visits by helpful staff. The heavy rock in the elevators was enough to cause serious mental illness. This hotel is expensive, way too expensive for what you get. And surely the women in the lobby at night and weekends, who wore so little, and who were taking pics of each other, were not what they appeared to be?

",1,2019,06,21
148,Exquisite,Everything was incredible. The team made us feel like celebrities. What a beautiful hotel; the art work and installations are remarkable. The radio rooftop bar had some delicious and unique cocktails. The view from the room was stunning! Thank you so much for the whole weekend! ,5,2019,06,21
148,"Expensive, but worth it","Fab room with balcony and great view towards the river. Lovely breakfast. Exceptionally stylish hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. Fantastic location on The Strand, but  room very quiet. My husband's birthday so room was decorated with balloons, and we were provided with a mini cheesecake and champagne!!! How's that for customer service. Thanks again ME Hotel - you went the extra mile!",5,2019,06,19
148,What a terrible disappointment!,"Paid a fortune to stay at this hotel. 
No information given regarding restaurants or their whereabouts. 
Couldn‚Äôt get into the roof top bar before dinner so we had to have drinks where we were eating dinner. 
Service in Zela restaurant was appalling. 
Waited so long for food and drinks. 
Breakfast was freezing cold on both mornings. 
First morning my daughter waited over an hour for gluten free bread to be heated up ... so waisted most of our morning. 
We were also not informed to use the room key in the lift ... so had an embarrassing situation with another angry guest. 
Really not happy with the compensation we have been offered either as after eating breakfast on both mornings I was terribly ill. 
I am never usually Ill when staying away from home. 
The breakfast was stone cold. 
Scrambled egg was rock hard. 
We will not be returning. ",2,2019,06,18
148,2nd stay is a charm,"A fam of the ME brand and a previous guest to this specific property, I‚Äôd opted to stay here again, following a great experience the previous year- and what a good decision it was.

The facility is chic, centrally-located, rooms are spacious and if you go for the top floor balcony rooms, London will be at your feet, literally, it‚Äôs magical.

Breakfast on the rooftop was a nice start to each day; it‚Äôs delicious, quiet, social and the river views are a great way to remind yourself you are in one of the greatest European cities.

Special thanks to the team who remembered my birthday and sent champagne and cakes (twice!) to my room and to Ante, who made the reservation process smooth and easy. 

I‚Äôll be back!",5,2019,06,18
148,Amazing trip as always-best place to stay in london,"This was my second stay at this hotel and it was amazing as always it‚Äôs very posh and trendy and the service is impeccable everyone is extremely friendly and super cool. All of the restaurants including STK, ZELA, and the rooftop radio bar are absolutely amazing with a great atmosphere great drinks and food all of the stuff was truly amazing. Antonio was Especially friendly and helped us so much upon check-in for my birthday they wrote a message on the mirror for me left us a champagne bottle with a cheesecake we literally jumped for joy upon entering our room wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer. This will definitely be my go to hotel in London worth every penny and more! We had an energy urban room with a city facing balcony and was truly beautiful.  Please do not hesitate to say this hotel in London can be a very expensive place to stay paying the extra penny to stay here is definitely worth it you can literally eat sleep and play all in one place. And the neighborhood around is amazing as well Covent Garden is right around the corner as Westminster and the city of London with two tube lines just a couple of blocks away as well.",5,2019,06,18
148,Perfect hotel for visiting London,"This was our second stay at the ME London and everything was perfect. Very friendly staff, room was great and comfortable and clean. Exceptinal service, excellent breakfast. We were celebrating my daughters 25th birthay and everything was super. We really can recommend the ME London and we will definitely come back!",5,2019,06,17
148,Enjoyable stay,Hotel and staff were great. Very trendy decor. Room was great and clean and comfortable. Even the housekeeping staff were great. Restaurants are pricey and serving staff and drinks at the rooftop bar were a two thumbs down. Stk was great. Music and atmosphere and food were all on point. But it is pricey! Which is inline with their other locations I suppose. Overall a great hotel and near many of the tourist attractions. ,5,2019,06,14
148,TOP Service and TOP TEAM,"Words cannot really describe the experience we had! We were celebrating my cousin‚Äôs hen do, and everything was simply perfect!!

Sergio the Revenue Manager assisted me since day 1 with the booking process and I would never thank him enough for his help.

Alessandro,Andrea and Laura at the Reception welcomed us ( with 4 glasses of Prosecco whilst we were waiting for our rooms) and made us feel home, you guys are the best and so he was the Front Office Manager Marco who gave us wonderful rooms and helped us with everything we needed!!! Thanks a mil, Marco!!! For sure he knows what he is doing and he nailed it :)))

Special thanks to the Aura Team for setting up the rooms! We loved the mirror message!

Leandro, Arman and Emiliano were super nice, despite the busy day, they were always smiling and giving us suggestions.

ME really loves you!!! We will cherish nothing, but wonderful memories.

We will definitely come back. 

",5,2019,06,13
148,Perfect location,"Spacious, modern room Exceptional service, particularly concierge - they helped book restaurants and tickets to theatre and art exhibitions. The location is ideal - Covent Garden is a great neighborhood - food, shopping, Royal Opera House. Access to transit is great. Easy walk across Waterloo bridge to Tate Modern and more. ",5,2019,06,13
148,When you forget something..,"You will get an excellent service! I forgot my glasses in the room when I checked out and called the hotel as soon I came home. The staff was really understanding. The hotel is so beautiful, I would recommend it to everyone who is traveling to London. You can just walk out and you are direct in the city. Not far away from big landmarks, e.g. the London Eye.",5,2019,06,12
148,Lovely and Great Location,"Very contemporary property with wonderful staff. The location could not be better for either walking, cabbing or using Uber. We had a room with a balcony and a terrific view and on a Sunday morning especially enjoyed listening to the bells ring out over the city. The room itself is very comfortable and loved that shower! The hallways are meant to be trendy but resemble a bat cave- VERY dark. The only drawback is that come about ten a.m. in the morning, the housekeeping staff begin banging the doors which are very heavy and very loud. The rooftop bar is nice and the food is surprisingly good; it is also apparently a destination to see and be seen, drawing an amusing crowd at times. ‚ÄúZela‚Äù serves a peaceful Spanish-style breakfast that we enjoyed very much as well as a fun happy hour. Great bartender! Again, the staff is exceptional. ",5,2019,06,11
148,RETRO HOTEL,"Wow!  This hotel was beautiful!  The check-in area was stunning with the reflective ceiling glass and holograms!  Hotel staff was so friendly and accommodating!  This hotel has a very retro vibe and is dimly lit!  Loved the beautiful art in the lobby and the granite walls throughout!  The rooms are amazing!  Visited the Radio Rooftop Bar for a drink which was fabulous overlooking London!  Need to book a table ahead of time as it was very crowded, but lively!  This is where all the ""beautiful people"" hang out!  LOL  We are in our 50's & 60's so felt a little out of place!  The Zela restaurant served a great English breakfast as well as to-order meals.  We enjoyed our stay at this hotel is it was central to iconic sites in London.  Within walking distance to Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Downing Street, the Parliament Buildings, Buckingham Palace, Churchill Museum, etc.  Along they way you can enjoy a multitude of Pubs!",5,2019,06,10

148,Helpful Staff,Fantastic hotel with very friendly staff. There was a problem with our booking when we checked in yesterday (8 June) and Alex on reception was very helpful in sorting out a room for us. Very comfortable room and highly recommend the roof top bar.,5,2019,06,09
148,Overnight stay,"Great location. Room was great, stayed in the urban with a balcony, which was a proper balcony.
Staff were extremely friendly wherever we were in the hotel.
Roof top bar well worth the visit - views great.",5,2019,06,08
148,FIRST CLASS HOTEL,"Myself and my husband had the pleasure of staying here for our first wedding anniversary. It was a last minute one night trip to London and as such we didn‚Äôt give the hotel much time before we arrived.
This however was no problem (as is nothing for the staff in this hotel) Edward on reception worked everything out for us whilst we enjoyed a complimentary cava. When it came to check in, knowing it was our anniversary, Edward upgraded us to room with a balcony and an amazing view of the city! Whilst we went out for dinner at STK later on, he arranged for a cake and champagne to be left in our room for our return. Honestly I was blown away by this customer service!
The hotel itself is stunning (including the fabulous rooftop bar) and cannot be faulted in any way. We will not be staying anywhere else now when we visit London.
Well done!",5,2019,06,07
148,Great place to stay..,Wonderful hotel in a great location. Roof top bar/restaurant is second to none..A great staff that takes pride in their work and it truly comes across. If it works it's right and if it's right it will work..The ME London works..Looking forward to our next stay one day..,5,2019,06,07
148,Average stay,"Great location and staff! Food here st Stk was not pleasant and the rooms were not that clean. The washrooms has mold - not the best - the sink had mold around it as well. Very poor cleaning! The staff was wonderful, the rooftop bar was amazing and staff as well. The location is perfect",3,2019,06,06
148,Very nice,"The service was excellent and the location of the hotel was centrally located. Even though the hotel was large, it still felt like a small boutique hotel, which I like. All the staff were very accommodating. ",5,2019,06,06
148,Me London,I was  traded  Very well here the best place in London the  Service  Was top notch I highly recommended this place every one knows you by name any thing that you need they go out of there way too do for you,5,2019,06,04
148,Fabulous dining  experience,"We visited STK Covent Garden to celebrate my sons 21st birthday. Chic funky restaurant, beautifully decorated. Loved the round tables and couches, all very sociable. We had a special lunch deal of ¬£30 for 3 courses and a cocktail which was an absolute bargain as there was so much food all of which was delicious. The watermelon cocktail was amazing too, honestly couldn't fault the place, loved it all. I also left behind my sunglasses which they duly sent me a day later and also paid for the postage which I was very impressed by. Would most definitely recommend visiting and I will definitely be returning.",5,2019,06,04
148,LONDON WEST END VISIT,"A second stay at the hotel this year and both were excellent. A delay in having a room available was dealt with professionally, free drinks in the roof-top bar were organised, and Alex personally delivered the keys to us. service throughout was excellent.",5,2019,06,04
148,Classy Spot in the Perfect Location,"For a first timers trip to London, this place had some serious vibes on arrival. Felt like it was the perfect place to park up for 3 nights to begin our Europe trip. The lobby of this place really made for a fantastic first impression which really got the excitement levels high.

The room we were allocated was on a higher floor we were told, we thought great, it must have a half decent view. Unfortunately due to the window placement, there wasn't much to speak of which was a let down. The room itself though was bright, airy and very well appointed. However smaller than you'd expect considering the price you pay.

The highlight of the hotel though was the rooftop bar which we took advantage of in the morning during the breakfast offering which we thought was outstanding. Fantastic views of London to start your day, eating outdoors is underrated!

The main downfall was the price, 15 pounds for a Makers Mark and Coke in the lobby bar was absolutely outrageous. I expected it to be pricey but jesus, that added up very fast! Despite that, would definitely recommend this place, providing your pockets are deep.",4,2019,06,03
148,An amazing experience,"It is worth staying here, even if just for the night! The building is amazing, a pyramid in the centre which goes the full height of the building and has reception in it! The rooms are around the pyramid. We stayed in a passion suite which was fabulous, it had everything you could want, a huge bath with candles, a comfy bed, good storage and a real luxurious feel. Lots of little treats were left in our room too! Our daughter loved the popcorn maker and there were so many little touches that made our visit special! There were several floor length windows in our suite and watching the London buses and the busy traffic was strangely captivating. The roof top bar is a must visit, the view is absolutely stunning you can see for miles and can see then shard, the London eye and lots lots more! The location is great lots of theatres nearby and tons of bars and restaurants, you are an easy walk to the river and it isn‚Äôt not far to Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden.",5,2019,06,03
148,ME Blown Away!!,"....from the minute we walked in, until we quite literally blew out!
Recently visited and loved the ME rooftop bars in Ibiza and Barcelona so decided to give our usual London hotel a miss and celebrate my daughters 21st here.
It was a complete surprise for her and me too, as I cannot thank the staff enough for making our stay so very special. The lobby is very chic, dark but airy at the same time, with the reception above akin to being in the centre of a pyramid, with a funnel of light beaming down and the walls cascaded in an array of lights. So not what I expected.
We were shown personally to our Vibe room by Adriana who enlightened us more on the design concept of the dark contrasting with the light in the rooms and she was right, our room was so bright and very spacious for the three of us. Birthday wishes and treats were left around the room and the massive 2 and 1 balloons were an amazing touch. (so many people must say its their birthday/anniversary when its not I felt like showing proof) Tissues all round, we headed up to the Rooftop bar where we had a reservation at a great table with brilliant view and spent a couple of hours being spoilt rotten once more by the fab staff.
Back to room 408 and 3 sets of robes and slippers - I love it when hotels take note of how many are staying - even here down to the glasses, 3 each of wine/tumbler/cocktail/champagne all proper glasses not the usual kind that look like someones had their teeth in!! Loads of towels and toiletries and a big bathroom area with ample room for us ladies to all get ready together, the mood lighting adding to the atmosphere we nearly stayed in!
We slept really well, massive king bed and a rollaway with lovely white duvets and pillows and no noise from hotel or street. 
Breakfast was included and served on the Rooftop. We arrived for 0830 and got another brill table, as the weather was great it soon filled up. Everything is done to order so we were told we could have anything and as much as we liked off the menu. We all opted for the full English which was fab, perfectly cooked and no grease, with juices, coffees and toast. The staff were all friendly and remembered us from the night before?? and seemed genuinely interested in what we had been up to. Adding to the relaxing breakfast was the fact we didn't have to check out til 12 so we could take our time and although they were busy the staff never once rushed us.
We truly enjoyed EVERY minute and credit ME and the team for an amazing stay, and when I said we were literally blown away those massive 2 and 1 balloons made it to St Pancras and home and are here as a reminder of the thoughtfulness and attention to detail that for not one second was lost on us!! x",5,2019,06,03
148,My favourite London Hotel,"This was an 80th birthday visit for my father and from start to finish it was amazing. I contacted the week before to ask if something could be done to mark the occassion and boy did the hotel deliver, especially Adriana from the Aura host team. It was absolutely brilliant from the moment we arrived. Nothing was too much trouble. Adriana welcomed us in reception and provided a lovely glass of champagne. She was friendly and attentive and showed us to our rooms. 
The birthday boy was thrilled to find his room festooned with balloons, champagne and a birthday cake with birthday messages on the mirror - all organised by Adriana. It was a fantastic room - bright and fresh with a lovely view. 
Breakfast every morning was served on the rooftop bar. It was amazing with so much to choice and  stunning views of Londons iconic buildings... what more could we have asked for. 
Adriana, you are a star - and we will definetely be returning to experience more of your wonderful hospitality. Thank you and the Aura team for making it so special x

148,Exceptional !!!,"The hotel is beautiful and rooms are amazing. But I was more impressed with the hotel staff. The tram was amazing and went up and beyond to make my stay a dream. Adriana Rossello has been probably the most helpful host I have ever met. She has so much love and passion for what she does and it reflects on the way she represents her brand. From a b-day cake to my wife, champagne, to directions and happy faces is what I experienced. Totally recommend and will be back again",5,2019,05,30
148,Vacation in London,"The hotel has very personable and attentive service throughout the hotel.  The rooms were large and very comfortable.  

The hotel is located in the theater district of the city and it was an easy walk to Trafalgar Square and other attractions and restaurants.",5,2019,05,30
148,Fantastic girls night away! ,"Went away for the night with my friend for my birthday and I‚Äôm so glad we chose this hotel part of what made the weekend so good! Accommodated early check in so we could get ready to go out. 

They decorated the room and made me feel so special for my birthday

Hotel decor and service was fantastic thanks to Antonio for taking us up to our room he was fab!

148,Me is ME,"If you want to know what would be like if you mix a High End Night Club and a 5 star Hotel together well wonder No more coz The ME London is just that a fusion of nightclub and hotel end result is Oh YEAH üòçüòéüòçüòéüòç.
You just gone have to Experience it for your selfs . Enjoy have Fun ....( tip to get The Best out of  ME Experience don‚Äôt think or treat like a hotel ).",5,2019,05,26
148,"Another lovely stay, just a tiny blip....","We stayed overnight for a concert. It was an early birthday present from my husband and we were treated to a bottle of fizz, a cheesecake to share, balloons and a birthday message on the mirror! Lovely touches to make the stay special. We have visited a few times previously and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. Breakfast is now served in the rooftop bar which is so much nicer than downstairs, where it was previously, with views over London and heaters to keep everyone comfortable. I was looking forward to the breakfast and it was very nice, my husband's was perfect, the only tiny blip was that my hollandaise sauce on my eggs florentine was very salty for my taste - my husband had a spoonful and agreed. I couldn't eat the sauce but the eggs were beautifully cooked and the rest of the meal was delicious. Service as always was faultless, and our server offered more to compensate. 
I saw the advertisement on the wall of the lobby showing the film 'deep meditation' and would love to have watched it had I known about it earlier - is there a link to your site that would allow me to view it at all?
We love your hotel, thanks to all staff for a great stay",5,2019,05,25
148,great place to stay,"I stayed at ME London for 3 nights. The room is spacious and clean, service is great, easy to check-in, and it has a great concierge with full services.

Location: It is at Covert Garden. Walking distance to many places around, like Piccadilly Circus, Soho, theaters, river side to see London Eye, Big Ben, etc. Convenient enough for dining (luxury or regular). 

Hotel facility: The rooftop bar is a must go. Even if you have no plan to eat or drink there, it is worth a try to take some photos and look at the view from there. 

I am from Canada and the room has 2 plugs for adaptor for Canada/US. Currently there is no USB plugs (something the hotel could think of adding:))

I have been to London so many times and stayed at different hotels every time. This hotel was on my list to stay at the very first time, but I did not try until this round. The price is in mid-range, comparing with other 5-star hotels nearby. Totally worth it. Should have stayed earlier:)",5,2019,05,24
148,1st Aniversary Break to London,"Hotel is superb!! They made us feel really special from the minute we checked in and went above and beyond to make our anniversary celebrations awesome. Location is great with everything in short walking distance, from eateries to the sights. I will most definitely return to this hotel when visiting London again.",5,2019,05,24
148,Beautiful Stay for a Work Event ,"Gorgeous from start to finish. Keeping in mind I hate STK the restaurant below the hotel which is affiliated I didn‚Äôt expect to like the hotel but as it was for business I luckily wasn‚Äôt paying so didn‚Äôt mind too much.

However they stay was wonderful, it has a lovely foyer downstairs with beautiful artwork which I believe they change frequently. Plenty of space to hang whilst you wait for taxi‚Äôs etc.

Up the lift to the main check in reception the space is incredible, light installations displayed on the incredible ceiling which is like being inside a pyramid it was the nicest entrance to a hotel I have ever seen. Staff offer some Prosecco upon arrival which is always a nice touch. 

Only downside is they require a ¬£100 deposit which they physically take from your card and it takes 5-7 business days to refund once you check out, mine took about 5 days to be returned which for some is quite a large amount to pay out for essentially nothing. My usual experience is a card is taken as a deposit in case they need to deduct for damages but this was taken in advance which was frustrating for one of my colleagues who unfortunately couldn‚Äôt really afford it at the time. 

Rooms - beautifully designed, extensive mini-bar, bass were absolutely huge you can easily fit 3 people in if you was that way inclined ;-) 

Bathrooms were beautiful, lots of marble and glass and very spacious. The toiletries were the best I have ever seen at a hotel and I‚Äôve stayed in places that have The White Company as standard. They had a HUGE bottle of facial cleanser which I am still using a month after my stay. 

The location is superb for anyone visiting the Westend Theatres, Covent Garden, Soho, Leicester Square or Piccadilly Circus all easily walkable. 10 min walk from Charing Cross Station. ",5,2019,05,23
148,Brilliant stay in London,"The hotel is excellent, the rooms are lovely,  staff are very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is in a great location walking distance to everything, would highly recommend drinks at the Radio bar the views are great üòä would 100% stay again. 

",5,2019,05,22
148,The very best!,"This hotel is without doubt the best in London. Service is amazing and quality is outstanding. I‚Äôve stayed in many London hotels but this one is our favourite. We tell everyone they must go and stay!

STK is amazing. The food is wow!  The rooftop bar is fantastic for cocktails and the views are lovely!

We stayed in in a suite which was beautiful. It was a birthday treat so it was such a lovely surprise to come back to the room to champagne and cake!!!

Concierge is outstanding. They treat you as VIPs and can‚Äôt do enough to make your stay special. 

We will be back again soon. ",5,2019,05,21
148,Amazing AND FABULOUS,"From check in to check out, our experience of ME London was fantastic.  We stayed in a Suite on the 6th floor.  The room was amazing with a view over London. We had some drinks on the roof terrace at lunch time and in the evening after dinner.  Breakfast was served on the roof terrace and was delicious.  The location is excellent and great for exploring Covent Garden and surrounding London.  We will definitely return.  A special thanks to the GM for looking after us.",5,2019,05,20
148,Fantastic,"Received a warm welcome by staff at reception. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable with a large terrace overlooking Covent Garden.

A modern and well appointed hotel with fantastic staff.

We ate at STK, which was superb. Concierge made our reservation and we were given an excellent table in the restaurant.

I absolutely recommend staying at this hotel.",5,2019,05,19
148,Me London Strand,"7 of us went to lunch on Friday.
The restaurant has amazing views. The layout of the restaurant is fabulous.
The staff are so professional, friendly and helpful. The food fabulous, delicious and very well presented.
We asked to meet the chef, Victor, all smiles even though you could see he was very busy, we asked him about a dish, how it was made, he made the time to talk to us which we thought was extremely nice of him.  Lovely man and so are the rest of the staff !!
Will deffinately be returning and recommending to others",5,2019,05,18
148,Great Hotel - Great Rooftop Bar ,We stayed here for a weekend break. Excellent location for Covent Garden or the Theatres and an excellent hotel. All of the staff were very attentive and the hotel in general was a pleasure to be in. The rooms were big (for central London) and very well equipped. As a resident we were able to get a table in Radio which is the rooftop bar which is a really good place to spend a few hours. My only gripe is that we had dinner in STK on Saturday evening and the music was at club levels!! I haven‚Äôt noticed it when I have been there before (or maybe I‚Äôm just old üòÇ) it is not cheap to eat and drink at the hotel but you feel like your custom is appreciated at all times.,5,2019,05,18
148,Modern and well situated,"We choose this hotel for the excellent situation and we enjoyed very much our stay.
Very modern good size rooms (lightning a little complicated) and very comfortable beds. Breakfast (we had it in the room) was perfect and arrived always on time.
Staff very friendly and efficient, concierge gave us excellent tips and a special thank to
Alvaro at the reception who was very helpful.
We'll come back",5,2019,05,18
148,Wife's birthday,"On arrival greeted with a glass of wine nice touch
Interior of foyer and reception area very modern and visually pleasing 
Staff very friendly and polite 
Roof top terrace for breakfast was fantastic especially being a sunny day with great views 
Definitely recommend",5,2019,05,15
148,Superb service,"This is our go to London hotel if we fancy a treat. 
It‚Äôs so well situated, within walking distance of Covent Garden, the Southbank and the shopping areas of Bond St & Oxford St.

On this occasion I went with a girlfriend to celebrate our joint birthdays and we were blown away by the service. Even before we arrived the Aura team got in touch to offer their help. 

We arrived far too early for checkin but the concierge and reception made it work. Brunch on the rooftop Radio Bar was heavenly, with friendly and efficient service and great Belllinis. 

After an afternoon shopping we returned to our room to find it beautifully decorated with champagne, balloons, and a cake which was such a surprise treat. 
I‚Äôve stayed in several rooms at the ME, they are much larger than an average London hotel room, sound proof and very comfortable. Great 3 headed showers and nice toiletries. Turn down was done at a time to suit us. 

The newly revamped breakfast room is very pleasant and we had a hearty breakfast with good coffee. 

When I returned home I realised I‚Äôd left some belongings, security have been super helpful and are posting them. 

Thank you the Aura team and the ME for another memorable stay. ",5,2019,05,15
148,Sexy,"Celebrated my birthday and the staff made my day a great day! The hotel comes off as very sexy, and modern. I‚Äôve stayed at another Melia property before and so I knew what I was getting into! Location was great! ",5,2019,05,15

148,A Fantastic Birthday at FANTASTIC hotel,"I don't often leave reviews, but I feel this hotel definitely deserves one! We have just got back from an overnight stay at the ME for my husbands 30th birthday gift and right from the very beginning we were treated amazing! Vittoria and the Aura Team went above and beyond for my husbands birthday leaving lovely birthday message written on the mirror, balloons, champagne and cake! The rooms were gorgeous, extremely clean and modern and very spacious, the bed so comfy with big chunky pillows and the minibar was incredibly stocked! The view we had from the balcony was wonderful especially at night! Every single staff we passed in the hotel acknowledged us with a hello and were all so extremely friendly! The Radio Rootftop Bar is fab, we had a few cocktails there before our show which Vittoria had reserved us a table prior to checking in, the view of London is incredible and it has such a nice vibe! The whole experience of staying at the ME felt very personal and helpful, and the hotel itself is gorgeous! I especially liked the dark corridors with the floor candles and spotlights it felt so luxurious with the added MELIA scent that sprayed out of the ceilings now and again was beautiful!! The location is spot on for a theatre trip! When we came back to our room in the night from the show, dressing gowns and slippers were laid out for us, all towels replaced with fresh ones, the mood lighting of the room had changed, and there were glass water bottles, glasses and a heart shaped chocolate on either bedside table which I felt was such an incredible touch! I cant thank the hotel and the team enough for such a wonderful stay and making my husbands birthday an extremely special one! I would recommend to anyone!",5,2019,05,13
148,fantastic hotel with great attention to detail,"Booked the hotel for a big milestone birthday many months in advance.  Showed up and was treated amazing right from the outset.  Checkin was seamless and we were treated to some great champagne as they got our room ready.  They offered us a suite upgrade for a fairly reasonable rate which we accepted.  Got to the room and they had given us a cheesecake and champagne to help celebrate my birthday (great start).  Room/Suite was very euro, modern and nice.  Loved the dual rain showers and the large bathroom which is rare in europe.

The service was good across the property but we especially enjoyed our morning breakfast at the radio bar.  Service was prompt and the food was really good.  We were able to get our coffee just like we like it even though not specifically on the menu that way.  We also had cocktails at the radio bar later which were fantastic as well.

I've stayed at ME London probably 8 times over the years.  Overall, the hotel treated us extremely well and made me feel special on my birthday. Would highly recommend.",5,2019,05,13
148,A wonderful birthday we'll always remember,"We had planned a 4 day escapade to London to celebrate my birthday and go to see a couple of shows. Adriana, from the Aura team, prepared our room very beautifully with written messages on the mirrors, balloons and a birthday cake, and made us feel at home from the very beginning. The rest of the staff was also very friendly but we felt that Adriana went above and beyond.
Our suit was huge by London standards, and the hotel couldn't be more centrally located. We had dinner once at the Radio Rooftop Bar and it was surprisingly good and the views are amazing (be sure to book a table in advance though).",5,2019,05,13
148,ALWAYS AMAZING,"The ME hotel is one of my favourite hotels in London and the top floor comes to life at night.
The rooms are very spacious and the beds are very comfy.
Staff are attentive and go out of there way for you.
Not the cheapest but well worth the money if your not on a budget.",5,2019,05,12

148,Fabulous stay,"We would give the ME London 10 stars if we could as we fell in love with all aspects of this London gem. This wonderful hotel is a perfect location for London sightseeing and within walking distance of theaters, restaurants and major attractions. The decor is spectacular: sleek, contemporary and spotless. All of the staff was extremely friendly and kind. The hotel was so quiet and even though our room was on the 2nd floor we could not hear traffic or other guests. Our Aura room was spotless and well appointed with an extremely functional and well-designed layout; the king bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was large with separate shower room and separate toilet room which made it easier for us to get ready each morning. The breakfast room was beautiful and the food was delicious. Absolutely 100% recommend. ",5,2019,05,08
148,Beautiful short break at ME London,I went to London to watch the marathon over the weekend and my stayed at this beautiful hotel. Staff is friendly and the room  was present with a surprise treat. I like the vibe of the hotel and lovely amenities which my short break in London worth a great trip.,5,2019,05,08
148,Hotel ME,Me and my friends stayed here for the night in April and was in awe at the decoration of the hotel once inside absolutely beautiful. The rooftop bar has a brilliant atmosphere and some stunning views of the capital. You don‚Äôt really need to leave the hotel as there was some music on the bottom floor (sort of club atmosphere) but when in your rooms you can‚Äôt here it which was good. Overall top hotel will be back.,5,2019,05,08
148,"Great location, interesting decor and awesome service.",Me London is super modern and is in a great location in London.  The staff there was very helpful particularly Edward at the reception desk.  He was very good at making sure we were happy and helped us with the details that made our stay a great one.  This is a particularly a good hotel for a couple.  Very romantic in a very modern way.,5,2019,05,08
148,Hen do stay,"Had a brilliant time and considering there was a few girls staying and we may not have been the quietest during check in, but they were extremely patient. My room was decorated with Champagne and poems and balloons which was lovely and this really made me smile. Would definitely stay here again as everything was perfect ",5,2019,05,08
148,Cool Hotel,"I stayed in the ME! hotel for 4 nights in October for a girl's weekend. We really enjoyed our stay there. The hotel itself is beautiful designed, and makes you feel like you are staying in the coolest and trendiest place (because it is). We ate dinner in their restaurant STK, where the food, service and atmosphere was 10 stars. The location is central and made it easy to go out in London. Emiliano, the head concierge, was extremely welcoming and helped us plan our stay, which included spending time at their Radio Rooftop Bar. It has amazing drinks and a killer view. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,05,08
148,What an experience!!,"Booked this Hotel for my partners 40th. Arrived at the hotel first thing we noticed was how gorgeous it smelt!! everyone was so friendly from the moment we walked in. We was escorted to our room by Vittoria who was very professional and friendly. To our amazement when we got to the room there was music playing, a birthday message on the mirror and also a desert and champagne waiting for us! What a welcome!! We even had someone knock in the evening with complimentary water and chocolate! We had a fantastic evening at the radio rooftop bar and a meal at STK which topped off our great experience! We will definitely be returning! Thankyou!!",5,2019,05,07
148,Niece 21st break,"I stayed here with my family, hotel is stunning & staff really nice & friendly, the only thing I can fault is our triple room that we booked was a single camp bed which for a 5 star hotel I thought was poor, location is excellent & very central, lovely welcome glass of champagne on arrival & balloons in the room that my niece was staying in, she was made up with this!
",5,2019,05,07
148,Birthday stay,"Stayed for two night to celebrate a birthday.  Booked a terrace room facing the city and it‚Äôs well worth the upgrade.  The view of the city gets afternoon sun and the view of the river gets sun in the morning. The hotel is ideally situated for Covent Gardens with associated theaters and eateries.  
Reception is on the first floor where we were met by Marco.  Checking in was easy but there needs to be more than two people on during busy periods as it was when we got there.  After a short wait we were checked in and given a complimentary glass of sparkling wine.  Nice touch.  We were taken to our room by Renata who was very professional, friendly and smiley who told us the layout.  
Good room with comfortable bed and a rather nice rainforest shower with a good selection of toiletries.  Lots of international channels on the television with good selection of UK ones.  The Nepresso was complimentary as was the good selection of tea available.  One small improvement is that there could be more storage in the room for clothing.  A nice touch was the cake, balloons and a small bottle of champagne for my birthday placed in the room.  Thank you ME.
At this point, a problem was noticed with the bedding.  Front Desk was contacted and Renata returned to the room and was immediately aware that there was a situation which needed to be dealt with.  The issue was resolved and handled very professionally and quickly.  Once again, thank you to all staff involved.
Breakfast can be taken in either one of two restaurants, the Rooftop Bar where it is ‚ÄòA la Carte‚Äô and the main restaurant on the ground floor which is buffet.  We ate in both and of the two, the Rooftop Bar was the best especially with the view over London. The food in the Rooftop Bar was good. 
We also ate in the STK Restaurant.  We had the set menu at ¬£30 per person although watch out for the 12.5% service charge already included in your bill.  The food was excellent and well worth a visit.  You also get a complimentary glass of sparking wine with the food.  We would definitely go back to this restaurant again.
Check out quick and efficient.",4,2019,05,06
148,Return to Me London,"I returned to the hotel for a second time with my boyfriend and it didn‚Äôt disappoint.  The hotel is beautiful and staff are very helpful.
Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience luxury in London!",4,2019,05,04
148,Beautiful design hotel with high level of service,"We had a problem with hosts on the room next door (they were smoking pot on their terrasse and smell was very strong), the hotel kicked them out (not only for us they had other complaints. We complained also about noise at 4am due to there staff cleaning on the rooftop bar. They offered us breakfast and cocktails. Good reactivity for all the staff. Staff at the radio sky bar is great üëç ",5,2019,05,04
148,Trendy hotel in the heart of theaterland,"Very good stay.Efficient and friendly staff.Great location.
Radio rooftop offers breathtaking views from the very heart of the city.
A pitty the Suites have such small windows with no access to a balcony.",5,2019,05,04
148,Another fantastic visit!,"My husband and I stayed last weekend to celebrate our Anniversary. We have stayed many times always opt for this hotel as the staff remember us, making us feel so welcome. It's a 2nd home. It's also the special touches the aura team take time to do. We had a lovely message on mirror, champagne and chocolate coated strawberries waiting in our room for us. We usually eat in Stk but it was closed our first night for a private function. We ended up eating both nights at the Radio rooftop bar which is tapas style. We really enjoy the atmosphere and cool vibe at the radio rooftop. Also the added bonus of the views.We also had breakfast there which was delicious. We cant emphasize enough how much we love this Hotel , location fab as well. We are home and looking at other flights to return.",5,2019,05,03
148,Great hotel,"Overall the hotel was great for location, my only problem was sleeping. The A.C didn't seen to kick on enough, I asked for a fan but  it made a load noise keeping me from sleeping. 
Roof top bar was great, little pricey but that's hotels.
",4,2019,05,03
148,Rude staff,Hotel looked nice and was clean but the staff ruined the experience. They were very rude and made us feel like we were not good enough to be staying in there. No one should be made to feel that way just because we wasn't suited and booted our money is just as good as anyone elses!!!,2,2019,05,01
148,Excellent hotel option and location,It was a great experience at this hotel and location was a big plus. The only downside is that the restaurants at the hotel are not very accommodating for kids. However the rest of the experience was very good.    ,5,2019,04,30
148,Fantastic stay,We had a wonderful stay and was made to feel very special. A mention to Vitorio and Alessandro who helped us to have a brilliant experience. The hotel was magnificent and areas for dining had excellent views. The radio bar with its atmosphere was a highlight of the trip but most of all it was the suite that we stayed in that really made our trip truly amazing. ,5,2019,04,30
148,Love it!,"Great hotel. Very beautiful and clean. The service is very good, and the stuff were really friendly. We celebrated our honeymoon in the hotel and the stuff did everything to make us pleased, including decorations in the room and complementary champaign with strawberries. Room service is really good. Helped as imidiatly with any problem. We took the river view room which was very nice. Very recommended!!!",5,2019,04,30
148,Going the extra Mile,"We booked a suite for our sons 21st and they decorated it, left him a bottle of fizz on ice and really made it special.
A stunning contemporary hotel like nothing else!
Even the aroma is gorgeous and the location is absolutely perfect for the west end, or a walk along the Thames.
Will definitely book again and have already started recommending it.",5,2019,04,29
148,Graduation and Birthday,"Fab room, very welcoming, used parking facilities, a lot of nice touches made our visit memorable and I'm sure we will visit again. The Radio Rooftop bar was a great experience at the end of the evening after we had been to the theatre.",5,2019,04,29
148,"Beautiful hotel, staff very attentive!","We stayed for 1 night for my partners birthday. Our room had balloons and a lovely message on the mirror in the bathroom with rose petals scattered round. Although a few errors were made, the staff were very quick to act to make sure things were put right. The hotel is absolutely stunning. As Melia members, we have visited many of the chains hotels across the world and this one particularly stands out with its amazing interior design. We will be returning.",4,2019,04,29
148,AWESOME PLACE !!,"We stayed there over the weekend and must say its AMAZING ! 
From the welcoming , to check in (incl. welcome drink) personal escort to the room , how the room was decorated incl. a little b-day cake, since it was my mothers birthday trip, everything was PERFECT. The rooms (we booked two rooms with connecting door) were so spacious , super large bed and so comfortable. The cleaning staff did a terrific job the rooms were cleaned to perfection every single day , also paying attention to little details. The Radio rooftop bar is a perfect location for an aperitif, great staff, super nice and very professional. I felt taken care of in every sense. Also the security staff on the ground floor helping getting into the elevators in the evenings were super professional and always with a smile. Last but not least the Concierge guys so lovely and always ready to help anytime. 
All in all FANTASTIC experience . Next time I will travel to London I will for sure book the ME MELIA again.  Thank you very much and WE LOVE  ME MELIA LONDON",5,2019,04,29
148,Hotel Visit,"Booked ME to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary, although we were offered a room upgrade, unfortunatey it was not a free upgrade, and was told it would cost us an extra ¬£400, so we declined the upgrade ",4,2019,04,28
148,Great hotel ,"We stayed at Me London for 4 nights and we enjoyed it very much. Such a lovely staff and the hotel is fantastic. Rooftop bar such a cool place and good atmosphere. Breakfast was delicious and the Zela restaurant phenomenal. 
We will definitely stay there again and recommend it to everyone üíï",5,2019,04,28
148,Excellent attitude and service from all staff,"Classy hotel, great location and staff that went beyond to help and be friendly at all times.

Valet parking on site and excellent roof top restaurant for breakfast with panoramic view from London Eye to city of London.",5,2019,04,27
148,Possibly the best hotel I have stayed at with only one trivial gripe about breakfast,"I booked this hotel for an overnight stay, for my wife's 35th birthday, as I had booked us dinner around the corner and the hotel looked very impressive and modern from what I found online. 
We have stayed at many 5 star hotels in London and around the world. I can truly say that the service here was better than any I have experienced previously  - even in Dubai, Singapore or the USA.  
At check in we were given a glass of Cava whilst we admired the lobby and it's incredible design.
Adriana, our Aura host welcomed us at reception, took us up to the room and had arranged  message, balloons, champagne and cake for my wife - in the room. This was an amazing surprise. 
She was incredibly nice and genuine, wishing my wife a happy birthday with a hug, and this made the experience perfect - setting the day off to an amazing start. 
They had also upgraded us to a room with a balcony and view of the Royal festival hall, Thames, London eye etc..... 
We were advised that breakfast was served on the rooftop bar which we were pleasant;y surprised by as, when I made my initial enquiries, before booking, I had been advised that breakfast was served in the Zela restaurant, on the ground floor. 
As a vegan, I also asked, before booking, if there were vegan options and I was advised that there were (a quick look on the menus online showed option of vegan sausages etc) 
On the evening, when we returned, we spoke with a lovely concierge by the name of Oleg, who sorted out our arrangements for the next day and we chatted for ages about our mutual love of cats, travelling and the commissioned digital art used in the lobby.
Oleg, like everyone one else we met and spoke to at the ME London hotel, was welcoming, warm and just made the experience that much better. 
In the morning, we went to the rooftop bar fro breakfast, which we were very excited for,  - breakfast with a view.
The disappointment came when we were told they no longer had vegan sausages as there was no demand for them. 
The waitress was very apologetic though and advised that Zela, might serve them.
We decided to the forfeit the view and go and eat at Zela.
We checked at reception, with very nice lady called Laura, about this and were advised that Zela was not included with the room but that she would call them to advise the situation and arrange for us to eat there instead.
We went down and were welcomed by, who I assume was the restaurant manager - a blond Spanish lady whose name I failed to get.
She was incredibly welcoming and accommodating like all of the other people we had met until this point, 
We ordered the vegan sausages and sat down to help ourselves to some buffet items until these arrived. 
about 10 minutes later we were advised, like upstairs, that there were no vegan sausages anymore as there was no demand and they had stopped stocking them.
By this point we didn't feel like going back upstairs again so sat and enjoyed the food on offer at Zela. 
The lady was very accommodating and arranged a veg stir fry and porridge without milk for me. This was all going above and beyond which we appreciated. 
If they had vegan sausages and served these on the rooftop, this hotel would be 6 stars in my eyes. I appreciate though, that these are very trivial points only relevant to me and maybe some other vegans who still like the idea of a ""full English""
Therefore, this hotel remains the best I have been to despite the breakfast not being to my exact taste. 
I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The Mrs and I are already considering our next stay and telling everyone we know about this place. 
Thanks again to Adriana for making this an amazing experience and a perfect birthday getaway for my wife.",5,2019,04,23
148,World class experience at ME...,"The staff literally went above and beyond during our entire stay.  We loved everything about the hotel from the staff, to the room, to the overall ambiance and of course to the bars and restaurants.  EVERY single staff member we spoke with was great.  You can tell they are well trained AND all  have a large focus on customer experience.  In a time when customer service is at an all time low, it's refreshing to see a hotel that still values the idea of going above and beyond.  ",5,2019,04,22
148,Fantasic Hotel and Staff,"We stay in London a couple of times a year, Birthdays, Anniversaries etc and I can honestly say this is by far the best hotel experience we have had.
The staff are friendly and warm, the management (Renata, Antonio) take care of every little detail and went above our expectations for our stay.
They reversed a table for friends and us in the radio bar and STK. 
The Radio bar has a nice chilled vibe going on with great views of London and a wonderful cocktail list. STK was a fantastic experience, wonderful food and music.
The room (Mode) was very large, great bed, coffee machine and double walk in shower.
My wife mis placed her programme as we went to watch Motown in the afternoon and the staff went above and beyond by getting us a new one and posting it too our home.
I will have no problem recommending this hotel to friends and family and we will be back to stay for sure.
",5,2019,04,22
148,"Fantastic hotel, room and staff","First time I have stayed at the ME London hotel and highly recommend. I would love to return again! 

Antonio contacted myself and ensured that anything I need for the birthday stay he could help with. 
The room was beautifully presented with music, cake, number 33 balloons and writing on the mirror. The room was perfect I couldn‚Äôt of been more happier. Beautiful bathroom and Bali shower with everything you need. Bed was very comfortable and with a suitable room check out time. Thank you. 
Marco who I also feel made our check in smooth at the reception desk showed us where to go and explained our stay. 
We went to the roof top bar and had a birthday drink with some nibbles both were fantastic with a great view. Overall very happy, what a wonderful hotel with very friendly, helpful staff. Thank you.",5,2019,04,21
148,Great hotel,"We stayed here for three nights in the eastern. It‚Äôs a special kind of hotel, but it‚Äôs really nice. Everything looks quite new and fresh. We had a double room, which was bigger than I thought it would be, with a small view of the city. Clean room, with lots of room services.

The hotel is close to several markets, tourist attractions and nice dining places. Really polite staff.

Recommended!",4,2019,04,20
148,Birthday theatre treat,"My husband and I have just returned from a 2 night stay here.
I booked this hotel as the pictures looked lovely and I wanted a treat, I must say though I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, I generally find hotels in this area to be beautiful but rather unfriendly. This place was such a breath of fresh air. The staff are amazing! They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable from the moment you enter the building, nothing was too much trouble.
They had decorated the room for me because it was my birthday with a few other treats thrown in, just loved it!
The food was fantastic as were the drinks and all public areas are stunning!
The rooms are beautifully decorated and to a very high standard.
Thank you ME, I look forward to visiting again very soon <3

148,enjoyed was incdedible one of a kind,"It was my first time in this place and it was excellent. Couldn't  fault anything from start to finish.It was lovely to see that management team, especially Fabio, was so involved and engaging with the guests. Big thank you to THE KITCHEN TEAM and F&D STAFF for making my day !!!! Higly recomended ! Planing to come back next week :)  ",5,2019,04,18
148,Hip hotel in Covent Garden,"I stayed in this hip hotel for one night.  I arrived early in the morning and the staff were both welcoming and helpful. They have already got a room ready for me to check in right away so that I may take a much needed nap.

The design of the hotel is minimal and chic and it is conveniently located in Covent Garden near several theatres.

The concierge is very helpful in recommending interesting local tours to me.  Further, as my tour finishes at 2:00p.m. on the day of my departure and my flight is at 10:00p.m., the hotel very kindly allowed me to check out at 5:00p.m. without any additional charge!",5,2019,04,18
148,Great hotel with great services,"I stayed at the hotel for a week and i highly recommend it to everyone. The location is just perfect, a great lobby, amazing rooftop and spacious rooms. Bertran, the night shift manager, was a very helpful employee and very welcoming at all times. He made sure that we had all what we needed and aided us in every way he could, a very kind and helpful person. The hotel's service is just great. Definitely the best hotel i have stayed at in London.",5,2019,04,17
148,My Surprise 70th Birthday,"My daughter planned a surprise birthday treat for my 70 birthday and she chose this hotel for our stay, it was truly amazing ,the staff ,the decor, the rooms, all were 5 star ,
Oleg, on reception, and Joseph in the restaurant helped to make it even more special.
Thanks to everyone involved my memories are forever x",5,2019,04,17
148,Another great stay,We have just returned home from our second stay at the ME London and it was excellent. The location and facilities are great and the staff just lovely. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a peaceful and chic stay close to the theatres and Covent Garden.,5,2019,04,17
148,Wonderful experience in an amazing Hotel with a great location,"The Hotel is located in one of the best areas of London. The staff in general was excellent, special mention to Aura, the Gest Experience staff, which made the stay wonderful. The installations are great, very new, very trendy Restaurant and Bar. ",5,2019,04,17
148,Unusual Hotel right in the middle of London.,"Excellent Suite with beautiful beds and Bathroom. Walking distance from the Theatres and Covent Garden. The Reception is a Pyramid and the corridors are Dark and atmoshpericmost unusual and contempary interior design. The staff were very well presented, engaging and helpful. The roof terrace offers fantastic views over London but infortunatly the  breakfastfood and service let this hotel down on our visit. ",4,2019,04,17
148,WOW !!!,"Fantastic stay at ME London, the staff was amazing and went beyond our expectations. 

The flight was delayed and arrived late at the hotel, we were mesmerized by the projection in Reception - Stunning !! Francisco and Bertran pampered us with a glass of champagne before giving us the keys to our Suite. 

Radio Rooftop Bar is a must, incredible views around London with top-notch cocktails. 

Will be back and recommend this chic hotel to anyone staying in this fantastic city!!!",5,2019,04,17
148,Lazy Sat Afternoon,"Check in experience faultless as usual. Fantastic welcome in the radio bar, nice to see familiar friendly faces. The Dog always made welcome. Wonderful afternoon snacking all day reading the papers, and being looked after. Thank you ME ",5,2019,04,16
148,Home from home in London,"The Me Hotel on the Strand is our hotel of choice in London‚Äôs theatre district.
The hotel reception has one of the most impressive and unique physical spaces. It is an extremely tall pyramid, with a sky light at the level of the roof top bar, 9 floors above. With constantly changing images traversing the walls and a glass of Prosecco, you know you are going to have a fun time.
All of the rooms are reflect different moods. The beds are enormous and exceedingly comfortable.
The staff are all extremely attentive and unflaggingly courteous and helpful.
It is our home from home in London.",5,2019,04,15
148,Awful service,After a very welcoming arrival it went rapidly downhill.  Follow up customer service was an insult. Not what I expect from Melia. Being refused a table that we were told wasreserved was a joke. Waited 2 hours for breakfast and sat next to an open door when so called reserved table was free throughout the two hour wait. Many other smaller issues that have not been followed up. Offered a room upgrade and a free breakfast as an apology....i get that with my Meliarewards anyway........just an awful experience which ruined the famly trip to London,1,2019,04,15
148,Fabulous hotel in every way,"I can only assume that the poor reviews on this hotel are written be competitors! Fabulous in every way. Staff are attentive, professional and friendly. Room was huge with everything needed and more. The place looks stunning too. We'll definitely be back! ",5,2019,04,15
148,Birthday Treat ,"What an amazing hotel. Pure luxury. Room very romantic and a special note on the mirror for my birthday along with treats. Such a special stay I will never forget. 

We have breakfast in room dining experience. Was amazing!!! 

Roof top bar very cool and STK house London had the finest food. 

We will be back. ",5,2019,04,15
148,Birthday surprise stay in London,"From the minute we walked into the Hotel, everything was perfect! The staff were fabulous especially Adriana Rossello who aranged our room, making our entire experience of the hotel wonderful, thank you and will definatelly be returning very soon!",5,2019,04,14
148,Exceptional Hotel,I have stayed here 3 times and each visit is better than the last. The hotel has a unique style with beautiful artwork. There is always a good atmosphere and the staff provide exceptional service. I would recommend drinks in the rooftop bar - great views.,5,2019,04,14
148,Very good hotel,As always ME London excels in service and quality. The friendliness of the check in people and especially the concierge service that is second to none. The location of the hotel is perfect to enjoy all London has to offer,5,2019,04,13
148,60th birthday treat,"Amazing stay for one night for my sister's 60th birthday.  Hotel organised balloons, champagne and cake in the room as well as a personalised message on the bathroom mirror - made her feel really special.",5,2019,04,13
148,Great Family Vacation,Great location.  Hotel is very modern and clean.  Rooms were very nice.  Beds were very big and comfortable. Staff was great.  The hotel restaurants are a very hot night spot.  I would recommend and would go back.,5,2019,04,11
148,Pleasant place / average value for money ,"The hotel is conveniently located in the city center, close to subway. The hotel has a unique modern style. The design of reception area is a must see. When you arrive they greet you with cava and water.  The breakfast is standard English style, well done, but nothing special.

The staff in the rooftop bar appears to be rude and unfriendly. It takes a while to get a drink or food.

The rooms are clean, large and modern. Every day, Maid put my toothbrush from the glass on the counter.

Value for money is ok, but not exceptional. ",4,2019,04,11
148,Mr Jon Wright,"This is the fourth time we have stayed at ME London and after a slight issue last time we stayed it was more than made up for with the service that we received this time round.
Absolutely outstanding from all the staff, from the minute we were welcomed at reception to the complimentary champagne and strawberry‚Äôs left in our room to the lovely message written on our bathroom mirror.. 
From when we checked in to when we checked out we were really looked after and will definitely be returning later in the year and will be bringing friends with us for a special weekend.. 
",5,2019,04,10
148,OUTSTANDING!,"Fabulous stay this weekend at the ME. It was our first visit and can‚Äôt wait to return. We stayed 2 nights for my birthday and boy do they spoil you! Champagne and cake in the room and every member of staff saying Happy Birthday. The champagne at check-in certainly gets you in the holiday mood and from there on everyone is friendly, welcoming and helpful. The location is central for Covent Garden with shops, restaurants and bars on the doorstep. Can not fault anything - thank you ME team #MEpeople üòò",5,2019,04,10
148,Customer Service,"The respect and customer service that was given to me for my stay was outstanding. The team did a great job making sure I was satisfied during my stay. The personalized letter in my room, room service, doormen, receptionist everyone was very friendly. Thank you",5,2019,04,10
148,40th Birthday Celebration ,Absolutely fantastic experience. I cannot thank the team enough at the hotel. Such thoughtful touches in our room to help us celebrate. Staff were so helpful and nothing was too much. Complimentary champagne and birthday cake plus drinks at the rooftop bar. Would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. We will definitely be back. Stunning hotel. ,5,2019,04,10
148,Arguably one of the best view over London,"The view from the room (Energy River) is spectacular, be sure to bring your tripod and enjoy the blue hour moment: Shard, London Eye, etc. The atmosphere of the rooftop bar Radio is also amazing (just get there earlier to secure the terrace seat so that you have space setting the tripod.) I want to thank the friendly staff Mr, Oleg for suggesting me the upgrade of room so that I as an avid photographer could enjoy the view very much. If your budget allows, get the penthouse for the best experience.",5,2019,04,09
148,Lovely stay,"This hotel is beautiful with a great location. The staff individually make you feel important, in every sector of the hotel. 
Rooms are fantastic and the beds are extremely comfortable.
Overall a great hotel ",4,2019,04,09
148,You should go!,"Last weekend I went with my friends to Radio Rooftop in Central London. Radio is the Me Hotel‚Äôs rooftop and is amazing! It has fav views and nice people (it had a DJ inside!). To be honest, everything was fine thanks to Alvaro, who is the receptionist. Alvaro, at all times, came with us to show us the reception, that is the best reception that I have never seen before, and he led us to the rooftop. 

I will come back! 

Thanks, especially to Alvaro",5,2019,04,09
148,ME London Experience,"I had an amazing time at ME London. All members of the team were extremely polite, professional and helpful. The hotel is very trendy with modern design and with really cool rooftop bar with the best views of London. I had Mode Room, which had awesome design and very cozy. The location was perfect right next to the Covent Garden and Soho. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a 5 star experience!",5,2019,04,08
148,Rooftop ME London Hotel,"This weekend me and a few friends were to London and visited the Rooftop of the Me London Hotel, and it was really nice. The views are Amazing and the whole hotel and its staff very focused on the customers needs, specially a receptionist named √Ålvaro Besoy was really helpful with us. Great place which we will come back in the future for sure!",5,2019,04,07
148,Stunning hotel,"This hotel is so thoughtfully designed. The only exception being the roof to bar. The bar and out door area are poorly designed in. comparison to the rest of the hotel. Our room had everything we needed and more. All the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Staying here is an experience. The STK restaraunt is very well priced and the food is amazing. My only criticism is the music is a touch too loud. You end up raising your voice to be heard. I have eaten there twice now and both time the set menus were wonderful. High recommend both the hotel and the restaraunt. The location is wonderful, especially if you're placing to see shows in the theatres on the door step.",5,2019,04,07
148,"Great location, very unique hotel","First time to stay here and its a very unique hotel. The door is very low key and gives no hint to what lies beyond.

Reception is flat out amazing, its at the inside base of a marble pyramid that stretches up thought the 10 floors of the building with the sky visible at the top - NEVER seen anything like this.
The hotel is very stylish in all areas, the rooms are modern and very comfortable. Excellent beds, pillows, shower, towels and toiletries.

It has an STK steak restaurant in the hotel which serves excellent beef with an extensive wine list to cater for all desires.

The roof bar is pretty cool also, even if service is  dreadfully slow.

Excellant hotel.",4,2019,04,05
148,Best decision ever ,"Absolutely good decision!

We have stayed for a couple of nights earlier in the months and it was a really good decision. overall the hotel is extremely different than any other usual hotels, but that is what i like the most. Something extravaganza. Every staff member is super helpful, sincere but friendly. Antonio has treated us like we would be the most important people in the world. Thank you very much, we will be back!",5,2019,04,05
148,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful experience","The staff were helpful and patient. They upgraded our room and the turn down service was great little treat. The beds are comfy and the room was spacious. Excellent location, within walking distance of most things. 
Overall a great visit .We will hopefully be back",5,2019,04,03
148,Quirky but comfortable experience,"An alternative to a traditional 5 star hotel in an excellent location. As it is described, this is a Fosters and Partners designer hotel. First impressions on arriving are the unusual entrance configuration with subdued lighting in the public spaces and a cavernous first floor reception that has light effects that appeared to show spermatozoa swimming up the walls .Our Vibe Room was comfortable and not  small for Central London.  Sound-proofing superb for a quiet room experience. Excellent bed comfort, very efficient and quiet AC. Breakfast at radio rooftop bar was a mixed experience. Food quality good but an over-long wait for food to arrive. When the food arrived, it all came at the same time- cold items and hot items. it would have been nice to have been served the cold items while waiting for the cooked food.   ",4,2019,04,03
148,Disappointed,"Recommended by friends who said it was a great hotel so I have high expectations. My experience not the same very average hotel. Started well; great loacation, bigger room size than you normally expect for central London, nice decor, Rooftop bar is nice and that is where it stops. Breakfast was a really long wait and not enough choice. Room service coming in the room constantly throughout the day. Service was not rude but neither did it make me feel at all like I was in a 5 star hotel. All in all would have been better saving money and staying in a budget hotel.",3,2019,03,31
148,Excellent hotel in the middle of everything,"I chose the hotel because of a nice deal on the ME Suite, found on the hotel website. The ME Suite is a duplex room (9th and 10th floor of the hotel) with on the top floor the most magical 360¬∞ view of London, in a glass dome. You really are above everything. The dome is a sitting room with comfortable sofas and lounge chairs, and a pop-out television, but it really is the incredible view that stands out. This room also has a direct exit to the rooftop bar of the hotel. So you can enjoy a drink (or a meal) and then walk straight into your room, a truely unique feature. On the bottom floor you find a bedroom, dressing room, bathroom, guest bathroom and dining space. The bedroom has access to a great terrace with a very nice view on London and the river. The dressing offers plenty of space to store clothes, and has a built-in safe. The bathroom is awesome, with separate toilet, shower and large bath. Too bad the bath doesn't have a view on London. The dining space has a large table, enough seating for 6. This room also offers a small office desk hidden in the corner. The room has a lot of art, which I appreciated. Breakfast was on the rooftop restaurant, and was simply excellent. On the second morning they did forget my eggs order (twice), but since I was not in a hurry this didn't bother me too much. 

The hotel is located close to the river and some great London highlights, some of which you can spot from the dome room. Closest tube station is about 5 mins walk. 

The enjoyment is also in the details. Staff always spoke to me by my name, from check-in to check-out, and even by room attendants. The bathroom mirror had a written personal message. This personal approach was really appreciated. The bedroom had European power plugs, so I didn't need a power adapter. 

I only found one downside to this excellent room. Although I really enjoyed the dome room, privacy is somewhat lacking. There are curtains but these do not cover the whole backside of the room, which allows people on the rooftop bar to have a peak inside the room, on either side of the door. The door itself is mostly glass with an opaque layer, but this only partially blocks views, especially in the evening when lights are on. I would recommend the hotel to allows the curtains to cover the door as well. 

I can recommend the hotel, and if they fix the curtains in the dome room I would happily stay in that room again.",5,2019,03,29
148,If you want a cool edge this is it.,"We have stayed here several times in recent years and look forward to our visit every time. If you want high standard efficiency, well trained staff and great location - all with a cool edge, this is it.",5,2019,03,29
148,Amazing stay,"From check in to check out amazing service ! Everybody was really warm and friendly. We were treated like VIP. Thank you so much for making our stay memorable. It‚Äôs too bad I can‚Äôt remember the nice lady at check in but she‚Äôs was friendly and welcoming. I will definitely stay here again next time I‚Äôm in London. 
STk restaurant was just ok but overall ok. STK Miami was way better food . ",5,2019,03,28
148,Favourite London hotel,5th time that we have stayed here and loved it again. Vittoria on reception made sure we were looked after and the birthday surprise in the room was a nice touch. Quality hotel staffed by quality people ,5,2019,03,28
148,Sublime hotel & service,"I recently stayed there for 3 nights specifically to be close to Royal Opera house. The hotel design, service and amazing staff exceeded my expectations. In particular check-in with Alvaro and subsequent barservice from Tomas. Such staff should be cloned!

My suite had a furnished terrace overlooking the river and what a delight to have coffee there in the morning. The rooftop bar-restaurant was so vibey - concurrent to delicious food and huge selection of cocktails.

Beyond doubt I will return",5,2019,03,27
148,Good basement breakfast conference space ,"Can offer coffee and food for 150+ then seated space for conference. Could do with another coffee machine but food including mini bite sized eggs Benedict interesting and tasty. 

Basement, so no windows, but cloakroom, Loos and layout all fine. 

Short walk from Charing Cross tube. ",4,2019,03,26
148,Nice Place,The staff is the best thing about the property.    Very professional and kind.    Rooms are very stylish and laid out nice.   Bars and restaurants are good but filled with people who want to take selfies and play dress up.       A little over the top for me.      Club type atmosphere throughout.       Again.   The staff is the best thing about this place.     Great hardworking people.       ,4,2019,03,25
148,Amazing hotel and service,"I stayed here recently for 2 nights with my husband mixing business with pleasure as he attended a conference and it was his birthday so I accompanied him. Again the ME experience was second to none. We had previously stayed in ME Ibiza and ME London did not disappoint. 
From prior to our arrival when they check in with us for any arrangements to be made. I mentioned it was my husbands birthday and there was champagne and a message left with petals on the bed, lots of little touches that made the stay special. 
I left my earrings behind and didn‚Äôt realize until 10 days later. When I contacted them they sent them to me immediately. 
The radio roof top is fab and perfect for a few pre or post dinner drinks. Also the hotel is really well located, in the middle of the theatre district with l easy underground access.  
I‚Äôll definitely stay here on my next trip to London! ",5,2019,03,25
148,High Class Luxury Hotel,"Excellent experience, visited with friends for a couple of nights. Wonderful atmosphere on the rooftop bar during relaxing afternoon and lively evening. Cocktails and food were excellent with great views across London. Rooms were surprisingly quiet for location, immaculate, modern and comfortable. Only downside is they add a service charge to everything and I prefer to tip individually for good service. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,03,25
148,Great weekend!,"Excellent stay at Me London, a stylish designer hotel with a great location, fantastic breakfast place and great staff, especially Adriana from the Aura team who made our stay very special! Thank you :) ",5,2019,03,25
148,Excellence,"Each year, we stay for a few days in this great hotel and every time, we are just overwhelmed by the warm welcome and hospitality of the staff and the really stunning architecture of the building.
This year again, we had the pleasure to experience the unmatched, high professional services by the extremely friendly employees. In particular the Aura team with Adriana Rossello and Antonio Berni, or Ugne Cepaite at the reception and the concierge Emiliano del Pizzo.
It's one of our favorite hotels and we look forward to being there again in the very near future.",5,2019,03,25
148,Great hotel and great location,"I recently stayed at the ME Hotel London for a four day business trip. The room was well set up to allow me to work with a good sized desk with plenty of power ports. The natural light in the room was also good which meant it was comfortable to work from the room. The room was much bigger then other London hotels and the room was maintained very well each day. I also asked for a late checkout and the Hotel was happy to oblige the request. Breakfast was served on the ground floor. It was not a big buffet and there was not too much choice. Nonetheless, if you are happy with a nice English hot Breakfast you will not be disappointed. The coffee was great, I would definitely stay at this hotel again. It is also very close to the West End Theater district and just a short walk to Temple Tube Station (7 minute walk).",5,2019,03,24
148,Fantastic experience at the ME LONDON again,"Absolutely fantastic hotel - great staff, treated really well with such personal touches.  On arrival when checking in offered a glass of prosecco - nice touch! It was our 15 year wedding anniversary and the Aura Team put special touches in our room as a surprise! Nothing too much trouble! Thanks Adrianna Rosello Chaves and the rest of the team - the only place I would stay in London!",5,2019,03,24
148,Me London,"Would just like to leave a review for the staff and especially Adriana Rossello at the Me London hotel. It was my girlfriends birthday weekend. We were welcomed at check in by a glass of champagne and balloons for the birthday girl. Then taken up to our room where we were welcomed to a lovely room, with a cheesecake, a bottle of champagne with two glasses for the birthday. Also we had a message left on the mirror mentioning drinking too much is never an issue! Lol. The staff couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. We had a lovely stay and we will definitely will be back soon :)",5,2019,03,24
148,A Perfect Honeymoon,"The ME London is a very unique hotel with an impressive pyramid at its core. It is absolutely stunning! In the lobby you will be greeted by warm and friendly staff and beautiful candles burning lining the halls.  The hotel is in a perfect location and walkable to everywhere you want to go. The staff went above and beyond to make a wonderful honeymoon for us with champagne, roses and so much more. What a wonderful surprise. Staff are the friendliest I have encountered in a hotel. I cannot wait to stay again!! Lastly, the rooms are very quiet, I did not hear anyone in the halls or traffic. ",5,2019,03,23
148,Amazing!,"I absolutely love this hotel. Stayed here a few years ago for my 18th and returned again to celebrate my 21st last weekend. The hotel is so beautiful and clean and the staff are all lovely and nothing is too much trouble. I would like to give a special thank you to Adriana from the Aura team who decorated our room for the occasion and made the room that bit more special. She was so lovely and kind and really went the extra mile to make sure we were happy (which we totally were!!). I‚Äôd say this is my favourite hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The hotel and staff are totally deserving of a 5 star rating. The roof top bar is also a must visit at the top of the hotel, stunning views both day and night and a great range of cocktails. I don‚Äôt have anything bad to say about this hotel, I felt so special during my stay and would definitely recommend to anyone whether it‚Äôs for a special occasion or just a general trip to London.",5,2019,03,23
148,Chic suite,Excellent service in every way. Room was outstanding. I paid for a upgrade which we got the chic suite. The only slight issue I had is I thought they would maybe give you a free breakfast after paying which I think is a lot of money for 1 night stay with no breakfast. However apart from that I can not give any bad feedback about my stay. Would highly recommend ,5,2019,03,23
148,Pretentious with unhelpful staff,"Unless you are 24 years old in a tiny dress - do not expect to get helped. Staff was very dismissive. The room is teeny tiny. And the hotel lacked basics for a traveler, like sundries. When I asked the front desk if housekeeping had contact lens solution - like every other high end hotel does - no one knew and I was finally transferred to the concierge desk who acted like I was insane for asking and informed me that there was a Boots nearby where I could buy stuff in the morning. Will not stay here again. Will not recommend.",2,2019,03,21
148,Worst beds ever ,Spent a lot of money in london but this hotel and it‚Äôs service left me upset and so tired! Beds are the worst I‚Äôve ever come across.. hotels lovely but the manager was terrible when asked about changing my cusions.. they never even apologised not even once.. I did not sleep a wink. The least the could of done is apologise.. pathetic never again! ,1,2019,03,21
148,Superb,"I absolutely love this Hotel. It's the king of cool.
Staff are fantastic. Rooms are great. And the added advantage of STK downstairs that really kicks off for a fun time. 
Stay here. You won't be disappointed.",5,2019,03,21
148,Theatre weekend,"Service not up to 5 ‚òÜ standard very poor.
Cleanliness of room poor.
We had a deluxe double at 5 ‚òÜ price with a very small bed.
Breakfast cold, limited, terrible service.
Overall disappointing stay. 
Good location although pricey compared to nearby competitors ",2,2019,03,20
148,excellent location,"Best location, close to all places you want to go and see in London (National Gallery, British museum).
Close to great restaurants (The Frog) excellent food. All the theaters are close by, I went to see two shows.
Room are large and modern, very clean, new bathrooms.
The staff at the hotel was nice and very helpful 
",5,2019,03,19
148,"Excellent, short stay","Super nice staff, mind blowing interior and architecture; very insta friendly. Location great for visiting nearby LSE and Kings College, and West end and Covent Garden fun. Pricey but goo deals can be found if one pays attention. Will definitely stay again.",5,2019,03,19
148,50th Birthday stay,"My partner and I were lucky to spend my birthday weekend at the hotel.  We had a balcony room overlooking Covent Garden and you couldn't hear any noise from the street, unless you opened the door.   

We arrived at the hotel earlier than planned and they still allowed us to go to our room without having to wait and it was only 1pm.   Plus they had put a birthday message, balloons, champagne and a cake to allow me to celebrate in style.  The room was nice and I loved the bathroom and its sliding doors.  

The breakfast in the 10th floor restaurant was good and the reception area, amazing.  We found the staff were friendly and when we ordered room service it was really quick.  While we encountered a few minor issues during our stay, but it wouldn't stop us going back as the hotel location was amazing for attending shows. 

One quick point to make, was that we encountered a lot of questions about how our stay went as we were leaving and that needs to be addressed.  It went on for too long and we nearly miss our train because of it.",5,2019,03,17
148,Amazing ,"Amazing from checking in to checking out . Booked an overnight stay to celebrate our friends 60th birthday and the hotel certainly didn‚Äôt disappoint from the complimentary glass of prosseco to the wonderfully decorated room with balloons cake and champagne on ice wow it certainly left a very good impression. Antonio and all the staff that looked after us were superb . The hotel has a lovely vibe about it and is very sleek and clean the rooms are very modern and high tech with everything in them that you can think of but if you find something missing they are only to happy to get it for you , definitely five star hotel and definitely five star experience. We will return. ",5,2019,03,17
148,Amazing experience,"Thanks to the amazing Antonio from the Aura department, my two night stay-over has been simply unique - from the room to the little details.. You made us feel so special! Also thanks to Sara J. for the great time we had. We hopefully gonna come back very soon. Truly recommended! ",5,2019,03,16
148,Perfect in everything except the breackfast,"Perfect but the breackfast is just awful, 20min waiting for a coffee... poor buffet...
Location, rooms and general mood is perfect
Special note for the concierge that is really helpfull in everything! ",4,2019,03,14
148,Belated 50th Birthday Treat,"Very well situated for all amenities, Covent Garden, River Thames and especially the Theatres and Royal Opera House.  The Hotel is fabulous and the roof top bar is out of this world as well as friendly helpful staff.",5,2019,03,13
148,Amazing hotel,"Hotel was beautiful, lovely location and helpful staff, would have preferred not to have been asked about upgrades, if I wanted one I would have requested. Breakfast was cold and very disappointing was hard to get staff for breakfast drinks also, it's a shame as it let down what should have been an amazing stay. Roof top bar was shut, very annoying as it was a big selling point of theirs!",4,2019,03,13
148,30th birthday,This was a hotel that me and my other half wanted to stay in for quite some time now. When I booked this I did not think it would be quite as good as it turned out to be! Adrianna went to every expense to ensure that our stay was memorable. Adrianna went above and beyond for every request that we had. Amazing hotel and equally amazing service!!,5,2019,03,11
148,Special celebration,"From the moment you walk in to the ME London you get excellent service and this extends throughout your stay üòä we felt like VIPs and thoroughly spoilt ! expert service from everybody and a special mention to Adriana Rossello who made our stay extra special, looking forward to returning soon x",5,2019,03,11
148,Superb choice,"Great location close to the city of London and right next to Covent Garden and the West End. The hotel has a wonderful low-lit atmosphere and is very modern compared to other hotels in the area. The rooms are nicely designed, very spacious, and great care is taken to provide the client with every amenity and service needed to make their stay comfortable and pleasurable. The Radio rooftop bar with panoramic views, great food options, and relaxed setting is a must see experience  The breakfast selection is excellent and at fair in price. The staff were very friendly and helpful, with a very special mention for Alvaro on reception, who provided excellent advise, was very helpful with various logistical issues for important meetings I had planned, provided a full run-down of the various spaces available to the guests of the hotel, and also took time‚Äìout to provide me with valuable insights on cultural visits available in the area during my stay. I will definitely recommend this hotel to clients. Colleagues, friends & family.",5,2019,03,11
148,Outstanding Luxury,"Amazing hotel, incredibly attentive staff and a personal touch.  Staff were warm and friendly and went out of their way to help in any way they could.  Rooms were luxuriously appointed and hi-tech.  Unexpected extras are a treat and the whole experience was wonderful.",5,2019,03,11
148,Night out,I've stayed hear numerous times and I have always enjoyed myself. The radio roof top bar is spot on too. I will be back again. The staff were attentive and it was quite a funky place to stay. I love staying here,5,2019,03,07
148,Wow,"This is the 3rd time we have stayed here and cannot fault this hotel except the breakfast, on our first visit it was far too expensive so we have breakfast at bistro round the corner from the hotel. We are staying at Me hotel in Marbella in June and we so hope it matches the Me hotel the strand. You must go to the roof top bar it has fantastic music, great food and great staff.",5,2019,03,06
148,Very poor,"The hotel as you walk in has a wow factor that‚Äôs it. Rooms are very very basic the finishing touches have all been missed even down to the toilet roll was cheap üò¨ STK was amazing great food 9 of us really great atmosphere a must try with friends. But this hotel was a massive let down and the price for what level of service you get and quality is poor. Breakfast waited over 25 minutes for a tea! Then other 15 mins for cold drinks food was very standard for ¬£68 breakfast everyone likes a bit of a wow factor when doing the couples w,end this was probably the worst hotel I‚Äôve stayed in shame as it had really good reviews big let down for us.",2,2019,03,06
148,My favourite Blazer,"I stayed in this hotel at the end of January. Lovely place, great location, beautiful architecture and most importantly a very friendly staff. I would strongly recommend ,if you happen to be in this hotel, to visit the Radio Bar and STK. On my last visit i forgot  my favourite white blazer in the room i was staying, but the security team, especially Andrei helped me by sending it back to me. Again my special thanks to Andrei for his professionalism and kind help.",5,2019,03,03
148,Outstanding!,"This hotel certainly has the wow factor. Ultra modern and every area is beautifully designed. 
We had drinks in Radio Rooftop and also in the Marconi Lounge. So stylish and ambient.
I took my mother in law as a surprise for her 50th birthday and this hotel exceeded my expectations. Such a warm welcome and personal experience. 
The staff are fantastic. Extremely welcoming and efficient. I felt as though it really did matter to them that we enjoyed our stay and had everything we required.
The location is perfect. We walked to Covent Garden, Leicester Square and the London Eye. Also there is a Tesco Express and a Greggs literally on the doorstep! Very handy.
If you are undecided and love modern, stylish hotels/bars. This is for you!",5,2019,03,02
148,I would give it a higher score if I could!,"We spent yesterday at the ME London and from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty! The concierge took our case and said it would delivered to our room.  We were escorted to the reception to check in and Alvaro talked me through the check in and from this we decided to upgrade our room.... yes it was hugely expensive, but it is so rare we get away, I through why not!

We were given a glass of champagne and told we could go up to the Radio roof bar for a spot of breakfast and of course a beverage whilst taking in the views.

We were then informed our room was ready for us.... oh wow! Adriana from the Aura team had set up our room, with helium numeric balloons for husbands birthday, champagne, cheesecake and the lighting and the music was already on when we entered.  The whole experience was simply amazing.  

We headed out for retail therapy, returning to enjoy a long hot soak in the superb bathroom. All of the items you would need was already there for use, including a large bottle of bubble bath. Perfect, 

The Radio roof bar is simply amazing at night. Again the staff were attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  Our final destination was dinner at STK ... again this is simply superb. The food and the atmosphere, complete with a brilliant DJ and of course a few cocktails really finished our already fabulous day off.

The room was simply amazing, the large bathroom, the separate sitting room, the control of music, mood lighting and air con throughout the suite was fab.  

Although late, I could not resist another soak in the tub before getting into the very comfortable bed.  

Breakfast back on the roof bar is recommended !

Even the check out was such a pleasure (not that we were keen on leaving....but shopping was calling)

Thank you for the amazing time.  My hubby and I will always remember his birthday get away. 

I truly hope we will be able to e perience the hotel and facilities again,",5,2019,03,02
148,fabulous hotel!,"It was great staying in every way. The room very modern , comfortable and clean. The balcony and the view off the city was beautiful. 
The hotel is stunning! The lobby it‚Äôs amazing! 
The rooftop bar very chic , and the welcome drink for the silver Meli√° memberships so nice... 
The most important thing the service from all the staff hotel out of the ordinary ! Definitely come back in my next visit in London 
Thank you me London for great staying.",5,2019,03,01
148,You will not want to leave ... ,"First time in this wonderfully designed hotel. Proper luxury stay - They make you feel special at all times. Such personalised approach. So beautifully done in so many ways - 
From the reception to the room to the roof top bar. It‚Äôs the kind of hotel where you would not want to leave. Thank you for 2 lovely nights - Antonio (Aura team) is a passionate lovely guy. Thank you for taking your time and show me around. 
I am a fan now!
 ",5,2019,03,01
148,Living London only at MeLondon!,"Not only a perfect business location, but also a luxury hotel, where modern art and glamour are at first place! The atmosfere is surprising and soft lights leads you to a relaxing feeling.
Everything was awesame thanks to the organisation of Marco, reception manager: you can perceive the class and attention in every single detail, he is a master in the art of hospitality...and Edward, whose smile and sophisticated attitude ensure a real warmer welcome.
Emiliano helps you with your luggages and gives you all the info to have the city in your hands!
We posted every single beautiful moment with the free wi-fi and enjoyed the beauty routine with precious cosmetics!
We appreciated our design decorated room! We also managed to visit everything of London in few days, because the hotel is in central position and in the middle of Covent Garden area! 
We started everyday with sweet super pancakes breakfast, but you shouldn‚Äôt miss a sparkling fl√ªte on the rooftop at the cool bar to enjoy the magnificent view! 

Trust me...You‚Äôll never want to leave!! ",5,2019,02,28
148,Valentines day made perfect by ME and their team.,"i stayed at ME to celebrate Valentines day with my boyfriend. ME and the team made it so special for us. The room was ready at 3 pm sharp for check in, and in our room were rose petals all over the bed, a bottle of champagne with strawberries and cheesecake. as well as white writing on the bathroom mirror saying 'When we are in love, we are truly living'. Such a lovely thing to walk into , first impression was great. the rooms were quiet and there was no noise, the TV and sound system were great. 

as well as the mini bar which we made the most of! Then we headed for dinner at STK - an amazing steak restaurant inside the hotel. wow. ME were so great to us, and i cant wait to return.",5,2019,02,27
148,Me London,Lovely room everything was perfect other than check in which was a pain as wrong information supplied and staff didn‚Äôt help that much and expected us to know what we needed to do although we didn‚Äôt know ,5,2019,02,26
148,Saturday night stay,"The hotel was very modern, the energy urban terrace room was lovely, liked the lighting options. Bed very comfortable,had a great sleep which is what you need in a hotel.
Staff very pleasant and polite, the only thing is we were never offered our complimentary drink, which was part of the deal booking through Melia website üôÉ
Would definitely stay here again though ",5,2019,02,25
148,ME London,"Really great hotel in a very good location. Room was cozy and well soundproofed. The staff was very friendly. Amazing birthday surprise waited in the room the first evening. Cake, champagne and balloons! Wow!
We will absolutely visit this hotel again!
Thank you so much your hospitality!",5,2019,02,24
148,Perfect valentines get away treat,"The hotel was stylish, elegant and we felt welcomed and special throughout our stay. Our Aura Manager, Marta Marczel was especially great, personally greeted us and took us to our room which was beautifully laid out with extra special treats (strawberries, champagne and mirror love messages) she managed to arrange our reservations as we needed around our theatre show, even though the timings were vague. Her recommendation to have breakfast on the roof rather than in our room was a great idea. It was nice of her to chat to us at breakfast to follow up on our night, this made us feel like valued guests. The bed was super comfy, had a really good night's sleep, good blackout curtains. On our second night there was late night noise from the room next door, but the hotel swiftly dealt with it as soon as we raised it with them. All the staff were friendly and couldn't t help you enough. Would come and stay here again in a heart beat. Breakfast was amazing and delicious, would recommend including breakfast when you book, as its more relaxed, and then all inclusive. Would recommend breakfast on the roof at the Radio Bar, the views across London are stunning and the bar itself is a very nice environment to dine in, its nice and relaxed with attentive staff. It was overall a total step away from normalility, bliss. ",5,2019,02,24
148,Special,"Took my wife here for a treat weekend including a show.  The hotel is impressive and feels special.  Front desk staff and concierge were all super friendly and helpful.  It's not cheap, but to be honest, it is not that much more than some of the 4 star offerings in the area.",5,2019,02,24
148,3rd visit and excellent throughout ,"This is my 3rd stay at the ME London. Love the art work for sale by local artists and the room was faultless. I had breakfast in my room for the first time and it was also faultless. Valet parking is great and convenient. All staff are attentive and polite and should be praised the the hotel manager. Only niggle is get new steam irons pleasseee üòÅI will
Be back üëç",5,2019,02,22
148,Our Favourite London Hotel,"As always the staff were welcoming and professional.  We've tried different rooms each visit and have never been disappointed, they each have different attributes, for instance we had an Aura room this visit on the second floor with floor to ceiling window where we could watch the world go by.  We love sitting in the Radio rooftop bar which has wonderful views across London.  The breakfast up there is well worth having.  Sunday brunch however, can be rather busy as we experienced this time, the waitresses were rushed off their feet and I imagine the kitchen staff were stretched as our chips accompanying our steak were cold and service for drinks was rather slow. This did not spoil an otherwise wonderful couple of days.   ",5,2019,02,22
148,Night away for the Husband's birthday,"For my husband's birthday this year, I decided to take us for a night away in London. As we're on the south coast it isn't too far. Having stayed at Melia before, White House London, I choose this one based on location for the theatres and Covent Garden.
This Hotel is stunning, with sleek lines and we were made to feel special the moment we walked in. The Reception is on the 1st floor, and we were booked in by Alex who was really helpful and professional. The Reception area is mind blowing!
Up in the lift to the 9th floor, we were shown to our Urban Energy Room by Antonio. I told the Hotel in advance it was a special occasion, and they kindly surprised us by decorating the room with balloons, cake and fizz. Our modern, but large room, had a balcony with awesome views over London. Everything felt so new and clean, and cleverly designed.
Highly recommend having a cocktail on the roof top bar.
Breakfast was delicious with a mouth watering selection of treats.
Would have loved to have stayed longer.
Everyone we meet was warm, friendly and professional.
We look forward to using Melia again in the future, thank you for making my husband's birthday so memorable :-) 10/10",5,2019,02,21
148,Not all ME Hotels are equal,"Stayed at the ME hotel in London SOHO for Valentines day. My partner flew in to meet me all the way from San Francisco, USA. I received good service, I didn't receive the ME wow service as I have at the other locations. Overall, it was ok.",3,2019,02,21
148,4th stay,Still a great hotel. Great staff. My only disappointment is that I had booked a better room than what I usually get and the king bed is two queen beds together (which I hate). They still use a very pungent and not too pleasant air freshener in the lobby entrance,5,2019,02,20
148,Stunning hotel in the heart of London,We stayed for one night for a special evening away from the kids. It was fabulous. Very unusual and grand building design makes it feel like a special place straight away. The staff were great and the room was perfect. Stay here!,5,2019,02,20
148,Inspiring service,"I visit this hotel multiple times a year.
It has a perfect location for theatre visits and is very close to Covent Garden.
The hotel has a very cool and hip vibe and the rooms are white, well equipped and ‚Äòsexy‚Äô at night (you have to find out for yourself why).

Last visit I had already checked out, went into the city and suddenly felt not well. But it was still many hours until I could go to the airport.
The hotel provided me a room to rest without any hassle and free of charge.
That is how you treat loyal customers.
The staff of ME London is an example in service.
I will stay loyal to them as well.",5,2019,02,16
148,"Amazing service, and amazing hotel","This hotel is simply amazing. I came here for a night and stayed in the suite. The Aura team were simply amazing, and very helpful. Everything was ready when we arrived, we also got a free drink on arrival. The suite was stunning, and the servicce was incredible. This is my 3rd time staying at this hotel, and I shall be staying again for sure. Thank you for Antonio for being amazing and looking after us. He really was amazing.",5,2019,02,16
148,A new experience in London,"We usually stay at the Intercontinental Hotel but decided on a change, it is very different as it is very ‚Äòtrendy and modern‚Äô My wife and I really enjoyed, we arrived late on Thursday and after a very efficient check-in we went up to Radio bar, welcomed by Ben, who was really looked after us from that moment on. We had some lovely food and drinks and went back to a really well set out bedroom with everything you need. We stayed 3 nights and couldn‚Äôt fault anything during the whole stay, all the staff are smiling and attentive at all times",5,2019,02,13

148,Funky hotel ,"I liked...the design, location, ambience. Staff were very friendly. Rooftop bar was good.

Was disappointed that breakfast wasn't a buffet affair (the food was decent though) and could hear the loud neighbours rolling in at God knows what hour. Also like to have a bedside light not just bright lights overhead.",4,2019,02,10
148,Birthday Weekend,"From the moment we got to the hotel reception we experienced exceptional service with the friendly reception team and lovely bar and porter staff. The hotel is beautiful and has an amazing rooftop bar with stunning views.

148,Melia Mouthed,Slow cumbersome check in / check out. Staff did not look after our luggage nor carry out tasks they promised they would. Reserving tables in bar area so only very limited seating which was full. Alternative bar very noisy with DJ at 5 in the afternoon. Had to leave hotel for a drink.,1,2019,01,30
148,So good we visited again during the same vacation!,"We stayed at ME London at the start of a vacation, on our way to Greece.  Two nights at ME were the perfect start to a great holiday.  The Hotel is immaculate, the staff attentive and friendly and the accommodation was wonderful.  We stayed on the 9th floor and had a great view.  From the moment you enter the hotel you are greeted with a friendly and helpful team that makes the check in process seamless.  The lobby is spectacular.  We enjoyed it so much that we booked to stay on the way back from Greece before we headed back to Canada.  Again, a terrific way to end the vacation.  

Recommended to visit the Rooftop bar.  Also the location of the hotel puts you steps away from Covent Garden, many restaurants & pubs and the tube station.

Thanks to Eduard Ionescu and everyone else we met during our time at ME.

We hope to be back soon!

148,Excellent,"The ME London exceeded our expectations. The welcome in the room with a message, rose petals and champagne was wonderful. The staff everywhere in the hotel made the stay absolutely memorable. Whether we were asking for reservations, bars, restaurants, room cleaning, Aura, reception .........it was as though we were their only point of attention. 
You have to see the hotel to really appreciate how unique it is amongst any other in London. Great sized rooms , and very clean. 
Do yourself a favour and stay there.",5,2019,01,30
148,Perfection,It's not often I will do a review whilst I am still at a hotel. However this hotel cannot be praised enough. Everything  is faultless. Antonio's  attention to detail from the Aura team thinks ahead of your plans and adds those special touches that makes  a stay here memorable.  In fact every member of staff cannot be praised enough.,5,2019,01,28
148,An Amazing Experience!,"ME London is a lovely property in a great location. Very central with easy access to theaters, attractions and Covent Garden with great shopping and near the Tube. High quality architecture, service, art and food. With one of the best rooftop bars in all of London, Radio. From top to bottom the experience was fantastic. The staff was kind and helpful but I must mention the Duty Manager (Emiliano) at the time we stayed there was exceptional. He went above and beyond to make sure our stay was very special. He checked in on us and made sure we had all the right accommodations. He even set us up with reservations to some of the top restaurants in London which were spectacular. His insight to the city and the top spots was greatly appreciated and we look forward to our next stay here because of that. Thank you!",5,2019,01,28
148,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel and location. Room was very nice, although the hallway was a little bit strange. Everything was black with no windows so was very dark. Good location for Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square!!!!! ",4,2019,01,28
148,Amazing but not great,This hotel is amazing for the art and the way they have designed the hotel is beautiful. When checking I felt as if because I was young they treated me as if I was inferior to a middle aged person with money. I cannot vault the hotel but the way I felt was just the negative and really annoyed me because I loved the room and the bed! ,5,2019,01,28
148,Great Service,"My son left his keys at the STK venue and they were taken in by security.  They were very efficient and kindly sent them back to us by special delivery.  Thank you so much.  As we don't live in London, it saved him a trip.",5,2019,01,28
148,Very modern lovely staff,"Great location lovely rooms only minor issue which may irritated some peoope is there is no bath in the 'normal' rooms. This however doesn't concern me as the showers are awesome! Very modern and you don't hear a lot of noise in the rooms.

The staff are lovely , bed are soooo comfy and the toiletries in the room are all natural and smell great.

The TV can be a bit tricky if you're not big into TV like me but my boyfriend found it no problem to use! Haha! 

You get cava on arrival and very nice gentlemen welcoming you in.

Roof top bar is a must and the cocktails are great! Stayed here three times because we love it!",4,2019,01,27
148,Work Event,"Here for a corporate day, and the hotel is visually stunning. The conference facilities are great, but the lunch time food was cold and lack of staff for coffee breaks meant very long queues for refreshments. The roof top bar was great, with amazing views over London - and also had the nicest, cosiest smoking area.",4,2019,01,27
148,What an impressive hotel!,Travelled to London to attend an exhibition. Made a decision to combine business with pleasure and booked this hotel for my partner and I. We got upgraded on arrival free of charge. Hotel had amazing facilities. You are made feel like VIP from the moment you arrive and until you leave. Parking facility is a great addition to hassle free stay! Will be booking again and highly recommend ,5,2019,01,27
148,Fabulous Central London Experience at the ME,"Sara Jones and her team at the ME made the stay in London one to remember, with their attention to detail and their friendly yet professional approach. The room had a lovely view, all the amenities you'd expect as well as personal note on arrival. I'm still surprised how quiet (silent) the room was given the volume of traffic and noise outside! Great location to enjoy the city from. Looking forward to visiting the rooftop bar in the summer! ",5,2019,01,26
148,The staff was amazing!!!,"When we checked in we felt instantly welcome and home.
Laura who did the check in, was so helpful to get my friend and me a connected room, and helped us to make our stay just perfect.
The rooftop bar was beautiful. The view stunning. We visited it twice. By night the radio Rooftop was a little bit chilly.
The breakfast  was served in Zela London, it was delicious, and the place is really beautiful.
The staff was caring and and made our stay wonderful.
The check out was so smooth and easy, Alvaro explained every detail patiently.
When we come again, we will definitely stay in ME London.",5,2019,01,25

148,Best Hotel in London!!!!!!!,"Me and my partner stayed at the ME on the 19th January and it was exceptional. We booked a standard room and was kindly upgraded to the passionate suite, courtesy of Edward the reception manager. The room was amazing and we also ate in the STK restaurant which was the best. We have stayed in so many hotels in London and this is by fat the best from start to finish. Will definitely be coming back!! Thank you Edward!!",5,2019,01,23
148,"Beautiful, central hotel but disturbed sleep both nights!","I would first like to say that this hotel is beautiful, central and the staff make you feel like VIPs in deferent ways. Cracking place. 

However- the true test of a hotels service is when things go wrong. 

On the first night I was kept awake by huge bangs against the wall which rocked the bed perhaps a dozen times throughout the early evening all the way through until the next morning. As these happened so randomly I wasn‚Äôt and still am not sure what caused them but didn‚Äôt report it as I expected after staying awake for 10 or so minutes after each occurrence that, each one was the last time and I fell back to sleep, only to get woken up but it again. 

The next night there was a strange electrical noise that kept changing in pitch that kept me away on and off for a couple of hours that second night. 

When I was checking out I was asked how my stay was and I told them that I had had very little sleep and told them the reasons why. I was told that I should have reported these issues immediately but as for the first one, I tried to explain that it was one Big Bang against the wall and then it went away for different amounts of time so assumed it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. 

Basically because I didn‚Äôt report it they didn‚Äôt take a penny off the room rate what so ever. 

As I eluded to earlier the rest of the service and attention to detail and even the room service was top notch, but when the service really counts they let me down and proved how penny pinching this hotel is. 

I won‚Äôt be back here and instead will stay over the road the next time I‚Äôm down to see a show.

148,Fall in love with London,"I was so completely in love with the Me Hotel,  location, services & Resturants. The concierge was very helpful in recommending restaurants outside of the hotel & helping in the best way to get theatre tickets.I will definitely be back & recommend the Me to many people.",5,2019,01,22
148,"The view, the view, the view!","It was my first time visiting London and I stayed at this very hip and modern hotel ME London. Upon entering you are personally escorted to the check in desk which is a floor above the main lobby. The check in area has the most amazing vaulted ceilings with light projections on the walls which was really quite breathtaking as a first impression. I had an issue with my room where the toilet seat had this huge crack in it but they immediately changed my room. The day after at breakfast I was greeted by a customer service agent who apologized for my issue with the room and gave me her contact information for any questions or concerns I have. I was really impressed by this level of customer service!  The room itself was extremely spacious, modern and clean. They even had a console where you can change the mood lighting of the room! The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had beautiful black marble everywhere. The hotel has a cute little gym in the basement to serve whatever exercising purposes you have. The hotel has a roof top restaurant where I had breakfast every morning and they had some great breakfast options and good service but the most impeccable thing was the view of London! You can see nearly everything from that roof top, it really was something else. The hotel is also in close proximity to Convent Garden which had some great shopping and restaurants. The hop on hop bus to tour the city was directly across from the hotel, so this was also very convenient. Another thing that I have to mention is that my bags were lost by the airline and it was a very stressful situation trying to locate where they were and get them delivered to my hotel and the hotel staff was so amazing, helpful and empathetic during that whole ordeal, they really helped lessen the stress of the situation. In all, I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to London!",5,2019,01,22
148,Thank you all at ME London,"My partner and I stayed at the ME Hotel over the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. We were greeted by the friendly staff in the immaculate and stylish lobby and received a glass of Prosecco on arrival at check in. Check In was quick and the staff were great. 

We stayed in one of the passions suites which was incredible!! The room was stylish and spacious and I can tell you now, even the website photos don‚Äôt do it justice. 

We visited the rooftop bar and unfortunately somebody spilt red wine all down my partners, suede designer boots. Despite this the staff couldn‚Äôt have been better or more attentive, we received apologies, complimentary drinks immediately and a bottle of soda water, we received information on the hotels dry cleaning service and overall it really felt as though they cared! 
The next day even at check out, they asked about the boots and wished us their best...it‚Äôs the little things!! 

Thank you all at ME London for an incredible trip! I couldn‚Äôt recommend more!",5,2019,01,21
148,30th birthday treat,great stay in a great location great hotel thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! My fianc√© lost the diamond from her ring whilst there and all of the staff were great in helping to find it!!! And did! We went to stk which was great food and atmosphere and radio rooftop great views and vibe,5,2019,01,21
148,Amazing!,"We have had the full ME London experience last week and it has been amazing. Check in was quick, friendly and informative. The moment you step in the hotel you know you have arrived in something quite special. The iron bars create a mysterious and stylish look. Great picture opportunity as well!  After dropping our luggage off in the spotless clean room we went for drinks in Radio Rooftop bar which is the hotspot of the area. Music loud but not annoying at all, with a great and quick service. Drinks are on the expensive side of things but made with care and perfection. We had dinner in STK and this was the best steak we have ever had. Again, not cheap but definitely worth it. The meat is grilled to perfection, and the sauces and sides are soooo good! The look and feel of the restaurant ties in with the rest of the hotel and is very cool and stylish. Service was very good and as we were talking a lot, we didn't even notice our glasses being topped up constantly. The last thing you want is a waiter interrupting you all the time! 
The location of the hotel is perfect to venture out in London but you might as well stay in the hotel as they have everything on offer!",5,2019,01,21
148,Nice touch ,"My partner and I spent the weekend at Me London for his birthday. I have called the hotel ahead and informed them about the celebration and the room was decorated, the music was on and the champagne and cake was on the table (all complimentary).

Nice hotel, good bed, clean room, just perfect! ",5,2019,01,21
148,Our favorite stay during our honeymoon!,"my wife and I were celebrating our honeymoon in Europe over 24 days. We traveled to multiple cities in Italy, Paris, Amsterdam, and finished the trip in London. We booked the ME hotel and it ended up being our favorite stay throughout our tripped. We were greeted in the lobby by the friendly staff member who I can't remember the name of, but he took us over to reception and made sure our bags were taken care of. At the front desk, we were helped out by Laura. I let her know we were on our honeymoon and she gave us an upgraded to a suite which was highly appreciated. Next, she gave us the great tip to eat at the restaurant, Zela, which was located inside the hotel. This ended up being our favorite meal during our honeymoon and I can't recommend it enough. What we didn't know was that Laura set up an extra special treat for us in our room when we we returned. They were rose petals, chocolate covered strawberries, and a nice bottle of champagne. The mood lighting was set in the room and the music was romantic. They also left us a special message on the bathroom mirror as well as a lovely card. Both my wife and I were blown away. We tried not to drop the honeymoon card during our stay but it just happened to come out in the conversation and I'm glad I did because Laura and the rest of the staff at the me hotel definitely created an experience that we will remember. I have already told all my friends that they should visit this establishment next time they're staying in London. Thank you to all the staff for creating such a great experience for us.",5,2019,01,20
148,Ultra modern luxury,"ME by Melia is ultra-modern, which you can regard as a plus or a minus depending on your outlook. The rooms are bang up to date, spacious, and it didn't prove difficult to master most of the tech (well at least I figured out how to change the temperature and turn the lights on and off). A large well appointed bathroom with dual shower and a very high standard of cleanliness was also very welcome. The room had an excellent view, and external noise did not penetrate at all. However, the best part of the experience was the staff, who were consistently friendly, helpful and professional. We also enjoyed breakfast in the 10th floor restaurant, which had a fantastic view and the food and service were good as well. There is very little to report on the negative side of the equation. Reception is spectacular, but quite difficult to find, and personally I found the mattress was not that comfortable on my lower back, but I suspect for most people it would be fine. An extremely enjoyable stay and I'm sure we will return.",5,2019,01,20
148,Amazing Experience,"Thank you all the staff for the fantastic experience! Stayed with some friends to celebrate a special occasion. Very attentive staff. Good food and beautiful rooftop bar. Beautiful hotel, with be back and will recommend.",5,2019,01,18

148,"Stunning, Modern Hotel","A Stunning hotel in a great location (only 5-10 min walk to Covent Garden), greeted very kindly and promptly on arrival and was accompanied up to the 1st floor where the reception is. Whilst checking in we were offered a glass of Prosecco and the room where the reception is was unbelievable, really is something you need to see. 

Our room was more than spacious and as were celebrating our anniversary, we had been giving a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries as well as a romantic message left on the mirror. A very nice gesture.

We were extremely well looked after throughout our visit to the hotel and had a wonderful time, will certainly return in the future.",5,2019,01,18
148,Modern and luxurious,"Brilliant location, 5 min walk to Covent Garden station and shops, staff were so friendly and helpful.

One of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The little features were just as perfect, with menu and chocolates left in the hotel room for when me and my boyfriend returned that evening. Would defiantly recommend this place as it‚Äôs ideal for its location with phenomenal service and facilities. Also great view of London was an added bonus. ",5,2019,01,16

The hotel has a warm welcoming, helpful staff and classy and spacious rooms. 
We were particularly impressed with Radio Roof Top bar which had a incredible overlooking view of London at night.

148,Amazing hotel that never disappoints!,"Earlier this month, my husband and I stayed at ME for the second time. Once again, the stay was perfect, the staff are friendly and inviting, the rooms cleaned to the highest of standards and the food at ZELA (located on the ground floor) is of the best quality. The weather was rather cold so we didn‚Äôt go to the rooftop, but we have been before and it is a must on a lovely sunny day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London whether on business or leisure. ",5,2019,01,14

Hotel is so stylish, cool, trendy and with an outstanding personality!!!

The Aura team prepared a very special surprise as it was my special day, thank you so much!!!!! 

Marconi‚Äôs bar at lobby is great, and then you access the reception at the first floor. OMG! It makes you feel fabulous and it‚Äôs so unique, the receptionist are great explaining you everything (thank you!) and concierge helps you with great information about what to do in the city and with any reservation needed. 

Also they have two restaurants on the ground floor. One is a steak house with good vibes where you can even stand and dance a bit as a live Dj delivers some beats, and the Zela fusion kitchen restaurant whit great style and very nice ambience. 

But the rooftop takes you experience to a higher level, charming staff delivering a great service, good food and greater cocktails. What a view!!! As it‚Äôs one of the most tall buildings in the area you can see two sides from London with spectacular views to the T√°mesis, Golden eye, and all the amazing buildings on the south west.

The ME London made me feel totally special. Thank you all so much!

148,Left Credit Card behind and returned - Andrei-Vasile Vrasmas,"Visited STK for a client lunch and had a great experience. The staff are always friendly and helpful.

On this occasion I left my card behind the bar from pre drinks. I contacted ME Hotel and Andrei was very brilliant. He asked me to send an email with a scanned copy of my driving license and I said he would then post the card back to me. I know I could have just cancelled the card and got a new on, but it would have meant a lot of hassle as I have lots of standing orders from this card number.

Thanks again Andrei for the effort in getting my card back to me.

148,Emiliano-way more than just a concierge,"I've stayed at the ME hotel for 2 nights during October. It was my very first time in London so ive contacted the concierge dept for assistance. As a concierge myself, I was truly amazed by the dedication of Emiliano who helped with all (and there were a lot!) of my questions. When I arrived at the hotel, we've met and trust me - this was just the beginning! 
Emiliano made sure I'll get the best room and even upgraded me. He took care of all our needs and even got my brother last minute tickes to Chelsea's game (front seats!)
Emiliano is a credit to the Hotel. He portrays the epitome of real excellent customer service. Always smiling and welcoming every time of the stressful day.
Thanks Emiliano - I cant wait to come back!

BTW-make sure you visit the Radio Rooftop Bar, it is super chic and stunning.",5,2018,12,31

148,ME Hotel London,"Great hotel! service and facilities are first class. Very modern hotel in the middle of the theatre district in London, everything is nearby but I cannot say enough for the first class service in the hotel. The concierge team made everything easy, you ask they deliver, people like Emiliano, Arman and Leandro who made our stay an extremely pleasant experience cannot say enough of the service delivered from these folks. The room was very accommodating and modern with a great balcony. We had a package that included free breakfast and the breakfast at Zela‚Äôs the restaurant in the hotel was outstanding, again the service was outstanding at Zela‚Äôs, Pepino Buonono went the extra mile to make us feel at home. I travel for a living and I have seldom seen this kind of service. Thanks to: Emiliano Del Pizzo, Arman Bernardino, Leandro Garcia, Pepino Buonono and others that unfortunately I did not get their names for making this a great trip and a great anniversary, THE ME HOTEL in London is a great hotel experience in its totality, THANKS!",5,2018,12,31

148,Great stay and superb propery!,"We had an opportunity to spend 2 nights recently at ME London hotel, and cant say enough about the place from the welcome and drinks upon the arrival to the stunning night views from panoramic rooftop.
Located in the heart of the Strand and just inbetween Admiral Nelson on the one side and Temple Bar Dragon on the other, this hotel truly made our overall stay in London magnificent.

Very enjoyable experience from the room features, friendliness of the team to the fun crowd and vibe in the Rooftop bar. Definitely, you could felt that Christmas festive season was just around the corner as hotel was beautifully decorated throughout. 

Would recommend anyone to stay here, and I know surely we will be coming back",5,2018,12,30
148,I love ME ‚ù§,We had a very warm welcome upon arrival and one of the porters escorted us to the first floor to be checked in where we were given a complimentary glass of cava. The rooms were beautiful and the roof top bar is amazing. Looking to come back in the new year.,5,2018,12,30
148,Super cool,Stayed here as friends were having a party on the rooftop. We had a great time. The Concierge were a real help with parking our car and helping us get some last minute clothes for the night. The reception looks really cool. Fantastic spot. The icing on the cake is the Radio bar. The cocktails were amazing and we had a great time.,5,2018,12,30
148,Amazing all round hotel !,This is one of my all time favourite hotels in the world. Awesome outfit run by a great management team. The rooms have always been lovely to stay in and I‚Äôve had the pleasure of one of their suites before which is a must! The radio bar roof terrace venue has one of the best views in london and their latest concept *Fire and Ice* is so authentic and cosy. They now do breakfast in the roof and their new fresh juice selection is so good!,5,2018,12,30

The waitress came over with two glasses of champagne and mentioned the Jica the security told her.",5,2018,12,30
148,Luxury Uber Cool  Experience,"You walk in and for a moment you are confused, is this a hotel? Everything about ME London oozes design and style! Not the average hotel lobbby bar but an ultra cool design which they told me was done by Norman Foster, beautiful!
The reception, it‚Äôs an Atrium with a skylight, and the Christmas tree, I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, a piece of art or scupture?
The room we stayed in had a balcony and amazing views both day and night! 
The staff were friendly and the Steakhouse excellent, the funny and happy clientele....kept us amused all night long! 
We wanted to extend our stay through to New Year‚Äôs Eve but no rooms available, we are considering to come back next year for sure! Apparently it‚Äôs the best place to see the fireworks!",5,2018,12,29
148,Service and comfort in the heart of London,ME London was new to me when I searched for a hotel where we intended to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 18th birthday. Amazing location with stylish modern decor and superb culinary options. Impeccable service and excellent advice and suggestions from a very professional and knowledgeable concierge named Emiliano. We had a wonderful visit and will most definitely be coming back. ,5,2018,12,29
148,Superb location!,"Had another great stay at ME London! It is just such a bustling location, and in the festive season just the perfect place to be!

148,Incredible experience,"Visited from Cornwall with my family last week. I must say, the experience we had was beyond amazing. 

Radio Bar was wonderful. I‚Äôm costrophibic and poor Gerrard from Security at Radio Bar went the extra mile to walk me up and down the stairs. 

Highly recommended!",5,2018,12,28
148,Great hotel with amazing rooftop bar,"I stayed in this hotel in March of this year when we came to London from Copenhagen. 
Excellent music throughout the hotel lobby, super helpful staff members always ready to assist 
My elderly Mum called several times for assistance and everytime someone came in with a smile. 

We stayed in a balcony room and enjoyed the view of London from the balcony. 

We ended our trip with a night at the rooftop bar and both myself and my parents enjoyed the incredible view of London from the bar.",5,2018,12,28
148,"Amazing hotel,  service and location in festive London","I stayed at ME hotel London once again, and again it was amazing! This time I stayed for Christmas. The hotel looked amazing. Please visit Covent Garden which is so close by (only 4 min walk) and beautifully decorated during Christmas time. Or catch a musical which is around the corner as well. 
Every staff member is taking service to the next level. Everyone is so knowledgeable, willing to help and genuine friendly (which I, as a Dutchie really appreciate). 
The breakfast is lovely and such a great view over London, it never gets old. Love it every time and I certainly will come back. See you soon!",5,2018,12,28
148,The Unfortunate Incident,"My partner and I stayed at the WE for four nights in late November. We chose the hotel mainly for the incredible price we got through Hotwire, but also based on the reviews here. 

The architecture is stunning. You check in on the second floor in a room that looks like a temple to hospitality highlighted by an Atrium that seems to reach the roof of the building. The rooms are bright and modern and we found the bed very comfortable with good pillows.

The staff on the whole are very nice, if not always on the mark. We found the restaurant recommendations to be pretty far off from what we had described we wanted, particularly around price. Three different times we were sent to restaurants where the bill, without any alcohol was over 100 pounds ($125) despite our instructions that we wanted something moderate inexpensive and casual. Not only was there a miss on the price point, but we also asked for someplace chill and all three were uber trendy and noisy. That's fine, but that's not what we asked for.

While our room was private and quiet, the hotel on the whole gives off a ""party"" vibe. The music in the ground floor bar was ear-splitting and the room deserted or almost deserted every time we passed through on our way out. Perhaps, we are not (or not any longer) the target audience for a swinging atmosphere like the ME provides.

While the hotel may skew too young for me; when all is said and done, it was a fairly nice stay... until the UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT. Readers, be aware that what follows may be a little graphic.

One afternoon, we came back to the room after an early dinner, and took a nap. When we woke up things got, um, romantic. Pretty soon we found ourselves having a gay old time on top of the bed. Suddenly, the door to our room opened and a member of the housekeeping staff caught us ""in flagrante delicto."" 

She and I made eye contact and after a moment of shock, I just started to laugh. Unfortunately, she screamed. I mean really screamed and made us feel very uncomfortable by the level of her horror. It read as very homophobic even though I have no proof of that, just my gut.

We brought this incident to the attention of the concierge. He expressed concern and was very apologetic. He said he would make sure it didn't happen again. He specifically asked me to let him know when we left the room the next evening, so he could make sure the room was turned down. We followed his request. He was right, it didn't happen again. They just skipped the turn-down service completely.

The ME provided a memory that we will not soon forget. Unfortunately.",3,2018,12,28
148,"Wow, Wow, Wow - the best hotel I have ever stayed","True example of 5 star hospitality! I have never written a review but ME London hotel absolutely amazed me. My partner and I stayed here over the weekend to celebrate his birthday and we were impressed. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by concierge then taken to reception and offered a glass of Cava. Our room had a birthday set up with balloons, bottle of champagne and cake. 

We have met General Manager Samantha- what a lovely woman, who recommended us to visit Radio Rooftop Bar and Zela Restaurant which are located inside of ME hotel. Radio bar offers a spectacular London view, Dj and amazing vibe. After a few cocktails in Radio Bar we had a nice dinner in Zela - Mediterranean, Japanese cuisine. Definitely, must visit both when staying in ME London!

All hotel members were truly amazing and made our stay special.

Thank you!",5,2018,12,28
148,Great stay and lots of positive changes ,"Had a fantastic stay at the ME two weeks ago. Lots of great changes since we last stayed. The bar had a more friendly and fun crowd plus the DJ was really good. Antoine the manager looked after us well before we went for dinner at the new restaurant. 
Great that they are still pet friendly, the dogs enjoyed the stay as much as we did. Will definitely go back. ",5,2018,12,28
148,Fantastic for X-Mas shopping,"We stayed at the ME London Hotel, to do some X-Mas shopping and it was an amazing experience. The location is great, close to all all major shopping areas, including Covent Garden and Oxford street. This is definately the hotel I will come back to, next time around",5,2018,12,28
148,Excellent choice,"Centrally located for business purposes and (evening) entertainment, with Radio Rooftop and STK at the hotel and Covent Garden close by. Amazing design, great staff, excellent food and cocktails. Well worth the visit and stay",5,2018,12,28
148,Hidden gem in a great location. Ideal luxury modern hotel,"If you like anything modern, you will love the ME. We chose a VIBE room as this seemed spacious in the description. It dodn't let us down. The room was lovely with a street view. I liked the glass curtained V shaped window and the electronically controled mood lighting and air-con. Also a clever motion detector on the bathroom lighting. Fully equiped room and bathroom had all you could ask for. Great reception staff on check-in that is hidden away upstairs from the entrance. A nice bar area for a casual drink. We ate breakfast in the Zela restaurant we everything is brought to your table, an extensive menu which makes up for lack of buffet options. It's a great location within walking distance of Covent Garden/ Trafalger Square and the Thames. Would definitely return.",5,2018,12,25
148,Wow - a beautiful hotel,"We stayed one night as we were attending an event in London as part of my husband's 50th birthday celebrations.  I chose the hotel because of its location and reviews.  We weren't disappointed, we were shown to our room where the staff had left us balloons and cake and a bottle of prosecco - how thoughtful.  The room was modern and minimalist but very cool and with every mod con.  The whole of the hotel is beautiful, amazing design and decor, if a little dark in places - very trendy!  We went to the Radio bar on the roof, I imagine it is even better in the summer, it was very cosy though even in the middle of December.  Our breakfast was delicious and was very quick, which was great as unfortunately we had to check out early.  However I think what sets this hotel apart is its staff.  Every interaction we had with every staff member was good, very professional but in a relaxed informal way somehow.  Every staff member does their utmost to help and assist - I don't think I will stay anywhere else when in London from now on - amazing, thank you.",5,2018,12,20
148,40th Birthday celebrations,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my partners 40th Birthday. I had never stayed here before we spent Saturday and Sunday night at the hotel. It was amazing from start to finish, the staff were all really polite and helpful. The room was beautiful and the hotel went above and beyond to put ballons and other added extras in out room which really mad the whole experience more special. The hotel is in a great location close to lots of restaurants and bars. It was also 10 mins in a cab to the train station and didn't cost a lot. I would difinatley recommend this hotel and will difinatley be returning. Thank you so much to the staff and team who made our stay so special.  ",5,2018,12,19
148,Superb 5 star hotel in great central location!,"Stayed just one night but the experience was great from start to finish.  We had a 9th floor room with a balcony and it was so worth the extra charge with great views over the city roof tops.  The staff were excellent and very helpful and we were offered a welcome glass of bubbly whilst check in was taking place in the perfumed air of the reception area - such a nice touch.  The only slight downside was the Radio Rooftop bar/restaurant which, whilst offering a great vista - lacked the quality and panache of the rest of the hotel - the cocktails were good though and the food was interesting but not in the same league!  We will definitely stay again though as loved the overall experience - well done ME!",5,2018,12,18
148,Great hotel,"Impeccable decor and staff service.lovely Rooms but generalHotel is very dark even in the day.Breakfast was a disaster, stone cold and obviously reheated food because you he bacon was ice cold and the sausages anaemic. The milk jug had dirt in and had to be replaced. ",5,2018,12,17

148,Weekend At The Me Hotel,"Stunning hotel with a fantastic location. Staff were also extremely helpful. The breackfast was between 26-30 pound each which originally we believed was very expensive but it truely delicious. We had left some belongings and they were quick in replying to our email and they had it sent out the same day free of charge to Ireland for us. 

If you get a chance to stay in London in luxury this is the place to go .",5,2018,12,12
148,Stylish and great steaks,"We had a table for eight as a Christmas celebration last week. The restaurant is stylish and very city with a backdrop of loud music. The cocktails were good, the steaks were sublime and it was super busy! Definitely the hangout on the Strand for the cool young things and for great USDA beef. Not the place for you if you want a conversation or a long, slow dinner!",4,2018,12,11
148,Excellent ,"A superb location for theatres and Covent Garden , excellent room standard , superb staff , breakfast was somewhat disappointing however , that would be my one and only criticism, otherwise I can‚Äôt wait to return ",5,2018,12,11
148,AMAZING,"Superb Hotel, Superb service.. Highly recommend for anyone considering this hotel. 
I also left some belongings in the hotel after I checked out. After sending an email to the Hotel they responded immediately and posted the items back and provided a Royal Mail Tracking number for me to track. Thanks to Stefano for sorting this for me. I will be staying here again next time I visit London.",5,2018,12,11
148,Fantastic stay!,Wonderful hotel and welcome for my partners 50th birthday! Fantastic service! Fabulous Room! We had a river facing room with balcony on the 9th floor and couldn't fault it Fantastic panoramic views. Would highly recommend.,5,2018,12,10
148,Wow & Wow,"This is the second time I‚Äôve stayed here. It‚Äôs simply an amazing modern hip hotel with the most helpful staff.

The location made it very easy to walk to Regent Street, Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square, Covent Gardens and the Theatre district. 

Excellently appointed rooms, with mini bar, very modern bathrooms, great WiFi.

We ate at their new Zela restaurant which was another amazing experience.

",5,2018,12,10
148,"Modern, Central, Friendly","Being my first trip to London the ME London was the perfect center of London location and luxury to come back to each evening and escape the London rain and a day of sight-seeing. Located right by the Theater district (big plus for a Broadway buff like me) it was easy to get around to public transport and walkable to the Covent Garden and SoHo districts for great bars and restaurants. The hotel itself is incredibly chic and modern, from the lobby to the staff and facilities (that rooftop bar I mean!). Also special SO to Jarred in security that helped me out and gave me a great tour of the hotel and all when I was lost finding the gym one night, really felt like the extra mile and made the trip all the more relaxing. 

Definitely stay again if ever over the pond again.",5,2018,12,06
148,10th floor bar,"Very nice bar set on top floor (10th floor). Nice seating area inside and an outside terrace with heaters. Very nice, friendly and efficient  staff. The lift clean and fast, a receptionist also downstairs.",4,2018,12,05
148,Great location,"Very modern, elegant hotel. Lovely roof top bar and  nice Japanese restaurant. Staff, as usual for Melia, are super helpful.Only negatives - no iron/board in room to take the creases out your shirt and no shaving mirror  in the bathroom.",5,2018,12,04
148,Outstanding in every way,"Spent a couple of nights at the ME London as part of a treat for the wife‚Äôs birthday. As soon as we entered we were met by a charming young man who took our cases and led us to reception. Our welcome and booking in was warm and efficient.
The hotel is modern, sleek and spotlessly clean. The room spacious and beautifully furnished. The roof top bar continues the theme of warm and welcoming and they offer an excellent selection of fine cocktails. Apparently the Espresso Martini is ‚Äúto die for‚Äù.
As a show of class, the hotel have picked up that it was the wife‚Äôs birthday and on return to our room we found balloons, champagne and cheesecake. A further example of outstanding customer service.
I cannot extol the virtues of this hotel enough. Top to bottom it is excellent.",5,2018,12,04
148,Great location,"Attentive staff, great location, modern and clean hotel, top notch rooftop bar. Walking distance to Covent garden and Waterloo bridge.  We got a room with a balcony which worked great for us. Amazing views. 
",5,2018,12,03
148,Fantastic time celebrating 70th birthday in this beautiful hotel,"We spent one night as a treat to my mother who was celebrating her 70th birthday- and I have just one word to describe this hotel- Amazing!

From entering the hotel we were completely blown away by the visuals, the hotel is stunning!

Check in was smooth, although our room was not quite ready for us, we were provided with complementary drinks which we enjoyed in the lobby. My sister asked the bar tender for a cocktail that was not sweet, green and should have a lime & he rose to the challenge. I regret not asking him for his name as he was wonderful & we would see him throughout our stay.

On entering our room, my mum did cry for joy, staff had written a happy birthday message, there were balloons  and treats, she was over the moon!

The room itself was gorgeous, I liked the tech features and we had a comfortable & restful night.

Breakfast in the morning was delicious, with a good range of options.

All staff we interacted with were professional, yet friendly & approachable.

Overall we had a wonderful stay. The one downside is that my mum enjoyed her birthday stay so much she is asking me to do this for all her birthdays! I'd better start saving then!",5,2018,12,03
148,Great Property - Poor Management,"I have stayed at this hotel in the past and was very happy.    This time,  management has slipped.   I tried to check in to the hotel 2 hours before check in time.   1 PM.   I was tired arriving internationally.    They tried to see me an upgrade for ¬£450 a night to a suite,    Yikes,  more than doubling the price.   Then ¬£70 for a upgrade.   I said keep me in the same room,   They said none available.   Wanting to sleep I took the upgrade.    I got the same room as before, but not cleaned.    The toilet was dirty.   It looked like a coke exploded on the desk mirror.   I went to sleep and was disturbed three times.   Once for fruit.    Once for water.   Once by what sounded like drunk maids asking what I was doing and if they could clean the room.     I wrote management at the email they provided.   They fixed the issues,  but didn‚Äôt respond via email.   Two days later, I get a message on my bed to call the duty manager.   I did.   The duty manager was not aware of why I was calling.    No adjustment made to bill.    No offer to move me to the room I bought,  as I could tell no difference from a normal room,  except that it was clean.

pros.   The hotel is beautiful.   The rooms are nice and big, especially compared to London hotels.   It is technology advanced,   The AC and lighting are controlled by one key pad.    All the lighting is dimable and they have mood lights,",2,2018,12,01
148,Ticks every single box for perfection!,"I have stayed in the Me Hotel twice now, and each time not disappointed.  Having stayed in many London 5* hotels, the Me for me far exceeds all of the others!  From the stylish decor, beautiful ambient music and their own personal fragrance in the air.. it really is up there as the best!  Staff so accommodating and nothing too much trouble.  Looking to visit London again for Xmas shopping and know where I will be staying.  Also highly recommend the STK for a fun atmosphere along with the roof top bar for great cocktails and views of the beautiful city! 
Thank you Me hotel for never disappointing and for making wonderful memories for me! ",5,2018,11,27
148,Many positives...,"This was my 4th time staying in this hotel and we had another really enjoyable experience. Great location. It still looks and feels very new. Love the modern decor. Rooms well appointed and spacious. The only thing I always feel is that the radio rooftop staff are extremely unwelcoming. From being stopped before getting into the lift asking if we are guests at the hotel. My father (in his 70‚Äôs) who was just joining me for drinks and not staying, was asked to go to another entrance and show his ID?! Ridiculous procedure and totally unnecessary. The girl was extremely rude and made me feel really annoyed. I feel like I want to take another star off for this experience but that wouldn‚Äôt be fair on all of the other lovely people (bell boys/room service/check in staff were all very helpful and welcoming) All in all I would definitely return to the hotel but perhaps not to the bar! ",4,2018,11,26
148,didnt quite live up to lofty expectations,"ultra ultra modern hotel where you ""go to be seen"". if your not into really modern d√©cor (black everywhere...) than its not for younot sure that its worth the priceexcellent location 5 mins walk to covent gardensrooms are a bit dark and stuffy- its not possible to open a windows",4,2018,11,25
148,Amazing hotel.,Stopped for my wife's 40th Birthday. Hotel put balloons and a lovely message in the bathroom. Fantastic touch. The hotel is amazing. Rooms are very modern and lighting is great. Best sleep ever on the most comfortable beds.Great location for theatre shows. Would recommend anyone to stop here. We will be back.,5,2018,11,25
148,Nice hotel but didn‚Äôt leave feeling ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù,"While the hotel may be nice, the entrance is odd. I arrived at the street entrance at 6pm which is not the check-in. It was more a lounge/bar area and then I had to take the elevator to the check in. The room felt small and sadly it was the 1st floor above the lounge... I could hear and feel the music loud and clear. I thought it was odd that my luggage didn‚Äôt fit in the closet nor was there a stand to put your luggage anywhere... so it was either on the floor in the small hall between the room and bathroom or on the bed... 

Other than that, the service was good and the room service was quick and always arrived quickly. ",4,2018,11,23
148,Best staff in breakfast radio,"I had the best breakfast in radio rooftop on Monday this young lady named Elif introduced herself as breakfast Server. She gave me the best experience we had a deep conversation with her and my wife we was speaking for more than 10 minutes. Me and my wife are very happy with the service we got from her very warm and sweet welcoming by Elif. He food was perfect my wife was feeling a bit sick so Elif told us that hot water with lemon should help we requested that and it was all perfect. She is one of the top 10 best servers. The next day we had another young Spanish women dealing with us which was good... in generally I am planning to come again for breakfast and I hope I will be served by the first server we had named Elif! 

It was all on spot.",5,2018,11,22
148,Superb!,"Beautiful contemporary property, great location, amazing staff. A truly fine hotel in a city known  for excellent lodging.

148,A spectacular b‚Äôday,"What a wonderful evening! I had called ahead to give notice about my girlfriends 30th birthday when booking a table at Zela. They did not disappoint! In addition to the delicious food and attentive service, we were surprised with a candlit chocolate brownie and a little VIP treatment for post drinks and the very happening Radio Rooftop Bar! 

Thank you to Luke Teeling and the Zela Team for organising and executing a very special celebration x",5,2018,11,19
148,Great staff!!!,I was staying in this hotel on the 10th of this month. I loved the view in Radio bar. The room was excellent and the staff very friendly. I would also like to say big thanks to Andrei from security because he was very helpful by sending what I left behind in the room at my home address.,5,2018,11,18
148,Beautiful hotel in the heart of London!,The Hotel is right in the center of London. The rooms are really comfortable and still had a lot of space even with a cot! The staff is very helpful and we had a great time. We shall definitly be back! ,5,2018,11,15
148,Anniversary,"Me and my partner went to the ME Hotel for our anniversary and was extremely pleased with our stay.As i had told staff before hand of the occassion, they had made such an effort to decorate the room and provided complimentary champagne and chocolate strawberries. It was a lovely touch.We had also booked the rooftop for drinks before dinner and was welcomed by friendly and smiley staff.They showed us round before hand to see where would be best for us to sit. As it was raining and slightly chilly, they had the heaters on.We had a lovely stay and have recommended to all of our friends and will be returning in the near future.",5,2018,11,14
148,What a great hotel experience,"What a great hotel. On arrival taken to the reception atrium, what a reception area. Offered a lovely cold glass of Cava. Lovely. Our room was great. The lighting very good and interesting. The room was clean and so quiet. Radio rooftop bar was brilliant. Great views of London during the day and at night. Sit outside if you can. Staff are very friendly and helpful. We will definitely return",5,2018,11,13
148,"Thank you, Me !!","We had such a lovely experience at ME London, a great warm welcome, we were only there for one night and the lovely gentleman at the front desk upgraded our room! The room was beautful and clean, amazing big bed! Radio roof top was our favourite part, we went up their mulitple times, great cocktails, best place to watch the sunset. It was a bit chilly and one member of the team gave some blankets out. The staff go above an beyond to spoil their guests, its all down to them at the of the day.  So thank you.",5,2018,11,08
148,50th birthday celebration,"We arrived at the Me London at 2.45pm and checked in without a hitch. Our luggage was taken straight up to our Aura room and we were shown the quirky light system and where to find everything in the room. Our room looked out on Mama Mia. 
The bed was big and comfortable, great air con, the room surprisingly quiet for its central location and had everything we needed, especially the lovely toiletries, a walk in shower, robes and slippers.
On my birthday we spent most of the day out with friends and family. It‚Äôs only a 10 minute walk to Covent Garden, the location is excellent!
We had a fantastic day visiting Choccywoccydoodah followed by Bohemian Rhapsody in Leicester Square. I didn‚Äôt think the day could get much better, until I stepped back into our room and saw a lovely birthday message, balloons, Champagne and cake. I was totally blown away. 
My husband had been in cahoots with Beau from the Aura team. Many thanks for such a wonderful stay. I love this hotel and can‚Äôt wait to come back.",5,2018,11,06
148,Magnificent night!!!,"I celebrated my 33rd birthday at ME London, from the valet parking to the decorated room for my Birthday and beautiful view on the rooftop lounge, everything was truly amazing. The hotel manager even gave us a private champagne tasting on there reception floor level.  I was truly made to feel special and my friends and family too. We all felt like we were the only ones in the hotel. Thank you ME London for being the 5* that you are and providing a 5* star experience for me and my friends. We all are happy to come back and visit your other locations too :)",5,2018,11,04
148,Amazing experience,"Amazing experience in Me London hotel, the staff is excellent friendly, helpful and welcoming , the room is one of the most beautiful rooms in London, STK restaurant is great nice food and atmosphere, radio rooftop is a must to visit.",5,2018,11,03
148,Great evening in Radio Bar,"Went for a drink with my two friends. We had a lovely evening with an amazing view. The security guy I think he was Polish, Wojciech, looked after us. 
The drinks and food was served well as expected from such a nice place. I would definitely recommend and for sure go back there. 
Thank you Radio Bar team and Wojciech.",5,2018,10,29
148,Great place to stay,"Stayed here for 10 days. Most people would have gotten sick and tired of the same breakfast, not for us. In fact, we really enjoyed the fantastic service rendered by the service team. The view at the breakfast venue was really breathtaking and it helps that coming from a hot country like Singapore we really appreciated being able to enjoy breakfast alfresco and at the same time having a nice cool morning London breeze. 

If you looking at where to stay whilst in London, this is a great hotel for your consideration. Enjoy!",4,2018,10,28
148,"Fantastic address, fantastic staff!","Great location, sublime interiors (very modern), and most of all the staff is great, accessible, helpful and very polite. We simply loved it. 

We have a 6 year old child and upon entering the hotel I was wary it might not be child-friendly (seeing it is rather a ‚Äòparty‚Äô style place) but actually it is, notably thanks to the staff who decorated the room for his birthday (a big thank you!)

Room space is very good, although 7th floor windows are small and with the hotel‚Äôs overall dark/black themes it may be a bit dark for some, but for us it was ok. 

Breakfast is top, and food is very good overall.

Bus stops right across the street go all across the city, otherwise walking distance to main attractions.
",5,2018,10,28
148,Another great stay,"Stayed on Friday 26th Oct.
What can I say ,lovely room great location.Thanks to all staff who gave a great service.
Thanks to Bo and her team for the lovely extras.
And to Finnish off on Saturday a hot top notch breakfast in radio bar  to set us up for our journey home.
Melia you should be pround of your hotel and staff.",5,2018,10,28
148,Better late then never. This place is awesome!,Having visited Radio Roof Top on a number of occasions in the past staying here was inevitable and I have to say from the moment we arrived for check-in (with prosecco I might add) we were taken care of. Service here is second to none and is in a great location for London meetings or just going out to the theatre.,5,2018,10,27
148,Great great ,Stayed here again for business and I have to say it is always great. From the service of the mostly spanish staff to the excellent rooms. Breakfast now is ordered off the menu the buffet has disappeared and all is excellent. The added access to the roof top bar makes this a groovy place to stay with the bonus of where it is in relation to theatres etc. ,5,2018,10,27
148,Love this place,"We love this hotel and stay regularly. The rooms are great and the service and food is also excellent. The position of it in London is Perfect. The radio roof top bar is definitely worth a drink , great music and atmosphere. ",5,2018,10,26
148,Stunning hotel,"A stunning hotel, in a fantastic location. We had a beautiful room with a fabulous view.All staff were amazing, helpful and very professional. The level of service was exceptional.A 5 star hotel without a doubt.",5,2018,10,25
148,"Amazing hotel, bar and restaurant!","As a frequent traveller I have been lucky enough to stay in some great hotels throughout the world but this one has become my new favourite. It is simply stunning and has everything you need under one roof. The moment you walk in you
Are blown away but the decor and the map projection is a wonderful touch. The service is impeccable, the atmosphere sophisticated and elegant. We stayed one night to celebrate my husbands birthday and the team had decorated the room and provided a cake and champagne. Such a generous gesture often omitted from hotels now and such a lovely surprise. Then more complimentary bubbles before cocktails on the rooftop bar where nothing was too much trouble and the views to die for.  We then had dinner in the restaurant and again was blown away by the service and food. From start to finish was amazing and we can‚Äôt thank the staff enough. We will be returning and I will become a regular as confident my team and colleagues will also love the bar and restaurant. Total gem and surpassed all expectations. Wonderful!",5,2018,10,25
148,ME LONDON 2ND TIME AROUND.,"Well yes this was my second time staying at the ME london and I must tell you it did not disappoint. I got to London a bit early but the hotel had a room available and checked me in so that I could get some rest. The room was as stunning as I remembered from last year.  This time I was able to enjoy dinner with a couple of friends at STK which is fabulous.  As for the Radio Bar . They went above and beyond .  Last year I met my favorite bartender Martina Genova and this year she was still working at Radio making the best Pornstar Martinis. Martina is friendly, and sociable and goes out of her way to make sure you're drinks are made to perfection. My second mention is Laszlo . Laszlo was a new bartender I met this year. This dude is super cool, super friendly and offered up some new drink recommendations. Laszlo took care of my drinks when Martina was off . Try his Casablancas. Then I met Alex who was the most amazing server, he was so efficient and outgoing and made everything so easy having only working there for a week . He was so on point.  Finally Antoine who was one of the Managers of Radio . Thank you for being so attentive and for making my stay there enjoyable. Antoine welcomed my friends and I and treated us like royalty .I never really understand when I read negative reviews about this Hotel. If your fun and have a great sense of self you'll have a great stay at this hotel . If you're looking for a boring lifeless place to stay at this may not be for you. The Me is about life, laughter, good vibes with good friends and great staff. The only thing that I could complain about was that most everyone I met last year year had moved on to other jobs. But I got over that quickly .. forgot to mention hotel us located in a really great area as well ..",5,2018,10,24
148,Birthday Weekend at ME London,"Had the most fantastic birthday weekend at ME London, such a beautiful hotel. The STK restaurant was delicious and the Radio rooftop bar had the most amazing views. The staff were beyond helpful and made our stay a memorable experience. We will definitely be returning back there and will be recommending our friends and family.",5,2018,10,22
148,Magnificent staff and excellent location,"This is the second time i have stayed at this hotel. The staff are fantastic, very welcoming and engaging, and extremely helpful. The location is close to theatres and the river. I requested a room upgrade and was blown away with what i received. Will definitely be returning!!",5,2018,10,21
148,30th birthday celebrations ,"This has been our 2nd visit to this hotel, and once again it was amazing! The staff are friendly and helpful, they make everything so easy. We only stayed 1 night but they made our stay extra special as it was my partners 30th birthday. We would definitely recommend this hotel. We still haven‚Äôt used the rooftop bar or the restaurant so can‚Äôt comment on these but the hotel is clean and modern! Can‚Äôt wait to return. ",5,2018,10,20
148,"Excellent location, and very friendly Staff, Highly recommended!","Very central location and friendly staff! There is no noise from the streets to keep you awake, and while this property is not like the one in Cancun, you still feel like a Rock Star, a highly recommended place in the heart of London. Thanks!",5,2018,10,19
148,Weekend break,Return visit and hotel staff were excellent. Very friendly and helpful. Room very quiet for a central London hotel. Excellent location and would not hesitate to recommend to friends and family and will certainly return in the future. HopeFife,5,2018,10,18
148,Couldn‚Äôt pick a better hotel,"The hotel is faultless, stayed here 3 times and I will keep coming back. Hotel is beautiful staff are helpful and rooms are stunning. Favourite hotel by a mile! Check in is always so Welcoming, our bags was taken before we got into the hotel, then was in our room in no time. Enjoyable stay as always! ",5,2018,10,16
148,Great Customer Service ,"We had some trouble in the beginning checking in, but the staff made up for it. Very nice people. Welcoming and accommodating. The rooms were very clean. They have a turn down service every night. The rooftop bar is night clubish and not really my style but has a great view. ",5,2018,10,16
148,Lovely modern hotel.,"We stayed there Friday night. We were offered  drinks on arrival in reception, which is a very impressive space. The room was very modern and well kept. We had a room with a balcony and were lucky with the weather so were able to enjoy a really good breakfast (one of the best I‚Äôve had in a hotel) overlooking the Thames / London",5,2018,10,14
148,Trendy hotel in the heart of London,"Brilliant, modern, trendy hotel with lovely hotel bars - the roof top one is amazing! Highly recommended for a special trip. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Covent Garden and a lot of the main theatres",5,2018,10,13
148,birthday treat,"We were made to feel very special on our recent stay at the ME London as we were on our previous stays. Nothing was too much trouble and all the staff were very friendly and attentive. The location is really convenient for Covent Garden and the theatres on the Aldwych, Drury Lane and The Strand.",5,2018,10,10
148,Mixed feelings .... ,"The good:  the bed was amazingly comfortable - I slept like a baby.  Room was incredibly and amazingly quiet.  Large room size - much larger than most rooms I have experienced in London. Great bathroom.  Fabulous room setup overall.

The not-so-good: While I realize the black marble and black-lit hallways are a stylistic choice meant to contrast with the white of the rooms, the overall feeling for a female solo traveler walking from the elevator to my room was unsettling, and frankly, kind of creepy. Additionally, this hotel is a little over-the-top with trying to appeal to the super-cool kids club.  I‚Äôve stayed at W hotels that were more accommodating to varying demographics (in particular, the over-40 club that actually can afford these types of hotels) than this place.   

If you have money to spend, are over 40, and want a great experience, I recommend you look elsewhere. I‚Äôve stayed in several London properties that far exceed what you can get from this hotel overall. ",3,2018,10,09
148,Definitely a cool hotel,This hotel has one of the most amazing lobbies you will see.  I used my melia points to stay here and was upgraded to an Aura Suite.  A nice fruit platter and bottle of wine in the room.  Room was high end with one of the best bathrooms I have seen.  this hotel is in an excellent location.  Breakfast was cooked to order and really good.  Could not fault my stay in any way.,5,2018,10,09
148,Attended for training - What a location!,"Wow! What a contemporary look, full of style and class. The staff are so professional and helpful. Me London really have though of every detail - perfect! Magnificent views from the Radio Bar too! :0D",5,2018,10,08
148,Great experience ,"I had stayed in a beautiful twin room just for one night and the stay was perfect! 

The room was fully equipped with all the amenities needed (also hair conditioner) and the hairdryer was really good and fast.

It was a beautiful surprise that the toilet and the shower are separate, the shower is massive and it has two different shower handles, so two people can have a shower together. 

The room has also speakers, in the main room and in the bathroom. You can put your music just with Bluetooth.

And from the check in, we just felt like at home. All the staff was attentive and welcoming, the best was the reception supervisor.",5,2018,10,08
148,Surprise Birthday Trip for Mum,"ME London were so welcoming! My mum had such a wonderful birthday thanks to all the wonderful staff and little thoughtful ideas they came up with! Champagne and cake in the room when we came back from the theatre blew our minds! What a wonderful place to stay! Atmosphere, location, customer service, quality, cleanliness and an amazing roof top bar! ",5,2018,10,08
148,Exceeded expectations,"very modern and contemporary. just a tiny bit too edgy for me in the evenings - almost club/lounge like - which might be the intended effect, but for the old-school me, just slightly over. It doesn't bother me a whole lot though as the level of service and quality overrides it all",5,2018,10,04
148,Stay over for a theatre visit,The hotel is stunning built like a triangle. Welcome drink on arrival. The breakfast was excellent with lots of choice. The rooms are very luxurious and very well equipped. The mood lighting was stunning. The roof top bar was very luxurious with superb views of the city and open to the public. I  thought the drinks were a little over priced and there was a discretionary service charge. This also served as breakfast dining Very friendly and attentive staff,4,2018,10,02
148,Amazing stay at one of the best hotels in london!,"Was staying for 3 nights for my bday, and booked the ‚Äúmode‚Äù room..HUGH helium ballons and delicious cake were waiting for me at the room and the design of the hotel is out of this world! The staff is amazing and always want to make u feel the best! The rooftop is beautiful too and the costumer service is impeccable! Would recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2018,10,02
148,Outstanding,"What an amazing experience! I had heard great things about this hotel and was not disappointed. We were greeted with prosecco and all staff were very helpful. As I had booked this for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday, the hotel had decorated the room with balloons and included a cake and champagne free of charge. We just went for the cheapest room and it was lovely - would definitely recommend to anyone! ",5,2018,10,02
148,Wonderful,Lovely hotel definitely got the wow factor the hotel is very nice as is the restaurant the room we had was a terrace room with balcony the room was a little small compared with some other hotels but that was pretty insignificant every detail has been thought of the staff are very efficient polite and curtious location is a plus as it‚Äôs very central with that in mind it‚Äôs extremely quiet will definitely visit again ,5,2018,10,02
148,family time away,What an amazing hotel the staff couldn't do enough for us all from the moment we stepped out of the taxi  - staff very well dressed and knowledgeable about local area d√©cor was amazing rooms large and comfy will stay again ,5,2018,10,01
148,Wow undiscovered gem,"Top class hotel modern great rooms , staff active friendly attentive , great design and vibe , roof top radio bar , I was very impressed by this hotel , in heart of the theatre land . Evening meal in stk , top class , not cheap but you get what you pay for in life . Classy hotel we be coming often . Give it a spin guys you will love it. Best hotel review I have ever given .",5,2018,09,30
148,Great birthday gift experience,"I booked the hotel for my husband's birthday present weekend in London. I chose it for its proximity to the theatre and evening restaurant options. It was fab! I loved the d√©cor, the room was VERY comfortable and the toiletries etc. all good quality (fluffy towels, nicely scented soaps etc.). So far, so expected. But the staff! They are what makes this hotel. From David and Alex in the concierge team to Elif in the roof-top restaurant they were, without exception: courteous; interested in us and our stay; keen to exceed our expectations; knowledgeable about the hotel and the locality; going the extra mile to ensure we had a great time. It was not cheap but it was very good value for money. I would go again and have already earmarked it as a wonderful gift for the future (e.g. significant wedding anniversary).",5,2018,09,27
148,Modern and pristine,"After the blackness of the elevator and walking down dark passageways, your bright white room resembles a shining light at the end of a tunnel... large, clean bedrooms, spacious well appointed bathrooms (even with face wash), tho a smallish window that I‚Äôd almost have had to stand on a chair to see out of (and came as a surprise as we‚Äôd apparently been upgraded two levels).  The gentlemen at the door, particularly Angelo, are welcoming and extremely helpful, and check in and out was a breeze.  Elevators work with your room key, which gives an air of security which I liked considering that reception is not on ground level.  Breakfast downstairs in a room resembling an Amazon jungle was absolutely delicious and the rooftop bar (which was unfortunately closed on our one free night) offered a complimentary prosecco on my lunchtime visit.  A very modern, high tech hotel, top class and outstanding location for theatres and covent gardens. Rooms offer slippers, bathrobes, nespresso machine (tho not nespresso brand capsules), a small gift selection and plenty of minibar selections, room safe, etc. If the rooftop bar is one of your main reasons for choosing this venue, perhaps check first if it‚Äôs open during your stay to avoid disappointment, and if you need a magnifying mirror for makeup, take your own. Perfect you love modern, and don‚Äôt mind the darkness of the interior passageways and elevator.",4,2018,09,27
148,Well trained staff,"The best part of this hotel is the staff, they are well trained and polite. The hotel is quite and elegant. The breakfast was delicious and served by very much trained crew. I will certainly consider the hotel in my next trip to London. ",5,2018,09,27
148,One of the best in London,"Great location, excellent Hotel and even better staff! Just a few meters from Covent Garden, the rooms are very spacious and modern and the whole hotel is an architectural landmark. The breakfast is √° la carte and very good. I will return.",5,2018,09,26
148,Awful,"Waited far too long for dinner (an hour) & breakfast, service extremely slow. Coffee & breakfast was cold. Only 1 lift working out of 3 & didnt want us to use the stairs because it was scruffy & not designer looking like the rest of the hotel! 
Couldnt work out the lights or phone (needed an iron) 
Too much emphasis on looks & not enough on what actually matters.
Wouldnt stay here again & wouldnt recommend.",1,2018,09,26
148,GREAT HOTEL BUT PAYMENT ISSUES,"Have visited this hotel on a couple of occasions as a non resident & have always found the hotel very nice, the staff extremely pleasant & the overall experience positive. This latest visit was for my daughters 20th birthday & we had drinks & ate in the Radio Bar on the rooftop in the golden sunshine & had a very nice time. 

My only issue is, if you are a non resident & order any food or drinks then you have no alternative but to hand over your bank/credit card as a payment security which is fine in itself but you will not see your card again until you make final payment. I‚Äôm sure the staff are entirely trustworthy but find this process very unusual in an age where we are constantly informed  by banks etc not to let you bank details out of your sight at any time in case these details fall into the wrong hands. This issue may not bother many but I personally felt slightly uneasy with this procedure. I have not experienced this process at any other establishment that I have visited in many years & I dine out often.",4,2018,09,25
148,"Great location, amazing staff...the ME is for me!","Upon entering the ME hotel we realized this was not at all our style of hotel/accommodations. It was a very upscale, dark polished marble pointy walls (modern architecture), fancy, high scale, ritzy place. The room was lovely-although the glass enclosed pointy V shaped window closure was again not our style and the computer digital control panel for all lighting, ac, heat, music was a challenge to learn. As was the motion detector lighting in the bathroom areas. Don‚Äôt take too long or stand still or you‚Äôre showering in the dark. The rooftop bar and dining was spectacular!! Loved the views. 
The staff of the ME was beyond amazingly attentive. They answered every question with tact, diplomacy and decorum. They found out where the Patriots NFL game was being broadcasted and mapped out directions for us. They recommended more homestyle budget friendly cooking restaurants. They called us an Uber when our transport failed to arrive to pick us up and transport us to the airport. 
Just for the exceptional service of this hardworking staff, I would stay at the ME again. I recommend it to my family and friends!",5,2018,09,24
148,Amazing,"This is one of the most amazing hotel I have been to. apart from the entrance area with the bar, the atmosphere is all black and dark, full of candles and amazing smells all over.

The room is big, the shower is even bigger and everything is so technological and luxurious. I had two tables in the room and a huge minibar. All of the amenities were supplied. Soundproof.

The rooftop bar offer a stunning view of the city, the dining room STK keeps with the dark theme and offers a delicious menu. Maybe a bit too loud.

Breakfast room was very delicate but if I have to be honest I didn't enjoy the choices of breakfasts. Personal taste, I would prefer more combination of menus (you can only choose in between four menus).
",5,2018,09,23
148,One Night Stay - Poor Sleep,"The hotel has a really interesting style about it and the staff are welcoming and professional striking a good balance between formality and friendly and the intent seems to be to ensure guests have a good stay.

The room was comfortable and stylish with a fantastic bed and great shower and the walls and doors are thick and their was little street noise - I was on the 9th floor. On checking in and dropping things off in my room I felt confident I'd have a good restful night. It looks and feels like an excellent hotel.

However my room was beneath the rooftop bar and on returning to the hotel later that evening, while I could hear no music and no voices, I was kept awake by what sounded like the scraping of chairs on the bar floor until 2 in the morning. It was loud, jarring and sufficiently random that you couldn't ""get used to it"".

I expect to wake up feeling fresh and ready for the day ahead and so this fell WELL short of what I expect of a 5* hotel.

For me the one thing a hotel has to get right is a good nights sleep - everything else is a bonus. I was asked about my stay at check out and was assured that if I stayed again I would be located on another floor and I'm sure thats the case and if I was staying another night I'm sure I would have been offered another room, I get the sense their a an attention paid to such things, but on this stay - not good at all.",2,2018,09,21
148,Beautiful & Modern with Excellent Customer Service,This hotel was very much to my liking from modern decor and excellent level of service to the location. The check in lobby was very impressive. Our room was perfect and had a nice city view. Staff was friendly and very helpful. I recommend checking out the awesome rooftop bar in the evening.  I ended up losing my wallet and the security staff took great care in contacting me once it was located. They even mailed it back to me at no cost as was already back in the US.  I will definitely be back next time I am in London.,5,2018,09,20
148,Nearly delivers,"Nice hotel public areas but the standard rooms are small and sterile. Comfortable enough and nice bathroom but you do get a sense of claustrophobia. 
Snotty barman up at Radio on the roof as well hence the mark down. ",4,2018,09,20
148,Excellent,"ME London just screams modern professionalism through and through. You are greeted by staff once you walk in, and they are very courteous to you. I have enjoyed my stay there a lot.

The entire hotel is sented with black/white theme, so be aware if you can't stand it. Everything else is pretty much perfect here, and hotel staff seems very eager to help you solve any issues that comes up.

The room is stylish and clean, worth its 5 star rating. Amenity is superb, view is good, bed is comfortable. I think ventilation inside needs some improvements since there's no way to open the window.

Overall very nice experience with the hotel. 9.9/10 would recommend.",5,2018,09,19
148,"ME London,","Oustanding hotel, from the moment you walk in from the street the hotel is impressive, from reception area even to finding your room, and the views if your lucky enough to have a room with a view over london. wish had the chance to eat at STK, maybe next time",5,2018,09,18
148,Excellent stay,When you arrive your greeted by the concierge service who were happy to take the bags and have them put into the room. On checking in we were given a complimentary glass either alcoholic or non alcoholic you could decide. The whole hotel is scented and very welcoming with a simplistic but well decorated look. This theme and attention to detail and quality continued through out the hotel and are room.,5,2018,09,18
148,Unforgettable!,"What a wonderful experience we had last week at the ME London! From the moment we stepped out of the cab to the minute we left, the staff was so attentive and helpful. The bellman not only greeted us and took our luggage in, but walked us up to the lobby. As our room wasn't quite ready, we were offered champagne or orange juice or water. Beau Coleman quickly met us and sat with us until she received word that we could check in. She escorted us to our room so she could see our faces when we opened the door!! (Her words!). I immediately started to cry when I saw the rose petals and champagne and the message she wrote on our bathroom mirror (a beautiful quote) to help us celebrate our anniversary!! The concierge was outstanding. Arman recommended a restaurant one night when we had theater tix (Chicetti). Outstanding! The next day, he stopped us to ask how dinner was and how we enjoyed the play!! The location near the theaters and Covent Gardens cannot be beat. Everything is within walking distance. The bed, of the bed! So comfortable. And I miss my Nespresso!!! The room was SO quiet. The decor was minimalist and chic. Such a friendly staff and we can't wait to return!!",5,2018,09,17
148,Amazing,"I was extremely impressed with my stay at this hotel.  From the moment I arrived to the moment I left was just a great experience.
My taxi pulled up outside and I was immediately greeted and helped out of the taxi and my luggage taken inside, I was shown to the reception area to check in.
Check in was perfection - a glass of water or cava was offered - the young lady at reception (Laura) informed me my room was not ready but they had another available, so I eagerly upgraded for a very small charge.
My room was incredible - spacious and luxurious.
At one stage we had an issue as we could not thread a needle to stitch a garment, with embarrassment we called reception who sent up a wonderful young lady (Khabiba) who was an absolute dream and helped us.
Nothing is too much to ask - the staff are polite, approachable, extremely helpful and you are always greeted with a smile.
Breakfast was a delight and the variety of food available on room service is a delight.
I highly recommend a stay here - well worth every penny.",5,2018,09,17

148,Fabulous!,I read TripAdvisor reviews and nearly didn‚Äôt book as some were quite worrying. As far as I‚Äôm concerned the negative comments proved unfounded. We had an amazing service right from when we pulled up outside with the attentive bell boys to the friendly reception staff. Room was lovely as was breakfast and I would recommend the MEto all my friends wanting to stay in London. It is very central too- close to the theatre venues.,5,2018,09,16
148,Birthday Celebrations,"I stayed at the ME a few weeks back for my birthday and it was literally one of the best experiences, it just gets better every time we stay (this is our 5th time at the ME). At check in I was offered champagne and upon arrival to my room I was greeted with a birthday card, balloons, champagne, cakes and a sweet birthday message on the mirror, how amazing !!!! The details the ME put into making my birthday special were just fabulous and the radio rooftop bar is a MUST it is overwhelmingly stunning.
Our room was on the sixth floor with a lovely balcony overlooking the views of the city. floor and was very modern in style, but with plenty of comfort also. The bed was a super king and was super comfy with great bedding. The bathroom area is well appointed with a fabulous rainfall style shower and plenty of toiletries. 
We had breakfast in bed the every day and everything arrived so lovely, great breakfast menu with a lot to choose from. Sara and all her team are amazing, they made us feel so special and she ensured we were well looked after. ME London is one of the best hotels in London. Perfect attention and luxury quality in every detail of the stay and i cant wait to come back at Christmas to stay here again. ME we love you xxx

148,Birthday Trip,"I stayed at ME London for my birthday trip a few weeks back and it was literally one of top hotel experiences. At check in I was offered champagne and upon arrival to my room I was greeted with a birthday card, balloons, champagne, and a sweet birthday message on the mirror. The rooftop bar and staff were amazing! The STK experience was amazing! It was a very young and fun vibe all around the hotel. Oh and the location is amazing! I have never really into any of this hotel groups properties but after that experience I will always check to see if they have hotel options at my travel destinations! ",5,2018,09,12
148,Amazing hotel,The best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The whole experience was fantastic from check-in to check-out. The staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us and made my wife‚Äôs birthday a very special occasion. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. ,5,2018,09,12
148,A truly FUNKY hotel that's in a fabulous location,"Go for this hotel to:
- get a fabulous location
- live among a truly funky interior (where else do you have the option of getting a THONG along with the usual mini bar stuff?!!) and ultra modern design
- get great access to happening places within and in the vicinity
***
This is one excellently designed hotel with quite a few happening places, whether it's the rooftop bar or the STK restaurant. The reception itself is out of this world, with its see-right-through-to-the-sky design. Even your rooms have fully customisable lighting (including colours). The best part I like about this very popular place, especially on weekends (locals told me TV/football stars are regular party animals here), is its WONDERFUL LOCATION. Staying here puts you right on the Strand Street at a place that's very close to the Temple Metro/Tube station near Waterloo Bridge on Victoria Embankment and also within reasonable walking distance of the more historically situated Charing Cross Station (that's below Trafalgar Square). Address wise, you have the Indian high commission bang next to your hotel and opposite is the Waldorf Astoria/One Aldwych hotels. Even better is the amazing amount of pubs, theatres and places of interest you get just round the corner in ALL directions -- believe me, you will have to do a Google Map search to realise this...",5,2018,09,11
148,Eureka the wow factor 5 stars. The moment you arrive to the moment you depart the service is second to non .,"Check in to check out you are looked after to the amazing pyramid projection visually stunning with bursts of scents mixed with cathedral cluster candles black marble black carpet all add to the mix waking up the senses , seeing is believing , it does not end there as the bedrooms have every conceivable extra we had a balcony up graded room the most comfortable bed we have had the pleasure to sleep in . The famous radio bar comes to life in the evenings same room for breakfast far reaching veiws accros the capital making this location a must for the Lyceum Theatre and surrounding theatre land also The Buckingham Palace tour and tour bus . We really enjoyed our stay in the capital we will be back üòéüòéüòé",5,2018,09,10
148,Avoid,I didn‚Äôt think it could be worse the the Melia whitehouse but it is...... the decor is poor and not inkeeping and the service is the slowest and most inefficient I have ever came across... not even near value for money or luxury ,1,2018,09,10
148,A Squires - Abbott Medical,"High prices, slow service in rooftop bar for all food. The room was great and I liked the shower and bathroom facilities and soaps etc provided. Wifi worked well and TV was reasonable. I did't scan for other services such as movies.",3,2018,09,10

148,Most amazing place in London!,"I booked to stay here for my boyfriends birthday, we literally had the most amazing time ever. Everything was made perfect and so much care was taken, from the moment we arrived the concierge took the car, took our bags and then we were greeted with a drink at reception. Check in was very nice, the whole interior is beautiful and the smell around the hotel is lovely! We got shown to our room and the lovely lady came in and showed us how to work everything, in the room the Aura team made everything so special we had the lovely mirror message, balloons on the bed, a cake and a bottle of champagne waiting. 
We had breakfast in bed the next day and everything arrived so lovely, great breakfast menu with a lot to choose from. 
Overall, we had the most amazing experience and ME London made my boyfriend birthday with their amazing service and very person touch, 100% I would stay here again. Thank you so much! ",5,2018,09,06
148,Stunning Marbel reception,"What a stunning Motel,,,very clean and extremely modern, with the most unusual window in our room, like a triangle you could stand in. The staff were friendly & helpful. Great views from our room, close to bus stops, pubs, shopping & restaurants. We would stay there again",5,2018,09,06
148,Me london,Very clean and modern. Reception area is lovely and STK is a very fun and lively place to eat aimed towards young people I would say. The fact that reception is on the first floor makes the checkin and checkout process so much easier. Loved our stay here. ,5,2018,09,05
148,Beautiful hotel - but food was disappointing ,"We chose to visit the ME hotel as it was located next to Somerset House. We booked an energy urban terrace room with a balcony which did not disappoint. Beautiful views across London towards Covent Garden. The interior public areas are tastefully decorated - the reception area itself is breathtaking with the most unusual use of space I‚Äôve seen in any London hotel. We were greeted by very friendly concierges at the front door and 2 very equally friendly and helpful reception team members on the first floor. 
My first disappointment was when, after a long journey down, we ordered room service to eat on the terrace. The food was not up to the standard we expected and most of it was left uneaten. We ended up going elsewhere later at night to find something less bland and stodgy. On this experience we also skipped breakfast the next morning- again choosing to eat somewhere else. 
We had reserved a table in the rooftop bar for midnight and received email confirmation of our booking, as we wanted to have a nightcap after our visit to Somerset House. We were greeted by a girl who told us they had given away our table as it had been booked for 10pm. Despite advising her that it had been booked and confirmed by email - she told us to wait to we if she could ‚Äúsqueeze us in‚Äù 
We eventually were seated at a table outside and then left for 10 mins without anyone approaching to take our drinks order. My husband gave up and went to the bar himself to fetch our drinks. As I waited alone - 15 mins after we had been seated - a server eventually came over to ask if I wanted anything. Needless to say we had one drink and then left to return to our room. 
Overall a lovely hotel but I have mixed reservations about returning due to the quality of food and the poor experience in the bar. ",3,2018,09,04
148,Fun hotel in Central location ,"My family and I (two adults and two children) stayed at this hotel for three nights. We had to make reservations late that evening as there was an issue with our prior booking. From the moment we arrived tired but excited to finally get to relax, everyone was pleasant and helpful. The reception is really cool with the show projected on the wall and the welcome glass of cava!  We got two adjoining rooms, both having a beautiful view of London. Our kids were impressed lol. We travel a lot and this was one of the fun hotels to stay at with all the technological touches (music and changing lighting etc). The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable. We even had my Mum book a room for a night so she could hang out with us till late before we flew back to NY. ( Reception was so nice and were able to put her in room next to our two!) We spent an evening at the rooftop bar (party of about 9) the waiter Diego I believe his name was was very attentive and our drinks were good, we ordered a lot of food for the table, everything was good. We ordered room service a couple of times for the kids and they enjoyed it. We were able to explore London from the hotel as it is so central. The doormen were very friendly and helpful ( one recommended a restaurant for breakfast close by). The hallways are dark as described in some reviews but it wasn‚Äôt a problem. I love that people couldn‚Äôt go to any floor unless they had a card. Made us feel secure. We would stay here again. ",5,2018,09,03
148,"Nice hotel, not with the expense.","This hotel tries to be very ""hip"", it aims to be a modern luxury hotel. The styling overall was unique, and I did quite like it, but that gets old quickly (there is a 30 second video clip that plays on repeat in the elevators that see every. single. time.), and the flaws become quite obvious. The biggest problem with this hotel was the price. If it had been cheaper, I would have rated it higher, as the problems we had weren't deal breakers, they were just annoying, especially for the cost of the room. When I pay this much, I don't expect to have a leaky shower, a shower head that operates like its 15+ years old (nozzles spraying all sorts of directions like its old and is clogging from years of use), AV issues, poor breakfast experience, and other smaller issues. Also, very such a high end hotel, I expect a much nice bed. The bed is less than 2 feet high, and feels like a brick. I can find better beds at cheap chain hotels.",3,2018,09,01
148,"Beaut hotel, rooftop bar staff need improving ","Stayed here for a night for a work event. The hotel was lovely and the rooms were slightly smaller than I expected, but nice. Speakers in the roof was a nice touch, as was prosecco on arrival. 

We visiting the Radio Rooftop bar on both the evening we arrived and next morning and I must say the waiting staff up there a pretty poor. The manager (I can‚Äôt remember his name - but with tattoos!) was absolutely lovely and highly attentive. It was just disappointing that the rest of the waiting staff were quite the opposite. Not very friendly and also slow and forgot elements of the orders repeatedly. 

However, overall, me and my colleagues had a fantastic time! ",4,2018,09,01
148,amazing,"was so great to spend 7 days in such a great hotel very modern and the athmosphere were very relaxing . everything was clean. rooms are spacious and very nice. the staff are all very friendly and very helpful.

148,Amazing hotel,Hotel was nothing short of what I expected it was absolutely amazing room was beautiful with nice balcony and a very nice view of the  surrounding areas. There is STK on the first floor and the crown jewel of the hotel is the radio bar on the rooftop. The bar has views of the entire city one of the best. The waitress Yazmin  was one of the sweetest kindest people we met in London her service was absolutely amazing.  Highly recommended in central London great location can't wait to return.   Matthew in the lobby it was also a gem super sweet.  Everyone at the hotel was super helpful.,5,2018,08,30

148,Nice afternoon tea,Went here for the view in The Radio Bar. Had a lovely afternoon tea. Loads of cake and really nice presentation. Only complaint is that the toilet is all black panels and it was hard to see! Nice cocktails too. Not cheap but it is central London. Can recommend.,4,2018,08,27
148,Lovely visit,"We stayed for four nights leading up to the bank holiday in a vibe room. 

First impressions - The hotel is stunning. The most incredible decor in the lobby and at reception. The staff are all very welcoming. We arrived about 1pm, and our room was ready. We were offered a drink at check in and our bags were taken to the room for us. A great start.

The room - Our room was on the third floor with a view of the street. Lovely seating area, well appointed bathroom and large comfortable bed. Coffee machine and well stocked mini bar. Robes, slippers and high quality toiletries. 

Pros - The hotel was very stylish. The staff were very friendly. The evening turn down service was a really nice touch. The rooms were very comfortable. 

Cons - we received no personal touches whatsoever (as other guests seem to have received). We pre- ordered breakfast to the room for the following day and it never arrived. The adjacent room was so loud and we were woken up nearly every morning by crying kids, screaming and slamming of doors. 

To be fair, we didn‚Äôt complain about the breakfast or the noise, we were too busy getting out and about for our trip. However, for the prices this hotel charges we expected top quality service and were surprised that noise from other guests carried so loudly to our room. 

Overall, we really enjoyed and would definitely consider staying here again on our next visit. ",4,2018,08,27
148,Amazing hotel with exceptional staff,"The room was beautiful and huge. Marcos was outstanding, there was always a member of staff to great me and welcome me back. The hotel has great security, is in a great location and has fabulous amenities. I will certainly be staying in other ME hotels.",5,2018,08,27
148,Bank holiday!,"Location wise this is as good as it gets as it is walking distance to a lot of what u want to do in London. Boutique hotel in feel. Service excellent and always feel looked after. 

We had theatre tickets for Tina which was literally on the doorstep and then Britney tickets for the Sunday. Short walk to Waterloo then Jubillee line. 

2mins you are in Covent Garden andwalking distance to a lot of what u would want to do. 

Always look for deals- I get a lot of pop ups and the differen can be huge in the rate. ",5,2018,08,27

148,Very Funky cool hotel with great service,"Our short stay here was great! Location was great everything closeby. We stayed in two attached rooms which are well decorated, just the second room was disabled room so the bathroom wasn‚Äôt very flashy. In room dining and restaurant was great. Staff at concierge were extremely helpful with everything.",5,2018,08,21
148,Great Experience,"Our family was getting together for a big birthday in London.  I wanted to book a sensational room and I always look for a balcony and/or view.  Balconies are hard to find in London but found a great one at Me Hotel.  Booked the Personality Suite.  Yes, a splurge but we will remember it forever.  What a great room.
  If you are looking for mahogany furniture and velvet curtains this isn't the place.  If you enjoy modern design Me is for you.
  Staff was very, very accommodating and friendly.  Concierge desk is super.  Would choose it in a second over the ""grand dame"" hotels.  It is unforgettable!",5,2018,08,21
148,Fabulous 5 star hotel,"We stayed here for a weekend with friends. As we got out of the cab, someone was there to greet us and direct us to reception on the second floor whilst taking care of our bags.
Check-in is in an incredible space, with a soaring atrium and projections onto the walls. We were greeted with a glass of cava and quickly allocated our rooms.
Our room was on the third floor and was very modern in style, but with plenty of comfort also. The bed was a super king and was super comfy with great bedding. The bathroom area is well appointed with a fabulous rainfall style shower and plenty of toiletries. 
What I loved also is that the hotel is just off a busy road on the Strand, however you could not hear a peep in your room. The air con was also super quick at heating up or cooling down, meaning I got a brilliant nights sleep (something I struggle with in many hotels).
The bar on the top floor has a wonderful outdoor area, with views across the river.
I would absolutely stay in this hotel again in a heart beat. Great location for theatre, nightlife, tourist attractions and shopping.",5,2018,08,20
148,Very helpful,"Great location and lovely room.   It was my partners birthday and we received complementary balloons, small cake and bottle of champagne.   Staff were very helpful when I left shoes behind in the room and they have arranged for the shoes to be shipped to me.   Thank you all at the ME Hotel.",5,2018,08,20
148,ME likes it a lot!,"What a fantastic hotel. From the moment you walk in you are relaxed by the sweet smelling scent that is circulating throughout the hotel. Reception has a lovely little light show in it's atrium. The standard rooms are still a great size and the beds are comfy. The bar on the roof (Radio Rooftop) has one of the best views of London. It is a very trendy bar and the drinks are quite expensive but this is because the location is so central. Still, it's definitely a good night out!",5,2018,08,20
148,A little treat !!,"Well I thought I would book a night here for a little treat for me and the wife. I have to say I picked the right place !! It‚Äôs easily the best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in from checking in with a glass of fizz we left our bags and went off for a bit of lunch. We returned at 4pm and the hotel had to double check our upgraded room was ready, so more fizz while we waited ! The room was ready 5mins later and off we went. We had been upgraded to a choc suit and OMG it was the most amazing space two massive TVs and blue tooth sound systems ! Coffee machine  full fridge and snacks all in the room a bath double shower this list goes on. You have the Radio bar on the roof which has amazing views and great service, we didn‚Äôt try this time but also in the building is stk restaurant which I‚Äôve been to b4.

148,Treat yourself and get the Urban Vibe!,"This was a treat to ourselves, we upgraded and got a room with a balcony and got the prepaid breakfast. Both were excellent choices.

148,Hounded,Booked for my partners 30th birthday. First we were hounded by staff showing us and entering the room then coming back with cake and champagne which I thought would already be in the room. They wanted ¬£50 to park at the hotel for 24hrs (you can book a space for 40hrs for ¬£7.50 down the road on yourparkingspace.com). 2 hours into us being in the room staff then walked into the room without knocking (lock your door). Then we were disturbed by staff asking if we want complimentary chocolate and water (not a problem if we hadnt already been disturbed twice). Next day we were woke at 9am by reception ringing the room phone again hounding us when check out was not untill 12 and we should have been enjoying a lie in. Decor nice and very modern style. Rooftop bar cost us ¬£36 for two drinks which we paid on check out however they should have totalled ¬£32 if we were going off the menu price. restraunt looked nice but ate elsewhere. ,3,2018,08,13
148,I would go back,We had such a lovely stay here for one night. We stayed for a birthday and they made it extra special for us with complimentary Prosecco. The hotel meets all the criteria of a five star hotel and we will be back. The room is very large and we had a comfortable stay.,5,2018,08,12

Lunch in the roof top restaurant/ bar was delicious and the service first class. Our room with its balcony was clean and the air conditioning was very welcome on what was a very hot couple of days. 

Breakfast was very good and served at the table rather than the buffet style a lot of hotels go for, another nice touch. 

Throughout our stay staff were polite, attentive and helpful. 

We would certainly have no hesitation in recommending the hotel and will certainly be back.",5,2018,08,06

148,"Lovely hotel for couples, fab location","Stayed here for one night in July for my boyfriends birthday. 

Check in - the reception is on the first floor and wow, what a fab first impression! The ceiling height of the lobby is the whole height of the building so you can look up and see daylight many stories above! I've stayed in lots of hotels and this has to be the most impressive reception I've ever seen! Definitely has the ""wow factor.""  A nice glass of complimentary bubbles added to the whole experience. 

Room - we were on the top floor of rooms (apart from rooftop bar/penthouse above). We had a balcony with a nice view. The room was a really good size with a comfy bed and great air conditioning! Mood lighting and music. Well stocked mini bar and more snack options on shelves (expensive!).  Good size bathroom but water pressure in shower wasn't the best and also the head is fixed in to the ceiling so if you're short like me, it was very high above me so I ended up using the hand held mini version to wash my hair properly. It would have been nice to have a bath in a luxury hotel too to properly relax in. Lots of lovely toiletries provided and bathrobes/slippers. Despite being under the rooftop bar, we didn't hear any noise and the room was lovely and quiet. 

Birthday - lots of effort made with balloons, card champagne and cake in our room for arrival. Plus a lovely message written on bathroom mirror. My boyfriend was very pleased! 

Location - fab and central. Walking distance to Covent Garden/Leicester Square and a lot of the big west end shows right on your doorstep. Two tube stations close by and lots of food/drink establishments literally steps away. Couldn't be more perfect really. 

Food/drink - we didn't eat in the hotel or have breakfast there (we ate dinner at the Ivy in Covent Garden and breakfast at Bills across the road). We did have drinks in the Radio rooftop bar which was a lovely experience as the views are fab and we were there for sunset so it was really lovely to see the changing colours of the sky as the sun went down. We hadn't booked but were able to get a great table outside with fab view. Be warned it isn't cheap though and cocktails start at ¬£15 upwards! Was a bit aggrieved that even though we ordered and waited for drinks at the bar, still had 12% service added on! Wouldn't have minded if someone had come to our table to take our order but it was a bit much when we went to get our own! Didn't stay for too many as was working out ¬£34+ per two drinks! 

Summary - this is a fab hotel and great for couples or business. Wouldn't recommend it for families. It's all very cool and trendy. The hallways are dark black, cool music and videos in lifts etc. We'd definitely stay again but always without our children!",5,2018,08,05

The concierge service is very warm and personally. I‚Äôll be delighted to mention Emiliano, which gave us a great attitude and made our vacation perfect. Thank you Emiliano ",5,2018,08,02
148,A beautiful hotel with an amazing roof top bar,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the ME London. The Mode room was stunning and the bathroom was amazing. If you like a modern hotel in the middle of everything then this is the place for you!!
The roof top bar has amazing views of London but is a bit on the expensive side. 
The food is also good but again a bit overpriced. ",5,2018,08,01

Highly recommend ",5,2018,07,30
148,"Great stay, but room nothing wow!!","Great location, impressive reception and cool roof top bar. It‚Äôs a shame that the rooms aren‚Äôt as impressive, quite basic and nothing that wow!! Room was clean, and bed comfortable. I wanted to enjoy some of the confectionary available in the room, but the popcorn was actually out of date. Check in was a bit slow with only 2 desks,but a nice touch of a glass of cava free on arrival. Just not convinced this hotel was worth the money. ",4,2018,07,29
148,Perfect,"First impressions are so important and I‚Äôm pleased to say our overall experience of this hotel was great.

148,Not the usual hotel experience ,"This was the third time that I have stayed at this hotel and overall the experience, style and location are fabulous. The architecture and interior design is amazing and sets it apart from the standard. The bar on the top has fantastic views of London and makes you feel you are living the high life.... which you are! We did have one small issue with our food in the bar upstairs is that whilst there was an amazing amount of staff one of our orders got lost, and took an age for someone to figure out the issue, even though we asked on a number of occasions. They did sort it and gave us a complementary drink for the trouble. So we forgive!",4,2018,07,25

I would like to thank the amazing staff that decorated the room for my girlfriends birthday we could not of asked for more. we were treated to five star luxury, this hotel oozes class and sophistication

Lovely message on the bathroom mirror, champagne and strawberries in the bedroom and cava at reception and at our lunch at the rooftop bar (Radio Bar)
Anna who looks after guest relations was outstanding. Well done Melia Hotel.

148,First rate!,A great hotel in very convenient location. Luxurious rooms and facilities. The rooftop radio bar for lunch was superb and the staff were really helpful in getting us an excellent table overlooking the city. We'd definitely recommend ME London and would stay here again in a heart beat.,5,2018,07,19
148,"Beautiful Hotel, good location","The decor throughout the hotel is stunning! We loved the views from our balcony and from the rooftop bar. Sadly our first night was disappointing because our shower had no hot water which took 3 hours to fix, causing us to miss dinner reservations which the hotel didn‚Äôt really empathize with. But overall the stay was nice.",3,2018,07,18
148,beautiful place,"stay every year, never fails in excellence or service, stayed in the chic suite which is fabulous, very friendly staff, highly recommended. Valet parking was excellent, definitely visit the rooftop bar for breakfast, outstanding.",5,2018,07,17
148,Strongly Recommend,"I‚Äôd like to start by saying how enjoyable my stay was at ME London. I had booked the experience for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and upon arrival we were greeted with complimentary prosecco and made to feel welcome. I booked the Energy Urban Terrace room and was more than impressed. We were fourtunate to have been given a corner room, making our balcony vast in size and accompanied with a great view of Covent Garden. Although I asked for special room requests for my boyfriends birthday, ME went above and beyond to make the experience unforgettable. The room included a complimentary bottle of champagne, cheesecake with candle, balloons and a message written on the mirror. Along with this, the staff were very considerate and ensured we had everything we needed, including hair straighteners that I asked for, that evening. We ate at radio rooftop bar which is within the hotel, as well as STK, both of which were an experience in themselves, the food at STK was delicious. Finally, the following day the hotel were more than happy to store our luggage until we needed it, later that evening. Overall I find this hotel very difficult to fault and would strongly recommend to anyone wanting a five star experience.",5,2018,07,16
148,Good location,"The ME is a different kind of hotel. It is very chic and modern. The lighting in the hall is a bit dark. The rooms are spacious and modern. The lighting, music etc. is on a keypad and can be a bit confusing. Check out is 12noon but with that don't expect to get in your room early. There is a hop on/hop off stop across the street making it convenient. Breakfast was included and was typical European food but could order hot food at no additional charge. The upstairs ""Radio"" restaurant has a great view.",4,2018,07,15
148,This hotel is for ME!,"We visited the hotel for a wedding and the venue was perfect.  I‚Äôd recommend the roof bar - a great place for a cool cocktails with a view. 

The restaurant is wonderfully decorated and the waiting staff excellent. The food was very good - even for 100+. 

The lobby isn‚Äôt very grand but it has interesting design features. 

The ME is expensive but good value - spoil yourself and your partner. ",5,2018,07,15
148,Mother and Daughter getaway,"By far this hotel is first class from the moment you step into the amazing foyer!
We were visiting London for a birthday treat and this hotel did not let us down. The room on the 9th floor was trendy and a terrace with a river view added to the experience.
Reception is an amazing design area very impressed. Staff at every level were incredible and nothing was a bother.
Upon arrival to our room there was a lovely message on the bathroom mirror, balloons, cheesecake and champagne! 
We ate at STK restaurant which has a great buzzing atmosphere and food was lovely. Then went up to the radio bar which again was first class and seen us return the 2nd eve and Sunday for lunch. 
There is no question about it....this is going to be our first choice hotel in London from now on.",5,2018,07,14
148,Dracula's Castle meets Blade Runner 2049,"The hotel is very dark, for some reason they like closing your curtains when you leave your room. There's a great Solo-esqu bar upstairs with a great view of the city that serves mean Long Island Iced Teas. Fun experience getting to the bar one night with a group of people on a business trip that were all a little worse for wear. Staff could be better all round. I'm convinced they filmed Blade Runner 2049 in the reception. TV is hard to use. Toilet is awkward to flush. ",3,2018,07,13
148,Melondon hotel,"Melondon hotel location is very good. The room is a bit small, though. Considering the price per night, it's not really that valuable. Also, there are  a lot of bar people hanging out in the radio city roof top bar. ",3,2018,07,11

148,One of the very good ones,"Hotel rooms are spacious, well equipped (with inbuilt speaker) and come with lots of good quality travel essentials like mouth wash, body wash, facial cleanse. 
It is close to Covent Garden (within 5 minutes walk) and cabs are always available at the entrance of the hotel. 
Check-in and check-out were quick-- took us around 5-10 minutes. 
Staff members were helpful. I asked for women's napkins and they provided me with 3 different variety to choose from. 
The view at our balcony is beautiful (but if you're a shopper, there wont be much need to book a room with a balcony)",4,2018,07,11
148,Read This Before Booking Your London Hotel!!,"If I had to choose one word to describe ME London it would be this: EXCEPTIONAL. And that applies to every aspect. The staff. The restaurant/bar. The rooms. The location. Exceptional in EVERY way.

The Staff

Ben at the Concierge Desk: Even before our arrival, Ben helped arrange transportation for us from LHR - and despite the time difference between Minnesota and London - he always responded to my inquiries right away. He was also able to get us a table at the Radio Rooftop bar/restaurant despite it being a last-minute reservation. I knew before even arriving we had made the right choice (we normally stay at Ritz Carltons but wanted a change of pace - it was the right call).

Marco at the front desk: Polite and professional, Marco welcomed us warmly after a long flight from Minnesota. He saw how exhausted we were and since it was early in the morning - he offered us to upgrade to the Penthouse Suite (at a great price) as it was already prepared and we could check in right away. And - It. Was. AMAZING. More on that below. Marco set the tone for our stay - and what a stay it was!

Luke the Hotel Assistant Manager: Luke gave us a personal tour of our room and shared his knowledge of both the hotel and of London. It was evident he loved his job, and made our family feel very special! He had an answer for our every question, and it was a pleasure to spend some time talking with him. 

Zhivko in Room Service: The level of friendliness and professionalism had already been set by Ben, Marco, and Luke - and Zhivko was no exception. He was engaging and friendly - and he happened to be delivering complimentary champagne and deserts (and by deserts I mean to say WORKS OF ART). Thank you for that!

All of this amazing service and we had been at the hotel less than an hour. My compliments and gratitude to everyone who made our time there so special. (We only had one night there as we were on our way to Paris - but I‚Äôve already booked another six nights for next week!)

The Room
I‚Äôve been to London three previous times and have never had a 180-degree view of the skyline. This two-story suite has set the standard for London hotel suites. And that‚Äôs not just me saying that - we hosted some friends who live in London and they confirmed they‚Äôve never seen a view like that from a hotel. The Penthouse Suite is worth every penny!

The Radio Bar/Restaurant 
If I had to choose one word of advice for those considering this bar/restaurant, it would be this: GO. Drinks are phenomenal. Staff is fun and friendly. Food is fantastic. (Try the bread with tapenade - we ordered three servings of it!) And of course, there‚Äôs the view. The amazing view of London. (Note: the Penthouse Suite has a private access door to the Radio Bar).

The Location
The best way to describe the location of this hotel is easy: Walking Distance. To everything. The West End. Covent Garden. Piccadilly Circus. Every high-end store and restaurant you could ask for...all within walking distance.

The true mark of a hotel that earns good reviews is whether or not they have earned the right to another visit from the reviewer. Let me say this: I will not visit London again EVER without ensuring I have a room at ME London. And that says it all.",5,2018,07,10
148,Stunning venue and exemplary service,"We hired the venue for a work function (screening of an England match) and they didn't disappoint, Excellent all round. Roof top bar is excellent, staff brilliant, quality 1st class. Seocial shout out to Andrei Vrasmas and team - simply brilliant.",5,2018,07,10
148,"The room had issues,","The electric sistem didn‚Äôt work well.
The lights turned on during the night so we could not sleep well. 
Every night we had to wake up and turned them off as well as some speakers that started making weird noises. We told the front desk and they did not fix it ",2,2018,07,09
148,5 star service from start to finish...a truly wonderful experience,"Our stay in ME by Melia London was a 5 star experience from arrival to departure.  Having normally stayed in the Savoy when visiting London, we thought we would try something different this time.  On arrival we were greeted by the concierge team.  Bags stored and escorted to reception on floor 1.  In reception the team seated us while our room was just having its final touches and served us a glass of very nice sparkling wine.  Our room was a double deluxe and contained everything you could possibly require during your stay.  It was my Husbands birthday and on arrival in the room was a bottle of champagne with a wonderful vanilla cheesecake with birthday candle. A very nice touch as we only mentioned his birthday at check in.  We had pre show drinks in the Radio Rooftop bar around 6pm.  Having not booked a table we were worried that we would not be able to sit with a view...we were surprised to be seated immediately with the best view on the top floor.  After our show we then came back to the Radio Rooftop bar and again, best seats on the top floor.  Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff members, all very attentive and polite.  Breakfast was plentiful and delicious.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough.  Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful weekend.",5,2018,07,09

148,Cool looking Hotel,"Well, the hotel threw me off at first. I didn‚Äôt expect the room to be designed so well. Used the optimum space and is very comfortable. This is walking distance to many places you want to visit. The coffee shop is decent. Very nice ambience and feel. ",5,2018,07,05
148,Great Experience,"Let me start by commending the service I received from Alex in reception during my stay. Alex was extremely pleasant and accommodating. I had just come off a red eye flight and had not slept and Alex was quick to get a room ready for me and made sure I was never left hanging. He also booked me reservations for dinner and made sure my gf got up to the room as she arrived a few hours later. He even printed my boarding passes for me. Alex went above and beyond for me and I‚Äôm so appreciative of service like that. Beyond the service I received, the room was clean and comfortable. Shower was so clean and the water pressure was fantastic. I was able to catch up on sleep in the comfortable bed and i heard no street noise even though I was in a very busy part of the city. I loved this hotel experience and will stay here the next time I‚Äôm in London. Go to Alex when you check in!",5,2018,07,05
148,Amazing stay,"I don‚Äôt often write reviews but I must in this case. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left 4 days later we were treated like royalty.

Highly recommend to All.",5,2018,07,03
148,Most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in,"I stayed in this sensational hotel on Saturday 30th June 2018. I spent 4 months training for a charity boxing fight in which if I won I was to propose to my long term girlfriend. I popped in the day before I checked in and spoke with the assistant manager of my plans. Him and his staff went beyond anything I can possibly imagine. Cut a long story short....I won the boxing fight and they the staff set me up to propose on the rooftop balcony. The hotel went to great lengths to match my incredible night which me and my fianace will cherish for the rest of our lives. Champagne and room service breakfast was exquisite. The style and decor of the hotel is breathtaking. And again...the staff...what can I say...professional, polite and genuine. Thank u thank u thank u. 

Ps. I have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world....but this one smashes them all

148,Do not go with family.,"Not worth the money. It‚Äôs very much like a high-end, overrated love hotel for flings. Room was dirty. Although staff overall was friendly and helpful, they were obviously encouraged to behave in a certain way, didn‚Äôt seem sinsere. If you are used to staying in real shophistcated, 5 star hotels, this place is completely misrated and should have been a 3 star hotel with all their quality provided. ",1,2018,07,02
148,Ann,A very modern but comfortable hotel; I was not expecting the first class customer service.  It makes you feel like a very special member of the family.  If you can make yourself leave the comfort of this hotel then all main attractions of London are in easy walking distance.,5,2018,06,28
148,Amazing!,"We have stayed there in the summer and had the room with the balcony. We paid ¬£350 for the room but it was definitely worth it. It was a lovely and pleasant surprise. The rooms are big and clean, so is the balcony. We did go to the rooftop bar and it was an experience on a different level. I will definitely recommend it.",5,2018,06,28
148,How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Vibe Hospitality,"For my first visit to London I decided to stay at the ME. My reasons initially were the fact that I love the hyper-modern architecture (I'm a sucker for Norman Foster's work) and design, as well as my preference for a central location (even though London is kind of spread out in many ways). When I arrived I was in high spirits and these were maintained through the complimentary prosecco checkin. 

For those not familar with the ME, the target market of the Melia hotel group is best described as ""Europeans who typically go to Ibiza to munch on ecstasy like tic-tacs."" The ME brand targets the high end of this market and establishes hotels in ""cool/hip/urban"" places. 

So in short, you're basically stuck with the European equivalent of the Bret Easton Ellis crowd. 

This was the only real downside to my stay, and I can't penalize a hotel because I dislike some of the other guests, and I'm sure I was killing their ""buzz"" just as much as they were killing mine so in the interests of fairness I'll focus entirely on the actual hotel itself.

The ME London embraces what is called ""vibe hospitality,"" which is a nice way of saying ""the hotel is a giant nightclub."" The visual design of this hotel, both interior and exterior, is truly stunning, and the rooms are compact but sufficient. The bed is very, very comfortable, the welcome amenity (a cheese plate and a bottle of wine) was considerate, and the rooms were well-designed (and very quiet too, which is a relief given the 'vibe hospitality' thing). Bathroom amenities were more than adequate. The ""maxi-bar"" (i.e. a mini-bar with openly-displayed contents on shelves) was interestingly-stocked although clearly intended to cause temptation (can't blame them), the mood lighting was a nice touch, and my request to stock my mini-bar fridge with low-carb beverages was attended to swiftly and efficiently. And the rooftop bar offers some excellent views too.

The staff were all exceptionally professional and efficient, the drinks were well-poured, the atmosphere was great when it wasn't too busy/loud, the concierge was very helpful and all problems I had were swiftly resolved. An additional point to make is that from a value-for-money standpoint, the ME is excellent given the location and competing hotels in its service category (compared to all the 'big name' hotel chains it is at least 100 GBP less per night).

All in all, I am very happy with my choice of the ME. Yes, it was crowded at some times with nightclubbers, and one of the restaurants was temporarily closed, but it was stylish, excellently-located, comfortable and very well-priced given the location. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again when returning to London. 

+ So so so very stylish and well-designed
+ Comfortable beds
+ Excellent location
+ Great staff
+ Good value for money relative to similarly-situated properties
- Sometimes crowded with clubbers and said crowd is not for everyone",5,2018,06,24
148,Luxury 5* stay at Me London,"I stayed at Me London for 1 night whilst visiting London for a concert at Wembley. It was for my sisters 18th birthday so we wanted a special
Hotel and this didn‚Äôt disappoint. From the moment we arrived the staff were super friendly and helpful, the concierge took our cases straight away and gave us a glass of prosecco on arrival. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready so we headed out to lunch. Located on the Strand there is plenty of restaurants and shops near by. Also close to Charing Cross station and other tube stations too. Covent Garden was a 3-5 min walk from the hotel so the location was great. 
The room was lovely and spacious very modern with a big bathroom and very large bed too. Only criticism is that there were no plugs by any mirrors in the room so to dry or style your hair was a bit difficult but apart from this it was lovely. We also visited the Radio Rooftop Bar which is located at the top of the hotel after 11am it is only open to hotel guests. The drinks were very expensive and there wasn‚Äôt any patio heaters outside so would recommend visiting in the day instead. 

Overall we had a fantastic stay, it is in a great location and I would definitely return again. ",5,2018,06,23
148,Accommodating stay,It was a very pleasant stay and very accommodating.. the staff were always looking out for you and giving you pointers and very happy. the breakfast was good but I wished they had more on the menu. Had no problem with anyone or anything everything was perfect.. ,5,2018,06,22
148,A bit of an experience,"Having enjoyed the delights of a number of central London generic hotels in the last few years, this first stay in the ME London really came as a pleasant surprise. The d√©cor, clearly intentioned to deliver a feeling and experience was a nice change from the usual drab beige walls. Wonderful service, food and views from the rooftop bar.",4,2018,06,22
148,Honeymoon,"Fabulous access to theatre, train, bus lines, food choices.Also lots of shopping an be done as well. We explored the area via all modes of transportation.  As well, we were able to walk about, day or night, with no concerns.",4,2018,06,18
148,Contemporary with a great location. ,"Modern, trendy, and unusual are the best words to describe this ultra-sheek hotel located near the theater district. Upon arrival, the curved sliding doors open and the staff is immediately there to assist and direct you to the elevator.  

Registration is on the 2nd floor where more unique design features greet your eyes. Soaring ceiling, white curvy sofa, art, and so much more. We were offered a beverage to enjoy while checking in. 

The hotel interior walls are black, there are lighted accent candles placed in alcoves; it‚Äôs an unusual effect. This theme reoccurs throughout the hotel:  dark floor, dark slanted walls, minimal lighting. 

Our king bed room - 909 - on the 9th floor had a balcony view of the city. For a fee, we upgraded to this option upon arrival.  The room, with leather-looking walls in white, was minimalist in design, but offered good comfort.  Lots of lighting options, admittedly, a bit challenging to figure out operation without labels.   There is a safe, minibar, closet, a small desk area separate from the bedroom,  and a large bathroom. 

The bathroom quality is premier with a full-size soaking tub, separate toilet room and a generous 2 person rain shower. Adequate storage is offered at the modern white 2 sink station. Plenty of towels too. And a hairdryer. 

There is 1 chair in the room, at the the desk. The outdoor balcony has several chairs. There really is no additional space for a sofa or chair as the bed takes up most of the space. Our luggage (2 large suitcases for an 18 day trip) we‚Äôre stored on the floor at the foot of the bed. For one night, that was acceptable. 

There is a rooftop bar/restaurant on the 10th floor. For ‚Ç¨63 we had high tea for 2.  Service was slow and incomplete, but the view was great. Not sure if that was usual, as the rest of our experience in the hotel was great. 

Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and would return. The location is excellent. ",5,2018,06,18
148,London Weekend,"If your going to London and need a hotel then look no further than the ME. Its the best modern hotel in London and gives you everything you would expect from a 5 star stay.
We stayed in a Chic Suite which is exceptional. I dont usually sleep that well in hotels but this hotel has the best beds, linen and temperature control i've come across in a hotel which meant I had the best nights sleep i've had in years.
Friendly staff that are there when you need them make the whole stay top class.
Book this hotel asap.",5,2018,06,18
148,Scott Mays,"Just had two nights at the ME, 
The hotel is unbelievable.
Staff are great, service is excellent, views from the room balcony were beyond what I would have expected. 
Hotel is very close to everything you could want for a couple of days in London, Waterloo bridge, Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, theatres and plenty of places to eat. 

The only down side is the prices in the hotel, but as there are plenty of local places to eat and drink you don‚Äôt need to pay ¬£4.50 for a bottle of water out the mini fridge or ¬£14 for a miniature of vodka in the Room
My wife and I have stayed in some very nice Hotels but the style and quality of the ME was unbeatable. 
I would recommend this to any chap that wants to take there wife away for a couple of nights and really relax in style.",5,2018,06,16
148,I would give 6 starts if I could ,"What a fabulous hotel. Probably one of our favourite hotels that we have stayed at. I hope it doesn‚Äôt get complacent with all these great reviews and keeps doing what it‚Äôs doing!

148,Trendy Sleek Hotel with Excellent Concierge,This hotel was very sleek and modern.  The concierge was incredibly helpful and pleasant. They went above and beyond to ensure that everything was taken care of from directions to deliveries outside of the hotel. The atmosphere and technology was a bit too cool for me but definitely a nice overall experience.,4,2018,06,11
148,ME London _ extraordinary,"Fantastic experience!
I really reccomend staying at the ME Hotel  (I am extremely picky when it comes to hotel quality and I can guarantee that at the ME London all the points on my check list were succesfully thicked)",5,2018,06,11
148,20th wedding anniversary ,"Having visited the me before I thought this would be the ideal place to stay whilst we celebrated our wedding anniversary.

Again the me staff didn‚Äôt disappoint. The staff are fantastic , you are made to feel so special from when you are greeted at the door till you leave. 

Nothing is any trouble and they seem to have this ability to make the whole experience feel tailored just for you.

The card from the staff for our anniversary, the drinks to celebrate our anniversary to booking the table on the rooftop bar they think of everything. 

The hotel is amazing and the decor very classy and modern . Food lovely,room clean and with the balcony looking out of the strand I don‚Äôt think your find many views with such a packed skyline.

Well done the Me you didn‚Äôt let us down and it was great to celebrate our anniversary with you 

5* all the way 

",5,2018,06,10
148,Treated like a VIP !,"This hotel is amazing. From the moment our taxi pulled up outside and Victor, open the doors, through to the service at reception, the whole experience is amazing. We booked 2 adjoining rooms as there were 5 of us, My wife and 3 teenage children. 
The rooms were spacious and well equipped. The interior of the hotel is stunning and great viewed from the roof-top restaurant.
The best part however, is the staff. We would not normally stay at such a high quality hotel, due to costs, but we used air-miles to book and paid for an upgrade. Our trip was for a family celebration and they went out of their way to make it even more special.",5,2018,06,10
148,Thank you for a wonderful stay,The best trip to London yet.  Thank you for great service and an incredible experience from check in to check out.  Well done...we will definitely return and recommend the hotel to our friends.  The whole experience was first rate.  ,5,2018,06,06
148,Great stay but expensive,"Really enjoyed our stay but only for special occasions due to price, all the corridors are very dark and a bit spooky but room was really good but you would expect that at over ¬£400.00 a night, breakfast was superb.",5,2018,06,06
148,STK reservation,"I called concierge team on behalf of a guest staying in my hotel that wanted to dine at STK. They were celebrating a birthday and Roari and David from concierge team were so helpful with the reservation, at same time friendly and professional. Good job guys!

Thanks as well to all the team of STK, they had a great time!

I won't hesitate to send more guest there as I know they will be well attended.",5,2018,06,05
148,Uber cool but not pretentious!,"My wife and I spent a night at the ME Hotel as part of our wedding anniversary.  The hotel is seriously cool but is not pretentious at all.  The staff are super helpful, courteous and always smiling.  The rooms are spotless, modern and very comfortable.  The Hotel welcomes you with a glass of Prosecco and we were given a complimentary upgrade and chocolate covered strawberries in the room (delicious by the way) as it was a special occasion.  I've stayed here before on business and the experience was no less satisfying on that occasion also.  We booked a table on the rooftop bar and enjoyed watching the in-crowd let their hair down on a Friday night against a backdrop of the London skyline - perfect.  It also served as a fantastic backdrop for breakfast the next morning (also delicious). I really couldn't fault the hotel and its staff who are all wonderful.  ",5,2018,06,05
148,Truly amazing hotel !!,"We have just returned from a simply amazing stay !  Stayed for 2 nights in the urban Terrance room with a balcony , the room was beautiful !, everything you could possibly want , just fantastic !! .

I proposed to my girl on the balcony which was a perfect setting ( she said yes..phew!!).   The staff all were fantastic !! Nothing was too much effort , plus they new of my plan & anything I wanted they would accommodate which was lovely.  

Even Anna the Aura manager made a point of meeting us on our checkout to wish us well .. a really nice touch.  The general manager Samantha also emailed me wishing us all the success in the future which again a lovely touch 

We will definitely be back sooner rather than later. 

Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place too much , anyone staying will be very happy I‚Äôm sure 

Paul.",5,2018,06,04
148,Birthday vacation,"This hotel was probably the most perfect hotel I have ever experienced! It boasts of amazing architecture, design and decor. 
The rooms were wonderfully  complete with mood lights, comfy beds, and wonderfully modern decor. The shower was like having your own spa with several areas for additional water spouts.  

The staff was friendly and accommodating! They went above and beyond to make my daughter's birthday trip memorable!

I only have two slight complaints. One, the cleaning staff was very noisy with many slamming doors and noise outside our room.  The other was that the cleaning staff entered our room to clean even though we had the ""do not enter"" sign displayed. 

The hotel is very dark with black walls, mirrors and dim lighting. It's a little hard to navigate for older folks but it's fun too with lots of candle light and colorful projections. The location in Covent Garden was perfect! 

It was a delightful experience and I highly recommend it.",5,2018,06,03
148,New Years in London 2018,"Was one of my favorites so far in London and will be back again for sure. We stayed there for 10 days over the New Year and absolutely loved it. Spacious rooms. Great staff. Cava upon welcome, Gym, loved the turn down se I‚Äôve with chocolates and super comfy beds. Also great location , I‚Äôll be a return customer for sure ",5,2018,06,02
148,Hotel lovely!,"Stayed here for my mum's birthday as we had theatre tickets booked.  Perfect location for the theatre district, all on your door step and within easy reach.  Hotel very modern, very contemporary.  Staff very friendly and professional.  This hotel is very much a 5 star hotel however I'm not over impressed with the roof bar.  It's open to the public, lots of 20 and 30 year old wannabes which is actually very funny to watch! Nice views though!",4,2018,06,02
148,Excellent service Recovery,"We stayed here at the end of April. The location is excellent  for the
theatre.
I must admit that the design and decor are not my cup of tea and our room was
quite small. There was really no place to put our luggage.
Yes, the halls are very dark and we did not care for the loud music which greeted us
at every arrival.
We did have an issue with extremely noisy neighbours who decided to have a party in
their room and kept us up at night and then woke us up again at 4 a.m.
However, the lovely manager listened  and gave us some wonderful hotel credits.

The concierges here are great and had great visiting suggestions. They knew their restaurants and made wonderful suggestions. One even gave me bandaids for my sore feet.
Great staff and location-unusual decor. You either like it or you don't.",4,2018,05,30
148,"FUN, SEXY AND A MUST STAY!","I stayed at Me Cabo and loved it. Me London was just as fabulous an experience. Posh and modern it's the perfect hotel to party and relax at all at the same time. I would not consider this a hotel for younger families. The location is perfect and located centrally. My favorite amenity is the rooftop. Music, drinks and food what else could one ask for? A great comparison would be the W which I have also visited.  I do however have to say I was treated more like a VIP at Me London than The W. Their service and staff are impeccable. I wish I could remember all their names. Victor was one. A gem. Polite and very helpful. Can't wait to stay here again. ",5,2018,05,29
148,Exceptional Staff,"The friendliness, consideration, and quality of the staff at the ME London was exceptional. During our stay, a member of my family was ill and they took wonderful care of him - making homemade soups and hand-delivering medicine. My family and I are very appreciative for the care that was provided at the ME London and would highly recommend to anyone travelling/staying in the area.",5,2018,05,29
148,The Best Hotel in London,"ME London is by far the Best Hotel in London. Wonderful hospitality and personnel. The location in superb, Covent Garden and musicals just next corner. Our third time in the Hotel, which now became our London Home. ",5,2018,05,28
148,Fab hotel,Great welcome and friendly staff.  The hotel is modern and stylish.  Rooms are a good size for London.  Everything is immaculate.  The roof top bar is really good for cocktails.  The hotel is in the perfect location for access to Convent Garden and central London. Great for a weekend break.,5,2018,05,28
148,"Fantastic stay, one of my favourite London hotels","I have to say this was by far one of the best stays we have had in London. From the very beginning at check in, the staff were so lovely and helpful. We were given a lovely glass of prosecco on arrival. Our room wasn't ready at the time but we arrived earlier than the check in time and we had a phone call as soon as it was ready. We were in London celebrating my birthday. When we got int our room i was greeted with balloons and a lovely birthday message on the mirror, in addition to a bottle of champagne and a chocolate desert. It really made my birthday extra special. We had a energy urban terrace room which was fabulous. A very large room and bathroom and lovely balcony over looking the city. We visited the roof top bar in the evening. It had great vibes and staff were friendly. We went again the next day when the royal wedding was on. It was a great atmosphere and the cakes issued were lush. It definitely helped that we had a cracking day of sunshine too. 
The location of this hotel is spot on. Right on the strand next to convent garden, with lots of coffee shops, restaurants and shops near by and the tube station is a minute walk away. We also decided to do a city bus tour, and the stop is right opposite the hotel which was fabulous! 
All in all we were so impressed with this hotel, we really cant fault any part of it and we will defiantly we returning. 
Thank you for making my birthday even more special. Kelly Stinton and Connor Edwards. ",5,2018,05,22
148,Hip hotel with big rooms,"When you arrive, you are greeted heartly and a wonderful fragrance expects you when you pass the ground floor to get the elevator to the reception on the 1st floor. We had the feeling to enter a church. The check-in was very fast and we got offered a glass of champgne. 

We were upgraded to a superior room. The room is modern an gives you a good room feeling. There is large and comfortable bed and a small table with two chairs. I really enjoyed the window which is like an oriel and if you stand there, you feel like you are in the trees.

There is a large bathroom with two sinks a a separate toilet.

The absolute highlight is thw terrasse on the top floor. It is open for luch with a beautiful view over the city. In the evening, it is a popular bar.",5,2018,05,20
148,Hit & Miss,"Booked two nights at the ME for my partner's 40th birthday. The hotel itself is very cool, minimalist, very dimly lit & nice smelling, a bit like hollister opened a hotel. 
We upgraded on arrival to a suite - which was really good. I had pre-booked a bottle of champagne to kick off the birthday celebrations and asked that this be moved to the suite. This unfortunately didn't happen so we decided to go up to the roof-top bar for a drink. Bad move! The bar is amazing but is open to anyone and everyone and the rather rude woman on the lift door told us to sit down and wait and then 10 minutes later told us there was no availability. We decided to ask reception why, as residents, we were not allowed in the bar and the woman there could not have been more helpful. She escorted us past the 'bouncer' on the lift and got us a table and a free glass of bubbles for the inconvenience.
As I said, the bar is amazing, but it was like a scene out of Towie - it was fully of really loud and obnoxious geezers on the birthday lash. We didn't stay long!
We did get a bottle of champagne and a written apology regarding the refusal of entry to the bar so credit to the hotel for that.
Overall a good hotel apart from the issue with the bar.",3,2018,05,19
148,Fantastic hotel and staff,"My friend and I booked a Saturday night at The Me Hotel as a treat for her birthday and wow it didn‚Äôt disappoint,not only is it a trendy stunning hotel but the staff we exceptional,they did everything to make us feel welcome and special,from Marie on reception to Maria who showed us to our room and how to work out all the lighting gadgets and bonus ,a bottle of champagne and a beautiful chocolate birthday cake awaiting us.Dinner was great and it‚Äôs such a fun lively atmosphere so great for groups of friends or couples and then when we headed to the Radio Roof top bar which we had booked we were greeted again but a glass of fizz.Check our is 12pm so again another bonus after a good night out and when we came to pay and check out we were greeted by Luke from The Aurora team who again didn‚Äôt disappoint,he was kind and friendly and offered us a Buck‚Äôs Fizz which was just what we needed.i cannot reccomend this hotel enough,the little touches really did count and I will be definitely staying again,well done to everyone at the hotel your customer service is exceptional and you made my friend and I feel like a million dollars xxx",5,2018,05,15
148,Amazing hotel!,"We stayed at the ME london for my boyfriends birthday. Walking in the hotel the way its designed is very modern and beautiful, every detail ! the reception is especially cool and staff were very friendly and helpful ! The room was very smart the gave little touches to make the stay extra special for the birthday. Better than i could of pictured they went out of their way to make it a great stay which I love. We also went to the stk downstairs which was also very good, again the design and surroundings were cool/modern, good food overall a very nice restaurant. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will be going again in future ! Next time Maybe try out their bars which look nice as i didn‚Äôt get the chance this time round as it was a short stay ",5,2018,05,15
148,5 star service Mention Didofrom the bar,"This hotel is amazing 
What else I can say friendly welcome in a very design place as well 
WE LOVED THE PERSONAL TOUCH  we have provided by one of the team members with name Dido he is so positive,professional and extremely fast in delivering service",5,2018,05,14
148,Excellent Hotel - Beautiful Aesthetic ,"Booked into this hotel after a horrible experience my first day at the Strand Palace down the street. I was so disgusted by that experience that I left there without a hotel to stay in and walked down the block to the ME. They had a room ready for me within 40 minutes of my arrival, for a reasonable price, and the staff was so helpful and understanding. The rooms are beautiful with really cool lighting technology and a very modern feel. There are tons of in-room amenities that really make you feel special and comfortable - there Is a distinct sense that you are in a 5 star hotel because of the architecture, decor, art and general vibe of the place. I was at the ME for 9 nights and it was like being home but with the awesome addition of turn down service every night (with chocolate and water). The cleaning staff was phenomenal and even after turn down, a staff member would come by to check that all was well and we didn‚Äôt need anything. I had in-room service one night from STK and it was everything you would expect - fast, hot and delicious. My father and I made good use of the Radio rooftop which is so chic and fun. The view of London is lovely and the staff there also makes you feel like a real star. As a guest at the hotel, you can use the rooftop without having reservations and you can tell that even though the level of service is high all around, there is a clear appreciation of and catering to those staying at the hotel. My first visit to the rooftop we were treated to a complimentary glass of champagne! And this is not to the detriment of anyone else visiting the bar - it‚Äôs just a very discreet sense you get as a guest based on how you are treated which is really skillful and speaks to the staff‚Äôs talent. Also - Great location, super comfy king beds (way big enough for two), cool windows/views and a breathtaking reception/champagne bar area. It‚Äôs a must visit - either as a guest or an architecture and art fan. And finally, I did have one minor issue with something in my room and it was dealt with expediently and with the exact level of service you would expect - a handwritten note of apology and a bottle of great wine. Mistakes happen but in the service industry it‚Äôs all about how they‚Äôre handled as opposed to the fact that they happened in the first place. The ME clearly understands this and executes it well. ",5,2018,05,12
148,Amazing Hotel in Central London!,I stayed at ME london hotel while on a business trip. The hotel was an absolute treat! The attention to detail and personal touchs were brilliant. The hotel staff were attentive and friendly. A big thanks to the ME team and especially the Aura team for giving me such a unique experience. Looking forward to the next business trip for a change!,5,2018,05,09
148,ME in the heart of London,"Me and my boyfriend spent a lovely long weekend @ ME in London. We loved the personal touch we have been provided by the ‚ÄúAura team‚Äù, we felt that the hotel truly welcomed us as individuals and not as just everyday guests. It was lovely to have such a bespoke experience, thank you! We are looking forward to return to this hotel.",5,2018,05,09
148,"Very Cool hotel, great night away from start to finish.","We had fantastic service from the second we got there to the moment we left. 
Ana Poley  Aura management even emailed me the recipe of the fantastic dip we had with our bread in STK, thank you Ana.
Highly recommend a stay here for a little luxury glamour and people watching !!!
Great views for the roof top bar and STK was super busy and fun.",5,2018,05,07
148,Another fantastic stay at the Me,"I booked two rooms for a one night stay and in advance if my stay contacted Ruairidh at the concierge to book a table at the radio roof top bar who was fantastically helpful and confirmed all details within minutes! 

Arrival and check in was seamless with small treats and a lovely card left in my immaculate room. 

We enjoyed a fantastic time in London and following check out the concierge also sorted and looked after our shopping from day one whilst we completed day two before the train home. 

A totally modern, contemporary stay, with great bars and super helpful staff, I wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else!",5,2018,05,07
148,Service makes up for failings...,"Stayed one night for partners birthday celebration.  Team ""Aura"" (Guest Relations in any other world) did a great job of picking up comments about birthday and placed champagne and a lovely sweet treat in the room !  Thoughtful touch which demonstrates their attention to detail.  

Check-in was perfunctory, no real guest engagement, just handed a key and told room number, was not told that keys required to operate lift so had to travel up and down a few times before figuring it out. I booked a river balcony room which was monochrome in design and very quiet & comfortable.  Two little niggles in the room....1. Toilet flush is hidden behind toilet seat - design fail there I would say.  2.  Telephone is useless ! The handset doesn't sit on the cradle properly so it beeps all night, in the end I just unplugged it.  There are little cards all over the room, eg - one that tells you ""how to operate"" things like TV, Lights, AC. Would it not have been easier to install electrical items that were recognisable to operate ? Anyway, it was fun figuring them out.

Booked a table at Radio Bar for post-theatre.  You would have thought I was trying to get into the Bank of England with the process required for getting in there.  You cannot take the elevator from your bedroom floor, oh no ! you have to go back to the lobby, switch elevators (wait a while) then go up to the rooftop bar.  You queue again, then greeted by a stressed employee who checks you have a booking, escorted to your seat (thank god I reserved) and asked by yet another employee if you have a reservation, then you're promptly ignored for 15 minutes, then given a menu, then ignored for another 10 minutes, then order a drink, wait 10 more minutes then you drink comes poorly presented !  I suppose my complicated order of 2 G&T's flumoxed the bar staff?  Drinks came with 2 ice cubes, already topped up with the tonic (Melia - you really need to learn how to present a G&T in London !).  After we had our drinks we just left as could not attract a waiter to sign the bill which is why I suspect they ask for room number when ordering as I guess so many people just give up and walk out. Dreadful place !

Checkout was lovely, very chatty receptionist who engaged warmly and is a credit to your hotel.

All in all a very nice stay (except for Radio Bar!).  I would return to this hotel but it's F&B operation is nowhere near 5 star ! Go and find a nicer bar outside the hotel as this one was not really a pleasant experience.",4,2018,05,04
148,Second time lucky!,"This is the second time we‚Äôve stayed at this hotel, the first time was a bit underwhelming, but this time it was much better- though there were a few areas for improvement.

First of all check-in, a very slick affair in the stunning cathedral-like reception hall. We were offered a glass of cava at reception, but declined for two reasons, one it was only 11am and secondly because of our hangovers from the night before!

Our room was spacious, especially for a hotel that is so centrally located. The room was beautifully presented, and very stylish. The one area for improvement here is the sliding door between the bathroom and the bedroom which was full of dust along the top rail- it could do with regular wipe!

As mentioned the hotel is centrally located for the restaurants and bars of Covent Garden, and also for the Theatres- including the National Theatre which is only a short walk away. 

Breakfast is buffet style, and is really outstanding with everything you could wish for, definitely worth the extra, so go for a room rate that includes breakfast!

Finally a word on the concierge team. Before your stay you receive an email asking whether they can help you with anything in advance, I‚Äôve twice requested, prior to arrival, that they book us a table for drinks at the rooftop Marconi Bar, on two separate occasions I had no response to my emails. If the bar is fully booked I‚Äôd just preferred to be told rather than for not getting any response!

Overall, despite the two small points made above, this is a great hotel that we will be staying at again!",4,2018,05,03
148,Me London,"Excellent hotel staff really helpful and friendly went out of their way to make our stay memorable even left a bottle of champagne and a cake as it was my birthday. Only down side was the roof top bar because it open to the public and they had a private party so couldn‚Äôt really enjoy the views but got a free cocktail for the inconvenience.

148,The perfect place to celebrate my 21st!!,"I visited this hotel for just the single night, I had two rooms to occupy myself and friends and I can honestly say we couldn't of had a better time! The rooms were located next to each other as I requested! We were looked after extremely well by all the staff, but especially a member of staff called Maria Fernandez-LLebrez, she is a credit to the hotel! The rooms were spotless and very comfortable! I would definitely stay again and recommend!",5,2018,05,01
148,A very different and amazing experience,The service was very attentive. The reception area was truly unique and the room was comfortable and full of hi tech gadgets. The window overhangs the street so all very unusual. The decor is trendy and very modern.,5,2018,04,29
148,Gorgeous hotel with outstanding staff,"I visited this hotel in April with 5 friends to celebrate my sisters hen and I can't wait for an excuse to rebook. What a fantastic hotel, the location was perfect and the lobby was simply breathtaking. All rooms were immaculate, bright and modern. I would recommend to take advantage of the roof top bar as we were able to give our feet a rest while taking in the sites of the capital sipping on cocktails. I'd advised the hotel in advance that this was a special occasion and the manager Sara went above and beyond to ensure we had a memorable stay. Every aspect of this hotel is 5*, the location, the decor and service. If you're undecided on a hotel look no further than the ME.",5,2018,04,29

The hotel is beautiful and modern and full of art. Also, the location of the hotel is amazing for a stay in London, you may discover the city by foot. 
The staff is very attentive & helpful and this refers to all: from the nice Gentlemen at the door, the concierge, the reception staff as well as the lovely people working at Radio rooftop bar and of course the housekeeping! 
Thank you once again for your wonderful hospitality! I'm already very much looking forward to my next stay! üëåüòç

148,The heart of London,"My husband and I visited London to celebrate our ten-year anniversary, and there is no better way to experience the city than by staying in the heart of it all. Making a reservation at ME London was a clear choice as we were already familiar with the Meli√£ brand after staying in its Luxembourg City hotel.

We reserved an Aura room for five nights. Prior to our arrival, Maria sent me an email to welcome us to the ME and offer her services. When I initially made the reservation online I requested a bottle of champagne for the room on account of our anniversary. Maria confirmed the request and ‚Äì true to her word ‚Äì a chilled bottle was there to greet us. Maria introduced herself not long after we checked in to introduce herself in the flesh and ensure everything was to our liking. Customer service is everything when it comes to a hotel stay, and ME London exemplifies quality service.

The check-in desk is unlike any other I have seen and sets the perfect tone for staying at ME London. The rooftop bar is a wonderful way to view the city above the city streets. The turndown service every evening is a lovely way to conclude a day of exploring the city by foot, train, and boat. Maria, the ME London and its staff made our ten-year anniversary all the better. Thank you for being so lovely.",5,2018,04,28
148,"ME London, a different experience","This is my fourth stay at the ME, they never fail to entertain, the ambiance, the quality of staff and reasonable compared to other hotels in their fantastic central location.  The concierge staff went above and beyond in finding good restaurants and entertainment.",5,2018,04,27
148,GOOD HOTEL BUT IS IT VALUE FOR MONEY?,"This is the third hotel we stayed in London on this trip. Is it great? It is pretty good. The decoration is funky, furniture are comfy and amenities are well presented. Location is very good, walking distance to Convent Garden and Trafalgar Square. Plenty of theatre, restaurants and pubs. Apparently there is a rooftop bar but I didn‚Äôt have a chance to visit because I didn‚Äôt have the right dress code. So if you like a funky good hotel with pretty much everything, then ME London is great choice.

But do I like it? It is good hotel I must said, but it lack of charm and welcoming compare to other hotel I stayed in London just few days before. The porter is very helpful so I gave him a good tip. The check-in staff is nice but not very helpful when I could not find the voucher for our stay. It is all prepaid so what is the issue? The room is clean and funky but very small. Compare to what I paid for other hotels in UK this one is expensive. The staffs clean the room daily and some welcoming bottle of water and chocolates. The foyer and lobby have very strong perfumed candles burning so the smell is very strong, give me after few minutes. The reception is very funky but I don‚Äôt feel as welcoming when we check in. 

So this is just my opinions about this hotel. Good hotel, got everything you want it but something certainly is missing is the human connections. And for that $$$ I am sure there are other places you can stay if funkiness is not what you are looking for. ",3,2018,04,26
148,Excellent service,"Stayed at the Me London several times because the quality/service received is second to none. You get what you pay for and the convinience of this hotel is brilliant if you travel to Into London, then treat yourself one time and you will see what I mean, arrive at the hotel cars parked for you bags carried in treatment is perfect, I also left items in my hotel room which were recovered and posted to me for free from the security team with no problems at all, very nice hotel always stay here when i visit London, oh and there‚Äôs a steak house downstairs that‚Äôs great,",5,2018,04,26
148,Great Hotel; Some Service and Product Issues,"This is a great hotel in a great location right off the strand. Overall the common areas, particularly the stunning reception area, are staggeringly beautiful. It's a shame that the reception area is so underused - the architecture alone makes it a place you want to spend more time in than you do. 

On my first visit to this hotel in 2013, the rooftop was the perfect space to get some work done during the day or have a nightcap at night - exclusively for those staying at the hotel. Sadly it seems the hotel has decided to turn it into a hotspot, filled with obnoxious people and even snootier door staff. Yes hotel guests get priority entrance with their room key, but this still makes it frustrating if you want to grab a drink with a few visiting friends. Once upstairs, service is dreadfully slow. We ordered a vodka + Diet Coke that took fifteen minutes to be delivered. 

Service is pretty good from the concierges, housekeeping and other departments. However, I've found the reception staff to be as cold as can be. Nothing warm about them. To make matters worse, they never seem to be quite sure how things operate, of the different room categories, etc.

Rooms themselves are nice, though a bit sterile for 2018. It seems they due for a bit of a refresh. Frustratingly, the room categories are given generic names such as ""Mode"" ""Chic"" ""Vibe"" which don't really translate and consequently it's really impossible to learn the difference between them. 

Food is decent. The room service menu is a little staid and boring. STK is good as always but exceptionally loud.",4,2018,04,25
148,Great Stunning Hotel,"I must say my expectations of this hotel were definitely exceeded. From entering the lobby with a very warm welcome, to leaving having loved my stay, this has been one of  my favourite places to stay in London. Not much to say, seeing as everything was enjoyable. The room was very spacious, with a warm comfortable bed. It's just next to a main road, but my bedroom was completely silent. Recommend this to anyone who wants a unique experience for an affordable price.",5,2018,04,25
148,Unique hotel,This was a really great hotel.  The check in lobby is one of the most unique I have ever seen.  I could have stayed right there on the CV couch.  Rooms were nice and a generous size for Europe.  Floors to the rooms were dark that was my on dislike.  Staff was helpful.,5,2018,04,24
148,Excellent Modern Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights last week to treat the wife.  We have stayed there before, but its been a few years.  The hotel is basically the same as far as decor, but they have added some art including some great Bowie photos.  The thing that stood out during this stay is the level of service.  It feels 5*+ now when it was only 4*+ before.  Everyone was very friendly throughout our stay from the desk to housekeeping to bar.  Great check in with the bubbles in the pyramid set us off and we ended up on the roof after we put our stuff away for a few more.  Roof has the best view of London I have seen and the bartender we had was a nice guy.  Room we were given was also large and felt brand new.  Didn't get to  the steakhouse this trip, but will next time.  You don't have to even leave the building to have a great weekend!",5,2018,04,23
148,"Avant-garde boutique, great location","Amazing hospitality and service. If you favor art, avant-garde and an artistic atmosphere it's the perfect place for you. Next to that, the location is great near Covent Garden.
An interesting fact to know, Marconi House used to be BBC radio headquarters. The radio rooftop bar, which offers amazing views, was the location all radio telescopes where situated to broadcast. 
Can't wait to visit in May again, hopefully the temperature will be more comfortable to enjoy the rooftop bar to the fullest.
I didn't knew the ME brand. Look forward to explore the brand in Ibiza as well!",5,2018,04,18
148,What a hotel,"Stayed here a night only on Saturday and I must say that this is the best hotel for a weekend away from home.
The decor is amazing, staff is very attentive and friendly.
Had a dinner at STK and drinks at Radio after - views are second to none and cocktails are amazing.",5,2018,04,18
148,Amazing!,"Had a great stay! Perfect location, helpful staff and great restaurant! 
I stayed for business for a number of nights, room has all amenities, quiet rooms and right by Covent Garden to go to after working hours. Transport options are close too.",5,2018,04,18
148,BEST HOTEL EVER,"This hotel is one of the bests I ever stayed, I went there to celebrate my anniversary and the staff hand wrote a happy anniversary card and left a bottle of Champagne and cheese board in my room on the first night! The rooms are extremely comfortable and updated, the staff is the best and most thoughtful I've ever experienced, they were friendly, engaged, and eager to please. We will be back next year.",5,2018,04,18
148,A destination that surpasses the rest!,"My husband and I have tried many hotels in London and the experience that we had at ME London surpassed any other experience that we have had before. From the moment that we arrived the staff were extremely attentive and seemed to genuinely want to assist us. The decor of the hotel is simply breathtaking and everything looked extremely fresh and inviting. 

The suite that we were given was very clean and the amenities were fantastic, I especially loved the size of the bathroom. 

The location is perfect and right in the centre of the city with very easy access to all major landmarks and museums. The hotel is situated in the heart of the West-End meaning easy access to fantastic musicals and shows. 

I would recommend this hotel to any couple wanting a fantastic relaxing weekend away.",5,2018,04,18
148,"Superlatively amazing on ""another level"", impeccable service fused with eye-popping architecture in London","This was a super-special trip for my wife, daughter and I; being a birthday bash and we were totally overwhelmed by the incredible surroundings (first when you come in, you see the great inventive art on the walls on left with LIPS) and architecture on ground and first floor where the lobby is; the surprises afforded to us and the super friendly AURA team and folks who work here. We were totally totally surprised by the efforts of the ME team to look after us. As a Melia member, you can check in online (like on a flight) 24 hours ahead. There is also an AURA staff (Alexis) to guide you and personalise your stay. Thank you to the team for this (Alexis and Ana WOW) Firstly, when my wife checked in whilst I was parking the car, my daughter and her were totally taken by the room that we were given (Tip: go for room 611) as this truly blew us out of the water. If you really want to know what a great hotel room is, this is it. Full stop. Uncannily modern filled with many designer furniture and excellent interior design ideas, the living room being faced with a tv screen inserted into a black wall of glass, very tactile wall feature, the room splendidly filled with a birthday decor of cakes and fruits a la Fortnum and Mason's afternoon tea cake; with balloons on either side of a modern sofa and of course a humungous flower bouquet. (PS we got one in Coworth Park and it was much smaller and ME London has outdone itself!) 
What really really caught our eyes was the cool message inscribed on the mirror in the living room; a message I asked to be kindly written on a card and instead it's cooly written on the wall mirror! Genius...totally...
Then my daughter was totally overcome by excitement by saying this was the best hotel room ever (not a mean feat considering we've been in suites in Kanuhura Maldives, Four Seasons Langkawi, Istanbul, London, Dublin, One & Only Royal Mirage and other five star resorts along with sister Melia Zanzibar recently)
The bedroom is super; and when the kind person came up with a bottle of Shloer (kindly provided as the y knew we didn't drink alcohol: very very smart of ME London team) and then there was a popcorn machine and popcorn machine for my wife's SECOND surprise: my daughter was more excite making this. Wow! 
For the THIRD surprise, when we came back from dinner, the bed was filled with rose petals saying LOVE and then the bathtub was full of rose petals too and candles lit all over the rooms. WOW! 
Whoever is in charge of this, is a superlatively imaginative person, who also wrote in beautiful writing a quote of Shakespeare on the mirror in bathroom about Love. Wow!
The experience is truly mind-blowing. 
The breakfast in the morning is again great; some Spanish touches form Melia group with Spanish omelettes alongside Chinese noodles soup as well as the usual hot cooked breakfast and a la carte choices: I recommend the eggs Royale and Benedict. 
There were vegetarian sausages; well done. I did inquire about halal sausages, but none were available. 
Overall, we were truly blown away, we asked for late checkout, we got it without question and we were also met by the super great GM on checkout, Samantha who was brilliant along with her team at ME London at organising the whole stay for us.
What else can one say, the toiletries are nice; Greek branded and natural; they've got everything you can order online if you are Melia member. 
Best service even from doorman to everyone there, even when you ask for photos in lobby, no questions asked even when busy. Wow!
Lovely rooms indeed...I don't know what it is in the rooms that always make it smell so nice all the time...so secret perfume permeating the air all the time.
Completely totally super birthday stay that will stay etched in our memories forever. Muchas Gracias ME London.",5,2018,04,17
148,"A London Favorite-Location, Location, Location...","Great ultra-modern London gem with one of the best locations in London in Covent Gardens. For the neighborhood, likely the best value for the money as far as square footage and amenities. Impeccable service and attention to detail.",5,2018,04,16
148,Top Hotel with the best service in London,"A great hotel with very quiet rooms, located in one of the best locations and provides great service.
The staff was extremely welcoming and helpful, providing the best service we experianced in any hotel.",5,2018,04,16
148,Luxurious & friendliest staff in London,"Had a fantastic stay where the staff are so friendly and welcoming .

Very stylish hotel with lovely rooms and an excellent roof top bar.

Quality from start to finish by well trained staff who make your custom feel valued and appreciated.

148,ME london,"Great hotel. Lovely staff, always loved walking though the hotel as it smelt amazing. Also loved looking at the art on the wall! The room was lovely and the balcony view was amazing. Thank you for a great stay. ",5,2018,04,15
148,"Excellent service and location, extremely impolite concierges","Let me beging by stating that I am Spanish and this is a Spanish hotel chain, hence expecting, at the very leats, a good service. The man at the front desk, to which I spoke to the best of my manners ""Excuse me, where may we find the bar?"" responded me in one of the most condescending tones ""do you mean (rudely pointing with his hand and raising his eyebrows) this?"" signalling the nearby, yet behind several columns, bar and seats. To which I, again, to the best of my abilities, tried not to reply ""Sorry, am I supposed to feel like an idiot for not knowing where your bar is in my first visit""

First impressions do a lot, and this men was begging to clash with another rude customer such as himself to present a formal complaint.",4,2018,04,15
148,18th Birthday ,Perfect! A glorious experience from start to finish. Couldn‚Äôt have wished for more. Everyone was so generous in their attentiveness. Room was incredibly comfortable. Words cannot describe how utterly sublime the whole experience was. 100% will return and recommend to all. ,5,2018,04,13
148,Love this hotel! ,"Fantastic, funky hotel. Faultless. Great rooms. Modern with a special  touch! STK is great for evening drinks and food. We sat in the hotel lobby bar enjoying drinks on our arrival once we had checked into the rooms. Lovely gesture of a bottle of fizz and chocolate for our anniversary. The only downside to this hotel is it does not have a pool! ",5,2018,04,13
148,Continues to Astound,"Having stayed at the ME on numerous occasions, some stays more rushed than others. This particular trip was to relax.  Laura at reception gave a warm welcome back, and enquired after my stay, I said for relaxation and had no plans except dinner, and just a quiet relaxing weekend. Wherever this message was passed along or not. The team in all areas of the hotel were friendly as ever and attentive to every need, while at the same time respecting that I was there to relax and found lovely areas in the Radio bar for me to chill out and enjoy the papers on a lazy rainy Sunday afternoon. Gru (French Bulldog) you make such a fuss and spoil him.  Thank you Guys, you make every visit special Looking forward to my next stay already",5,2018,04,12
148,Very Good,"This location sits at the midpoint of local attractions up and downstream of the river.  It is architecturally stunning and the rooms are properly fitted.  The staff is extraordinary and their training is evident but moreover I believe they are genuinely good people.

The on-site breakfast is good and came with my reservation.

My personal favorite is the RGB LED controls for mood lighting!",5,2018,04,11
148,Great 5-Star Hotel in a central location ,"This was our first stay at the ¬´¬†ME London¬†¬ª and certainly not our last.
This great and modern 5-Star Hotel is centrally located near Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square. 
The rooms are very modern, large, clean and confortable. The service is very good and always friendly.
Breakfast is very good and diversified with a great choice.
Great roof top bar with great panoramic views. To be recommended: This will be our new ¬´¬†favorite hotel¬†¬ª in London.
",5,2018,04,11
148,Nice place in the hearth of London,Stayed over with my family week after Easter. Quite a surprise of a hotel. Modern and lively. Good breakfast and very clean. Very good level of service throughout. Liked the interconnected rooms option. Pity the amazing reception with its architecture is not enjoyed much since it is located at 1st floor and unless your room is at first floor you would barely need to visit reception since the concierge is at ground floor. Would definitely return. ,5,2018,04,07
148,Amazing hotel! A must when staying in london,Absolutely loved this hotel! It has the wow factor and i wouldnt be able to settle for anywhere else now when staying in london! Best food cocktails and stay ever! You will love it book now!!! Thank me later :-),5,2018,04,04
148,Great location and amazing terraced bar!,We visited the Hotel Me for work and we must say the service is really good. It is very conveniently close to our offices plus Covent garden so you have the best of both worlds. We went to the terraced bar which offered a great atmosphere and were shown the penthouse (has a direct access from the bar) which offers an amazing round glass view of the city.,5,2018,04,04
148,Valet Parking,"Booked valet parking, could not be happier with how easy the whole experience was. Just pull up outside the hotel and hand your keys over. Perfect placement for West End shows. 

Very friendly and helpful staff. 

Would absolutely book again. ",5,2018,04,01
148,Always excellent!!,"This is the third time we have stayed here & absolutely love it. The rooms are spacious, beautifully decorated & spotlessly clean. All the staff are fantastic & look after you as soon as you arrive. We always use the car parking facility which is amazing. The hotel has a great location too. Stay here, you will NOT be disappointed!!",5,2018,03,31
148,Amazing service in a cool hotel,I was slightly skeptical by this hotel as it looks like a secret bunker where a James Bond villain would be hanging out. But it pleasantly surprised me. Super chilled out and relaxing environment. Great views of the city and the staff are amazing. Especially Ms Marco Zanotto who took great care of me and my stay. Thanks! ,5,2018,03,29
148,Tailored Experience by ME,"We were warmly welcomed by one of the hotel's greatest assets, Mr Ruairi McDowell, the Head Concierge, who kindly escorted us up to the first floor to check-in. He offered us a glass of Cava and offered assistance for anything we may need during our stay! He was extremely attentive and followed up with us whenever we met in the premises. Upon check-in, Alexis Petratos, from the Aura Team, another very charming young man greeted us as well and very politely explained all the services the hotel offered. 
The biggest surprise of all was when we arrived to our room, where personalised amenities and a beautiful message on the main mirror were written dedicating us a wonderful stay and Happy Birthday - we really appreciated it!
We will definitely be back very soon for more and look forward to another ME experience! Out of all the ME's around the world, this might not be the most impressive one, however, the staff is definitely the best!
Thank you to the whole Aura Team and hotel's lovely staff for such an incredible experience - may you continue to convert more memorable experiences just the same way you did with us!",5,2018,03,28
148,Cool as always,"I am frequently staying at the ME hotel in London and I love it every time. Very cool atmosphere of the check-in on the first floor, of the radio rooftop bar (however, it seems not as frequented as it used to be) and of the steak restaurant STK. The rooms are very modern and have windows from floor to ceiling w/ an outside view. The bathrooms have big walk-in showers and a separated toilet w/ a glass door. Basically, the hotel feels like one big lounge. The location is very central, basically in walking distance to Trafalgar Square. If you are looking for a really cool hotel which was newly build w/ all modern facilities, centrally located and has five stars, go there. Furthermore, IMHO their price point is very acceptable.
PS. The only thing over the top is the ME fragrance you really smell everywhere, except in the rooms of course.",5,2018,03,27
148,Incredible hotel perfectly positioned to explore London,"We recently stayed here with friends to run the inaugural London Landmarks Half Marathon and had an amazing experience. The location, service, view, room standard and food were faultless and the ME team could not have been any more helpful during our stay. It was a true luxury experience and a fantastic base for both our running adventure and for further exploring London. I would recommend a stay here without hesitation and we will definitely be returning. ",5,2018,03,26
148,Valentine‚Äôs Bliss at ME ,"What an amazing arrangement for Valentine‚Äôs they exceeded my expectations. Amazing room, amazing staff, knowledgeable and super helpful, nothing was too much trouble and their attention to detail in my requests were over and above what I expected. Well worth a visit - highly recommend this hotel when staying in London. Super location for all the west end shows .... thank you ME London",5,2018,03,21
148,"Fantastic hotel, almost perfect","Stayed here weekend in march for my partners 30th birthday. I let the hotel know in advance that we were celebrating and they were very kind enough to leave a small bottle of champagne in the hotel room. The room itself was brilliant, very nice and spacious, the rooftop bar is incredible and again we had a complimentary glass of champagne which was very much appreciated. The staff were very friendly and always helpful - I am almost ashamed at giving 4 stars because the hotel was great and the staff friendly. However there were just a few niggles and annoyances and it may be me just being picky!
For instance, we left late on the Saturday morning after having breakfast in the room but when we got back at 6 in the evening the room had not been cleaned. We had to request this and it was obviously because we had turned the maid away in the morning as we were eating breakfast but still....they should have known the room had not been done and come back later in the day? As it was we couldnt use the room for 45 minutes while they cleaned it (and we were FREEZING from the snow!) so it wasnt great.
Also - the room did not have any tea making facilities which is bizarre. there is coffee, but no kettle. We asked for one on the Friday night, which did not arrive and then asked for it again Saturday day. It came but then they removed it after we came in from the theatre so we had to ask for it AGAIN only this time it was just a pot of tea and not a kettle for ourselves. Like I say - all a bit odd. At least we did not pay a tray charge each time :)",4,2018,03,20
148,Brilliant Parking for Theatre Trip,"We chose here to park for our trip to see Kinky Boots a few weeks ago.  What a brilliant find it was too, the snow and traffic (due to a Uni Lecturers march) were not great but the service we received was second to none - I almost abandoned my car to be able to get to the hotel but the chap in reception just took over, took my keys, parked the car and sorted the paperwork so we wouldn't miss our performance - totally brilliant as I have already mentioned!
So brilliant in fact that I am about to book parking again for later in the year.  
Thank you, thank you
Fiona",5,2018,03,20
148,Always great experience.,"This is my favorite place to stay in London. In a city so old and traditional Me is a refreshing experience. It looks like a vault when you are in the hallways, the reception area is like from a movie and rooms are really comfy and have all the amenities you need. My only complaint is that there is no milk in-room for the capsule coffees, but then again, hot milk is just one phone call away, as is anything else you might require.
Breakfast is wonderful, I especially love the Veuve Clicquot start to my day! Hotel‚Äôs location is close to everything and staff overall is very attentive. My exception to this was the receptionist , a guy with an earring, who was so busy with his arrival papers(?) at seven o‚Äôclock on a Sunday morning that he barely looked or talked to me when I checked out. I paid attention to this because the contrast to check-in with the sparkling wine and attentive staff was so big. It is just as important to leave a good last impression than the first, if not more! Outside of this, another great stay in a lovely Me.
",5,2018,03,20
148,Very friendly staff,The staff and the service was fantastic. They always greeted us at the door and the rooms were serviced three times a day. The concierge was able to help us on a few occacions when we needed to get somewhere or wanted to do something. ,4,2018,03,19
148,Love this hotel the perfect place to stay in London ,"This hotel definitely hits every spot!! 

The decor is lovely, bed the comfiest I think I‚Äôve ever slept in, the customer service is second to none!

Breakfast was lovely! 

Radio rooftop bar has some amazing views, and the cocktails are so good!! 

STK was delicious! 

Every part of our stay exceeded expectations!!

We have definitely found our hotel in London and will always book to stay here in the future!!",5,2018,03,19
148,Great hotel,"Good atmosphere, great location, friendly staff  and considering its so central there was no traffic noise. Well Priced too. 

Breakfast could be improved but all things considered will definitely go back.",5,2018,03,19
148,Simply amazing,"This hotel was simply the best place I have ever stayed in.  The location was amazing, the staff were perfect, the room was amazing and the roof top bar/resturant/club were amazing.  Would recomend this to anyone for simply and amazing experience.",5,2018,03,19
148,Perfectly Positioned for business & pleasure with a London skyline view of note!,"A modern facility with a unique character. The hotel welcomes you into it's ""belly"", the reception area (1st floor). It has to be unique as you stand in the centre of a hollow three sided pyramid looking up on granite walls as projected shapes float up towards the glass apex. Phenomenal. The rooms are fantastic with a large range allowing for suites. Great position with a short walk to Covent Garden and the surrounding Theatres. The Radio Rooftop Bar offers some of the best skyline views of London and the Thames that you will get here. Again exceptional.",5,2018,03,19
148,Love love love this hotel,"I joined my husband on a trip to London for a few days and we were booked into this hotel. I had never heard of it and didn‚Äôt research it so had no idea what to expect. I was so pleasantly surprised when we arrived.  It is such a modern vibrant hotel with an amazing atmosphere and great art and decor. The reception is such a cool place I could have hung out there all night and the best part is that they serve prosecco for the welcome drink!! My perfect hotel.
It is fantastically located and their rooftop bar is fabulous. I will be back and tell everyone I know about this awesome hotel ",5,2018,03,19
148,Birthday celebration in London ,I came to London to continue my 30th birthday celebration. First 4 nights were spent with family and the last 4 at the ME London. Everything about the hotel was amazing from the reception area to the awesome room. Emily at the front desk really took care of me and sent up some champagne and sweets for my birthday celebration. The location of the hotel can‚Äôt be beat and the Radio rooftop bar was great with incredible views of London. Definitely my number one choice for when I return to London.,5,2018,03,18
148,Lovely luxury hotel,This was a birthday treat for my partner who was very impressed with my choice of hotel.  Upon check-in our room was upgraded and we were able to leave our luggage to be brought up to our room.  I left booking STK to the last minute and there was limited availability (dinner at 22.45pm which was too late for us) but I contacted the Aura team and received a call later on in the day with a booking for 7pm which was very impressive.  I enjoyed the food at STK and the portions are very large.  Our waiter was also very attentive.  The Radio Rooftop Bar is very impressive.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.,5,2018,03,17
148,Beautiful hotel,"My husband and i visited the hotel last week when we had a day in London. I must say we didnt stay over night but we used their Radio Rooftop bar for lunch (left separate review for this). Their bar downstairs is beautiful, they have a table with a fire in the middle which is a lovely touch. Very modern and trendy. They even have a selection of sweets on the side free to help yourself. The hotel is in a good location right next to Covent Garden. What we saw of the hotel didnt disappoint and we definitely hope to stay here in the future.",5,2018,03,14
148,AMAZING ALL ROUND,"can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough our stay was amazing from start to finish on both occasions we have stayed at the hotel, the rooms are all gorgeous, the hotel is very modern the interior design is on another level, our first choice for hotel in London ",5,2018,03,12
148,There are better hotels,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights. The hotel puts design before practicality.  The real reason we stayed was because of the Radio Bar on the roof but only do I realise that you don't need to stay to get in.  The room was small and the drains were smelly.
The best thing about this hotel is the location, it is great for the theatre's.
I won't return. ",3,2018,03,12
148,Wow - Lovely modern hotel,"Stayed in ME hotel March 2018.  We booked a chic suite but think we were upgraded to Passion.  Suite was absolutely amazing.  Very up on technology and the staff were very helpful (and patient) with us, with the technology, and came to our assistance immediately.  Loved the Radio Bar with amazing views and lively atmosphere. Only disappointment was we couldn't get in the STK restaurant as it was fully booked.  (Should consider keeping some tables free for hotel guests), especially as it is so popular you would always be able to fulfill, but got a peep of very dressy ladies coming out and sounded very lively inside.  Can't wait to get a table next time :)",5,2018,03,12
148,Great Night,"Had great night at STK for my friends birthday on Saturday - Food delicious, great service and staff are a credit to the hotel - especially Daniella and the team at Radio Rooftop Bar, they went out of their way to make us feel very special.  This extended to the security team. I could not find my coat at the end of the evening and when I called the next day Belarmino in the security department went upstairs to the bar and called me back to say he had found it!",5,2018,03,11
148,Pure Class,"The roof top bar will become a destination bar in no time, with the view and the pleasant staff they have a winning combination. The Atrium is AMAZING and the light show something special.

The restaurant was great value with superb food and staff who were keen to help but not forever hovering.",5,2018,03,11
148,"Superb location, first class service but better think twice","Hotel is located at the very heart of London, in Westminster neighborhood. First surprise is that reception in not by the entrance, but one has to walk to the end of an endless corridor, take the elevator to first floor and then... wow! An eight floors skylight with reception desk at its center... impressive!!!
Staff is always attentive and genuinely willing to help. Something unfortunately quite rare these days, even at a five stars hotel. You will be welcomed with a refreshing drink and then, ready to go to the room.
My choice was eight floor with terrace. Excellent! Specially if you are willing to smoke a cigarrete without exiting the building at the mid of the night! Room was very well equiped with fully assorted minibar, nexpresso coffee machine, etc. Very comfortable indeed.
Unfortunately all the above fails when it comes to room acuostic insulation. A normal conversation at the adjoining room may ruin your sleep. No noise is heard at all coming from streets, so they did a good job on that, but in what refers to room to room insulation, they clearly failed, so as with elevators coming up and down at the middle of a quite night, so please be advsed to ask for a room as far away as possible from them.
Breakfast excellent as in any Meli√†, and check-out also a pleasant experience. So, all in all, leaving aside noisy rooms, of the best possible class. Unfortunately, quite sleep ranks high for me!!!",3,2018,03,07
148,Great Hotel,"Held a conference at the hotel in February, the product, staff and service where all great. The hotel is a lot more modern than what we would usually go for but our customers loved it, the quality and standards of the hotel are fantastic and I would definitely recommend anyone to use it for business or leisure. Bedrooms where very clean and spacious. Good selection of bars in the hotel, we ate in STK one evening and the food was delicious and the service was great. I will hopefully get the chance to experience this hotel again in the future and a special mention to Dipika & Vincze who looked after our event and made sure it all ran smoothly they couldn't have been more helpful.",5,2018,03,07
148,Great rooms. Expensive bar,"I like this hotel in London. It‚Äôs location is perfect. Walking diistance from soho and holborn. Very large rooms and a wonderful shower. 

My only complaint would be the price of the sky bar. 12 pounds for a wine is a little steep. ",5,2018,03,06
148,"Excellent Hotel, Great Staff !","Thoroughly enjoyed our experience in this very contemporary and well located Hotel. It‚Äôs sleek and modern, with beautifully appointed rooms that are superbly maintained - and impressively no noise in the rooms so a good nights sleep is guaranteed. My wife and I enjoyed the room, great amenities and well thought thru extra touches. Great room service for breakfast too....best thing of all, the sincere and well trained staff, all smiling and there to assist - not always easy in London.",5,2018,03,06
148,Trip tolondon,"We booked this hotel for our trip into London, as it was our 10th wedding anniversary.
Will what‚Äôs Great place.
Top notch on everything, service was the best.
They looked after us from the moment they took our car to be parked until the time we checked out.
Clean and elagant, smart and stylish.
I‚Äôd like to say a big thank you to everyone who works at ME for a great stay.
Room was more than we expected, and the shower was to die for.
Definitely be back 
From Karl and Corinne Williams.",5,2018,03,06
148,Out of this world,"Fantastic hotel on the Strand.
Spotlessly clean & yes, 5 star in my opinion.
Bedroom very large with gorgeous bathroom.
We had a balcony which was fantastic.
Location great for Covent Garden & Embankment with lots of local restaurants & bars.
Lots of little extras in the room including slippers & bedtime chocolates.",5,2018,03,04
148,Birthday celebration ,"Wonderful hotel in a great location. I stayed here with my family to celebrate my birthday and we all had a great time. The welcome was fantastic and we all got a welcoming glass of bubbles. 
The rooms were spacious, light and comfortable. The bed was huge and the linen was very luxurious. 
The Rooftop Bar was fantastic with amazing views.  Definitely worth a visit.     ",5,2018,03,04
148,The right place to be in London ! ,"We stayed in this amazing hotel 4 nights.
The room was super nice and comfortable with good music in the ME channel. The shower was amazing with great amenities and the view was perfect.
All the staff was extremely nice and helpful and the bar on the rooftop, radio, is super cool.
The reception is in super luxury room with video art all around it and triangle bar in which they serve you some drinks upon check-in  
Highly recommended, we definitely will come back again ",5,2018,03,04
148,Amazing Hotel,"Visited the hotel for 2 nights. The hotel was outstanding and the service was fabulous. We will definitely come back and stay there, next time we are in London. The food was incredable, some of the best food that we have ever tasted. ",5,2018,03,04
148,Best staff of any hotel I've visited,"The ME is where I stay whenever I'm in London on business. I've stayed a few times already this year, and I'm never, ever disappointed. The staff are absolutely superb. Truly world class. And the rooms are fresh, stylish, cool, clean and very quiet. From the hotel it's just a few minutes walk to Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, Downing Street - and maybe 10 minutes from Soho. It is beautifully designed, but once again, it's the staff that make the place.",5,2018,03,03
148,Perfect - best hotel in London ,"Third visit back to ME to celebrate my partner birthday. We stayed 3 nights and From the second you enter the hotel you are treated like a VIP. The extra special touches in the room and a complimentary room upgrade all add up to how this hotel knows how to make there guests happy and extra special. The room was beautiful and the bath was the biggest bath I have ever seen in any hotel I have stayed. Having breakfast ordered to your room is another brilliant touch as not many hotels offer this service. Location is perfect located in West End and walking distance to Oxford Street and Leicester Square. Radio Rooftop  bar is out of this world it definitely has the Wow factor. Cocktails are amazing ! The staff can not do enough for you. I can‚Äôt wait to go back in August. I have stayed in many five star hotels but the ME is by far the best in design, experience and customer excellence . There unique Aura team ensure your stay and experience is perfect. Thank you for another amazing stay and we can‚Äôt wait to return to celebrate my birthday in August. ME you are just amazing.

148,Superb hotel in an excellent location,"We have stayed at this hotel several times and it never fails to please. The staff are friendly and efficient, the rooms are immaculately clean & chic. The hotel exudes contemporary luxe without being pretentious. Thanks for another great stay.",5,2018,02,28
148,Excellent service,"Fantastic hotel, friendly and polite staff providing excellent service, nothing was to much trouble.  It was my birthday and i was made to feel very special. 
Would highly recommend a stay here.  Hotel very clean, very spacious room.",5,2018,02,27
148,Best hotel ever!,Best service and the most stylish hotel in London! For my birthday they left roses and champagne which was such a nice touch. Honestly it made my birthday and made my stay very special. Our MP3 player kept not playing and the maintenance guy came up almost immediately. He fixed it and then us girls partied hard in sound proof room! I always have the best stay  would definitely recommend to anyone.,5,2018,02,23
148,Excellent ,"I stayed here for just a night but I can say it is in my top 5 hotels I have ever stayed in. Well priced for its great location. Room was spotless as was the hotel generally. Great mini bar selection. Bed was very comfy. I stayed on the 9th floor with a balcony which had a great view. My only small annoyance was hearing the chairs scrapping on the roof top bar above the room, some rubber feet would stop this but it did not stop me giving a 5 stars. The reception is the best I have ever seen and the drink selection on arrival is a nice touch . Top staff and great to valet park üòÄ",5,2018,02,21
148,VERY trendy (possibly too much). Brilliant Location,"Stayed there for a date night over the weekend with my wife... point of note we are not dead (or that old) but not kids... we are used to 5star hotels and more normally stay in Mayfair et al but fancied a change.

Ive used Melia all over Europe and the quality is always good - the staff - usually mostly spanish are always attentive and helpful - although used to Melia never stayed in an ME before.

OK so to the review.... 

Location... absolutely perfect for theatre and covant garden etc. 50m from Mama Mia if that helps and maybe 300m from Covant Garden.... so if you have that in mind for your evening youve got three choices for walk back (Aldwych, Wardorf and ME). Each is slightly different and ME is clearly aimed toward the yonger or more ""chic"" ""trendy"" (or even slightly pretentious) crowd. 

Ground floor is a lobby bar - its good and relaxed.. not huge but enough for hotel guests and few spare ... it gives the idea of what to expect upstairs in the hotel with pop art on the walls and lots of funky stainless steel dressing the area with maybe half dozen grouped seating areas and big ""sit up"" style bar to watch cocktails being made if thats your thing. Not cheap - its a cocktail bar - not a pub and frequented mostly by people on way to or coming from Radio (see separate review).

Check in on first floor.... as all the corridors in the hotel... carry a pocket torch if you like it will help (sarcasm but not far off). Large open expanse with small desks and some seating which we needed... thanks to timing..

Dont expect early check in .. they seem to run to the MINUTE .. and dont seem to understand the concept that in most five star hotels published times are for advisement not deadlines as to be frank at these prices a customer has the right to expect above and beyond. 

However customers can be compensated by the free cava and juices which are classy displayed in reception area.

We stayed in Chic Suite which is a funky and very trendy two room suite. Living room dominated by massive tv and actually feels very upmarket trendy place (just like the hotel)

Bedroom large and comfy again massive tv

Bathroom large with crazy shaped bath which looks better than it is --- try siting or lying in a curved bath .. its great fun but not if you actually want a relaxing soak! hehe. Massive two person shower .. great!

Special note of bathroom toiletries - beautiful and best I think Ive seen .. not your usual stuff - much much better - I know Im being picky but this sort of thing separates 5star from 5star plus....  

Windows .. issue that when you close the funky blinds it only makes them glazed (think a bathroom) so as its london which never gets dark in the electric lights .. Id suggest its actually darker at 2pm on a summers day in the corridor than your bed in the middle of the night.

Didnt take room service or eat in hotel so cant comment but prices were monstrous even by west end hotel standards and although its hilarious the idea that there is a PETS menu including fillet steak and chicken with rice is both crazy and worrying! and that you can find Agent Provocateur THONG in the mini bar (fresh to buy not just dumped there).

Special note and commendation - Maria Fernandez in the Arua Team - greeted us and showed us to the room careful explaining the various toys in the room (mood lighting, bluetooth bits and ensured we were happy and content) - instantly arranged for kettle and more coffee pods - also Id communicated with her before and found her - as I usually do with melia (thats why I use them) exceptionally helpful and genuinely friendly. Many Thanks Maria - much appreciated. Helpful and very charming.

Marco on front desk - once he figured out I was actually irritated by not being able to check in early and having to wait until the stroke of three o'clock before room was released tried very hard to redeem himself. (yes I know thats the published time but if YOU ask ME a week in advance what time we are arriving and we arrive at that stated time (1pm) its perhaps not too much to expect that housekeeping that day do the expensive suites first?

Im being picky..but its not a cheap hotel by a long stretch so I think Im being fair....if you want great, really great location and funky trendy hotel which primarily seems to be focused on sub 50yr clients with ""the right dress, appearance and attitude with a generous wallet or allowance"" .. (oh and by the way dont expect to be able to hold a conversation in a public area including the lifts because the dance music being played everywhere is actually overpoweringly loud... especially the lifts... turn it down please!) then this is without doubt a great hotel!

Summary I liked it especially for location... more than wife did... If you want a Melia thats a bit more relaxed and perhaps you dont like dance music then use The Level up by Euston station (see another review I did last year)  ... some cute touches .. comfy.. nice cocktails .. not quiet and possibly fits right in with the London Fashion Week thats happening right now.",4,2018,02,19
148,Me London Experience,"I am a frequent hotel guest at ME London but this is my first Tripadvisor review of the property. This is probably one of my favourite Hotels in London. The service delivered at Me London is exactly what you will expect from a 5* luxury hotel in the city. I prefer the higher floor rooms on the 9th floor, as they come with Balcony (8th and 9th floor) as you have a good view of the city of London from rooms on this level.

Guests have priority access to Radio Rooftop Bar and STK restaurant which is a plus. 

The room Decor is very modern, the bed is very comfortable, the mini bar is fully stocked with beverages from soft drinks and juice to spirits and champagne. 

Some of the rooms come with a bath or a shower or a combination of both if you are lucky.

I will recommend a stay at the ME London hotel for Solo travellers, couples and family travel as they have interconnecting rooms.",5,2018,02,16
148,pleasant surprise for my partner and i,"Stayed only for one night as needed to meet my partner before going onto Prague and Paris. We chose to stay at ME due to the ratings, review and location was prefect to see show. We went to see Mama mia which was just across the road from the hotel.
The staff was accommodating, i landed very early that morning from Hong Kong, went for breakfast and tried my luck for an early check-in. I met Marco at the reception, he managed to get me checked-in than normal time. I was welcomed with a nice glass of prosecco...

The room given was very clean, all amenities was there. It was nice size, great lighting, comfy bed with really nice bedding which was smooth and high cotton count. I actually travel a lot and must say it was one of the best hotels i have stayed for this price.

It was an anniversary trip and the hotel knew and surprised us with a bottle of champagne and strawberries. Such thoughtful touch to make one feel special...

We are planning our next visit in London in October again and definitely stay at ME London.",5,2018,02,16
148,Very good hotel but not excellent ,"My husband surprised with a trip for valentines. This hotels Art Deco is amazing and the hotel is in the perfect location for the theatre or shopping. Rooms are a good size and clean. Staff are really friendly. We decided to try the radio bar on top floor, when we approached the lift we got asked a lot of questions by a member of staff and I do believe we may have found it hard to get in had we not been staying at the hotel. When we got up there the view is amazing but staff can be rude, we asked for a table and got told ‚Äúyour have to pay to sit‚Äù again when she found out we were staying at the hotel we didn‚Äôt have to pay for a table. Drinks are very expensive so please be aware.. ( ¬£24.00 for 2 drinks) The dj was very good In My eyes. I did enjoy my night but I did feel the staff are only really interested in the young rich and famous. 
Breakfast in the morning was nice but nothing amazing for the price tag they put on it. This hotel in my eyes is for couples only, it doesn‚Äôt have a family feel to it. Great hotel, great location but be aware you won‚Äôt come home with any change. ",4,2018,02,15
148,Business breakfast ,"I have been to Me London on quite a few occasions, always to meet clients and partners. The reason why I have chosen this place is because the people who work there have an understanding for my need to not be disturbed every second. The eggs royal are excellent as well as the pancakes and the staff is simply amazing. I think her name is Karen is always very careful and polite. Very professional. I highly recommend this restaurant if in need of a place to organise business meetings over a cup of coffee. ",5,2018,02,10
148,With the warmest breakfast ever!,In January for my special day I went to Breakfast in MeLondon with friends to enjoy our morning with a nice warm brunch and what I expected was what I got! I‚Äôm so happy with the lovely young staffs they were all professional and we was welcomed very warmly. The staff introduced her self we had 2 server which they were so lovely giving us all the attention we needed! She greeted us with a lovely warming champagne and sparkling water on a round table the first server was called as Elif if I‚Äôm not wrong and the second we had the same day was introduced as mersedes she was a supervisor she bring us the coffee and teas.  All staff was very polite. In my other special occasions I would also love to try going to STK in the future!,5,2018,02,09
148,Business stay,"I stayed here just before Christmas for a one-night business stay.

Pros:
Welcomed at reception with a glass of fizz
Large well-lit rooms 
Ample space to work at with good desk lighting
Nice touches including dressing gowns, complimentary water and if you needed it a well stock mini bar including phone charger and other items you may have forgotten to pack.
Comfortable beds and plenty of hanging space
Very modern design

Cons:
- It was incredibly noisy. There is a club/bar above so if you want a quiet sleep this probably isn't the hotel for you.
- I liked the modern design but if you don't then this definately won't be for you. I did hear a couple of folk grumbling they had ended up in a cupboard when looking for the door to get out of the black corridor that the rooms were on.

I would stay here if I was going on a night out or taking a team away for a social evening. ",4,2018,02,08
148,Thoroughly modern ME!  BIG thanks to housekeeping and security.,"Fabulous girls weekend away in mid January combining some shopping, eating and celebrating! Had emailed hotel a few times to discuss celebrations. Booked two Vibe rooms, these were upgraded to Mode rooms and were fabulous. I had requested twin beds, but our rooms had king size beds, wasn‚Äôt really an issue for us as two lots of sisters and beds were enormous and so comfortable. Lovely touches provided by Aura team of bubbly and choc dipped strawberries in rooms. Breakfast was included in room rate and was really very good (although ridiculously priced if paying separately). As others have said, very dark corridors and the smell in the corridors, although initially gorgeous does become very overpowering. Drinks prices are high as expected in a 5* hotel. Tesco extra just over the road, very handy for wine and soft drinks!
Booked a table for 10pm at Radio on the Saturday. Table wasn‚Äôt ready and had to wait a while, but provided with a glass of Prosecco by way of apology. Glad we went but wouldn‚Äôt rush to go back on a Saturday night. 
Had a very special surprise party at Radio Rooftop at lunchtime on the Sunday. This was absolutely perfect and have left separate review for this.
Very helpful staff in a thoroughly modern setting. Not for eveyone but worth a splurge for a special occasion.
One of my daughter‚Äôs left her perfume in her room, I did email to see if this had been found and was amazed to receive a reply back that they had got it.

I wanted to say a BIG THANK YOU to Wojciech Socha, ME security. The perfume arrived safely today. How lovely that your housekeeping team handed it in and how kind to post it out.
Another example of the exceptional staff and service provided by ME London.
Thank you.",5,2018,02,07
148,Block of rooms at a Great Hotel!!!,"I work for a large corporation and had to get a block of rooms in quick order.  The sales staff at the ME, especially Dipika, were most accommodating especially through many last minute changes.  Then upon arrival, the hotel was wonderful... service, cleanliness, amenities, restaurants.  Everything suited my group of executives.  We couldn't have chosen a better hotel.  My recommendation is BOOK AT THE ME in London.  ENJOY!!!",5,2018,02,07
148,Out of this world customer service,The staff here were all outstanding and their customer service made me feel extremely welcoming and like a VIP. The reception staff were extremely helpful and ensured all our wishes were granted. The staff at the Radio bar were incredible and made a fantastic evening even better,5,2018,02,06
148,Business trip,"Hallways were too dark.  Otherwise, the hotel was fine.  Had a meeting in the lounge and were
attended to properly. Staff was helpful and friendly.  Bartender in the lobby lounge was very friendly and helpful.  ",4,2018,02,05
148,Celebrating a special occassion,"Location ideal for sightseeing and shopping. The hotel rooms were very good , clean and very well equipped. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. This was in evidence on our departure when access to the Strand was limited for taxis and cars ( 10K charity run ) . A member of staff carried our case to a meeting point for our transport and was generally very helpful, as was Alexis the Aura Host who went out of his way to make our stay memorable.",5,2018,02,05
148,Five star experience,Ultra glamarous decor and very trendy. Very friendly staff and complimentary drink on check in - also upgraded. Would stay here again as very central for covent garden and theatres. Spacious high tech room with wonderful shower and lovely toiletries. ,5,2018,02,04
148,A truly fantastic experience,"I've been to ME London several times now, and every single time it doesn't disappoint. There really is no other hotel like it in my opinion - from the service of the staff to the fascinating decor; superb rooms and Radio bar, there is absolutely no comparison. It's fabulous. 

I was visiting London for a one night stay with my mother to start my 21st birthday celebrations, which she had made the hotel aware of prior to our visit. After a glass of prosecco on arrival and a comfortable checkin in the GORGEOUS reception area, we then went up to our room. We later popped out for some shopping and upon our return, we found our room had been tidied and a bottle of champagne and macaroons were waiting for us on the table. It was such a lovely gesture from the ME team and it genuinely made my day - so thank you so much for that. 

The Radio bar was bustling and just as enjoyable as ever, the rooms were tidy and the beds were incredibly comfy. The service from all the staff was fantastic and we're already planning our next visit back! ME London has absolutely nailed the hotel experience from the moment you walk in the door and it's everything that a 5* hotel should be and more.",5,2018,02,03
148,Expensive Young People‚Äôs Hotel,"Whilst the hotel staff are very nice and the hotel itself is very ‚Äúflash‚Äù, it is definitely a young people‚Äôs place. The music in both bars was both loud and invasive and was full of the young and rich. We are by no means party poopers but not for us again I‚Äôm afraid.",3,2018,02,02
148,Me hotel was awesome!!,"Awesomeness from start to finish! Great staff, amazing location, ultra modern rooms and decor with the best breakfast !................
The only negative would be the price, but that aside a great weekend in an amazing hotel!",5,2018,01,31
148,Great,"We had a great stay after a stressful travel to the hotel, we dropped our car right outside, our luggage was taken straight away and we were welcomed with a glass of prosecco. Instantly felt relaxed and at ease. STK and radio rooftop bar were amazing. We ended up not leaving the hotel during our stay. Will 100% be returning ",5,2018,01,31
148,Nice hotel - average service / customer care ,"My wife and I stayed here overnight for a birthday treat. Firstly hotel is really nice, great reception, room nice, spacious and really clean and modern.

I phoned and requested an iron for the room which I waited for an hour but nothing came. Then I followed up the call again politely asking, again it never came despite being promised it would be there straight away. Half an hour later I called again but no one answered the ‚Äú24hr‚Äù reception. On phoning a 4th time someone answered and said I hadn‚Äôt asked for one. I politely explained that I have already phoned twice about it and no one had answered the third time.

It‚Äôs not a major thing, however for the amount we paid for the hotel and the fact it‚Äôs supposed to be 5* this is a sub standard service and no apology was offered.

A few times we phoned the ‚Äú24hr‚Äù reception there was no answer.",4,2018,01,30
148,Loved this hotel so much!,"The hotel lobby. WOW What an entrance to the hotel.
We thought the ground floor was gorgeous, but that wasn't even the lobby. 
The rooms are definitely kit out for those who want a romantic night, with their 'adults' mini bar, and mood lighting/music etc.
Great fun, and a fantastic modern experience!!",5,2018,01,30
148,Another Fantastic Stay,"It was such a lovely return for us to the beautiful Me Hotel, we were looked after again by all of the staff from the moment we walked through the doors. 
The staff were friendly and made our experience so special and Luis and his colleague Alexis made our stay extra special with the attention to detail remembering our previous stays.
These comfortable rooms were kept spotlessly clean and the attention to detail and the ensures you want for nothing.
The breakfast was perfect thanks to Ski who managed it so well - with a good selection of  both hot and cold food that was lovely and fresh and set us up for the day. 
This is how a hotel should be!",5,2018,01,28
148,Watch your cash! Staff not to be trusted!,"Strange place. Dont think this place would suit anyone over 40. OK, its clean enough & well placed (not for car access) but its weird. Design was probably done by an occultist. Its dark, so dark, you can barely see where your going. If your on a floor on your own, its actually scary. Leaning walls, black marble & mirrors, with barely any light, will give you the willies. You keep looking around because you feel someone is stalking you, but its your own reflection! No good for anyone who has eyesight or balance problems. Rooms all controlled by fancy lighting - cant just walk in and switch a light on. The greeting setting on the LCD controller made it look like I was walking into a bordelo! Maybe I was....the room fridge/snack menu included in-room merchandise offering 'Trixies Thong'.....strange!!!  Roof-top bar is interesting in that it has a great view but beware, the music is too loud to talk over and really only for the mindless. We were there on business & the conference rooms were good, albeit no phone signal in basement. Breakfast bar ok - particularly the specialist bread.      NOW HERE COMES THE CRUNCH :  Do not leave anything valuable in your room. My colleague left some loose change out & someone came in and stole it. Someone was going around the rooms early evening leaving chocolates, with master keycard to enter all rooms. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  Thats why I'm marking the review down to two stars, but would only give it three tops without the theft anyway. Its a strange place, so if you want something you can cope with, perhaps give this a miss.",2,2018,01,27
148,This is how to stay in London,"This hotel was one of the best hotels I've stayed in - ever. 
Located brilliantly by Covent Garden and the Theatre area. The attention to detail by all staff is amazing. The rooms are excellent with all the latest designs, in room mini bar, and the most amazing roof top views. At night the ""Radio"" bar is simply brilliant with loud music, cocktails, views across London and cleaver food options. As a resident of the hotel, access to the Radio bar is standard.

In summery, I found this hotel simply breath taking in every way.",5,2018,01,25
148,Great location,"A great location close to Covent Garden and Temple tube stops. The hotel is super swanky and mod. Reception is really amazing with complimentary prosecco!!! and the Radio rooftop bar great. Only a few minor quirky points... there was only 1 bedside lamp we had to ask for a second one ( maybe a design thing) and there was no tea making facilities in the room, only coffee.We had to ask for them to bring up a kettle etc...Laura on reception was extra helpful and friendly.",5,2018,01,24
148,Much Better The Second Time,"I decided to give the ME London another try after a so-so stay previously.  We visited London Nov. 29 - Dec 2 and a Mode room would be are home for the four night stay.  Our stay this time was MUCH better this time around.  I made the room and transfer arrangements with the hotel through Paula.  The transfer from LHR was smooth and the car and driver were great.  The room was clean and quiet except for the gentleman next door who was yelling on the first day.  A call to the front desk rectified the situation.  The only other issue was no wake-up call on the morning of our departure.  We always set our alarms so it really was not an issue.  They did call about 45 minutes later, claiming to have called and then to have sent someone up to knock on our door.  I appreciate the call, but don't lie to me about the screw-up on your part.  There was no call previously or a knock on the door.  I plan on returning to London at the end of Nov once again, but Paula has since moved onto another position within the company.  So I am not sure if I will stay here again, because she was fantastic to deal with and her help ensured everything with the reservation went smoothly.  A BIG THANK YOU to Paula.",5,2018,01,24
148,Birthday Treat,"My hubby booked this for my birthday  and booked us a room with a balcony on the 9th floor.(905)
The hotel is in a perfect location
From the start it was a pleasurable experience the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming and couldn't do enough to make us comfortable.  We were given prosecco on arrival and shown to our room.
the room was lovely and the bed was on of the most comfortable ive slept in.  My hubby told the hotel it was my birthday and there was champagne on ice and a lovely desert waiting for us in the room.
We drank in the hotel bar and again the staff were amazing and remembered that I only like 1 piece of ice in my vodka.  We went up to the Radio Rooftop bar on both nights and again the staff were brilliant and we really enjoyed it.
I would have liked a bath in my room but I guess you cant have everything.  the room was lovely and well stocked with toiletries and the mini bar had everything we could want.
I would say the breakfast slightly let it down as it was quite standard but it wouldn't prevent me from staying there again and the breakfast staff were again lovely!
All in all (apart from the weather rain and snow) we had a really lovely time and I would recommend this hotel and have no doubt that I would consider it next time.",4,2018,01,23
148,Amazing beautiful hotel,Everything was 5star! Upon arrival champagne was served and a very friendly receptionist. The porter took me to my room and my room was amazing! I was right up at the top so the views were breathtaking. I went out for dinner and the staff were extremely friendly. Always checking to see if I was ok. The staff really do go beyond to get you anything you need. Amazing hotel and the food is of the highest quality ,5,2018,01,22
148,Class act,"Totally hassle free from the moment you arrive.
I love staying here. 
Cool, calm, collected. Right in the heart of a vibrant area.
Everything is only a short walk, restaurants, bars, theatre, galleries and the bustling Covent Garden",5,2018,01,22
148,"Excellent service and attention to detail, staff couldn't do enough to make you feel special","Good location, rooms very nice and spacious we were lucky to receive a room upgrade as it was our wedding anniversary, champagne on ice in our room as well on arrival. Special thank you to Alexis Petratos for looking after us so well. Pre booked dinner in STK and a table at Radio Bar which i would recommend doing in advance as both get busy.",5,2018,01,22
148,THE BEST EXPERIENCE,"We have just returned from the ME London & it was one of my best hotel experiences, I have stayed at many 5 star hotels in the past, very few can match service & comfort. Let's just start with location, right in the the heart of Theatre land & great for shopping. The staff from the boys on the door to the cleaners are all great at there job & so friendly. Special mention to Reception ....The most important job of the lot, Its the first impression that sets the tone of your stay. get that wrong & immediately there is a barrier. This is a most welcoming place & to met with a glass of sparkling wine is just a nice touch. Faultless staff here. Rooms & Suites  are spotless, Double hand basins & good lighting in the bathrooms, This a must for me. Comfortable beds with fresh crisp bed linen, Everything is there that you need with  wonderful views over London. Our very special thank you has to be to Luis Lopez & his assistant Alexis who made our stay outstanding, every now & then you come across someone who just has that extra something that you know they will go far with there career. Luis Lopez has it in abundance. Breakfast too is out standing managed beautifully by a lovely lady called Ski. This Hotel is everything a 5 star should be & then some. Unlike our recent stay in another Melia (supposed) 5 star in Gran Canaria.  We shall keep going back to this great design hotel.",5,2018,01,21
148,T kelly ,Wow from the moment we walked in this hotel we were stunned by the beauty of it . The reception area is amazing I‚Äôve never seen anything like it ! And the offer of prosecco on arrival was very welcome . All the staff here cannot do enough for you and can answer any question you have . They go above and beyond . Only one problem !!!! Wish I‚Äôd booked an extra night ! Will definitely be back .,5,2018,01,20
148,Very dark but stylish,"Unusual hotel, filled with black marble and lots of very polite staff. Free glass of Prosecco was a nice touch. We stayed in a Mode room, high quality bathroom and very quiet, especially considering the location. Could understand if the seventies insipred style and minimalist decor is not for you but overall we liked it. Didn't eat in so can't comment on the food.",5,2018,01,17
148,Just Superb,"Had an amazing Birthday night away at this lovely hotel.  From the moment we arrived and our car was valeted away to the very friendly reception with a glass of bubbles and an upgrade things could not get better!  They did the room was lovely as were the amenities the Birthday cake and more bubbles the brilliant technology in the room linking to bluetooth and giving sounds through the built in speakers!

A wonderful stay the cocktails really are the best I've ever had we went upto the Radio Bar which has breathtaking views and a lovely atmosphere only downside was a table next to us all smoked so it spoilt it for us and we had to leave the outside terrace..... the good side of this we went downstairs to the quiet bar and had the most incredible Espresso Martinis they were to die for.

Thoroughly recommend to anyone this amazing place we are gold members or Melia so stay frequently at another of their hotels but I will definitely be back here.   Loved it.",5,2018,01,17
148,Favorite hotel in London,"I had the pleasure of staying at the ME London during a weekend getaway. As soon as I walked in the property, I was stunned by the beautifully designed interior and I absolutely loved discovering all the areas of the hotel; the lobby, Marconi lounge, Atrium reception, STK steakhouse, the room, and of course the Radio Rooftop bar with an amazing view. 

ME London has quickly become one of my favorite hotels in London, and I am already planning my next visit. Thank you ME London for such a wonderful stay!",5,2018,01,16
148,Superb hotel where the staff 'go the extra mile',"We spent the night of our 40th wedding anniversary at the hotel. Not only was the hotel excellent by any standards, there was a bottle of champagne waiting, red rose petals on the bed and lovely congratulatory greeting written on the bathroom mirror. I just happened to mention that it was a special occasion when booking a restaurant table and the staff did the rest. It was a wonderful and thoughtful surprise. The decor is very avant-arde and striking. We liked it immensely, though some people may find the reception areas a little on the dark side.",5,2018,01,16
148,The best birthday weekend away!,"I stayed at the ME hotel with my boyfriend this past Saturday to celebrate his birthday and it was an amazing trip from start to finish. 
Firstly, the staff could not be more accommodating and friendly! The door staff taking our bags up early so that we could go shopping before checking, reception saying ""happy birthday"" to my boyfriend at check in, and not to mention the lovely surprise in the room on arrival I had organised with the Aura team.. champagne, birthday dessert and a birthday message on the bathroom mirror. 
Our room was immaculate and just to our taste, very modern and simple but with all the right touches. Having a balcony was a nice added bonus also and the view over looking Covent Garden way was stunning. 
All in all I can't wait to return to the hotel to stay again. Thank you ME for making it such a pleasant stay. ",5,2018,01,16
148,Fabulous modern hotel," I loved the modern design of the interior , lighting and room layout.  Staff were very helpful , especially in the Breakfast dinning area. I definitely  will come back. Room size is much bigger than most London hotels so that was a big plus. Massive bed!  ",5,2018,01,16
148,Great place to stay in London,"Fabulous hotel that blows you away by its interiors which are in stark contrast to the exteriors.

Front desk staff were awesome.
Very quick check in and check out.

Room was spacious - very techy stuff which takes a bit of getting used to.
But it all works.",4,2018,01,16
148,Always amazing! ,I have stayed at this hotel a few times in the past with my husband and friends. In December my husband and I returned for one night. The hotel was as welcoming as ever. The staff are all great and the hotel is very luxurious. It even smells amazing when you walk in! The rates are high but in comparison to other London hotels they are not ridiculous and I think the extra here is worth it. The hotel is in a good location for visiting different areas of London. The rooftop bar is very stylish and definitely worth a visit for a drink or two. STK is located downstairs as you enter the hotel. I have only been in for a drink but I‚Äôm told by friends it is a great restaurant with a lovely atmosphere. This is one of my favourite hotels in London and I will continue to return here when visiting the city.,5,2018,01,15
148,Superb hotel,"Fantastic staff excelled at everything they did.  Super modern, sleek rooms with very comfortable beds and great amenities.  Our room was silent despite being in a busy area.  Location is great, especially for shopping and tourism in the West End",5,2018,01,15
148,What a stay and a must to go back ,"From the moment you walk into this hotel you are amazed. Not only by the reception, or the customer service or the brilliant decor it is simple amazing . You are made to feel like a king every step of the way . The reception is amazing and a welcoming glass of champagne is always nice . We went here for a friends 40th birthday and ate in the restaurant which was one of the best we have ever eaten it . To all at this hotel thank you and long may this continue . See you soon ",5,2018,01,14
148,One night visit,"Beautiful hotel it's stunning and the staff are very helpful and professional, the Radio Bar is amazing if only to be young again, the views are probably the best in London. The room was immaculate and very well appointed. Breakfast was the only reason I didn't give five stars as the cooked option bacon was undercooked and the sausages were average and the black pudding was overcooked!!!! I wouldn't hesitate to go back again though!",4,2018,01,14
148,Capital New Year Visit,"We spent two nights at the ME (1 & 2 January) for a post NY family break. We chose the ME for its central location with many of the city's attractions within walking distance.
The layout of concierge and bar on the ground floor, reception on the first floor, rooms above and a separately accessed roof top bar is unusual but works well enough.
The corridors are subtly lit or more plainly very dark! Our room overlooking The Strand was magnificent. The bed was very wide and of a high quality. The large TV worked well and along with all the lights could be controlled from the bed. The bathroom was immaculate with a great shower. The toiletries and accoutrements were all high quality.
On our first night we had a drink on the roof top bar. It was a pleasant experience although the prices ridiculously inflated. We also chose not to take breakfast in the hotel because of the extraordinary price.
Throughout our stay all the staff we encountered we polite, courteous and helpful.",4,2018,01,08
148,ME Melia London,"This is truly a 5 Star hotel,  from the moment you enter the Staff, level of service and interior design are simply excellent.

The Suites are splendid . We had chosen the Chic Suit but were upgraded to the Passion Suite....a stunning set of rooms.

Would Recommend a Stay or simply visit to dine and enjoy the Rooftop bar.",5,2018,01,06
148,Great location and service,"Close to Covent Garden and a reasonabe walk time to Westmister or to the City (if you like to walk this is one of the best locations). 
Rooms are very comfortable and service is great. 
Breakfast buffet is good enough.",5,2018,01,06
148,Fabulous Chic Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the ME for three nights during Christmas, and we both thought the hotel was wonderful. Great breakfast, with a nice touch of having Champagne with my eggs benedict, the staff were very friendly and thoughtful.
We had a Mode room which was very well appointed, loved the bathroom, mode lighting, and very comfortable bed.
Thank you ME for the champagne and treats in the room. Amazing reception area,  and rooftop bar, with fabulous views and again friendly staff.
We will definitely stay at the ME again, and would recommend this hotel, if you want a great experience in London.",5,2018,01,06
148,I like the hotel,Nice hotel to stay in London I like it so much rooms are good location is good service is nice so go for it so good hotel and food is so so nice and it was good hotel for New year to spend in it so go for it,5,2018,01,05
148,Excellent hotel at perfect location,"This is an excellent hotel in perfect location steps away from govent garden, near many theatres, near enmbarkment never Trafalgar Square. Very modern hotel rooms are very nice and breakfast is excellent. People are very friendly and the service is excellent. This is the best hotel in London we have stayed and we are always staying in 5 stars hotels. Definitely coming back again. Thanks to Emily at the reception for her excellent service and upgraded provided. We had a great holiday because of the hotel. We stayed from 27th December 2017 to 2nd January 2018 in room 415 (viber Room)",5,2018,01,05
148,Amazing hotel great spot!!!!,"Stayed here one night on bussiness, beautiful hotel with great imagination put into the decor. The roof top bar is a beautiful addition to the hotel with great panoramic views of the city. If your coming to watch the lion king it is very close just across the road. The rooms are very chic and modern. All the staff have been very good with a big smile on there face. So overall a definite one to return to. ",5,2018,01,05
148,Great atmosphere overlooking the city,"We wanted to finish our stay in the Capital with a drink to remember so we came here. The surroundings both downstairs and up where the bar is are great. We caught a lift up and were able to have a drink at the bar only rather than at a table. Cocktails were around ¬£15. My lychee mojito was ok (no sign of any lychee) but my daughter‚Äôs apple martini was delicious. Nice, sophisticated surroundings, good music and view. ",4,2018,01,04
148,Its not you.....Its me,"Let me start. This hotel is very very good. Very well run, service is excellent, Rooms are really good and is difficult to fault. Its an uber cool hotel, all black inside with music everywhere. The roof top bar is great if you are young I suspect. For me, I felt slightly too old for it. I love Melia, and so maybe the ME brand is just not for me. It will be for many many people on here. We had stayed at Marriotts EDITION brand which is similar but I feel that is more laid back which is why I love it. That said I will continue staying in the Gran Melias if they have one in each city.

My 23 year old son and 18 year old daughter loved everything about it

Summary :

Service 5 stars
Rooms 5 Stars
Location 5 Stars
Food - 3.5 Stars (Breakfast was just ok. Didn't eat at STK)",4,2018,01,03
148,"Great location, excellent customer service and atmosphere","My Girlfriend and I stayed at this great luxury hotel in central London over the New Year. I can only praise the level of service and little touches that you get, such as a glass of Champagne on arrival in the stunning reception and the level of tech (bluetooth, internal speakers, touchscreen) built into the rooms. I would highly recommend a few drinks at the rooftop bar and a steak at STK.

The only negative is the outrageous cost of a in room massage.",5,2018,01,02
148,everything was perfect,"everything was perfect,nice and clean  room,beds are comfortable, good location very nice and modern hotel ,nice loby nice view from the terrace.breakfast,food and service was great.bar also was excellent.i really recomend this hotel",4,2018,01,02
148,Amazing hotel with excellent location,"We stayed at ME London hotel for 4 nights. We arrived at 10 am and they were able to check us in and give us our room at that early hour. Our room was quite large, very clean, extremely quite and very comfortable. The location is unbeatable, walking distance to many major attractions-for us this meant to be close to Covent Garden, National Gallery, and National Portrait Gallery. We were also able to walk to Tate Modern. We highly recommend it. ",5,2018,01,01
148,Superb stay and definitely 5star quality hotel,When you enter me. Hotel the staff are spot on it‚Äôs a wow in the reception treated like kings and queens love the radio roof top bar is fantastic drinks were rather expensive but you expect that in a 5 star hotel but I was surprised how reasonable priced the food was and good quality ,5,2018,01,01
148,"Well managed, beautiful design and very comfortable","Pleasantly surprised with the entire experience. Five star luxury, friendly service, comfortable and well appointed rooms. Can be a bit noisy due to traffic. Radio bar has great views over London and decent cocktails",5,2017,12,31
148,Fabulous as always,"I LOVE this hotel. Fabulous stay as always. Feel safe and feel special when I stay there. Best mojito ever. Perfect location. Happy staff. Smells awesome. Will stay again, just need to save some money :-)",5,2017,12,25
148,Perfect.,"Unlike any other hotel in London (in a good way). Super modern, space age almost.  Wry dark and moody spaces. The reception ‚Äòvoid‚Äô is spectacular.
Service was exceptional - from the pre arrival email to arrange a birthday surprise to housekeeping and front desk. 
Room was super comfortable and quiet. Great bathroom. The trademark ME lighting is a fun toy and much simpler than the Madrid hotel! 
Would return. ",4,2017,12,24
148,Sexy and chic!,"Targeted to a more younger affluent crowd which fitted us perfectly but I would not recommend this hotel to my parents for instance. ME London is Loud, vibrant and sexy. Everyone in the staff we encountered treated us as VIPs. Celebrated anniversary with my girlfriend. Received a welcome gift when arrived to the room. 

Overall a great stay and surprisingly well thought through design in the rooms and the whole building itself (Front desk). Highly recommend the rooftop bar for a drink before & after dinner out in town.",5,2017,12,23
148,Hard to find fault with this hotel,"I've stayed a few times at Me Ibiza and loved the concept of the hotel and the service. So we were excited to stay here and it didn't disappoint.
The design and architecture are amazing.
Slight delay at check in which I guess was only downside. We were offered an upgrade at a discounted rate but wanted to stick with Mode room.
Staff and service make this hotel - nothing too much trouble.
Mode room was large - lighting music set up was amazing.
very clean - room service quick and friendly and nice food.
Great double shower - lovely window overlooking The Strand. 
We asked for late check out on the Sunday and this was fine.
Had massages organised by concierge.
Drinks int he bar.
Basically did not want to leave!",5,2017,12,22
148,Another excellent stay,"Can not fault anything about this hotel, another great Christmas stay. The staff make you feel special and are so helpful.
Rooms are very comfortable, breakfast offers a great choice and the Radio Bar offers wonderful service and amazing views.
",5,2017,12,21
148,Brilliant Hotel and service,"Great hotel, customer service and quality of food / drink. During the stay we got treated by the staff as the only guests staying in the hotel. Staff had great knowledge of the local area and offered best places to visit and how to get to / from effectivity. ",5,2017,12,20
148,Chic and stylish,"My first visit to ME, but definitely not my last. 
Superb location on the Strand, the atmosphere hits you as soon as you walk through the door. It has a very modern and stylish feel, very contemporary and tasteful. Loved the black & white photos of David Bowie on the walls as well!
Check-in at reception on the first floor has a light show projected onto the walls, which you can enjoy laying on a couch drinking complementary prosecco - very cool! Being Christmas time, the reception also had a huge Christmas tree, modern and superbly done.
We were upgraded to a room on the 9th floor and what a view. Our balcony gave us views of most of the major London landmarks. The room itself was superb. Chic, spacious and very well equipped, with a large comfortable bed, huge bathroom and just a really decadent feel. The touch screen lighting control was useful with the ability to set the mood lighting to any colour you like. Bluetoothed our phone to the media station to play music, but it dropped the connection after a while and also had some background buzzing - my only very minor complaint.
With the hotel in the heart of theatreland, we walked to a nearby restaurant and show, after which we returned to the hotel and went up to the rooftop radio bar for some drinks. As with the rest of the hotel, this had such a good vibe, with great music, dancing, fantastic views and everybody obviously enjoying themselves.
After a good nights sleep, we enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant. 
The staff are all very polite, helpful and cheerful and this helps make it one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in. They have got it just right - upmarket, but not at all stuffy. To say we were impressed is an understatement and we look forward to our next visit.

148,Magical Magnificent ME London ,"This hotel is the first 5 star hotel for us and WOW! Absolutely outstanding. Ultra modern, sleek, sophisticated and high class services throughout our stay. Everything is spotless, management and staff acknowledge and appreciate you as their guest. Stayed on the 8th floor with a balcony to experience London by night from our room. A first!! Rooftop bar is classy and well managed. Magical (check out reception) and magnificent. Already booked for next Christmas. Very difficult to choose another hotel in London now due to this wonderful experience. ",5,2017,12,18
148,Amazing!!,"Wow!! What a stunning hotel ! Stayed in a wonderful suite overlooking The Strand and Somerset House. The staff were all so friendly and helpful - we went and had a drink in Radio Bar on the roof ....stunning ! Great cocktails too .
Our suite was superb ! Gorgeous bedroom and a separate living room with another TV where you can sit and have a drink before going out. Delicious plate of tasty treats and a bottle of Champagne on our arrival - how lovely !
Fabulous round bath and separate showers in two bathrooms - the amenities were also amazing . 
Breakfast delivered to our room next morning was really great too.
All in all a fantastic experience - we will be sure to come back.
Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou!!!",5,2017,12,18
148,Excellent Hotel in great location,"The reception check in area was stunning and the free glass of prosecco was a nice touch especially as it was my birthday. Also the complimentary bottle of champagne and cake for my birthday . The Radio bar had amazing views over London , I loved the whole feel of the hotel and will definitely return and recommend. ",5,2017,12,18
148,Not the kind of thing you will expect in London for a 5 star hotel,"Too many faults, lack of service, noisy rooms and corridors, and the list goes on.

Hugely dissappointed with the 4 nights experience and the expectation someone has when booking a room at a 5 star hotel in central London.

The hotel is more of a motorway than a 5 star hotel.

The quality of the installations dont stuck up with the signature of a 5 star either.

Once is enough for me.

148,Monochrome Marvel,"Let me help you out - to get to the reception, go straight through the glass doors, past the bar to the elevators at the end and go up to the first floor. The desk downstairs is concierge, who are very friendly, but cannot check you in! The hotel is very much like an art gallery, beauty and excess everywhere. I was quite overwhelmed by the reception area, situated in an apex in the middle of the building, images projected onto the white marble walls. Again staff very friendly and accommodating, I was offered prosecco on arrival and nothing was too much trouble. The room was very minimalistic, lots of white and glass. Views amazing. Double sinks and huge double shower. However - the mini bar is more like a mini shop, the only available free beverage is black coffee and breakfast is ¬£30pp. It is beautiful but not homely. All in all it‚Äôs an experience to stay here and certainly a feast for the eyes xx",4,2017,12,12
148,Denise Large,"Another Fabulous stay. We had a suite and it was really comfortable. This hotel has such a cool vibe. The staff are very friendly, efficient and welcoming. The roof bar is great. Valet parking also a bonus.
Can‚Äôt wait to go back.",5,2017,12,12
148,Beautiful and Energetic,"Design and fit-out at this hotel is stunning. Beautiful aesthetics is coupled with cutting edge functionality and in-room technology. A clean, fresh and modern feeling - which is rare in the centre of London. Attentive staff that are sensitive to improving the guest experience. I felt energised during my stay and will definitely return.",5,2017,12,10
148,excellent,I thought the hotel was very modern with attractive decor.  The staff was excellent. they were knowledgeable and made us feel like VIPs.  Good location. There was always a cab available for our daily travels.,5,2017,12,10
148,"Beautiful Hotel, great location ","This is a really stylish hotel in a brilliant location. 
I found all the staff to be very helpful and polite. 
A glass of prosecco when checking in is a nice touch and I loved the jellyfish projected on to the walls in reception!
The room was large, spotlessly clean and the bed very comfortable. 
The rooftop bar is worth visiting even in December with warm blankets and heaters. 
Breakfast was excellent, lots of choice and freshly cooked. 
I would recommend this hotel. I only stayed one night, not long enough, so will return. 

",5,2017,12,08
148,Its all about ME!,Luxury and modern hotel! Smells like heaven! AMAZING ROOMS! Spacious bathrooms. Nice corridors. AMAZING location. Amazing Hotel. Family trip made amazing. STK was tasty! Rooftop was very nice. Staff welcomes you when you arrive and make your stay pleasant! Really recommend this hotel!,5,2017,12,08
148,What a waste,"The ME Melia in London is in a great location near the Royal Opera House.  The hotel is new and the rooms are shiny.  But sadly, we are never coming back again.  The reasons for this are:

1.	the room is so high-tech you can‚Äôt get the lights to work.  The switch on the less important side of the bed will switch the room lights off but pressing the same switch will not turn the lights on again.  Several times, whilst sitting in our room, the lights went off whilst we were just sitting reading.  It was later explained to us that there are movement sensors in the room which govern the lights.  So if you sit still the lights turn off.  Madness.  

2.	the same high-tech system meant that the three-pin sockets in the room didn‚Äôt work.  Only one three-pin socket (set in the desk) worked.  So we couldn‚Äôt charge our phones and computers overnight.  Of course you don‚Äôt discover this until it‚Äôs bedtime.  So a maintenance man has to be called to your room at 10:40pm to reset the circuit for the room sockets.  Now you can charge your ‚Äòphone.  He‚Äôs a nice man and so gives you a lesson in the complexity of the automatic lighting and shows you the complex workaround to override the ‚Äúauto-off‚Äù feature of the room lights.  

Lift operations:

>	the lift doors don‚Äôt close easily.  Most lifts have a beam across the doors to stop you being sliced-in-two.  Not these lifts.  These lifts must have proximity sensors.  We had some farcical moments with other guests trying to figure-out how to get the lift doors to close.  Three, four and five attempts‚Ä¶still no luck. The most reliable way to get the lift doors to close was to huddle-up with strangers on the far side of the lift as far away from the doors as possible.  It was a moment of intimacy we had not expected.

>	lift security.  As is expected nowadays the lifts will not travel to bedroom floors without first recognising a room key: a sensible precaution implemented in the most stupid manner.  The lifts in the best designed hotels recognise the proximity of a room key.  Not these lifts.  You have to insert your key first.  There are four permutations for this.  Face up, face down and the two ends.  Only one of the four permutations works. Also the slot into which the card needs to be inserted is so narrow you have to be really accurate.  But it‚Äôs waist high and you haven‚Äôt got your spectacles on.  You‚Äôd think the lift designers had never seen a bank ATM whereby there is a v-shaped profile to guide your card into the slot. And finally the light which illuminates to confirm the card has been accepted by the lift controls is beneath the slot which means it is under your hand so you can‚Äôt see it.  There ought to an award for the worst designed set of lift security controls.  These lifts would win.

All-in-all this hotel drove us completely mad.  You don‚Äôt relax.  We ended-up exasperated or frustrated.  We raged about the idiocy of the design and the fact that clearly nobody tested the ergonomics of the room electronics or the lift controls. 

You just know there is a good chance that somebody got promoted for a brilliant high-tech design of the rooms when in reality they should have been demoted or fired.

And the reason why we‚Äôll never go back to this hotel again is you just know there is no chance that all these points will ever get fixed:  the lighting controls, the different circuits for 3-pin sockets, the lift controls.  No chance.  

I pity the staff who are going to be dealing with frustrated guests for years to come.",2,2017,12,08
148,Wonderful central hotel,"We were really amazed by the reception an indoor pyramid in black marble with jellyfish floating to the ceiling.The staff were very friendly and the glass of prosecco as we booked in was very welcome.We had arrived early so left our luggage which was taken to our room when it was ready.
The hotel is right in the centre of the theatre district and a few minutes from covent garden.We visited the wonderful roof top bar which has amazing views of London.
Our room was large for London hotels and very light and airy I loved the blinds rather than curtains.
The only thing that marred our visit was the shouting and banging made by other guests but that is not the hotels fault.
Will definitely be back and also recommend it to our friends.",4,2017,12,07
148,A good base for Covent Garden area,Spent a Saturday night here this week and the room was very good.  This is an Ultra smart designer hotel with some great flourishes . The bedroom was standard London sized but well equipped and with a nice bathroom. Lighting system was a bit unfathomable but conquered in the end. . Did not eat in but I would say its a bit on the expensive side as were the published drinks prices. staff were very courteous and the prosecco on arrival at reception was very welcome but weirdly was not available to purchase in the bars.,4,2017,12,07
148,"Trendy place, centrally located","This place is trendy/hip (for the under 35 crowd). Rooms are comfortable and clean. Staff are exceptionally helpful. Centrally located for public transportation: within walking distance of at least 3 Underground (Tube) stations of different lines, many buses, taxis/cab are easy hail, but do use the concierge to hail a cab because that way if you leave anything on the cab, they can call them for you.",5,2017,12,06
148,London Walking In Winter Wonderland ,"From the moment you enter the hotel the quality shines through. The friendly welcome from reception to the lovely touches in the room all add up to a hotel that knows how to make its customers happy. Room was large and comfortable with a monster bed that I did find a bit on the hard side. Location wise the hotel is in a great spot, easy walk to various tube stations or I wandered all the way To Hyde Park to see the Winter Wonderland which was a pleasant 40 Min stroll. 
Overall it‚Äôs a design hotel which may or may not be to your tastes but if you like modern and querky places then give it a go. ",5,2017,12,03
148,Worth splashing out that bit extra,"From the moment you arrive in the most amazing Hotel Reception on floor one with Prosecco on ice you know you are somewhere special.
LAURA went out of her way to make sure we knew everything about the hotel... i can honestly say nothing is too much trouble.
The rooms are qwirky but classy have stayed in many hotels and i will remember this for the right reasons from the double shower to the full control if the lighting from the control panel by the bed.
The roof top bar gives amazing views and is worth that bit extra for a gin n tonic to savour the views of Tower Bridge.
Oh by the way the beds are massive makes my king size at home look tiney tiny !!
Great location.. and worth the dollar if you want to go the extra mile . 
 ",5,2017,12,01
148,Great stay. Amazing hotel & location.,"I stayed for a weekend, to enjoy Les Misserables and take the oportunity to enjoy London¬¥s night life and atmosphere and the hotel was perfect in terms of location, service, and rooms & design. The hotel has an amazing roof-top bar worthwhile checking out, outstanding breakfast and the STK club to enjoy one or two drinks (or maybe more).",5,2017,12,01
148,"Terrible service, all the food and beyond overpriced ","The service was terrible, it took fifteen minutes for our order to be taken. It then took 45 minutes for our smoked salmon and scrambled eggs to arrive and when it arrived it was all stone cold. By this point we were absolutely starving so did not want to send back the food to receive something hot. 

All in all a very disappointing experience for very average food at a ridiculous price. Will definitely not be going back.",1,2017,11,30
148,Amazing Service for our group of 50!,"My company recently stayed at The ME London for a company away day and we couldn't have asked for more! 

From the initial reservation right through until after the event, the service was outstanding.

Would definitely visit again and would highly recommend.",5,2017,11,29
148,Modern hotel ,"Cute, modern hotel in central London. Shower was amazing, big TV, fantastic view, lovely mood lighting in room. Roof top bar was great with fantastic views. Welcomed to hotel with a glass of prosecco üëåüèº would return ",4,2017,11,29
148,Best Experience Ever,"Everything was great and I got a royal treatment and everybody made me feel at home.  The food was great, the bar was great, the location was great and personnel was great.  All the details ME does have for their guest top of the line.",5,2017,11,28
148,It was good for Me !!,"Great hotel, From the moment we arrived the staff were brilliant, Drinks on arrival,and very efficient and friendly staff,   Our room was ready although we were a couple of hours early, the room was very contemporary  with mood lighting and although very Contemporary was also very comfortable, We only stayed for 2 nights but if we had stayed longer might of needed more storage space, it was a special occasion and they made it special with Champagne ( which we drank on the roof top bar )  Pedro was very good but to fair so was everyone else,  The hotel roof top bar doubles as a bar for locals as well as other tourists so can be loud and busy ( but it seems to be the place to be ) also the contemporary design is very dark so anyone wanting light would be disappointed",5,2017,11,27
148,Weekend Away,"Stayed 2 nights while visiting London. 
Great location for theatre, shopping and the sites.
Friendly and efficient staff, well equipped rooms, interesting design concept with reception at the bad of an internal pyramid which runs all the way up to the roof top bar.
Great views over London as you sip cocktails. 
Breakfast very good too.
All in all a great place to stay.",5,2017,11,26
148,Amazing weekend ,"Stayed at the me London hotel and I must say from when you enter the hotel you are greeted by great friendly staff they are very attentive and make you feel like a vip. We had an amazing room the bed was so comfortable with the most gorgeous pillows.
The roof top bar is a must and the stk restaurant is mouth watering but make sure you book as it‚Äôs very popular, please don‚Äôt hesitate to book this hotel you will absolutely love it..
We will definitely be going back.
Thank you to all the staff at the me hotel especially Maria for a great weekend 
Ps prosecco at check in and champagne at breakfast is fabulous xx ",5,2017,11,23

148,5 star quality,"Beautiful reception entrance, felt like entering an exclusive nightclub.  Floor to rooms are very dark and expensive looking. Room was amazing, very minimalist, modern. Mini bar was a huge selection of cool food and snacks. Too expensive to buy though!  The bed was enormous and very comfortable. The bathroom is open planned with room to WC and shower room with 2 showerheads, plenty of room to have some fun in the shower.",5,2017,11,21
148,Returned for second visit won't be a third,"My wife and I chose to stay here for a 3 nights following a great experience staying there last year but this time it was very hit and miss.
Hit.
Fantastic location, great rooms, great rooftop bar.
Misses.
Numerous room card problems both trying to use the elevators and trying to get into our rooms, very frustrating.
Have experienced this problem from time to time in other hotels but not so many times (repeatedly!)
Worst of all was breakfast,
We were not late for breakfast where you sometimes expect the food on show to be sparse or possibly dried out.
Just looking at the food on show was enough to put us off ordering that so we opted for 2 eggs Benedict served at the table.
I ordered coffee my wife tea, coffee was luke warm at best, I got some hot coffee, my wife's tea needed hot water and although service was still going on I had to go to the desk to get some attention.
The eggs Benedict arrived , mine was on the cold side but edible, my wife's food chilled not cold.
I complained , the waitress apologised and took the food away.
By the time the replacement came I had finished my breakfast  (she should have removed both so that we could at least eat together)
The second serving was worse, next to no sauce and one egg was too raw to eat.
i complained again told the waitress I wanted the ""breakfasts"" removed from my bill and to cancel the 2 following days breakfasts.
The most annoying thing was that no one from management tried to contact us to apologise for the poor food served.
On checking out I was asked how was your stay I said good and bad (no response)
I asked if the breakfasts had been removed from my bill, yes came the response no further enquiry or apology.
Next year we will return to One Aldwych across the road, not as trendy but far far superior service and breakfasts.
Very disappointed with parts of the stay and the attitude of management.
Not may I add of the waitress who at least apologised.",3,2017,11,21
148,Trendy and cozy hotel,"Truly amazing experience from arrival to departure. Location is very close to SoHo and Covent Garden but also feel peaceful from congestion. My Room was locate on 8th floor with small balcony and good size room for central London. 
Staff are very friendly and well trained. 
One only point that need to improve is the speed of internet which I found that extremely slow and best to use mobile 3G! ",5,2017,11,20
148,Amazing hotel from the moment we walked in,"I can't speak highly enough of my experience at ME London this weekend. Having mentioned it was a surprise booking for my boyfriends birthday, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome with a few lovely little touches that made all the difference (message on the mirror, little cake in the room, champagne).
From the moment we stepped in to the lobby, we were greeted by friendly staff and overwhelmed at the beauty of the actual hotel and building. Drinks on the roof at Radio bar were splendid - warm balcony despite the cold and the view was amazing. Great cocktails and slick service from the bar staff.
The room was much bigger than expected and really modern, with a bed so comfortable it was a struggle to get out in the morning! I love the concept of the ""maxi-bar"" as opposed to the mini-bar!
Can't think of a single thing I would change about my experience and stay with ME and will definitely be visiting again and recommending to anybody who asks me where to stay in central London. The hotel is also right by the tube and opposite a busy bus stop so the location makes it very convenient to get around the city.
Huge thank you to all the staff who made it so pleasant!",5,2017,11,20
148,"Fancy common areas, average rooms.","Pros: The reception is stunning, never seen anything like this before. The staff are friendly and helpful. Common areas, bars, etc are good, a bit pricey, but good.

Cons: The corridors are dark, probably because they are meant to be fancy and different but sorry guys, it doesn't work. If you ever decide to go to the roof-top bar, make sure you stay indoors as it gets quite windy and they have no heating and cant get any heating even if you request. The rooms are average at best, and are surprisingly basic. In this DNAge, a couple of power sockets dont cut it, especially when even the average hotels now provide usb charging points in the rooms.",3,2017,11,19
148,Not the place to stay if you're in town for business.,"Overall small rooms (even after double upgrades, noisy from clubs and a not very good restaurant where there are many excellent ones in short walking distance. I come often to London and was recommended this place for it location nearby a conference I needed to attend.   Live and learn. ",2,2017,11,18
148,Beautidul,Amazing hotel from decor to food to anything. Stayed for my boyfriends birthday and they decorated the room and gave us a bottle of champagne which was a lovely touch. Highly reccomend booking through the hotel and not booking.com etc as they ask you about your stay and what your plans are etc. Food was good and rooftop bar was amazing. Rooms also much bigger than the pictures!,5,2017,11,16
148,"Great Service, chic hotel.","The hotel reception is one of the coolest spaces I've been in. The staff are extremely personable and service has always been excellent. The rooms are spacious and well designed and the bathrooms exemplary. 

My only criticisms are the fact you have to request an iron in your room desperately and the corridors feel like the set of a dark, dystopian thriller.

The rooftop bar is accessible to all hotel residents which is good because you can mingle with the rich kids of Instagram who probably paid to get up there, ha take that Quentin you have to share your hashtags with a northerner.",5,2017,11,15
148,Wonderful,"A wonderful experience from the beginning and even before, with a team dedicated to us and our needs who prepared our arrival and our whole stay on a perfect way. This a modern hotel with an impressive architecture, a warm group of people and many small details that really make the difference. Special thanks to the Aura Team for all that, we¬¥ll be back!",5,2017,11,13
148,Unique Design Hotel in London center!,"I have decided to stay at the ME London hotel my last days during my London trip. Amazing experience! If you wish to be at a very modern, unique decoration, special style and great location hotel, ME hotel should be your choice. A staff service super personalized and great food and beverage outlets! My congratulations to all the team and the hotel Manager Mr. Marly!",5,2017,11,11
148,Excellent experience,"A hotel to try, not to miss that makes you feel all London energy! Excellent service, friendly staff. Super design hotel, unique of its kind! Not to miss also the excellent quality and service at STK restaurant! Great presence, hands-on management and overall excellent follow up of hotel Manager Mr. Guillaume Marly. A true asset for the company!!!",5,2017,11,11
148,Great Location,"Modern, efficient, good location. Rooms well appointed, air conditioning effective. Would recommend it.  Radio Bar at the top was a great spot although some complaints from our group that the cocktails were nit the best.",4,2017,11,09
148,Hip Hotel,"The best thing about the hotel was the location. 

I was anxious staying at the hotel as it was my first time in the area - I usually stay in North West or South west London but did so this time for work. 
I wasn‚Äôt as impressed as I assumed I would be. But the location made up for everything. The corridors / elevators are very loud and a little dark - but that‚Äôs the whole point of the hotel - so it didn‚Äôt bother me much. 

As I was staying long, the staff ensured to take care of me and upgraded me when I had an issue with my room (due to guest neighbours). 
I didn‚Äôt end up visiting the rooftop - but I will return when the weather is more pleasant. ",4,2017,11,09
148,Amazing London Hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for the second time.  The first stay wasn't perfect but the hotels approach to customer service far exceeded our expectations.  I won't go into great detail but needless to say, we are completely sold on this brand because their company ethos is second to none.  I would highly recommend ME London to everyone and anyone!  You won't be disappointed.",5,2017,11,08
148,Best views in town,I've stayed at ME many times. We love the views from Radio Club at the top and the variety of cool restaurants you can find at this hotel. No doubt the perfect location to walk and enjoy downtown shopping areas.,5,2017,11,06
148,Mr Lake,Fantastic hotel the best I have stayed in. Thank you so much for a amazing weekend all the staff made the experience incredible. I am think of taken my daughter for her birthday as a surprise. Book here you won‚Äôt be disappointed ,5,2017,11,06
148,Too Dark!,The hotel hallways were so dark it was hard to see.  There is an ever present fragrance in the hotel common space as well as the rooms.  There is little storage space which is a problem if you stay longer than a weekend.,2,2017,11,06
148,"Trying so hard to be cool, it forgets to be comfortable","I stayed 2 nights/3 days in this new 5 star hotel in central London, as part of a large business group. It was an 'alright' stay, but a 5 star hotel (especially in London, where there are many to choose from) should be amazing in terms of guest comfort and attention to detail, and this place wasn't. The architecture and decor are certainly innovative, verging on the bizarre. For example the reception area is the dark interior of a large black granite pyramid, with a single skylight many metres above and images of jellyfish projected on the walls - yes, really. Almost everywhere in the public areas is black and many of the walls are angled strangely, which taken together make you feel like you've had a few drinks even if you are sober. The lifts all feature a TV playing loud music and a continuous loop of an ad for the Melia group, which becomes very annoying after 3 days. My room had a very comfortable bed and was quiet, but most of the lights were operated from a tiny iPad next to the bed, so that if you came in and wanted to turn the bathroom light on, you had to walk into the middle of the room to do so (via several clicks to get into the right menu), then return to the bathroom. I don't know what is wrong with having a switch on the wall next to the light it operates, but at least half my colleagues had difficulties either turning lights on in their rooms, or turning them off. The bathroom lights and the reading lights caused particular confusion. There was no kettle in the room, only a coffee machine (I don't drink coffee). However, the minibar did offer the chance to purchase a thong and cashmere socks......personally, I would have found a kettle, some teabags and proper light switches far more useful. Breakfast was OK. The hotel staff were all very nice and service was generally good, other than in the rooftop bar where it was rather disorganised (but they were always very busy - it is a lovely space). The meeting rooms were large but had no natural light. Overall, my stay was fine with no major problems, but I felt like I'd spent 3 days in a nightclub and was more than a little relieved to leave. I'm sure a lot of people love this place and its efforts to be trendy rather than ergonomic, but I wasn't one of them and wouldn't choose to stay here in my personal time.",3,2017,11,05
148,I am lovin it,"The ME at 336 - 337 Strand is just a design an stile pearl in London - and I have to admit - I really loving it - great and super stylish rooms, clean, perfect service and support and just a great atmosphere - perfectly located for your shopping tour or to see some musicals just around the corner... Simply perfect location and one of me top 5 Hotels worldwide",5,2017,11,01
148,Awesomeness at its best,"Fabulous experience..right from check in, to the rooms, the balcony, the food, the rooftop lounge, the staff, the location, the restaurants, to check out.... will stay here again for sure....awesome!The staff was very hospitable and super friendly...the room was fabulous & had a balcony.The rooftop lounge bar was crowded  in the day as well as the evenings and nights,great vibe & ambience & super f&b services...the location too is excellent if theatres,broadway shows, shopping,restaurants and pubs are what you looking for. Covent Garden is literally a 5 to 10 minutes walk from the hotel.
Very Classy Vibe.Warm and friendly staff. Loved it!!!",5,2017,10,31
148,The Best place to celebrate love ,"We had the most amazing weekend stay at ME London celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary. Thank you for such a great service and helpfull staff and a special Thanks for Maria for a wonderfull surprise setting in our room with beautiful flowers, bubbles, chocolate covered strawberries, rose petals on the bed and the most romantic quote on the mirror. We will for sure come back. ",5,2017,10,30
148,ME Melia London was an unexpected surprise in a good way !!!,"I need to be honest. I go to London a lot . There are two hotels I stay at usually, one was fully booked and the other was way to expensive as this was a business trip and I could not expense it at the price. So I ended up staying at the ME, because they had a good rate. They always seem to have discounts running, and that really is the reason I never stayed there. The thinking being, "" how can a really good hotel always give discounts""? Something must be wrong. Well I was wrong. Everything that defines a well appointed modern hotel they had. Modern design-check; strong shower-check; fast free internet-check; cool on premise nightclub-check; happening restaurant attached to building -check!!! There was nothing to complain about, I will be staying here again on my next trip!!!",5,2017,10,30
148,ME Melia is spectacular,"I would like to note that there was a booking issue with booking.com that the website would not fix, and the booking manager, Roy Garcia, kindly did.  This hotel has not only incredible design and ambience, but SUPERIOR SERVICE.  Further, the roof deck atmosphere is jaw-dproppingly awesome and the food was unexpectedly SECTACULAR. Because of my (and my guests) excellent stay; we will return annually.  There is no place we would rather be for our very special reunions.",5,2017,10,30
148,First time in London,"Overall great experience. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Convenient location, within walking distance to tourist attractions. Concierge was very accommodating. I was in need of a hair straightener as I had just burned mine out because of the voltage. One was brought up to my room and I used it for the duration of our stay. ",4,2017,10,25
148,Another fantastic experience,"Beautiful hotel, brilliant location and went above and beyond to make birthday experience fantastic - wouldn't hesitate to recommend for any occasion and look forward to going back - staff lovely from reservation to departure, really friendly and helpful and welcoming - fantastic experience ",5,2017,10,24
148,Beautiful Experience,"First rate experience from the moment I stepped into the hotel. The concierge was knowledgeable, professional and friendly. Check in and check out was smooth. Every employee went out of their way to please guests and the room was just beautiful. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,10,20
148,Could not fault anything,"We‚Äôve just spent a lovely night in this hotel for our wedding anniversary.

The room was beautifully finished, the staff were welcoming and professional. We felt totally spoilt, with glasses of bubbles wherever we went! A generous touch and appreciated.

Roof top bar was best to visit earlier on, we felt. The large crowd of late night drinkers lacking in basic manners, but the music was great. Hotel not at fault here. Hardly surprising it draws such a crowd with it‚Äôs outstanding views.

Would definitely recommend and return again. Thanks to all at ME.",5,2017,10,20
148,Fabulously Chic in the heart of London,"Absolutely adore this hotel. The staff are wonderful, the rooms modern luxury and mostly with a balcony which is such a rarity in big cities these days. Check in is a breeze as is check out, organised a small breakfast in the room nothing is too much trouble. The STK restaurant is out of this world with the best quality steaks, fabulous cocktails, swanky decor & a top class DJ, all make for a truly amazing night out in the hotel premises! The Radio Rooftop Bar is also great although it could do with more seating that cant be reserved and also more staff on at the bar. Love love love this place! ",5,2017,10,18
148,A must stay,"From the moment they take your reservation to the moment you leave everything is perfect.
Top class facilities without losing its personal touch in customer service 
It's a stunning hotel.

Thank you to Pedro from the aura team for increasing the wow factor
also.

I hope I get to visit again.",5,2017,10,17
148,Repeat visit to an amazing hotel,"This was my third stay at ME London.  Again, the choice was largely down to its location as we were attending a performance at Covent Garden.  But it has its own attractions too including a great rooftop bar and stylish modern interiors.

For this visit I booked an Energy Urban Terrace Room as I wanted to see what the balcony was like.  This was the only slightly disappointing feature as the high concrete wall somewhat limited views.  However, the room itself was spacious with all the electronic features (including mood lighting) I've come to enjoy at ME London.  Wardrobe space is very limited, but was ok for one person.

I joined some friends for pre-dinner drinks one night and post-opera drinks the next night at the Radio Bar.  This is a great, lively, trendy bar and on the Saturday night we were there featured some live music and dancers.  Excellent cocktails too.

Friendly and welcoming staff.",5,2017,10,16
148,"Amazing hotel, decor & location","Wonderful hotel! Complimentary drink given the moment you arrive in the wonderful reception area - a very tall room that goes all the way upto the rooftop bar. Very good sized hotel room, fully packed minibar with a great selection of drinks and snacks, comfortable bed. Location is great - easy access to the west end, not too far to anywhere and easy to get to city airport. ",5,2017,10,15
148,Excellent rooms,"Excellent room. We were in the ""mode"" room so very spacious.Reception and concierge excellent. Location is very good. 
Ptoblem with noise juring weekend. There is a dancong bar and you hear the basses in the room until the early hours of the morning. So not for light sleepers",4,2017,10,12
148,Very pleasant and civilised experience,We had a very pleasant experience at the ME London last weekend. The room exceeded expectations and the radio roof top bar was a very pleasant place to relax a while. Breakfast also exceeded expectations with serving to a very civilised 11:30 on the Sunday and 11:00 on the Monday. ,4,2017,10,12
148,Very Cool Vibe,"I reached London early morning so didn't have expectations in getting an early check-in. Yet the hotel front desk and concierge made me feel welcomed and worked on organizing a room once available. The staff was very social, the vibe of the hotel was very cool and the venue is in a great neighbourhood. The Radio Rooftop Bar is a great place to kick off the night before dinner at STK. Overall, very cool venue to hang out at in London. ",5,2017,10,11
148,I would 100% recommend Hotel Me!,"Staying at Me was both impressive and very cool! We enjoyed a fabulous stay, the view from our room was simply exciting!  A remarkable place with the added bonus of the sensational rooftop bar!! Just wonderful!!",5,2017,10,11
148,Fabulous! Just Fab,We had a lovely experience staying at this hotel. The trip was a family event that involved a Birthday. All staff met all our needs in all areas. We spent one evening in the radio roof top bar which was super. The boys requested a PS game in the room and the staff helped them sort it out even supplying many games. Above and beyond üëèüëèüëè,5,2017,10,11
148,Anniversary Trip,"Came here with hubby for our first anniversary trip. For some reason, the style of the room wasn't exactly what I anticipated (I wanted a Scandinavian vibe) but our overall stay was good despite the surprise of the interior. 

What I liked about the most are the location and the bed. We find the location very convenient and it's nicely situated, just off the popular touristy sites. We don't typically take buses (but gotta do it cuz we're in London) and for some reason, many of the places we went during the trip had buses right by our hotel :) And the bed, the softness was just nice. We often had problems with beds in the hotel since it's hard to find what I called ""heavenly bed"" but ME hotel definitely fulfilled our standard. 

I wish I could be back to London again. It's a place I hope to call home again some day.",4,2017,10,10
148,Wonderful ,"Modern, comfortable, high level service, perfectly located, very nice staff. A very luxury hotel. Just one fault: not all the people they accept in the Radio bar are beautiful people. But we'll come back for sure!",4,2017,10,09
148,Beautiful stay,"We stayed at the ME for 8 nights at the end of our visit, due to the front end of our trip being postponed by Hurricane Irma.  The hotel is beautifully modern and the staff was very attentive.  We had a nice balcony room on the 8th floor which always is a must-have for us, and one of the reasons we originally booked the ME.  The room was large, the bed was very comfortable.and the large shower had 2 rainfall showerheads as well as a body spray.  The fitness room was small, and perhaps could have used a few more weight machines, but overall it was clean and well-stocked with water, towels and fruit.  The location was very convenient to everything we wished to do and see. Overall the experience was extremely satisfying and we would definitely stay at the ME again.",5,2017,10,07
148,Classy ,I have been many luxury hotels but experience I had during my visit to this property was excellent one. From interior design to service provided was excellent. Roof top bar is great place to chill out as well as the restaurant on the ground floor. I will be back again.,5,2017,10,07
148,Breathtaking Experience,"Amazing stay at what I consider to be one of the best hotels anywhere. Its artistic decor and stylish attitude enhanced our stay, and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. It was luxury in the heart of London!",5,2017,10,04
148,Excellent Hotel,This is the second time we stayed as we obviously very happy with the quality and location of this hotel. Even though it is relatively pricey but still worthwhile spending the extra money as I know what I'm getting for my money.,5,2017,10,03
148,What does this mean?,"Very pleasant experience, overall.   One observation - we paid for a balcony (with view) but our ""view"" was just rooftops, which did nothing to enhance our stay.   If the ""rooms with a view"" were situated under the Radio Bar, the noise levels would have been most intrusive.",4,2017,10,03
148,Business and Relaxation,"A midweek trip to London on Business with my wife, followed by an evening and the following day to relax and enjoy time together (without the children) in the city. ME London is the prefect hotel in the perfect location. Fantastic ambience from the entrance to the hotel all the way through to the suite, being here makes any occasion  that little bit more special. I must mention Radio, the roof top bar, which offer fantastic views of the city. Finally the staff, friendly, helpful, excellent. Finally, special mention for Front of House Manager; Dimitri for his excellent service.",5,2017,10,02
148,Perfect location a little noisy at night,"Three generation, girls weekend.

The car is valet parked by concierge for ¬£49 for 24 hours very easy and quite reasonable for London.
Beautiful inside. Very modern. Corridors a little dark but very atmospheric. 
Rooftop bar has great views. We went up just after midday and found somewhere to sit but many tables were reserved. Drinks expensive but the surroundings command that I suppose. Staff lovely.
Rooms modern, clean and comfy. Beds huge, I mean really huge. We were in two connecting Vibe rooms and I was expecting large floor to ceiling windows but on the the 7th floor that's not possible. Reception tried to move us but they were fully booked and made a note for when we stay again. The view was lovely, from the London Eye to the Shard and everything in between.
Lifts were a bit annoying. There are 3 but one is only used to go to the rooftop and back down. The others, you need your room key to work and it will only work if you put it in the right way. Caused some hilarity.
The only real negative was, despite the thickness of the doors, late night revellers were very noisy in the night. (2am, 4 am and again at 7am) clearly nothing the hotel can do about disrespectful clientele but wonder if it is because the hotel does have a nightclub on the ground floor (albeit a very posh trendy one) reception were very good about this the next day though and reduced our bill slightly which was greatly appreciated.
There is a pod coffee machine and if you want tea or milk they deliver it fresh, we did not know this so went without. Again a note has been made of our preferences for when we stay again, it was just a shame we didn't know that earlier.
We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we were not hungry enough to spend ¬£25 a head, so we popped out down the Strand and paid ¬£30 in total instead.
We returned to the lobby and our car was delivered back to us. Perfect.
I would return as it was a real luxury treat, but just maybe not on a Saturday night.

",4,2017,10,02
148,Weekend break,"We had an amazing stay for my 30th birthday, greeted with glass of fizz on arrival the staff really can't do enough to make you feel welcome. The rooms are modern and clean with great views, we were on the 7th floor.

The hotel is in the perfect location, and the views from the roof top bar are awesome.

Certainly a Birthday to remember and we will be back for sure.",5,2017,10,02
148,Excellent service ,"Prior to arrival staff was made aware this was our wedding night stay, we did expect some added touch but were pleasantly surprised as to the level of attention to detail that was provided. The room being up to the standards one would expect but the beautifully set mood lightning, petals and more than a dozen roses, chocolate covered strawberries, hot bath been prepared etc. made our stay incredibly memorable. Beautifully designed hotel, must visit roof top bar.  ",5,2017,10,02
148,Great,Great place central..close to everything. Good lower lounge and roof top patio. Check in was easy. Staff was great. Rooms were larger than i thought. Breakfast was also good. The only problem which was minor were the slow elevators,5,2017,10,01
148,My new favourite Hotel in London,"We booked this hotel for 3 things:
- location
- rooftop bar with nice views
- design
We loved the design of this hotel, exactly to out taste. 
The location is great too, especially if you like the covent garden area which is a few minutes away.
We had booked a table at the rooftop bar which was amazing. It was very easy to get up and be seated, the waiter always put attention to us and the service was quick. The rsvp cocktail was very yummy:) and the views are incredible.
We were made to feel welcome by very helpful members of staff. For my birthday, they had arranged a little cake/mousse with a candle and a bottle of champagne. There was a handwritten note as well which was all very nice. We were told we got an upgrade but from the photos on the homepage we don't really know what the difference between some rooms are, so I don't know which room we had. Anyway, it was quite spacious and very lovely-we loved it. A very nice touch were the continental plugs so we did not need adapters! The breakfast was very good quality too. 
Thank you for making our stay so special in my new favourite hotel in London. We felt like VIPs for 2 days:)",5,2017,10,01
148,Value for money,"I did not feel that it was a value for money considering the size of room and overall amenities. Please look into the means to better the amenities like permanent iron board, a bigger size water bottle and more tv channels. ",3,2017,10,01
148,Great location and rooftop bar,"Really nice modern hotel with excellent rooftop bar, Suite was fantastic and large for Central London, had a great stay and room was relatively quiet being right on the Strand.
Only downside is the rooftop bar elevator was down for most of my stay and the staff didn't work it very well as they had paying guests wait for elevators to go to their rooms whilst outside people were taken to the rooftop bar, this was during the day around check in and out time, which was really inconvenient, not at night time which I would understand.",4,2017,09,30
148,Gem of a hotel,"Booked over the internet, sight unseen. What a place! Great architecture, great looks and what service! Just shows how checking TripAdvisor is worth it.
Has a roof top bar/restaurant which I did not have time to try. Did use the ground floor restaurant ‚ÄúSTK‚Äù which as it sounds serve steak, and some other foods. Eat the steak. Just eat the steak. This was to die for. Juicy, tender, cooked to perfection. 300g fillet was superb. A friend the second night joined me and had the sirloin, I had the fillet again!
Rooms are excellent, including a huge range of goodies if you want them. Well laid out, great bed, and if you get the Energy River Terrace Room, it has a balcony with a great view over central London.
Staff amazingly helpful and their when you need them.
Right in the centre with easy walking to theatres and Covent Garden or down to the river.
Well worth a stay.",5,2017,09,29
148,Wouldn't stay anywhere else!,My husband and I visit London yearly and this year went for his Birthday and Fashion Week. We were greeted with breakfast and a bottle of champagne upon our early arrival. We always stay at the ME Hotel because it is right in the center of all the action on the Strand and we'll connected to the underground. The restaurants are world-class and the cocktails superb and creative. The service is above and beyond and the Hotel is hip and contemporary. We wouldn't stay anywhere else!,5,2017,09,28
148,Perfect hotel,"I took my girlfriend here for the weekend and it was a great hotel and the rooms are beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful. Having access to the rooftop bar without having to queue was a great addition, the view of London are fantastic from the bar. The hotel is well situated for a trip to London. A great option but this doesn't come cheap",5,2017,09,28
148,ME experience,"I treated my husband to a weekend stay at ME for his 30th birthday, we had a fab weekend away and were very impressed with the hotel, it was very luxurious and had everything we needed. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My only gripe was the fact there wasn't a kettle in the room, my husband is a coffee drinker so the coffee machine was fab for him but I'm a tea drinker and that was the only thing that bothered me.",4,2017,09,27
148,Modern Chic but with a Warm Personal Experience,"This is a Chic hotel with a modern feel and great design.  The architecture is fabulous and they make good use of an old building.  It is minimalistic yet sophisticated.  They try to create a modern hip vibe and even though I'm of an older generation, the staff want out of their way to be warm, friendly and professional.  Our room had all the amenities and was mostly insulated from the street noise or from other rooms.  The bed and bedding were luxurious.  It feels like a newly renovated hotel and it's location is tremendous in terms of walkability to all the major tourist sites including the nearby Covent Gardens and theatre district. The front desk was helpful and efficient.  The Concierge desk was courteous, friendly and professional.  The views from the Rooftop Radio bar are second only to the London eye.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,09,27
148,¬£600 taken off my card,Do not stay at this hotel. They took ¬£600 off my card! Accused me of scratching the television which I di not do!!! No emails or calls! Just ¬£600 off me!!! Terrible hotel I will never stay there again. I am often in London but will never stay here! Very very upsetting.,1,2017,09,26
148,Outstanding contemporary hotel in the heart of London,"The hotel was great overall, Starting from the exceptional room design to the service to the location. the best hotel i have stayed in London so far. Recommended for all sorts of trips weather business, family, couples. friends or solo.",5,2017,09,26
148,So close but so far,"Maybe my experience wasn't great because we opted for a handicap room over a regular room so we could check in quicker...but even then i would think a handicap room would have been better than this.  Our ""king size"" bed was two twin beds put together...not sure if all king beds are like this or just the handicap rooms either way it makes for a not so comfortable sleep.  The other interesting issue with the two twin pushed together king bed was that it was very low to the ground, any one i know who has issues walking and bending or is handicapped would not have been able to get out of the bed on their own without difficulty. Another odd issue was the shower, we knew there was going to be a shower seat which was no big deal...but the odd issue came when it was time to put down the shampoo bottle or the soap...there was NO WHERE to put it.  I would think there would have been a shelf especially since the shower was designed for individuals with disabilities, clearly they would not be expected to put the shampoo or soap on the floor and have to bend down every time they needed something?  I think someone needs to revisit this design and maybe add a small shelf and possibly think of raising the bed (and the heated bathroom floor didn't seem to work)?  The lounge area by the concierges was very modern and trendy but due to the fact that it was London fashion week (insert major eye roll) we felt like we couldn't actually sit back and enjoy it even though we were guests.  Maybe booking at a different time would have been better.  The staff was friendly and helpful especially the concierges staff they were great.  The gym was small but good enough to get in a quick work out while on vacation.",3,2017,09,25
148,ME a wonderful experience,"I stayed  at ME London for a week at the end of August. I picked this Hotel initially for its location.As a tourist new to London the hotel was central to most tourist hot spots and also it is located next to the Theatre district. The room was modern with a bed that was heaven to crawl into at night. The staff were attentive and extremely helpful.  A  great place to unwind.

148,Incredible hotel with amazing customer service,"We have hosted events at the ME London Hotel for several years now and each time it is an absolute pleasure!

The hotel staff all have incredible customer service skills, always do their upmost to help with any request and we love working with them.

The ME London itself is a gorgeous, luxurious hotel featuring innovative design and is the best place to stay in London!",5,2017,09,21
148,Great location comfortable room,This is a trendy hotel yet the room is nice and the bed is very comfortable. A bit of night club scene around at night though. Reception and Radio Bar were closed due to private event at that one night I planned to visit... Anyway I enjoyed my stay and would like to stay there next time in London. ,5,2017,09,20
148,"Excellent value for money, superb comfort and attentive staff","First time stay - loved the room with a view and balcony. Superb bedding, technology and ambient lighting. A great one-nighter having arrived late off a flight. Great breakfast before heading off on another long haul flight. Couldn't have asked for a softer landing.",5,2017,09,20
148,Our long weekend at ME London...,We had 35 guests staying here for a long weekend and we were really well loooked after!  We would definitely recommend the hotel and can't wait to return...radio bar has spectacular views and the atmosphere in SDK on the Saturday night was great fun with lots of dancing!  The staff and whole team could not have been more accomodating.....fantastic location for shopping too!,5,2017,09,20
148,My stay in ME London,"Lovely hotel, in a very good location in London , very close to Convent Garden and other main tourist attractions , clean and friendly, helpful staff, contemporary Modern design  which makes it unique from the other hotels I visited in London .

",5,2017,09,20
148,Great place,"Great location, great stuff, the room was clean and the bad was very comfortable.
Breakfast is highly recumended, and also the the bar on the rooftop.
The staff was very helpful and the wifi is very good",5,2017,09,19
148,"Very trendy, modern hotel","This is a real cool, modern hotel parked in a great part of London, with easy access to most things. The hotel is purposely very dark with low lighting, but it's very cool. There is music playing throughout the day (at 7 in the morning it might be a little bit too much!) in the lifts and hall areas,  the staff are all extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are a fairly good size with extremely comfortable beds and nice bathroom facilities - although everything is frosted glass!  Breakfast was very nice too. It's expensive, but would recommend it. ",4,2017,09,19
148,BEST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN! ,"Click back and book this hotel straight away! It's incredible! 
The location was perfect and the hotel itself is stunning. The lobby .. WOW! 
You know it's a nice hotel when they give you a champagne when you check in. Housekeeping also kept the room so clean and always said hello when you passed them. I didn't want to leave! 
Also - I have stayed in a lot of hotels! 
Book it! ",5,2017,09,18
148,Stylish and lively,"ME provides you with an attractive package for a weekend trip in summer:  leading-edge design and ambience (thanks to Sir Norman Foster), a convenient location and a popular rooftop bar (the crowd may not be he coolest on earth, but interesting indeed) ",5,2017,09,18
148,M e London ,"While working at proms in the park I stayed here and I normally stay at some high end hotels but no more it's all about M E what a place see for yourselves London at your finger tips. The staff are the best couldn't do enough for us but the hotel is an experience in it's self THANK YOU 
M E ",5,2017,09,17
148,Beautiful hotel,"Myself and husband stopped at this hotel from 9 to 11th Sept for our 10 year anniversary. Staff are all lovely and the hotel amazing. 

When we got to our room, i was hoping for something to recognise our anniversary but there was nothing. I was dissappointed with this considering how much money we spent to stay. The staff at the desk when checking out said happy anniversary but it was pointless when leaving the hotel. Its the one thing i was hoping for as its was a special weekend end for us.

After checking in, 5 minutes of being in our room, i found someone elses boxer shorts under the bedside table and some rubbish in our bin. I reported this and two managers came up. The manager expressed his apology which was nice and when checking out he came to us personally and just made sure we had a nice stay. Again, i think the hotel could have sent something complimentary to our room for the inconvenience or on checking out taken 10 percent off our bill as on your anniversary you dont want to find something like that in your room so i was a little dissappointed with that.

The rooftop bar was amazing, we had afternoon tea there (which i felt needed more savoury food on there as there was a lot of sweet, it was more like we had a dessert then the afternoon tea) but the view was fantastic.

Overall we had a fantastic time and the hotel is in a great location.",4,2017,09,15
148,Disappointed ,"In the past weeks we stayed in the hotel in London, 5 friends and myself, we were a group of 6 in total and I am greatly disappointed with the service that the concierge gave us. We asked if he could reserve tickets for the whole group for ""Kinky Boots"" and he kindly did so. At the end of the show we found out that the tickets the hotel sold us actually costed 65‚Ç¨ and the concierge charged us 130‚Ç¨ per ticket...we were a group of 6 and paid 780‚Ç¨ when in reality we only had to pay 390‚Ç¨.... the concierge never even mentioned that the hotel charged an additional fee, we thought that his was a hotel cortesy and in this case it ended up being more than double the price of what it actually costed... i feel robbed.",2,2017,09,12
148,Totally Worth it,"Inexpensive in comparison to other comparable hotel status levels. The attention to detail and the quality of customer service is one to be reckoned with. I absolutely loved this hotel. From the swanky bar and  breakfast selection downstairs, to the modern feel of the hotel room floors. Also, just a tip--ask to stay on the 4th floor. The rooms are very spacious and level of technology is non-stop fun. Perfect for the tech savvy or those looking to celebrate life. Note: make a reservation for STK and most definitely radio-bar. The views from the top are beautiful however it fills up very fast. Hotel guest as given priority but it is opened to the public.",5,2017,09,12
148,A- MAY-ZING  Definitely  the place to be,"Vey modern, new and stylish.  Staff so helpful and friendly.  The rooftop bar a must do, as is the restaurant - STX?, both buzzing on a Saturday night.  Food amazing too.  Will definitely revisit but needs more than a one night stay to be able to appreciate all this hotel has to offer",5,2017,09,11
148,They take good service very seriously and it shows,"This is my fourth or fifth trip to ME and despite my previous misgivings - credit where it is due - the levels of service and professionalism on display here are some of the best of any top-flight London hotel.

We were upgraded from a chic suite to a signature suite (I think that's what it was called).  On the 8th floor.  Great views from the room and balcony (balcony was quite a surprise at this hotel).  Superb suite.  Could not fault it.  The rest of the hotel still impresses too.

Visited the rooftop bar and very wisely made a booking for 22.00.  If you are staying at the hotel and you want to use the rooftop bar then you really should book a table (if like me you want to sit down with a drink!) as it is the victim of its own success somewhat.  If you cant get in the rooftop bar don't worry - in my view the bar on the ground floor is just as good but in a different way.

All staff encountered were superb.",5,2017,09,11
148,Great location and great views,Stayed in one of the Urban Terrace rooms on the upper floors.  This gave us fantastic views over London and well worth the slight increase in price.  The hotel itself is very chic and well maintained.  With very few exceptions most of the staff are really friendly and helpful.  We enjoyed our stay and use of the facilities.  The only real downside was that the Radio bar was near enough fully booked even early evening (around 6) as the hotel had a club event/night.  It was disappointing as hotel guests we were initially told they did not have a table but were eventfully found one.  One the whole though this is a must visit hotel and the Radio bar is a great venue for drinks with views over London.,5,2017,09,06
148,Couldn't Do Enough For Us.,"Stayed here over the weekend while celebrating my sisters birthday. The concierge staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderfully stay. Small touches like emailing me a few days before arriving to help arrange any reservations I might need was a lovely touch. Even better was them rearranging those reservations on short notice when plans fell through on my end. 

We stayed in the Aura room on the second floor and had a lovely view of the nearby theaters. The room itself was spacious,modern,quiet and clean and the bed is to die for. The bathroom however had to be my favorite part of the room, with its 'His & Her's' sinks and powerful shower. 

Had breakfast in the room and although at first glance thought the portion sizes were small, we found ourselves full and unable to finish it. We also had cocktails at the bar downstairs and the bartender couldn't have been more courteous and helpful. 

All in all had an amazing stay. The hotel,staff,food and location is prefect. Will stay again.",5,2017,09,05
148,birthday treat,"well from the moment we got into the hotel we could tell it felt luxury. it's modern and very nice. 

before coming I told the hotel it was my girlfriends birthday and my girlfriend was so happy when we got into the room and there was rose petals on the bed. a nice bunch of flowers. a bottle of champagne and a personalized message for her on the window.

we also got booked in to the stk and the rooftop bar. both are very pricey and not organized. 

our train home wasn't till late in the day and we got to keep our bags at the hotel and it was a hot day when we came to collect them we got a glass of water given to us and a taxi ordered. the staff here make you feel well come.

thanks for making our stay a good one.",5,2017,09,03
148,One night stay,"One day before going to Southampton for a cruise. Boy, I wish I had stayed there longer.  Arrived early and the check in staff did everything possible to find me a compatible room to the one I booked for early check in.  Sleek and spacious with a wonderful view, full tub and the coolest mood lights.  Got in late after dinner and the staff ran the light show for us without hesitation.  Pampered from begging to end.  Can't wait to go back.",5,2017,09,03
148,"Modern, brilliant staff, lovely hotel","Came here for my 18th birthday and was so welcomed and felt so relaxed and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  Could not have asked for more.  Had a table booked at the Radio Bar which was fabulous, beautiful views, very helpful staff and liked the idea of being fast tracked in because we were hotel guests and met with a complimentary glass of Prosecco as well! Would love to stay again. ",5,2017,09,03
148,Amazing!!!,"Stayed there on bank holiday and the service, decor, food and experience was amazing. The cake and champagne in our room for our special day was a lovely touch! Also we got upgraded to the FAB Passion Suite. I didn't want to leave!! Can't wait to return. What a gorgeous hotel....",5,2017,09,01
148,Birthday,"I celebrated my birthday and wanted to stay at the hotel & dine at the restaurant. The hotel was lovely, staff were friendly. Room exceeded my expectations. I was overwhelmed the detail of the room was fit for my stay. ",5,2017,09,01
148,Birthday celebration ,Had a lovely stay at the ME London for my birthday celebrations. The staff were all very helpful and friendly and we had some lovely added extras to add to the celebration so thank you to everyone. We will defiantly be returning. ,5,2017,09,01
148,"Brilliant location, gorgeous hotel & amazing staff","Hotel is brilliant location being located right by Covent Garden and only a walk from Victoria Station. We also visited STK for dinner & had drinks at Radio, which are all located within the hotel. This hotel is perfect for a couples break away.",5,2017,08,31
148,Great time on the Strand!,"Great staff, nice vibe, excellent location. The STK restaurant is very good with a good selection of food and very good service. The room was clean and checked on twice a day --- we never have to ask for something they were on top of things. ",5,2017,08,31
148,First Class!,"Great location. Everything you would expect from a 5 Star hotel in London, & more.  Excellent service all round. We stayed in an Urban Energy room on the 9th floor. Fantastic view from balcony. Highly recommended.",5,2017,08,30
148,Birthday treat,"Stayed at the ME for 1 night.  Perfect location to all stations, shops and the normal London attractions.  Staff were extremely helpful at checkout with prosecco or soft drink on arrival and accommodated our request of keeping a birthday cake safe for me until needed later that evening.  The rooms are spacious and immaculate. Hotel room service was quick when needed.  Very trendy roof top bar had great views of London.  ",5,2017,08,30
148,Late stay request and concierge,"We stayed in three rooms for three nights. We asked to keep one room until 5pm before leaving for airport. We were happy to pay the extra. The reception said no room available and we had to check out at noon. But we found in booking.com that there were many rooms available. 

Then, we told the reception to send concierge to take luggages downstairs when we checked out. No concierge came to bring 10 luggages from three rooms down. Tried to call few times only to get to answering machine. No response. After 20 minutes, we brought the luggages down ourselves. We told the concierge in charge at the counter and he just said that he was busy. Five stars?",2,2017,08,29
148,Birthday Treat,"Excellent stay at this hotel.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  We arrived at the hotel before Noon and were able to check in straight away.  They upgraded us to a more superior room at no extra cost.  The Roof Top bar was great.
Would definitely visit again",5,2017,08,29
148,You get what you pay for........,"My wife and I stayed at the ME London for 7 nights. The hotel is ultra modern. We were greeted with mineral water/prosecco. Our room was very nice......plenty of space, awesome bali rain shower, in room amenities were great

The english breakfast was super. Plenty of variety for anyone's palate The food was great. The servers were all very friendly.

The staff was outstanding. Being there for 7 nights, the staff made us feel like regulars. The staff were helpful with all of our needs. They gave us helpful hints on transportation, places to check out, and places we really shouldn't go to.

The rooftop bar: We never had a problem getting in. The cocktails are expensive........but worth it! They were real cocktails, not watered down. The bartenders, though busy, were very friendly. As we always chose to be seated at the bar, we were able to have conversations with them and they were great. One, originally from the Czech Republic, was awesome.

The ME is not cheap, but it is a great place to stay. Unequivocally,  we would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2017,08,28
148,Great views little pricey,"We stayed for 2 nights for our anniversary. We had a room on the 9th floor with a terrace and view over the Thames. A stunning view both during the day and evening. The hotel is very stylish and the rooms are well appointed. I have never seen a better stocked mini bar in any other hotel, however it's not cheap, but it it London.
There are some really nice touches such as the lighting and air conditioning controls from a touch pad, a beauty set in the bathroom and a toothbrush kit.
The door to the patio is double glazed but does not seem to cut down on the traffic noise which is a busy thoroughfare and a main route for the emergency services. Also the walls are a bit thin, we could hear the staff moving the furniture at about 7am on Sunday morning.
The only grips about the room was there was no kettle to make a a cup of tea. If your a coffee drinker your in luck as there is a great Nesspreso machine.
Breakfast in any London hotel is not going to be cheap but it's ¬£25 each for a full English which is too much. We went to the cafe over the road and had breakfast for the two of us for ¬£17 with extra tea.
All in all a lovely hotel and a great experience, but maybe save it for special occasions.",4,2017,08,27
148,Sven,"Great hotel, all the staff great, nicely modern, great bars, great restaurants, great cleanness, I have staid there many times and I always book it if it's available for acceptable price but often it's very busy that take the price up.",5,2017,08,26
148,Amazing!!,Absolutely loved this hotel!!  It is very modern and stylish with a great location thrown in.  Its only a 5 minute walk to Covent Garden and about 10 to Regent Street. The staff are extremely friendly and the rooms are very comfortable.  We especially liked the rooftop bar and the main restaurant.  We will definitely be back!!,5,2017,08,25
148,Modern & Friendly & Wonderful Hotel,"My first trip to London became wonderful experience with stay at Me London.
All staff here were nice and doing great service. I felt professionalism from them.
Room are very modernized and well equipped. 
i definitely will stay again.
Thank you! ",4,2017,08,24
148,Exceptional staff and lovely hotel,"Staying for 1 night with 2 children under 10 - from the moment I booked it's been a great experience. Lovely email asking if I had anything I could help with before I even arrived. From concierge to reception excellent experience, very early check in accommodated and nothing seems like to much trouble for the lovely staff. Breakfast booked for tomorrow morning in my room so no food review however experience so far is great. Rooms are a great size especially for the location and so clean. Thank you to the staff for making this such a lovely experience.",5,2017,08,23
148,Summer Vacation,"The hotel is modern, new, very clean! The building is different than an ordinary hotel. The hall is amazing, it's like a cone with 3D effect. Staff and the hotel manager are very kind. It's my second time in Me-London and it's not the last one. Our room (deluxe) is very big and clean with every comfort. Our toilet was clean (we usually find dirty and old ones in other hotels). Location is amazing, you can easily go to covent garden or Piccadilly. ",5,2017,08,23
148,Exceptional customer care,"We stayed here as a treat for a special anniversary and were very well cared for by the professional team at ME. From the free champagne and chocolate in the room to the welcome message, every effort was made to make our stay special. We were upgraded to a river balcony room so had a great view ( standing up as the wall is too high to sit down) 
We visited the Radio rooftop bar,  with all the young hipsters, which is a stunning space with incredible views. We had expected to pay over the odds for a drink instead were given a free glass of Prosecco, presumably because we were hotel guests. We found a table to sit at on a Tuesday night , I imagine this would be much busier on a Friday. 
The breakfast buffet was fine but not exceptional.
The modern design was interesting to experience and finding our way around with limited signage, black corridors and lots of mirrors was genuinely  fun! The rooms were entirely black and white with plenty of gadgetry , this is not my personal taste but was luxurious, had a great bathroom and was very comfortable nevertheless.

",4,2017,08,23
148,Enjoyable extravagance,"From the moment the concierge took our bag, to when he arranged our taxi on departure, every member of staff was extremely polite, friendly, professional and extremely helpful. Room Service was efficient and very prompt. The ME is our number one London hotel. ",5,2017,08,22
148,Lunch ,"We booked an outside table at radio rooftop bar for three at 2pm and got a lovely table .
We ordered the ME Fuzz cocktail which came with a small stick of candy floss - very nice .
We had main course ,dessert and coffee ¬£129 including service charge .
Food was good and presented well .
Staff very friendly and service just right .
The views are good and we will be back - I would book ,as we were leaving after 4 pm it started to fill up .
A great spot as near  trains,theatres ,Covent garden .",4,2017,08,21
148,Modern well positioned Hotel,I stayed Saturday night with my wife and daughter and took two rooms as we were going to see the Lion King. I called in advance to check where I parked to be told just call when you are a few minutes away and the concierge will greet you as there is no room to park. I did this and they did as they said greeted us took our luggage and took the car. We checked in all good. We had the hotel layout explained which was a good job really as it was a modern design and quite dark. went to our rooms again all good very clean and well presented. We then went for a walk around convent garden 5 minutes away and had some dinner before going to see the Lion King. We came back after the show had a drink in the roof top bar. Had breakfast in the room on Sunday. One of the best breakfast's I have had especially room service all the food was piping hot even my coffee and the pastries. Went out for a walk for a couple of hours on Sunday came back my car was brought round to me with 10 minutes and my luggage followed shortly after. Great experience I would recommend the hotel.,5,2017,08,21
148,More Style than Substance,"My wife and I stayed here on Saturday. On entering the hotel the first thing you notice is the black shiney cladding on every surface and also the lack of any signage so we had to ask where the reception was as it was nowhere to be seen. Reception is in a pyramid shaped room that reaches up to the 9th floor with jellyfish projected on the walls, very bizarre. Nice to be offered prosecco while we waited for the room (at these prices champagne would have been received better). The room was very good with everything you could need for a short stay, I had paid considerable more for a balcony with a view but it was a disappointment, the walls where in plain concrete and were about 4'6"" high which meant when you sat down you felt you were in a concrete coffin, and as the buildings opposite were at the same height the view was not ""stunning"".
Do not be tempted to have the ¬£30 breakfast it is standard help yourself fare but was tepid and if you got the chef to cook you some eggs then you had a further 10 minute wait whilst your food gets colder, had better breakfasts at Premier Inns.
I don't believe it was the money certainly not the extra for the balcony.",3,2017,08,21
148,Management Meeting,"Our first management meeting and it was amazing. Having the best views over London from the top of this Hotel was the perfect venue. The staff have been trained to a high degree and nothing was too much for them. Each service was presented with a smile and the conceiage was excellent. All staff watched and helped you wherever you were and I wouldn't hesitate ever to return to this classic, stylish hotel again.. perfect ..!",5,2017,08,21
148,Top-notch 5-star hotel ,"The ME London bills itself as an avant garde hotel and, at first, the soft lighting and angular architecture do seem a bit odd. But after you've stayed there a couple of days, you realize that what the ME is really selling is SERVICE! The staff are fantastic and will do virtually anything you ask. The rooms are spacious and ultra modern. And the location is fabulous--walk to theater, restaurants and more. Definitely would stay there again. ",5,2017,08,20
148,Amazing service,"Wow! From the greeting at the main entrance to every personnel, great service. Couldn't ask for a better location! Slept like a baby in the bed! Staff were so helpful. I complained about something but they immediately took care of it. ",5,2017,08,19
148,Excellent Service,"We had a wonderful experience from the moment we arrrived. They escorted us to reception and took care of our bags. Reception was fast, friendly and we were offered champagne.  The concierge helped with theater tickets, directions, restaurants and pubs to check out.  This hotel is in the perfect location for shoppI got and theater.  It's across from a great coffee shop too.  We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. We also walked to The Eye. It was very pretty.",5,2017,08,19
148,Loved this stay!,"I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in London. I loved the fact we have a balcony on the 8th floor in London - not many places offer this. Our view was beautiful of the bustling streets by Novello Theatre. The room was spacious and the whole hotel was trendy and modern. We had a beautiful welcome with a bottle of champagne, cake and personalised hand written card for my boyfriends birthday celebrations. Top class service. 
We also visited Radio Rooftop bar and STK all of which were classy, modern and staff were so attentive. Definitely recommend. We loved it :-) ",5,2017,08,19
148,Amazing hotel,We had a wonderful stay in this hotel! The hotel is located in Strand/Covent Garden which is a very central location in London. The rooms were very beautiful and clean. The hotel staff gave us an extra service with sending back a forgotten item from my luggage. It arrived within a couple of days on my doorstep in the Netherlands. I can highly recommend this hotel to everybody!,5,2017,08,19
148,Amazing birthday celebration,"My Daughter booked us into the ME hotel to celebrate my birthday. She had informed the hotel of this and on arrival we were given a glass of bubbly and complimentary champagne in the room. The rooms are very big for London, a seating area, mood lighting and a huge bed. It's a brilliant location near most of the theatres and Covent Garden just a five minute walk. Although our room faced on The Strand it was extremely sound proofed, the best night's sleep I've had in London. I would definitely recommend the roof bar. Again, my Daughter had pre-booked via their website and a glass of complimentary champagne was provided on arrival. The views are amazing. Thank you to all the staff at ME hotel, they excel at their jobs and their customer service is exemplary. The hotel just added to the lovely memories of a wonderful celebration.",5,2017,08,18
148,wonderfl hotel,"we upgraded our room on arrival - it was well worth the extra money
the room was huge,beautiful bathroom,good bed & pillows

the roof top bar was brilliant in the day - the staff very attentive but not at night if you like a peaceful drink - very lively with load music - ",5,2017,08,18
148,Fantastic hotel,"Only stayed for one night as a birthday surprise for my partner.  Excellent check in with a glass of sparkling was a nice touch.  The room was contemporary and had a great little balcony.  Would stay again, as in a great location.",5,2017,08,18
148,Wow,Absolutely fantastic  modern  friendly hotel in a great location with great staff who made our stay a wonderful experience. The customer service of the aura team is second to none will definitely return,5,2017,08,17
148,Amazing experience,"My fianc√© and I were very impressed with the quality of service and the room was spacious, modern and clean with a huge choice from the mini bar. They made our engagement even more special with the added romantic touches in our room. We loved our stay and wished we could have stayed longer. Thank you ME team!",5,2017,08,17
148,Wonderful stay in London,This Hotel is beautiful.  We were treated to a glass of Champagne at our arrival.  We waited only a few minutes for our gorgeous room.  The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming.  We were constantly asked if we needed anything or wanted dinner reservations or advice.  The advice and direction given was perfect and we could not have been happier!,5,2017,08,16
148,Perfect luxurious stay ,"I stayed overnight at ME with my mum in August. Totally fell in love with this hotel. It's beautiful! We were awestruck from the moment we arrived. We were offered prosecco at check in and we're then escorted to our room. It was huge! We drank our welcome drink looking out of the floor to ceiling window. The location was fab, just over the road from the Novello Theatre. Very useful! We spent a very sunny afternoon in the roof top bar drinking cocktails. The staff are really professional and friendly. The food was delicious also! Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. We have to give a special mention to Ray Garcia. This is an employee who goes the extra mile. A lovely man. Hope to be back soon... I'm bringing my husband next time xxx ",5,2017,08,16
148,Luxury  and style,"A fantastic welcome by very friendly well briefed staff. Reception has wow factor including d√©cor and staff and welcome drink. Rooms stylish, smart and well appointed. Only one thing missing...a kettle despite coffee machine giving excellent coffee. We like a cup of tea first thing !! Everything else was fab ! incl good size quality TV. Balcony was nice despite limited use due to showers. 
The staff were the most friendly we have ever experienced bar Fiji !! The Radio bar on the roof was stunning during a sunny Saturday afternoon...great cocktails.... as good as the American bar in the Savoy! Steaks in the STK restaurant were a bit pricey! Overal a fantastic stay for 3 nights and extra room for daughters on the Saturday. Stunning! and v close to both Covent Garden and River Thames.",5,2017,08,16
148,Stylish affair ,"I had heard so much about this place, so I was keen to go. 
When we arrived we got treated well by the staff, which we were pleased with, as we weren't planning to go so there was no booking. 
We only popped in drinks at the roof bar and was pleasantly surprised by lovely ambience. 
I also love the fact that from the cocktail menu you could also buy sunglasses and cigars. 
I would recommend this place to anyone who would love like to have drinks with a touch of class. üòä",5,2017,08,16
148,"Stylish, comfortable, fascinating architecture","ME has the modern vibe you look for in a luxury hotel nowadays. The moody Foster and Partners construction is the perfect host to a hotel providing every amenity one could want. Facilities include the ground-level bar, as well as a rooftop pool, a spa and a steak restaurant, which even provides some mouth-watering vegetarian options.",5,2017,08,15
148,"Great hotel & resturant near covent garden, no tables in radio bar, which was very disappointing","We have stayed at this hotel a number of times, as always been pleased with it, restaurant and especially looked forward to drink in the radio bar. However, this time, there were no tables at either night, one due to party, next due to very busy, which before, if a resident, they used to reserve a set number of tables, so we never had this issue. I mentioned on check out, which they apologise and said if I booked table next time, but that is difficult, as we often are not sure what time we would want a drink or if dinner took longer than expected, you would then be rushing to make sure table did not go. So if you enjoy a modern, clean, high customer service hotel, with a great (STK) restaurant, would def recommend. If you want to experience the radio bar, book a table. G",4,2017,08,15
148,Excellence assistance,"ME London went out of their way to accommodate our 16 year old son, who was undertaking work experience very close to the hotel. They made him extremely welcome during his stay, and kept an eye on him during his time in London. This sets them aside from other hotels. Thank you",5,2017,08,14
148,Very swish hotel with an amazing roof bar overlooking London,"I've used the ME London for business guests and events several times and apart from some inconsistent procedures for corporate bookings, it has been a good experience. The rooms are high quality and my guests have also been impressed at their stays. The real treat at the hotel is Radio, the roof bar. The Radio roof bar staff are polite but firm on the guest list for entry so if you want to invite (non hotel guest) friends to meet you at Radio bar then make sure you speak with hotel staff as soon as possible or face them being turned away. This can be an expensive hotel if you don't book early or have a corporate rate agreed but quality wise it does deliver. Locationally the hotel is good for the Theatre district, Opera House, Covent Garden and not too far from the City of London financial district. There are plenty of good restaurants and pubs nearby so eating out is convenient, but the hotel restaurants are in themselves places that well heeled business people dine at.",5,2017,08,13
148,Another Gem by Melia,"This is my second time at ME London. The first time made me always and whenever I go look for a Melia. The facility, the staff and everything are well maintained. They always treat us like royal family; very pampered. ",5,2017,08,13
148,One of the best in the world!,"Everything about the ME London is absolutely fabulous. I love this hotel so much and always really look forward to my visits whenever I get to come and stay here. Based centrally right on The Strand, it is a fantastic location for any London activities. The design, look and feel of this hotel might not be to everyone's taste, so make sure that you research into it before booking... I on the other hand, absolutely love it! It's quirky and stylish, bold and unique. 

The staff are consistently fantastic, from cleaning, door, reception and bar - they are all very professional, helpful and welcoming. We had a room with a balcony looking over Covent Garden direction which was lovely. The beds were comfortable, the room was extremely spacious and the bathroom with the double shower was phenomenal. 

Everything about the ME just screams class and style and it is such a unique place to stay. The Radio rooftop bar is trendy, always bustling and has a fantastic vibe with great views over to Canary Wharf, London Bridge, Central and beyond. 

The only slight issue we had was that we were awoken at 2:30am with some bassy music coming from somewhere, we couldn't work out where... When we flagged this with reception on checkout, it was handled exceptionally well by the staff member who cancelled our minibar charges as a means of apology, and promised to look into the issue, which was very well received. (The gentleman was tall with brown hair and stated he used to work as an evening manager, if that helps pin-point him, as I'd love to pass on my compliments.)

Many thanks for a fantastic stay and we cannot wait to come again!",5,2017,08,12
148,Anniversary ruined,"
Greetings from the other side of the pond. I would first off like to say I appreciate the efforts your team made once a very unfortunate series of events took place. However a bad first impression is hard to come back from regardless of efforts displayed. Especially when the efforts your team said they would provide after these instances don't hold true. I was told by Three separate members of your staff that I would be receiving a monetary compensation for a horrifying and traumatic ordeal. Vitor I think was the concierges name who was the first point of contact.  He told me that we would be moving into a suite on Saturday. That several suites would be available and the manager Pierre would be available to speak with me later. All this was stated in front of both me and fianc√©. My fianc√© touched a used condom in a 5 star hotel . She was hysterical and began screaming at me like it was mine. Then she calmed down and just started crying worried about the health aspect of it. Then we moved a second time hair in the room and dead flies on the bed and bugs flying around the room. This upset her even more. Long story short she couldn't mentally get over these events and left back home. She is one of the head writers for Trip advisor. She was mortified and our anniversary ruined. What good is an amazing suite on Sunday if I have to be there alone. Even though I was told we would get a suite the next day Pierre said there was none available. I had my assistant make a reservation for Saturday for a suite and double confirm there were suites available on Saturday: why would Marcos tell me there was non available. I had my assistant check 2 hrs after I spoke with him. Called him back and he said there were non available? On Sunday we planned a lovely meal at STK. our food took over an hour to get there. Our server informed the prepared our order wrong and it had to be redone. That proved to be the straw that broke the camels back. 
 
Vito,Pierre, Marcos, and Dimitri all apologized and said I would be receiving a partial refund for at least one of my days for this horrifying experience. 4 separate members of staff all echoing the same apologies and things they would do to compensate. For you to come back with this rebuttal and back peddling is shocking. Your establishment ruined my anniversary and I was forced to spend it alone. I booked your fine establishment because its reputation and attention detail and I got a mixed bag. ",1,2017,08,12

148,Exiting stylish hotel,"Modern youthful style interior with high standard. Great experience and a treat, fresh friendly and professional staff that are truly interested in assisting and to make your stay a memory.

148,The Hotel is 10/10 The Radio Bar Staff a let down,"I loved everything about the actual hotel! The image, photo opportunities, the smell! Outstanding! My boyfriend was extremely pleased with this surprise treat. Staff helped me to personalise the experience with a birthday message on the bathroom mirror and a beautiful card and bottle of champagne. Amazing!

The Radio Bar Staff (doorman, not all staff) were a rude let down. I have been to Radio Bar before and experienced the same thing. It's a shame that they are yet to be addressed as so many people make the same complaint - I've seen these online numerous times. 

Don't let that ruin the experience of the actual hotel. The staff there are lovely and the hotel is to die for! Just find another place to have drinks, maybe the bar inside the actual hotel x",4,2017,08,11
148,Like the property and good location,"Stayed for family vacation.  Staff was friendly, but we had to move rooms when they couldn't accommodate the reservations that we made over 3 months prior.  Had to call 3 times to get an iron delivered and was very rushed to make dinner reservations.",3,2017,08,11
148,First class hotel,"The only missing amenity was a cosmetic mirror and light. Found it difficult to see close up in the mirrors. Felt that the floors in the bathroom could have been cleaned a bit better for this quality of room.
On a positive note, was impressed that CNN was added to our TV for our viewing.",5,2017,08,11
148,No hotel quite like this one,"Everything about this hotel is so special, from reception to room with balcony to drinks on the roof top bar. Staff courteous and helpful. Location couldn't be better. It is the only hotel I would stay in when visiting London.",5,2017,08,09

148,Perfect weekend!,"From the minute you step into this hotel you feel special! From the scent, the lift to reception, a reception that has to be one of the quickest and most efficient I have ever experienced in London! Rooms were gorgeous although a little small, however this is London I guess! My only critisism is that the rooftop bar was such bad service and we had to wait ages to be served after completely being ignored by the waitress! This was a Sunday aswell so not exactly peak times. Would definately stay again though, perfect location for Covent Garden , loved it!",5,2017,08,08
148,Theatre and west end stay,"I recently stayed at this hotel to celebrate my partners birthday. The hotel is absolutely stunning and the staff are some of the best that I've come across in a hotel. The rooms are comfortable, spacious and a well stocked mini bar for those that want to use it. The only minor negative in the room was the water pressure of the shower, it wasn't what I would expect for a hotel of this class and price.

Didn't use any of the restaurants although I booked a table in the roooftop bar for a drink which was a good call as the views are unbelievable. 

Location is great, literally a 5 minute walk into Covent Garden. Would definitely stay there again. Well done ME London ",5,2017,08,07
148,A 50th celebration to remember!,"A wonderful experience at Me London from the moment we walked through the entrance! We were welcomed at the door and our cases swiftly taken off us for transfer their to our yet unknown room. We were pleasantly escorted to reception, where we were offered water or prosecco and an upgrade on our room being Melia Gold clients. We had a lovely surprise in the room with a bottle of champagne on ice.
We had cocktails at the Radio rooftop and a delicious meal at STK.
Thank you Melia",5,2017,08,07
148,Romantic getaway,"This is one of my favourote hotels to stay in, each and every time I'm there I'm gobsmacked by how beautiful it is.

148,Weekend for my wife's birthday,"Great reception in the hotel. I booked a room with balcony (not really a plus) but apparently only a room of that type adapted for disabled people was available. Because it wasn't quite the room we booked a complimentary upgrade was offered. A free bottle of champagne was offered for my wife's birthday (thank you Beatriz!).
Everyone of the staff super freidnly and helpful. Hotel is trendy, very nice and superbly located. We will certainly return!",5,2017,08,03
148,Great Service,"This hotel has very good service. We booked on hotwire of course they give us the worst room on the property. We inquired about a different room, but ultimately it was not worth it. If you stay at the hotel they treat you like royalty if you goto any of their bars or restaurants.",4,2017,08,03
148,Best hotel I stayed in London,"This is the best hotel out of the 5 five star hotels I stayed in London. Great location, biggest room, great service, and a really nice roof top bar. 

The only thing I didn't like were the amenities in the bathroom. On my first day, the dental kit and the cosmetic kit were already opened by the previous occupant - the previous occupant took the toothpaste from the dental kit and cotton sheets from the cosmetic kit. I wish housekeeping could have checked the kits before leaving them to me because it was really obvious as the plastic packaging for the toothbrush and paste was clearly opened. I was a bit disgusted since I didn't know if the previous occupant had used the tooth brush.",5,2017,08,03
148,Just perfect !,"Arrival at 10am, the room was already ready, the staff took our luggage and is very nice.

148,Great service and amazing to have a balcony with views in the middle of London,"Although the experience was positive, you get the idea that the noisy bars /nightclubs are their main business, from the bouncers on the door to the fact that one lift is permanently blocked for visitors to the rooftop bar. If you want to party in style, it's pretty good. Otherwise, you may want to stay where the hotel business is their main reason for being.",4,2017,08,01
148,"Great location, slighlty over priced but good never the less, would still stay again","Great location for theatres etc, slighlty over priced but good never the less, would still stay again. Beds weren't that comfortable for a hotel of this standard. Not much movie or TV choice either. 
Cold breakfast ",4,2017,07,31
148,Birthday Treat,Wow! What a fabulous hotel... I booked the hotel for my partners birthday treat on arrival we were greeted with a glass of prosecco and an upgrade to a suite! The suite was simply out of this world...more than we could have hoped for. Complementary champagne and a birthday cake for my partner and the ammenaties in the room were fantastic. The staff (sadly I can remember any names as I was so excited) were really helpful and went out of their way to ensure our stay was top class. An experience neither of us will forget. Thank you.,5,2017,07,31
148,Perfect Anniversary Trip,"My girlfriend and I stayed this weekend to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't have been happier with our room. We were made to feel welcome from the second we entered the hotel. We were given a glass of prosecco on arrival and in minutes were up in our room. We had been upgraded to a top floor room with views over the whole of London. It was an incredibly surprise and this was quickly followed up with a complimentary bottle of champagne which was delivered to the room minutes later. The shower was excellent, the toiletries were all of a good standard, and the bed and the linen was incredible quality. We visited the upstairs bar which was quite lively as it was Saturday night but definitely worth a visit. I would absolutely visit again - The location could not be more perfect",5,2017,07,30
148,Extraordinary,"Trendy hotel. If you don't like continuous background music and dim light trendy hotels, don't go.
Absolutely amazing reception lobby.
Very crowded and trendy rooftop with a nice crowd.
Room is spacious with an amazing glass ""bow window"" that makes you feel hovering over the street.
Staff and concierge were very helpful and kind, especially Joseph.
Definitely recommend it.",5,2017,07,30
148,Really disappointing experience in our favorite hotel,"Myself and my other half decided to celebrate our anniversary and repeat our first date which took place in the ME hotel. We have been coming here for years as it has sentimental value to us, and absolutely love it every time. 

However, for our anniversary last weekend, to our surprise, it was actually quite a disappointment. 
We arrived in to the lobby and were greeted with glasses of prosecco as always. 

We got to the room and it was like walking into a freezer, horribly uncomfortably cold. It also was half the size of the rooms we had on our previous visits, which was rather disappointing, but nonetheless the bed was as comfortable as I remembered! 
We tried putting the heat on full blast and still it was too cold to actually settle into the room. 

We tried getting the speakers to work for music but they weren't working. We were trying to link our phone to the tv with Bluetooth and this wouldn't work either. 
We asked the gentleman who took our luggage to send engineering to us and he said he'd do that right away. We waited around in the freezing cold room for somebody to come up and help us, but 25mins passed and we couldn't stay in the room any longer as it was still freezing.

We decided to head down to the bar for a while in hope that somebody would fix it by the time we got back. 
On our way out we let one of the staff know that we were waiting on engineering and to ensure that they came up to fix the speakers & the heating, she said she'd make sure that they come.

We spent a few hours at the bar downstairs and while we were sitting there an argument broke out between (who we presume was) one of the managers / supervisor & one of the cleaning staff. The manager was shouting at the other member of staff and speaking to her in a very aggressive way with very exaggerated hand gestures & really making it awfully awkward for us to sit there, trying to enjoy our cocktails. The dispute lasted a long 5 minutes or so which just seemed to go against everything that I previously had believed the ME to be. A professional, accommodating 5 star hotel- not a family run bread & breakfast with staff arguing in front of guests. 

After this we decided to head back upstairs, we arrived back to a sweltering hot room and no working speakers. We tried turning the heat down and just switched it off as it was a sauna in the room at this stage! 

We got ready to have dinner in stk, we had made a reservation and ended up having to stand at the bar for 30mins to wait for our table. We were starving by the time we sat down. We were informed that our usual favorite dish had been taken off the menu (lobster & steak combo) so this was also a disappointment, so we went for the steak and lobster mac & cheese instead. 

Dinner was okay, not as tasty as usual. The steaks were Luke warm and the lobster Mac and cheese barely had any lobster in it at all, a few strings of meat at very most. The magnum of LPR was the best part of the meal to be honest! 

We arranged for a table to be reserved for us after dinner up in the radio rooftop bar, but we were informed that it was fully booked and not possible to get a reservation which was also a disappointment to the evening.  

So we went back to our room a little earlier than planned, and the room was once again freezing cold! So we turned up the heat once again before going to sleep, of course to wake up an hour later sweltering once again. The most uncomfortable night's sleep I've had in a while - the room seemed to only go from one extreme temperature to the other! 

We woke up the next day tired, not as relaxed as we usually are leaving the ME & quite frustrated that our special anniversary trip wasn't what we had hoped it would be. 

It is such a pity, and I really hate to be writing this review as we normally have the greatest time & such a relaxed & wonderful stay in the ME. But for some reason this time it really didn't live up to our past experiences & was quite a let down for our special weekend. ",2,2017,07,26
148,The Hotel was much better when it first opened.,"Generally the hotel is very impressive in terms of the interior space and design, it is not you average hotel. However, things have deteriorated since we stayed there the first time when hotel just opened, about 3-4 years ago. The roof-top bar became too ""junky"", too many random drunk people, lots of smoke, etc. There people clearly were not staying in the hotel, just cam for the evening. It used to be very modern spacious place, now there are lots on oversize furniture, which make it look small and dark. The windows in the room were internally foggy, the seal must have broke, we could not see very well through them. The staff and services are still superb, but conditions have deteriorated. Still grate hotel overall.",3,2017,07,26
148,Midweek Birthday,"I've been to the ME London a few times before as treat from my parents, but decided to take my girlfriend for her 21st Birthday. On arrival we made our way up to reception and were given a glass of prosecco as we checked in, but were spoken to in a slightly patronising way throughout the process. Nonetheless, on this occasion we were given a generous room upgrade from an energy terrace room (8th floor) to a chic suite. However did not know this room was on the 2nd floor and was disappointed not to have a few and could hear the busy traffic outside the window at night, nevertheless the hotel did leave a bottle of champagne and a small cake which was nice. The room itself was spacious and beautiful, however was looking worn around the edges (only on wall panels). 
The staff outside Radio bar on the bottom floor were particularly rude actually, i believe that the guard didn't expect myself to be a guest due to my age and told me to go back outside to book a table and once I said I was a guest he just shrugged and nodded towards a hostess. However we did receive some absolutely perfect service from a gent called Alex whom was tending to the lobby bar in the evening. He was always very considerate to our needs and memorized our particular order from our first round to the last, he also was genuinely interested in our stay and if was able to do anything for ourselves. I would visit the Me again due to his kindness.",4,2017,07,24
148,Royal Treatment,"Royalty were leaving as we arrived but we were also treated like royalty. Everything about the hotel was superb - the staff outstanding, as was our room. We were located on the 9th floor with a balcony, of which we made good use. The only downside was the noise coming from the rooftop bar when we were trying to sleep. However, the purchase of earplugs solved this problem.",5,2017,07,20
148,Brilliant stay here on wife's birthday,"Prosecco on arrival, champagne in the room , nothing was too much trouble
The 9 th floor balcony room was stunning, the service outstanding, great roof top bar and lounge bar on ground floor. Best London hotel stay in years",5,2017,07,19
148,Magnificent Me London,"Our stay at this hotel went beyond my expectations. The physical plant was very appealing to one's eye as well as giving a feeling of warmth and welcome. The staff is 5 stars worthy. So helpful, pleasant always willing to make our stay as enjoyable as possible, all the time with a smile on their faces. I will be comparing future hotels to this wonderful experience. ",5,2017,07,14
148,Really good property and great base for London visits,"Outstanding design and the rooms are very well appointed as one would expect.

Restaurant and Bar excellent and in-house guests treated with the gravitas one would hope for but not always offered at other places.

Location really well suits me and very cose walk to the west end and theatres with all the bars and restaurants close by.

Staff are extremely well trained and give air of authority without snobbiness, truly top class.

The reception area and check in is incredible and sets the tone for the stay

The rooms are rather small it must be said and whilst well appointed, lack the WOW factor of the rest of the property , but this is a small gripe",4,2017,07,14
148,Very nice hotel with central location,"We enjoyed our stay at ME London Hotel very much, the staff was more than helpful, worked very efficiently and solved the issues, which came up in a quick and resourceful way.
The bar on the top floor was very windy, so we didn't spend much time there, but no doubt about the place having a quite spectacular view over London.",4,2017,07,14
148,Anniversary Weekend,"Beautiful 5 star hotel in the centre of London near to theatres and Covent garden couldn't ask for a better location. Rooms are modern  and luxurious as is the whole hotel and it smells amazing they must spend a fortune on air freshener üòÅ. Breakfast was good with plenty choice in the buffet and a few choices from the kitchen, I had the eggs Benedict which were delicious. Would def stay here again.",5,2017,07,13
148,A fantastic night in London,Great place to stay. Steff very friendly and informative and looked after us very well. The Radio bar is a great place to go and have done fun. The room was fantastic with great views and overall a great place to stay.,5,2017,07,13
148,"Cool, contemporary, quality ","Firstly The location of the Me London is great, a stones throw from Covent Garden near the river and Trafalgar Square with plenty of dining options near by. 

I'd seen some mixed reviews but decided to book the Me for 5 nights during a visit to London and I wasn't disappointed, I was greater by a glass of champagne which was lovely and the reception area is really something special and probably something you won't see anywhere else. 

I stayed in the passion suite which exceeded my expectations I was escorted to the suite by a member of the Aura team, the suite was large, clean and had one of the best mini bars I've come across. The rooms are high tech with touch control lighting and air con but I especially loved the Bluetooth surround sound as I was in the city for British summer time in Hyde park this really got me in the mood for the concerts. The suite had an Excellent rain fall shower and huge bath tub along with his and hers sinks. There was also a complimentary bottle of champagne in the room which was a lovely touch. 

All the staff at the hotel were lovely and couldn't do enough to help form the breakfast team to the ladies at the lift for the Radio bar who always made a point of speaking to guests and asked if I'd like to visit the bar for a drink. I'd like to especially mention the barman at the Marconi lounge who in my opinion went above and beyond to make sure I enjoyed the bar, he had some fantastic cocktail suggestions and was genuinely interested in my stay, After a while some friends joined me as it was one of their birthdays and the barman appeared with a little cake complete with a lit candle and sung happy birthday to her which was very much appreciated, I'm very sorry but I can't remember the guys name but if could thank him again from me, he was working the evening of Saturday the 8th July. 

The radio bar has some fantastic views of the city and is well worth a visit, it does get very busy so I'd recommend making a reservation first. 

There are one or two things I feel could be improved to make the hotel even better, one of which is the attention to detail from the housekeeping team as some items in the minibar wasn't replaced which is unusual from a hotel of this standard. Also the door men although friendly if spoken to could make more of an effort to great guests rather than stand silently by the door, small things which didn't detract from my stay but would if done would of
made the stay faultless. 

Overall my stay was fantastic and will be making the Me my London base from now on, I've been home a few days and cannot wait to return, in fact I wish I was there right now.

148,My FAVORITE HOTEL in London if you're looking for fun!,"Alright crew, if you know me, you know I like my W Hotels for the modern, lively, flashing lights, high-energy type of vibe. 

However, I will say, this is my FAVORITE hotel in London! Obviously you can't go wrong staying at the W Hotel, but the ME Hotel is seriously one of a kind and one up the W Hotel in London. I'll tell you why, but before that, I will say it is not for everyone! If you're looking for a quiet weekend or if you're hanging out with your grandparents, stay away!!!

Pros:
- The rooftop bar with the views. Period.
- Again, the rooftop bar alone makes this hotel worthwhile. People come from all over town to hang out there.
- Yes, the rooftop bar view ain't like NYC or Shanghai or LA or Vegas, but for London, it's great! 
- The energy is amazing.
- The place to see and be seen. Great for people watching. 
- Very central location to restaurant, markets, underground, and tourist sites.
- The check-in lobby is seriously one of a kind. You feel like you're in some kind of spaceship / pyramid. 
- The rooms are spacious and the waterfall shower is amazing! 
- ""Casual"" dress-up hip crowd but not too stuffy.
- Great customer service
- Good distance away from the super touristy Leicester Square, but close enough to walk there if you want. 
- W Hotel London is in the super touristy area, another reason why I went with ME. 

Con:
- Definitely not the cheapest hotel in town, but the place to be if you're looking to spurge.
- Don't go there if you're into quiet weekends!
- Wait, you mean there's not a rooftop pool next to the rooftop bar? lol jk...!",5,2017,07,13
148,Beautiful hotel,"Amazing hotel, lovely staff. Very conveniently situated in central London. We dined in STK restaurant below the hotel, and went on to the radio rooftop afterwards for a few drinks. Will be returning again very soon!",5,2017,07,12
148,Date night in London,"If you want a gorgeous, cool and contemporary hotel in the heart of Covent Garden, then the Me is for you. Service and staff exceptional. The Radio roof top bar has amazing views over London and they make a mean Virgin Mojito. STK restaurant, located in the lobby, has some of the best steaks we have ever eaten!
Plus you can walk to the theatres and restaurants, everything you need is on the doorstep.",5,2017,07,12
148,Quick visit ,"I always make sure I stay at The Me.  From the moment you arrive you feel very special. From the glass of champagne on arrival to the whole welcome is great. The rooms are very chic and it's a must to have a balcony view. 

I can't wait to visit again. Breakfast is wonderful and the radio bar is a great place for evening drinks. STX was a fab place to eat. 

Can't wait to visit next month. ",5,2017,07,11
148,Fabulous as always ,"Enjoyed our 3rd visit, obtained an upgrade to the fantastic chic suite, all staff were more than helpful can't praise them enough.

The Roof Bar was buzzy fun with amazing views . The concierge team were fantastic and arranged several things for us, they couldn't have been more helpful. The only downside was that some rooms were not ready on our arrival at 230pm  and we were kept waiting several hours before we were given a room key.",4,2017,07,11
148,something special,"Having had a great experience with the Melia brand in Majorca it made perfect sense to try their London experience which didn't disappoint.

The staff are all ultimate professionals and clearly passionate about the hotel ",5,2017,07,11
148,Good hotel,"This is my second stay at this hotel... the first time myself and my husband stayed and it was so good I booked again for a weekend with my daughter, unfortunately I had a few disappointments this time around, the first issue was that we were on the 9th floor and our room was directly under the rooftop bar and it was incredibly noisy, we had a very tiring day shopping with a lot of walking and all we wanted to do was go to sleep, there was no chance of that it was like sleeping in the middle of a nightclub, the next evening me and my daughter were in the lobby enjoying some cocktails in the lobby bar, the bar men were excellent and the cocktails were amazing but unfortunately this was soon spoilt, when you are staying at the hotel you have priority to the roof top bar which is great... people who are not staying at the hotel have to queue outside and as the bar is very popular the queue gets rather long, two men and a women came into the lobby bar realised we were guests at the hotel asked my daughter if she would get them in the rooftop bar, she politely said no sorry now that should have been the end of it, well these two men would not leave me and my daughter alone asking to borrow our room key and it got to the point where we had to go outside the front of the hotel for a bit just to get away from them, they were so persistent even the bar man could see it was making us feel uncomfortable and asked us if we were ok... now I'm in London with my daughter staying in a good hotel which I don't expect to be made to feel uncomfortable in the lobby bar these men should have been removed, however I don't want this incident to put me off the ME hotel as it is a lovely hotel in a great location and I will return, I just feel that if anyone can come into the lobby bar then maybe they should have security there to prevent hotel guests getting badgered by people desperate to get into the rooftop bar, if that happens again I would have to go elsewhere which would be a real shame ",4,2017,07,11
148,Amazingly cool lobby and spacious clean line rooms!,"Great location...right on the strand and walking distance to Trafalgar Square and other landmarks like London Eye and Parliament. Loved the champagne at check in along with amazing light show right in the pyramid shaped reception area.  Beatriz our  receptionist was so kind, sweet, professional and so accommodating...went out of her way to make us feel comfortable right away upon checking in. We had to change room our last night there and got upgraded to a larger room.  Comparing the rooms, we actually liked the Standard room more as there were two sinks in bathroom and more open. The larger room has one sink and a large tub so if you travel in pair and not into bathing, it's a little tight and inconvenient if both people want to get ready at the same time. The bedroom areas were approximately the same so you'd save money going Standard.
This hotel also got a pretty posh rooftop bar ""Radio"" with great view of the city. Hotel guests can come up anytime by showing room keys. On weekends, there's a line outside the door (separate entrance) and the well dressed crowd could be a little pretentious.  Nevertheless, guests should definitely check it out preferably before the evening crowds.",5,2017,07,11
148,Feels like a nightclub,"I was on the 4th floor with a room overlooking Aldwych.  The room was quiet, although the room doors are heavy and when next door came in or out it was quite loud.

The hotel itself is modern which is fine if you like that.  The downstairs has a nice looking bar.  Strangely, reception is on the 4th floor.  That again is an intriguing room with a very high up window in the roof.  But it was a pain to have to go up in the lift to then check in.  On the fourth floor the main corridors were dark and anyone with eye problems would probably end up walking into something.  I didn't like it personally but some might.  

The shower was good - warm and powerful.  But as a woman it was annoying to have to stand with my head back if I didn't want to wash my hair because the 2 options were the shower head on the ceiling pointing down or the hand held shower attachment.  It was also impossible to shave my legs without sitting on the floor of the shower - nice.  And why were there no rooms with a bath?  I hate not having a bath.  And the hooks for the towels were inside the shower - why?

My last negative was the extensive minibar which is on display on shelves opposite the bed - why do I want to see that all the time?

On the positive side, the window covers made the room nice and dark, the bed was comfortable and very big.  They did not stint on showers and the room had slippers, a bathrobe and a chocolate on the bed every night.  There was a nice area to blow dry your hair - with a seat, a mirror and lots of plugs nearby.  And the hairdryer was excellent.  The room was also spacious and very handy for visitors to London.

My overall thought on the hotel is that it could easily get a 5 out of 5 if it lightened the corridors, had reception on the ground floor (why not turn the 1st floor into a funky bar?) and had some rooms with baths.",4,2017,07,10
148,Quick Stay,The Me is one of the premier hotels in London. I have stayed here at least 5 times this year and always find it a pleasure. The staff are incredible and the facilities are second to none. The Radio bar is a greta place fir lunch or evening drinks,5,2017,07,08
148,Almost perfect!!,"The Me London hotel is the perfect place to your stay in London City. Everyone and everything is simply the best starting from the consierge people to the housekeeping woman. Great the reception and the breakfast service. Design room very technological! Some small details to be improved there to be simply perfect!
Price adeguated to the hotel standard.
Roof top not easy to reach for hotel guests!",5,2017,07,06
148,Cool hotel,"We've had a few visits to the Radio Bar, but this was the first time staying at ME hotel. Both my wife and I were very impressed with the architecture, the mood and feel of the hotel. We will definitely be back !",5,2017,07,05
148,Modern viby beautiful but noisy hotel.,"Be very careful of staying on the 9th floor. These rooms have balconies (which are tiny). The Radio Rooftop bar is right above these rooms and the noise factor is huge!
You can hear high heel shoes walking up and down, music thumping until 2am and then the moving of furniture until 3:10am as they were cleaning up. ",3,2017,07,05
148,My London Vacation,"So my friend and I stayed at the Me LONDON from June 24th through July 3rd.. I've seen mixed reviews on here but let me tell you this hotel has the wow factor that I anticipated.. The hotel is exceptional in every way from the the minute you step into the lobby you feel like your in a totally different world.. The decor, the lighting the ambiance are all part of what made this vacation so great. We stayed on the 5th floor room 517 and though we didn't some scenic view from the room the room itself was quite impeccable . The ambient mood lighting was somewhat surreal.  The rain shower bathroom was also one of my faves.. the radio bar was upstairs was the best ever .. it was like having a club at the rooftop of your hotel and to tell you how popular this spot was. Everyone travels from all over london to get into this bar, guest have free access and never have to wait in queue to get up to the bar but others do.. China the restaurant we had breakfast at daily was quite to my delight. The staff was attentive the food delicious.. I have been on several vacations and have never taken time to write a review but I had to this time  around just based on my experience and how much fun I had.. the hotel itself is located in the theatre district with playhouses all around it . Now the staff.. Sebastien was one of the first people we interacted with when we arrived He greeted us and took us up to reception where we checked in with Laura and Pierre  who did everything to accommodate us having arrived a few hours early. They got a room ready as soon as they could and we were able to check in early and always greeted us with a smile they are totally amazing. Karen at Cucina was also one of our faves she took our breakfast order during most of our stay and was so pleasant friendly and attentive we loved her and our interactions with her.. Then we met Martina at Radio Bar and just when we thought it couldn't get any better it did.. when you go to the bar please have her make your drinks .. Martina is friendly  inviting and charismatic and she had a way with those drinks.. she makes the best Pornstar Martini which yes is a drink there thats so tasty and delicious.. she also made this drink that my friend Janice loved.. I couldn't tell you the name of it but she had it everynight..  we also me Helena and Iulien. Helena is so sweet, it was great getting to know her , she also was welcoming and just all around made our night on our last night there.. Iulien was hysterical he serves you up your drinks with a flare that was so spirited that he left you in awe of his awesomeness.. I want to send a special thank you to Blake the Hotel Manager and Lajos the Bar Manager  who made our final night so  spectacular . Thanks for your response and the attentiveness you provided.. This is the real deal if your staying in London in central London you need to stay at the Me LONDON. It's by far the best hotel I've had the pleasure of staying at. I have up loaded a few pics..",5,2017,07,04
148,Fabulous anniversary stay,"Can't say enough to praise this wonderful hotel- fabulous in every way- all  the staff, huge rooms,SK restaurant  and of course the funky rooftop bar!!! Location is just perfect.2 little niggles however- ordered a Martin Millars gin( don't often see this) at ¬£15 I would've thought it would've been served with strawberries and pink peppercorns like it should and not a slice of  lime; and the other was the breakfast was not the best- good quality but not a great selection compared with similar 5* hotels  and the coffee was always cool- would be best to make a fresh pot for each table. We will definitely return but think we would do room only - go out for breakfast but definitely use STK and rooftops for tapas.",5,2017,07,03
148,Great location and design,"Perfect location for theatre lovers!  We booked last minute and didn't quite know what to expect, and were not disappointed.  Staff was very friendly and helpful, rooms were very clean and quiet.  Service and food at lobby bar and STJ were great too.  The rooftop bar is a popular destination for non guests. ",5,2017,07,02
148,Fantastic Hotel,"Wow what a fantastic Hotel to stay in, everything was just perfect.  The Hotel was spotlessly clean, the staff were super efficient , cheery, friendly and very helpful.  The rooms were spacious, lovely shower, lots of amenities and a huge, comfy bed.  Although the Hotel is on the Strand there is no street noise at night as the rooms are so well soundproofed, we had an excellent nights sleep.  There is an fabulous rooftop bar with excellent views of the city. We had breakfast included in our room price which was buffet style with good choices and was hot.  Great location, close to Covent Garden and many theatres and the London Eye.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,06,30
148,The Me London,"Excellent experience all round, from the moment we arrived, during our stay to the moment we checked out. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Couldn't fault the service throughout our stay.",5,2017,06,30

148,Highly recommended ,Not only is this hotel √ºbercool but the staff is very friendly with personalized attention paid to individual needs. The interior design and architecture by Foster and Partners makes the hotel a pleasant experience and pleasing to all senses. The mood lighting in rooms and soothing music makes winding down at night easy! Highly recommended for business or leisure! ,5,2017,06,29
148,ME hotel,"Had an excellent stay, my boyfriend and I got a terrace room to celebrate our anniversary and it was great, I got no complain over the hotel mood and space. I would like if they had more vegan options available but apart from it the whole staff was very carrying and helpful I would be back soon for sure.",5,2017,06,29
148,London Break,"I would recommend this Hotel to everyone. Friendly staff, great rooms, stylish hotel, rooftop bar was amazing too...staff had left a cake and champagne in our room upon arrival as it was my wife's birthday. ",5,2017,06,28
148,2nd Visit,"We made a return after our visit last summer and I have to say it didn't disappoint, the staff are very obliging and super efficient. Chilled sparkling wine on arrival and a very tranquil atmosphere soon smoothed away the City traffic and eased us into our stay.

Before our visit I made a reservation for a chauffeured car. The beautiful new, black, long wheelbase Jaguar arrived bang on time for our trip to Ascot and similarly for our return to the hotel afterwards. Thanks again to the concierge desk, particularly Arman.

Unlike our last visit we actually ate in the STK restaurant for a couple of evenings and  we found the waiters charming and helpful. We enjoyed possibly the best tender and tasty steaks we've ever eaten and we've had quite a few over the years.

Full marks!",5,2017,06,28
148,"Dog Friendly ME London, Bow Wows Gru the Frenchie","Have Stayed at ME London on numerous occasions, mid-week and Fridays & Saturdays and recently had the opportunity to stay on a Sunday the only problem was the four legged companion who was slightly overweight and did not  comply with the size and weight policy. I was contacted by the booking team who said they would be delighted to welcome the slightly overweight French Bulldog. They  carried out the booking on my behalf and arranged a reserved table in the rooftop Radio Bar for  the afternoon, the  Hotel team did not disappoint, I was provided with a room with a larger terrace and the staff made such a fuss of the four leggged monster he didn't  want to leave. A bed was provided and dog shampoo. The staff in the Radio were as efficient as ever and handle busy times with a smile, they ensured his  dog water bowl was topped up. Sunday afternoon in the Radio is a lot more relaxed then the Friday or Saturday night crowd. Staff excellent and this is why  I rate this Hotel as One of the Best In The World.",5,2017,06,27
148,Beautiful design & function!,"striking design throughout with matched attention to functionality, service, and accommodation esp exceptions. well-appointed rooms w things that work as expected & customizable, including wifi. good location for walking and/or transit. rooftop is fab although a bit pricey & limited menu choices. best room features: terrace, views, variety of charger outlets for all devices, bath area. loved the inroom dining menu for pets :-) ",5,2017,06,26

148,The best hotel in Covent Garden,"It was my seventh  stay in ME London. As usual I am very satisfied  - clean, top location, excellent staff, personality. 
They up-grated me as usual for a very cozy apartment. I just wandered that this hotel is so Kids friendly. 
Huge space - Spanish standards, fantastic breakfast .  ",5,2017,06,26
148,Fantastic ,"Stayed here for sat evening for 50th birthday while going to see ELO at Wembley, this hotel is fantastic, the staff are very friendly and helpful, we had a room on the 5th floor which was superb, mood lighting and remote controlled everything, could not hear a sound from anything outside the room as other reviews have said although this was not the badic room.
Came back from Wembley and decided to try the radio bar, had read other reviews saying not been let in etc so was a bit sceptical, had no problem getting in even though was wearing jeans and flip flops, must admit it was very 'Joey Essex' plenty of self important flash the cash they don't really have types being complete idiots, only stayed for about 10 mins as that was enough in short hotel is super great radio bar is not!",5,2017,06,25
148,Amazing Stay,"Stayed on Monday 19th, just as a date night in the city with my girlfriend. We had the most amazing time, the hotel for starts is gorgeous... you literally cannot fault it at all. The staff are really friendly, polite and cannot do enough for you! We went to the Radio Rooftop bar for drinks, which again is just stunning. If you are going on the sunnier days I would arrange a table, you can always stand at the bar, but the table views outside are beautiful. We went for dinner at STK and it was the best meal we had ever had. The rooms are also just as good, well equipped everything you need, and if it didn't then that was only a phone call away. We upgraded to a balcony room, which was nice to sit outside. Would definitely recommend this hotel, great location in central London, short walk from Covent Garden and all the west end shows. ",5,2017,06,24
148,Good location -  its all in the detail though,"Nice trendy bars if not too trendy rooftop bar. Good business meeting service. Rooms  are fresh and airey  but on close inspection this is a cheap refit - old plugs, tape on the ceiling etc. Took 10 mins to retrieve my bag from the concierge. False alarm fire drill - bad communication. I expect decor to be top quality at top quality prices. Great location.",3,2017,06,22
148,Fantastic stay!,"We celebrated our wedding aniversary here for a long weekend from Friday to Monday. Everything was just superb, from Prosecco in the reception upon our arrival and throughout our whole stay. And the extra surprise treatment we received from Maria in the Aura team on the night of our anniversary was amazing and totally exceeded our  expectations!",5,2017,06,22
148,Outstanding and beautiful hotel ,"Gorgeous views if the London Eye and impeccable service. Can be a bit noisy from the rooftop bar, but didn't bother me. Very central location to attractions, tube libe and bus stop. Great place to stay if you want to go to a show.",5,2017,06,22
148,Great hotel,"Fabulous, chic hotel. Well appointed, modern rooms that are exceptionally clean. Great service all across the board. Radio rooftop bar is a must visit, especially when the weather is nice. Will definitely be back.",5,2017,06,22

148,Mid week break,"This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel so obviously I love it. The location is perfect the hotel, staff & rooms are fantastic. I am only being picky now & it may be my lack of technology skills but couldn't get my music to work in every room of the suite. ",4,2017,06,20
148,ME is 4 me!,Overall the stay at the ME Hotel was outstanding. The hotel staff are simply perfect and the rooms and atmosphere is rather enjoyable. If all the ME Hotels are this well run and comfortable...book me everywhere! Thanks ME! ,5,2017,06,20
148,June 2017 Vacation,"Hotel, staff and location were great.  From the moment our car arrived the service was excellent. After checking in were were walked to our room and shown all the different features of the room. The room was very nice, clean and exceeded our expectations. I would definitely stay here again and will be recommending it to anyone visiting London.",5,2017,06,19
148,Outstanding Experience,"We (3 Gentleman) had a wonderful experiences for 5 Days in the ME London. Always a highlight is the Radio RooftopBar with is good Cocktails and perfect guests. The whole Atmosphere in the Hotel is stunning, but you already see some aging here and there.",5,2017,06,19
148,If You want the Wow factor in London then look no further !!,"The Entrance in to this location in Central London is Grand, Hospitality is second to none and the Decor just has to be admired for the sheer scale of excellence in design.

Entree the large lobby area to be greeted by the team and be escorted to the 1st Floor reception, Now take a look at this magnificent area, enjoy a nice glass of bubbly or cool water if you have had a hard day or long journey and look in Awe of the magnitude of the Indoor Pyramid that bestows you eyes. 

The calming yet inspiring music gives you a feel of grandeur and opulence you desire when staying at such a prestigious venue.

The hall way to your room is dark but very classy, the room bears a resemblance to modern day art including all the Mod Cons you desire at your finger tips using the ipad style remote control to work the lights and air conditioning.

Although I did not dine at this location the menu certainly was mouth watering and when I visit again I will tempt to utilise to full effect.

We dined out elsewhere but after either a nice meal or a trip to one of the local theatres in the local vicinity and a couple of nice drinks you need to come back to this facility to experience the Hotel Roof Bar.

The atmosphere was great and the clientele very exquisite for a very special night or one of  Wowing your clients, Staff or that special person in your life.

This again was very inspiring and another feather in the CAP for the tremendous location. 

I was attending with the company I have represented for 26 years now and the conference and boardroom facilities are second to none also, If you are looking to hold any Business ventures or meetings in this facility then again this is the place to be.

I booked room service for breakfast and unfortunately this was the only thing that let the whole thing down in my eyes, the Full English breakfast I endured had obviously been on the hotplate way too long and if I can explain further, the Bacon was overdone, the Black pudding was like attempting to eat like crisps and was very well overdone the Coffee was cold and the Sausage seemed under cooked. 

Such a blooming shame when all had been not just great but Absolutely fantastic, my question to ME by Melia is to possible try not to pre make so much and deliver overcooked as we all know Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and mine set me in the wrong mood due to maybe my timing being the same as everyone else but I presume more to do with either the journey fro the Kitchen to my Bedroom being too expansive or trying to deliver too much at the same time.
Damn I'm so dissapointed to have to write this but as per all my reviews I am honest and would do no more than be in this manner when referring this to so many.

The ME by Melia in The Strand London is the Place to Be for all travellers either private, exclusive or business and hopefully by way of reading this review they will enhance their package for customers seeking room service for the Breakfast and will change the way this happens so not all will encounter this, I spoke to one of my colleagues who also ordered the Breakfast to his room and he exaggerated the same concern hence me making such a trivial issue slightly dampen my Fantastic Review.

I am back in London on for my partners Birthday in July budget permitting and will definitely be contemplating staying here again. 

Great Building, Definitely the WOW factor, The main place to be for Opulence and with a bit of change of direction with Breakfast will be in my eyes No1 for London. 

ME by Melia in The Strand You are the best around, just a couple of tweaks and you will become",5,2017,06,18
148,Worst hotel I have ever stayed in,"This hotel fails at customer service plain and simple.  Backstory is this, we unintentionally wound up stuck in London(there was a British airways IT issues that grounded all flights, and we picked this hotel last minute based on good reviews and availability.  The hotel itself is very sleek and modern, and our room was nice, but then again we paid $700.

With that said there were a couple issues with the room (the TV just started blaring noise in the middle of the night, and the fire alarm went off every time we showered), not too big of a deal in and of itself I know these things can happen. The problem actually occurred when we actually tried to bring these issues to the staff. In particular, the manager, Dimitri Ciglio, was the most unprofessional human I have ever interacted with at a hotel. Here are the details:
1. He asked to come search our room after we complained.  The only time this has ever happened is when we were in Vegas. I get that there are probably a lot of young brats that frequent this hotel(since people with actual standards would probably stay away) but we are not those people.
2. Rather than acknowledging that there may have been some issues he said he need to ""review the videotapes."" Could he have at least stated  that something may have happened? Guess not.
3. Later on that day he called me and told me that there were ""inconsistencies in our stories"" and he recommended that we leave and the hotel would not charge us. Wow nice, did I mention that we were stuck in London? 

Not once did this manager acknowledge the situation, rather his only goal seemed to be to let us know how wrong and stupid we were. He actually told me the issue was that I did not know how to press the red power button on the TV remote.  Meanwhile I am a damn physician pretty sure I know how to use a TV remote.

Bottom line is that this hotel fails at the primary goal of any high class hotel, which is providing great customer care and a pleasant experience.  I'm not really one to complain about hotels but this was actually the worst hotel we have ever stayed in.  We stayed at 3 other hotels during our trip to Europe(La Bastide de Gordes, Chateau de Chevre' d'Or, and Hotel the Serras) and all those places are real luxury places that know how to treat their customers. 

I think if you're a 20 something party animal that needs a nice room to snort a bunch of blow in and have sex with prostitutes this place fits the bill. But if you're looking for genuine luxury I would avoid this place at all costs.",1,2017,06,18
148,Muy bueno,The hotel is of high standards and good quality for the price. The staff keep the customer first and very professional. I would satay at this hotel again on mu next trip to London. Did not try the restaurant but will next time,5,2017,06,18
148,Great hotel,"Was very pleased with hotel was a surprise for my partners birthday we both loved it will defo be returning for another stay, the view from the radio roof top bar was amazing and stk was a really good place to eat ",4,2017,06,17
148,Another fantastic stay,"I stayed in this hotel for one night in June and just as before I wasn't disappointed. The large room was very comfortable and spotless with every facility/service you would hope to need. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and the superior linen including the towels are noticeable. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful throughout my stay and were always on hand to answer any queries. The buffet breakfast had a large selection of hot and cold food, however It was still possible to order some items off the menu. I ordered the pancakes and they were delicious. I would always consider this hotel first when planning a visit to London.
",5,2017,06,17
148,Just a wonderful hotel,"Wife and I stayed for our Anniversary and what a wonderful hotel it is.  There is a strong emphasis on  keeping a relaxed atmosphere.  What makes the hotel so nice is the people that work there, just walking past someone you are greeted with a warm smile and a hello.  Nothing seems to be too much trouble, even we got lost looking for the breakfast room and the barman walked us the majority of the way.  We also got one if the best night sleeps in any hotel we've stayed at, with the bed having just the right support and rooms are lovely and cool even without the air con on. Just a word of warning, we were offered a room on the 9th floor but warned that we may hear the music from the Radio Bar, but whilst we opted for the 8th floor the music could be faintly heard, so would imagine it being quite noticeable on the 9th, it's on till 2am so if your out till then it won't be a problem. All in all though the chill out vibe, comfy bed and amazing staff, I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. ",5,2017,06,16
148,Great location and service but....,"Terrific location and the service was outstanding but I felt uncomfortable because the hotel is ultra trendy. The hallways had black marble walls and black carpet. Luckily the rooms were bright and airie. The piped in music was repetitive techno...not my thing. Very very good service, especially at breakfast. The concierge service was also very good.",3,2017,06,15
148,Kath and Danny,"All of the staff made ourselves so welcome and as it was our special anniversary they through in quite a few surprises and treats , a special thank you to Maria for organising everything. The Hotel is excellent and the rooftop Bar is fantastic experience ",5,2017,06,14

148,Best hotel in London,"Stayed at this hotel with my mom for 4 nights. When we arrived we were told that we were given a free upgrade to a larger room with a bathtub (which we had requested by e-mail), including in-room breakfast every day. They were also aware via my mom that it was my birthday during our stay and gave me chocolate cake and sparkling wine as a surprise in the afternoon. 
The staff is the most friendly and service minded people I have ever met. We felt always seen and noticed and frequently asked by the staff what they could do for us. It was as clean as can be, including both cleaning in the morning and a night check every evening. Great atmosphere at the hotel with a super cool rooftop bar and a restaurant with amazing food. Hallways are dark and cosy, lots of candles everywhere. We didn't once hear other guests or other sounds in our room, it was very quiet. The location is perfect. 
A sincere and big thank you to the staff at ME hotel for being part in making this birthday and trip to London the best I've had so far. Can't imagine staying anywhere else in London from now on.",5,2017,06,09
148,"Excellent service, delivered on value for money","Stayed here in May for a week.  Luxury property with service to match.  Demitri and the rest of the front desk staff were great to work with.

Bed was super comfy, water pressure was great, room was clean and well kept.",5,2017,06,08
148,luxury through and through,I went with friends for my 50th birthday and as soon as I walked in the front door I fell in love with the place. The whole place smelt beautiful and staff were so happy to see us with a glass of  bubbly while waiting for check in. The rooms were fabulous clean fresh and rather big. They even left a out of this world chocolate moose and a bottle of wine in my room with a birthday message. Will definitely stay there again. Did here a bit of noise from rooftop bar but soon fell to sleep no problem beds are huge.,5,2017,06,07
148,30th Birthday Treat,"I booked this hotel for my daughter as a 30th birthday treat as it was close to where The Lion King is showing, it far exceeded my expectations, we were both treated like royalty! 
Can't wait to return in the future! ",5,2017,06,06
148,Second visit - Overrated,"This was a second visit to the hotel as our preferred hotel was fully booked we reluctantly booked the ME again in the hopes it would be better.

My previous review will stands and to make it worse they had issues with the drains which gave a strong unpleasant small in the check in area and STK restaurant. Thankfully this smell was not in our room.

Again - this hotel is very overrated. Apart from the trendy look & feel it doesn't offer much else. Service is standard from staff and you can't tell the staff apart from the hotel guests as staff are in different clothing and no name tags. 

Our room was on a high floor right beneath Radio bar which meant we could hear every beat and bass from the speakers till early hours. We was not told to expect this at check in.

Disappointing stay again.",3,2017,06,05
148,wow wow wow,"what a hotel you have to experience this fab hotel. the staff were lovely. very modern hotel, rooms are of great size and very clean loved everything about the hotel and the rooftop bar is wow wow  wow  breakfast was excellent nothing too much trouble if there is something you want just  ask 5stars not enough ",5,2017,06,04
148,"World-class architecture--- and everything else, too.","Fabulous reception area, more like a cathedral, gets one in the right frame of mind for the excellences still to come. The staff, buffet, room, and appointments were absolutely first-rate. Yes, it's really this wonderful a place--- and the location is close to many tourist ""must-see"" destinations.",5,2017,06,02
148,Excellent Hotel and Wonderful Staff,"From the minute we entered the hotel to the minute we left we were made to feel like VIPs.  Reception was fantastic, the concierge was awesome, breakfast staff was very attentive and the food was fresh and delicious.  Even the check out was great.  The room was very well appointed with bluetooth hook up to my iPhone to play music through nice JBL speakers.  Oh and from my balcony I had a great view of The Tower Bridge and the Thames!   I have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel!  I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to London.  ",5,2017,06,01
148,Great Hotel,"The ME London was recommended by a friend of mine who travels to London for business.  I'm glad I took her suggestion and stayed at this wonderful hotel, located in the Covent Garden area.  I was impressed with the size, cleanliness and quality of my room.  I would definitely stay here again!  The environmental control panel, which also controlled lighting, was awesome and conveniently located next to the bed.  It was nice to see how they implemented some great tech!",5,2017,06,01
148,Contemporary chic in the heart of London,"Booked a one night stay for an anniversary celebration and selected an Energy Urban Terrace Room. The hotel has an edgy, contemporary feel with a huge pyramid shaped atrium upon the walls of which colourful images are projected. Guests are offered a free glass of prosecco upon check in, which is a nice touch. We were congratulated by the check in staff on our anniversary and advised that they had selected for us the one room which has a bath tub as well as a shower, although it wouldn't be ready until 3pm. This wasn't a problem as we went off for lunch and the room had been prepared by the time we returned. The corridors of the hotel are incredibly dark, which we really liked but which might pose a problem if you struggle in dark spaces! However, and in contrast, the bedroom was white and bright. I had thought that there might be a small token in the room for our anniversary (last year, in Amalfi, we had a chilled bottle of prosecco and a bowl of cherries waiting for us in our hotel room, which was really lovely), however I guess we'd had the glass of fizz in the lobby so shouldn't be greedy! The room itself was great - minimalist but pristine with a huge bathroom and a double shower. The bed was just fantastic - larger, I think, than the super king sized bed we have at home - and so comfortable. There were a couple of chairs and one sun lounger on the  large terrace - a second lounger would have been good so that we could both have relaxed in the sun. We had thought that we might go up to the Radio roof bar at the top of the hotel later in the evening and sit with a cocktail, but there was nowhere to sit and it was full of, glam but much younger people  and a female DJ playing thumping music - not really our thing...! Other than the slight disappointment of the roof top bar (maybe we should have gone much earlier before the late night young crowd arrived)  the look, and feel of the hotel was exactly as we had hoped it would be. The staff were incredibly warm, efficient and welcoming and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stylish and ultra modern hotel in a central London location.",5,2017,05,31
148,"Great Location, a little pricey.","We enjoyed our stay and the staff were friendly, especially enjoyed the Roof Top. The hotel under-performed in some areas (despite order, no champagne in the room) however nice message left (on the bathroom mirror). Room, comfortable but a little basic... so a little generous at scoring a 4, really 3.5. 
Really enjoyed the time on roof top bar, brunch .",4,2017,05,30
148,Amazing!!!!!,"An amazing night away, the hotel is perfect, the service is top notch. Everything was set up and ready for my girlfriend as I had a Rose and chocolate ready for her. As you check in they off you a glass of Prosecco. The room looked out onto The Strand. Couldn't of asked for a better night away. ",5,2017,05,30
148,Unexpectedly good.,"When looking at the website and the slightly eclectic, modern rooms, I was expecting a very young and rather loud hotel.  Instead I found a very purposeful, clear hotel with excellent rooms and a very professional service. 

The hotel is very conveniently placed if Covent Garden and the West End is your scene, and not bad for the city either.  

The rooms come in many categories, but appear to be all consistent and comfortable beds, good showers and being quite well soundproofed. 

A word of advice, do not ask for the top floor, as it is directly below the bar and therefore can be quite loud.  

Although my stay was for business, and this will probably be my primary purpose in the future, I would certainly wish to stay there again if other hotels in my range of preferences were not available.",5,2017,05,28
148,Amazing,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Customer service excellent and over and beyond what is expected, rooms are amazing with huge beds which you won't want to leave ever! Great if expensive food at STK! What a wonderful experience. We wouldn't stay anywhere else in London!",5,2017,05,27
148,"Stylish yet overpriced, a bit snobbish...","I stayed here recently with my boyfriend and his family. The hotel was stylish and clean, yet I don't think the rooms themselves were worth what we payed, nothing notably different from what you get at other 4/5 star hotels anyway, slightly disappointing even. 

As for the staff at the front desk on the bottom floor, they weren't the friendliest and made you feel uncomfortable and out of place, one even snatching our luggage from us as we entered even know we didn't ask for them to take it. 

Staff in the Radio Bar and those on entrance to the lifts also made us feel like we shouldn't have been there, looking down on us almost. All guests should be treated the same. We are all paying good money to stay there after all! The bar itself was stylish and played good music, however the drinks again were over priced for what you got. The views over London however from the Radio Bar are lovely. 

",3,2017,05,27
148,Perfect hotel,"It has been quite some time since I made a comment for a hotel. I thought this hotel is worth it. All details are well considered, chic but comfortable, smiling personnel, very good location. It deserves a better TripAdvisor rating. ",5,2017,05,27

148,Wonderful Anniversary Stay,"We stayed for one night at the ME and loved our experience.  The Aura team made our stay special with a little cake and sparkling wine and a lovely note written on our bathroom mirror.
The Me is a very cool hotel in a fantastic location.  We will definitely return.",5,2017,05,25
148,Hotel Review,"Unfortunately my experience with ME London Hotel and Melia Chain is not the nicest.  I must say Melia Chain is a total disaster! 

General Reservations Representatives are absolutely unprofessional in most cases and some have complete lock of product knowledge. Their Melia Reward Program is a complete scam especially for those clients who do not ask right questions at the time of booking.

Please note, if you are  signing up for reward program at the time of booking, these points should be used immediately. Otherwise they will be worthless. 
I personally emailed a complaint letter to a general reservation and never received a response despite of getting a ticket number for my 
complaint.

Four of us (two couples) spent our vacation at ME London Hotel. I must say most of the hotel's personnel is not well trained. Fifty percent of the time their  answers to our questions  were "" I don't know or i am not sure."" 
In addition we had impression that front desk assistants had no connection to a hotel reservation desk , needles to say with general reservation. 

Hotel has a very good location (convenient to public transportation; hop on hop off is right across ; many restaurants and bars are near by; convenient and short walk to primary points of interests ), and clean spacious rooms. 

At the time of booking we were offered room upgrade (original room had balcony). When making online checkin we needed to make a decision to accept the upgrade. 
I called general reservation and was advised that room of higher category has no balcony even though its a suite. At the same time my friend called the hotel directly and was advised that higher category DOES have a balcony.
These calls created chaos and delays in processing the smooth checkin, as was promised by the Melia website.
The checkout process took forever as well: computer was frozen; reward number was not possible to locate; millions of questions about what was charged on the room were asked. The front desk representative asked about our room numbers  for several times and got confused whose points go to which reservation. 
If you will be using  phone from your room to call the front desk or anywhere inside the hotel  the charges will be posted to your checkout bill. 

Further, one of the hostess for Radio Bar, which is the rooftop bar located at the hotel was extremely rude. 
Her arrogance and lock of customer service had simply  spoiled our stay at this hotel. 

For those who would like to travel to London and stay at Covent Gardens area, find another hotel! ME hotel prices per night are not in collaboration with customer service. ",2,2017,05,25

148,Perfect I. Every way,From our arrival until our departure we found all of the staff extremely helpful and polite. Lovey property and a great excperience. Strongly recommend to all!  Modern yet comfortable and the location within London met all of our needs. Very trendy yet quality service in every way.  I would return here for certain and will recommend it to my friends.,5,2017,05,23
148,What is important to you is important to them,"For my girlfriends birthday i had some plans which were amended numerous times throughout the day. The team at ME were fantastic in being flexible and patient with me as well as providing incredible attention to detail in the first place. Would i like a bottle of champagne and a little birthday cake and a message on the mirror for her arrival? Well i never thought of any of that until you mentioned it but yes that would be amazing! Would we like a glass of prosecco while we wait to check in, even though we are the only people checking in? Yes, of course. They were fantastic, the experience was fantastic, I knew the radio bar and room would be incredible, you can find that on their website but you cannot account for the incredible attention to detail and care of the staff. Shout out to Andrea on the Front Desk and Maria in the Aura team for everything they did to make this trip perfect.",5,2017,05,22
148,Outstanding attention to detail,"In town on business and chose the ME because of its great location.  Beautiful room, phenomenal roof bar, excellent amenities, fantastic bed and shower.  Excellent attention to detail to create a terrific atmosphere.  I'll be back, for sure.",5,2017,05,18
148,Surprise Treat,"I went for dinner at STK as a surprise and it was fab! The service was very smooth and efficient, not too pushy and really friendly. We got great recommendations for champagne and food. The starters were fun, quite quirky and something a bit different- we really liked them, very tasty. I had a fillet steak main and it was stunning...so much of a distraction, that I'd already eaten it by the time I remember to take a photo! My partner had a T-bone as it weighed more, but as it turned out, it had more fat on it and wasn't as good a quality- definitely a lesson learnt to go for the best cut, not necessarily the bigger piece! :) We didn't make dessert- too full. We'd hoped to get to the rooftop but the weather wasn't good, but it didn't matter- the restaurant didn't disappoint. Overall a great atmosphere, vibrant d√©cor and lovely people. It was quite pricey so it wouldn't be a regular pitt stop, but a great one-off treat!",4,2017,05,18
148,this hotel is something else!,"I have recently stayed in this hotel for a weekend in London and have 2 words for you - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! This hotel is highly recommended for young couples or friend groups. Rooms are very spacious and clean, the design of the hotel blew me away! They have a rooftop bar which is called Radio 1 and there is a gueslist (you have to prebook to avoid disappointment) you can put your name on beforehand. DO NOT miss the STK Restaurant - best steak I ever had! Will definitely go back and has to be asap! PS: Yes, beds are very comfy and pillows to die for!",5,2017,05,18
148,My birthday ,"My partner booked this as a birthday surprise.

148,Superior customer service,"My partner and I stayed here to celebrate our engagement and our anniversary. This hotel is nicely situated near Covent Garden tube station and far enough away from the hustle and bustle to be quiet. 
Our initial impression was made by the beautiful smell as you walk in enhanced by the friendly and welcoming concierge staff who calmly directed us to check in at reception. Here we were greeted with a glass of fizz and a warm welcome. 
We chose a double room which was very clean and minimalistic. Unfortunately we were kept up during the night on a number of occasion by a high pitched noise. We called reception to get it rectified and maintenance came immediately out but could not fix the issue. The manager and reception staff advised us to pack our suitcases in the morning and while we were out they would move rooms for us. 
Well what a surprise we had when we got back! They had upgraded us to a suite with a bottle of champagne on ice and a couple of sweet treats to congratulate us on our celebration and to apologise for the inconvenience. 
Finally, on our anniversary evening we had a truly awful meal at a nearby restaurant and we decided we would go to the rooftop bar to enjoy a Saturday night in London. Unfortunately the bar was very overcrowded and we could not get served despite the staff trying their best and there was no seating or standing room. This seemed a shame considering we were guests and we both felt they could afford a small area just for staying guests however, all hope was not lost as we used the ground floor bar instead. 
This is where our stay become out of this world. We were served by Bogdan and Fabritzio who blew us away with their cocktail making skills and their personable nature. Without a doubt they made our evening and we went to bed truly laughing like teenagers again!",5,2017,05,16
148,My second time in this modern hotel ,"My first visit, was a big chance, i received a upgrade to one of the suites. My second visit in 2017, was regular but great too. The staffs are absolutely friendly üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº the breakfast is wonderful. The bartenders at the roof are professionals! But the Sound was too loud. The rooms are fabulous. I would recommend this hotel anytime!",4,2017,05,15
148,Dissapointing,"A very underwhelming experience in general. Bathroom sinks were dirty, TV didnt work, unable to contact reception to discuss noise from air conditioning unit - when switched off. Breakfast staff, with the exception of one person, were unfriendly. Poor quality breakfast.",2,2017,05,15
148,A visit to remember!,From the time you step into this hotel you feel very special. Staff are so kind to you nothing is too much trouble. As soon as you check out you are thinking when you can return to be spoilt again in this beautiful hotel. The location is great for shows and short walk to Covent Garden. ,5,2017,05,15
148,5 star service and room walking distance to most landmarks,Amazing room with arguably the best equipped mini bar in the world. Certainly the best we have seen. This is not the forum for spoilers. It makes a great surprise. Our room had a river facing terrace which was a bonus in the morning sunshine. 5 star service from arrival. We had one issue that was dealt with swiftly. We would book again in a heartbeat. ,5,2017,05,13
148,Sexy and sleek hotel in the middle of London,"I stayed at this hotel for a week for work and the best words to describe it are sexy and sleek. Everything is very modern. Reception is on the 1st floor (not ground) in a stunning space with natural light all the way up to the roof. The rooms were clean and well-maintained. One night, the air conditioning system was making a whistling noise and maintenance showed up promptly to address and solve the problem. The rooms have pink lighting which adds a fun vibe. The rain shower is a nice touch as well.",4,2017,05,13
148,Another great stay,"Recently stayed in a chic suite with my 2 daughters. The suite was lovely, bed extremely comfortable, everything fresh and clean. Lovely check-in experience with prosecco and a friendly welcome. Fantastic location for Covent Garden and theatres. Can't wait to visit again.",5,2017,05,13
148,Complete and utter rip off!,"Scrambled eggs and two factory made slices of thumbed toast which you had to make yourself in a conveyor machine. Bill arrived with a menu on the PDQ asking you to select a top of 10%, 20% and upwards to 40%! This is despite the fact that it was a self- service buffet ( a rich description for the little on offer) and, wait for it, there was already 12.5% service charge on the bill. When I asked the waitress , why is the machine asking for a tip when there was already a service charge the response  was , well, that's just the service charge. 

The bill? Nearly ¬£70 for two people , both having the same. 

Disgraceful rip off. 

Never again.",1,2017,05,12
148,ME London...the hotel I call home...,"Very stylish boutique hotel centrally located in London's West End, with easy access to shops, restaurants and entertainment. 
The best views of London can be enjoyed at the hotel's contemporary and edgy Radio Roof Top Bar",5,2017,05,09
148,"Once again, fab stay",Faultless. Love it here. Third visit and hope I can always afford to stay here. Feel special every time. Every single member of staff is polite and helpful. Even help you via email a week before you arrive! ,5,2017,05,08
148,Awful and expensive,"This is a very expensive modern hotel in the new genre i.e. all dark/minimal lighting/cubicle style room.  Not my cup of tea at all, including the nasty 'chillax' music in the room on return.  Awful.  It is really difficult to find your way around the hotel - we met some people who had been up and down in the lift several times without finding their floor! So dark, couldn't see down the corridors.  The room was long, narrow and small, with odd glass blinds across the windows.  Bathroom door sliding glass - very little privacy. Bed was good but it is an expensive place to sleep if that's all you need.  Didn't try the food.  Rooftop bar nothing to write home about.  Reception plain weird and not in the least warm or welcoming.  Staff fine.  I prefer the more traditional type of hotel where I feel cared for.  Won't be returning.",2,2017,05,08
148,"Modern hotel, fabulous location","Very efficient check in and we had a lovely room on the 9th floor with balcony and view. Enjoyed the very vibrant roof bar and the bar staff were very friendly decpice being under pressure as extremely busy popular bar. Concierge helpful and service again superb. It's one of the more modern melia hotels and being near to Covent gardens and on the strand, the location is fantastic for walking out in the day and evening to restaurants, bars and the theatre. 

",5,2017,05,08
148,"Amazing, Vibrant, Friendly, Professional, Modern Hotel","We absolutely loved this hotel. We stayed at the ME hotel on in on a Friday night in May as we were watching a show near to Covent Garden and it was to Celebrate our 15th Wedding Anniversary. I would recommend an 'Energy Urban Terrace' room on the 9th floor because the views are amazing as your eye level is above the neighbouring buildings. The room was a bit extra, but well worth it in our opinion. The hotel is perfectly positioned for most theatres and is very close to Covent Garden.
 All the staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough to help, from Sergio in resevations, to Pierre on the recepton check in desk and Julian at the Radio Rooftop Bar.
 When you're there the Rooftop Bar is a must, but if you want a table its best to book.",5,2017,05,07
148,"Great hotel, shame the roof was shut!","This was the third ME we'd stayed in over the past 12 months, having already been to ME Ibiza and ME Madrid. In many ways doesn't disappoint. The rececption area on the 1st floor is something else... won't describe it as you have to experience it. We had a room on the top floor with a balacony and a (sort of) view over Covent Garden. Like all ME hotels room was excellent and bed amazing. Turn down service every night with the chill out music channel put on for us returning which was a nice touch. The bar downstairs excellent and the bar staff were great recommending their own concoctions. Tried the STK restaurant one night which was very good, although not outstanding given the price. The only downside was the bloody roof cocktail bar was shut for refurbishment which was one of the main things we were looking forwards to having experienced the amazing one in ME Madrid. Just bad timing I guess!",4,2017,05,06
148,Nice Modern Hotel,"Sleek and modern hotel which has recently been refurbished. A glass of champagne at check in is a nice touch. The hotel is well located for Covent Garden and the locality. Rooms are spacious and nicely furnished in a modern style. Beds are very comfortable with nice linens.  Breakfast is ok, with some of the buffet food being a little ""past its best"". Overall I loved this hotel and will revisit.",5,2017,05,06
148,Superb stay,"We stayed at the ME London for two nights in April. We were hoping for a first-class, 5* hotel - and that's exactly what we got. From the moment we set foot in the hotel we were looked after beautifully. The standard room had everything you could possibly want (one small point to note, please provide a kettle for those of us who prefer tea to coffee!), the decor was gorgeous and the shower - wow! I was especially impressed with the nightly turn down service including chocolates and water by the bed. The location was perfect - right in the heart of theatreland and an easy 5min stroll to Covent Garden and the tube station. We didn't try the breakfast or the restaurant so unable to comment on those, but the rooftop bar is fantastic. The views are exceptional, nothing better than drinking a delicious cocktail in the sunshine overlooking our beautiful capital city. Very special.

This trip was a real treat, I can't wait to do it all again. Thank you ME London!

148,ME Hotel assures a fantastic experience,"Having stayed here before and being totally satisfied with all aspects of the hotel, it made sense to return for this visit. The hotel is amazing, the experience is amazing and the rooftop bar is unbeatable with a terrific atmosphere. Priority access to the Rooftop Radio Bar for residents is a great thing to have as it gets extremely busy on a weekend. Definitely our favourite hotel in London now with the quality and location being perfect. ",5,2017,05,04
148,Fabulous design hotel,"Very beautiful, inspiring hotel with good location and very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms had everything which is needed.

148,Great short stay!!!,We stayed overnight in this stylish hotel and had a lovely time. We loved surprise glass of champagne while checking in. We loved our drinks in the rooftop Radio bar in the evening and enjoyed delicious breakfast in the room next morning. All members of staff were very attentive. Thank you.,5,2017,05,03
148,Anniversary stay at the ME.,"Just the best hotel!! Nothing but 5 stars for the ME. If you're thinking of going, stop thinking and GO! We didn't want to leave after lovely cocktails in the downstairs bar and on the rooftop! Not to mention a sublime steak at STK!",5,2017,05,03
148,AMAZING,"Where do I start.

From the moment you arrive here you are treated so well here. 

Staff greeting you on arrival into the hotel, taking your luggage then taken to reception. 
Presseco on arrival. 
Greeted and taken up to your room.

The attention to detail is amazing and nothing is too much trouble for the staff who work so hard and are an asset to the hotel.

If you are celebrating someone's birthday then you can e mail the hotel in advance and they go out of there way to make it extra special - messages on the mirror and champagne and cakes in the room, sometimes a room upgrade if available.

Room service was on time and always well presented. First Class.

STK was amazing for food and Radio bar was lively and great for cocktails and stunning London Views. We didn't come out of the hotel everything was there for you so there was no need too.

Hairdryer in room and iron and ironing board on request. Water too. The mini bar is amazing and other things you can choose to purchase.

Top hotel and I would recommend any one to stay and book, well worth the price.

Greta staff and fantastic Chic hotel which also welcomes dogs which is a plus.

You get what you pay for, Thank you Me Hotel great job and your staff are an asset.

I will be back for sure and anyone thinking of booking do so as you wont be disappointed.",5,2017,05,03
148,A wonderful oasis in the heart of Convent Garden,I visited ME with my family to celebrate a  special birthday. The service was first class from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. We were greeted with a glass of prosecco and one room was ready for our use as we had told the hotel we would be arriving at midday. We had urban terrace rooms which were spacious and very modern with a wonderful bed and great selection of toiletries. We had a fun drink in the Radio Roof Top bar before venturing out to celebrate. Thank you to all the staff at ME for making my special trip so memorable.,5,2017,05,03
148,Great location for a hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights and used those 2 nights to watch plays in covent garden. We then proceeded to visit Radio Bar at the top of the hotel - and that did not disappoint.

Rooms are a bit small - but shouldn't really expect much more based on location.",4,2017,05,02
148,"Great Hotel, great staff and fantastic Bar","Stayed 3 nights, had a great time, very helpful and considerate staff, had a great night at the radio roof top bar and good food at STK in house restaurant, was there for a 50th and a 16th birthday , a few nice touches added by hotel staff, cake and champagne waiting in our room , more cake and bubbles at STK, well done very appreciated ....... we will be back,",5,2017,05,01
148,Excellent hotel in likewise excellent location,"We stayed at ME for three days for an event in London. It is located in such a fantastic location - food, shows, shopping, and amazing restaurants are right outside. The hotel itself is incredibly modern, and its registration lobby is genuinely breathtaking (as in literally - I walked in, and gasped - you'll see). The service was excellent. The rooms, beds, bathroom as clean and well laid out. The bed is incredibly comfortable. I have allergies and had no issues at all at the hotel. 

The only issue we did have were salads ordered late for room service. They were poor quality with browned lettuce. In the end, they ended up being removed from our bill due to a separate issue - someone triggered the fire alarm at 8am. The hotel management apologised when we checked out (we had said nothing), and said they waived our charges for that meal. It was a nice gesture. 

The ME is absolutely first class, and we will absolutely stay there again. Thanks for a great visit. ",5,2017,04,30
148,Statecof the Art hotel in the Strand London,"Very well located hotel if you go to musicals. Close to the Covent garden which is a nice place for drinks and food after theater.

148,A true pearl!,"Our stay at ME London this Easter was amazing from start to finish.
It started with the doorman greeting us, and helping with our bags. They were very attentive. 
We got greeted in the reception by Mr. Zanotto who gave us a compensation as one of the reasons we chose the hotel was because of their well known sky bar, which was closed due to renovations. 
The hotel itself is in a nice fashionable area, with walking distance to oxford street. It‚Äôs a modern hotel with beautiful design. And there are many great restaurants and cafes in the area. 
We used the concierge services frequently throughout our stay, and I am very impressed with the quality of their tips and understanding as to what we were looking for. Their staff is super friendly and professional. 
The breakfast was a true delight, both in the dining area and room service. 
And after heading out in the evening we returned to our rooms cleaned and prepped with small water bottles, chocolates and our slippers placed by the bed. 
Working within hotel myself I am very impressed by their service minded awareness to all the small things that made this stay memorable.

We are definitely coming back to ME London, and I can strongly recommend this hotel to both couples and families. 

Thank you to the staff for such a wonderful stay with you, 

Kr,

148,Great location/value in London.,"Stayed at ME with my GF for 3 nights.  Location is amazing, easy walking distance to Westminster, Parliament.  25-30 min walk to Tower of London.
Staff is very friendly, and rooms are huge.  The bed is also really comfortable and the dual rain shower head is nice.

The hotel is very minimalist/modern, but also comfortable.

The only issue that we had is that our neighbors doors would slam and that would actually jar our door, simulating a knock.

Otherwise, great place.  ",4,2017,04,26
148,Fabulous luxury hotel!,"Everything was clean and to a high standard. The staff were very helpful and went over and above to make my husbands special birthday, really special by secretly putting champagne and a handmade Easter bunny in the room when we went out to the theatre. They arranged the time especially so he would come back to it! Totally satisfied! ",5,2017,04,26
148,Class act,"Top class hotel in the centre of Soho. 
From the moment your arrive you are looked after like a VIP.
Fantastic rooms - We stayed in a Mode room on this occasion which is more than adequate. No bath is these rooms, but the shower is great.
The restaurant STK is on site as well as the rooftop Radio bar - both worth a visit.
We are booked in again next month, can't wait...
",5,2017,04,25
148,Birthday weekend I will never forget!,"This hotel is one of a kind. Perfect in every way, really couldn't fault it! My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights for my birthday and stayed in a suite which was fantastic. Really spacious room and the bathroom was very cool. Lovely touches such as champagne in the room and a personalised 'Happy Birthday' message on the mirror. We booked STK for dinner on the Saturday night and were seated on a 6 person round table overlooking the whole restaurant - I would recommend requesting this kind of table (if you can) if you want more intimacy as I noticed most of the tables for two were positioned very close together. The service was great, a very cool restaurant with good music and even better food. The steak was so tasty and cooked to perfection - I recommend the mini burgers to start and truffle chips as a side! Thoroughly enjoyable evening. We went to Radio rooftop bar for drinks on the Sunday and although very busy, we had a table reserved for us outside which was great especially as the weather was kind to us! The rooftop has a great atmosphere with loud music and a great cocktail menu. Overall a perfect weekend, filled with too much food and drink but honestly cannot fault anything and will definitely be returning! Simply the best!",5,2017,04,25
148,Highly recommended hotel! Great experience for design and service lovers!,"Design is outstanding, especially reception room, lobby, rooftop, restaurant and corridors to rooms. Special thanks to security guys and personally to Karim Asiyabe who arranged return of lost items back home safely.",5,2017,04,24
148,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, great location, great service and luxury guarenteed!","This is our second time at the Me in London and if possible it was even better than the first. From arrival to departure the team here can't do enough to help you, they are friendly, helpful and go out of their way (discretely) to ensure you have a fabulous stay with them. 

Arrival is fabulous with a cool light show and complimentary prosecco whilst checking in which is a great way to start any stay. 

Riccardo the Aura Manager ensured we were welcomed back to the hotel and they made a point of celebrating a special occasion with us with some beautiful chocolate and cake treats as well as complimentary bubbles and a fantastic room, we were blown away by such a welcome. 

The rooms themselves are beautiful with really lovely high quality fittings and bedding etc. Luxury guaranteed, we have stayed in a lot of hotels in London however we both agreed we wouldn't stay anywhere else other than the Me going forward as it is so consistent and such great value for money. 

The cleaning is spotless everywhere and the turndown service is a real treat with chocolates and water left, our five year old loved it. 

The beds are super comfortable and the bathroom has a lovely walk in shower, there is plenty of room in the wardrobe and the room has a lovely large flat screen, there is also free wifi (which works!!).

The hotel is marketed as more of an adults hotel, due to some of the extra facilities like the very cool roof top bar however we stayed this time as a family with our five year old and he absolutely loved the cool glamour of the place, plus the staff go out of their way to be lovely which children notice, he said it was his favourite hotel.  The rooms themselves are so big that they accommodate an extra bed whilst still retaining a feeling of roominess.

The concierge also deserve a mention, they couldn't be more helpful. We spoke with Emiliano who helped us arrange a hop on hop off bus tour, in addition he took the time to explain the route and give recommendations on how to make the most of it including a boat tour that was included, which as it turns out was the highlight of the tour and we may have overlooked without Emiliano's recommendation. In addition when we had a couple of issues with the trip company (nothing within the hotel's control) and we fed back for information only, Emiliano demonstrated total ownership and contacted the company, when I got home I received an email from him confirming we should expect a refund, Given we hadn't complained to the hotel we were totally impressed that they had showed such great concern and ownership for the issue that occurred. Massively impressed, never have we stayed anywhere with such a responsive concierge! 

Lastly location deserves a mention, it has to be one of the best situated hotels in London if you are there for the sights, great food and drink and perhaps the shows, it suited us perfectly for our trip to the theatre, the southbank, the London eye etc. 

All in all a 5 star stay, every member of staff clearly loves working at the Me and the standards of service and cleanliness are exactly what we look for in a hotel, we will definitely be back!",5,2017,04,23
148,Right hotel in the right area. ,Modern hotel design just keeps getting better and this Hotel has got it right. The led aquarium in the lobby is very cool and on Sundays so are the people. I didn't know brunch was such a big deal... looked like a nightclub. The rooms are clean and well appointed... great showers. Near Covent Garden so close to food and theaters. Staff were great with helping arrange London Eye tickets.. been to the Langham and May Fair and this was our favorite hands down. ,5,2017,04,23
148,AMAZING,"From the minute we walked in the staff were so friendly,
Rooms were amazing , clean , comfortable actually the best nights sleep I have had in a long time .
Bathroom and toiletries were more than catered for 
Can't fault this hotel   
Can't wait to return",5,2017,04,22
148,Perfect modern hotel in the best location. Top choice for us.,Lets start with the location a 2 minute walk to Covent Garden which puts you in a great area to get great food and also near transportation. The hotel is ultra modern and has a most unusual lobby with a laser show units pyramid walls. The breakfast was excellent and the rooms are a nice size as well. Modern bathrooms and for us a joining room for the kids. We have stayed at the Langham and the Mayfair and prefer this easily.,5,2017,04,22
148,Highly recommended...happy to be back,"I've stayed 2 nights at the ME London and I really enjoyed the stay. Staff was very friendly and check-in went very smoothly. Our room was on the second floor but we couldn't hear any noise from the street. The room itself was stylish and clean. The gym was also nice, much better than most hotel gyms. We also tried out the Radio Rooftop bar - we were lucky with the weather - and the view over London ist just amazing. The hotels location is also perfect - few minutes walk from Covent Garden and all the other spots you need to see in london. The area itself has a lot of nice restaurants. I'm happy to stay at ME London again once I'm back to London. ",5,2017,04,22
148,ME London,"Loved this hotel. The staff is the greatest! The concierge staff was the most professional but friendly and helpful staff that I have encountered anywhere. The location is great, convenient to restaurants, theaters and shopping. Overall, this hotel can't be beat. I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,04,21
148,Comfort away from home,"We would have rated higher, but we didn't get the full Me London experience.  The rooftop bar was closed!!üò≠ The staff was great.  Management even gave us champagne to celebrate our 2nd year of marriage.  Great hospitality from concierge to check-in.  Housekeeping were respectful and courteous. ",3,2017,04,21
148,"Impressive, ultra-modern hotel","I was blown away when I arrived at the ME. It's a super-trendy place, so I felt a little intimidated trudging in in my jeans and with a tattered rucksack after a long journey, but I was warmly welcomed at the check-in desk - placed at the base of the enormous pyramid that goes up the inside of the whole building. A glass of prosecco on check-in was a nice touch!
The interiors of the hotel continued with the theme of being sleek and ultra-modern - black-clad corridors brightly lit and heavily perfumed. Our room, by contrast, was less imposing and more comfortable, with a good view down onto the Strand and all the clever romantic hints. 
This hotel is perfect if you want to explore Covent Garden or go to the Opera - it's only round the corner. 
Breakfast was delicious and very fresh - the staff were friendly and kept a keen eye on us to make sure we had everything we needed.",5,2017,04,21
148,Excellent,"The hotel is one of the most modernly designed hotel where I've ever been. It is the best location in London, exactly in the center but not noisy. The bar is amazing with special foods and cocktails. The service is high quality, helpful and professional workers. Luxury equipped rooms with perfect view to the city.",5,2017,04,20
148,Nice hotel BUT....,"Hmm so We stayed at the hotel for one night but we had two rooms. So the location is very good, the reception hmm very modern. The hotel is modern, which makes it a little bit cold. I wanted to write a better review BUT When we came to the hotel the receptionists said that they have to block our 200 GBP in case we don't pay for something. Now five days have past and we still don't have our 200 GBP although we did not eat something from the minibar, we did not steal neither towels nor toilet paper etc. Honestly I feel like we were robbed, we are leaving the UK tomorrow and we will not need 200 GBP anymore. So please remember that they will be keeping Your money with now reason.... AAAAA and the receptionist said no worry we will give You the money back the next day after You book out, and today when I have called the hotel they have said You have to wait 7 days at least.... Honestly I will never comeback to this hotel again...",3,2017,04,20
148,Cool Hotel,Fab location and very impressive Hotel . The ground floor entrance is very cool and reception on the 1st floor is Wow ........ only shame was that the roof top bar was closed for refurbishment .... will have to visit again.   ,5,2017,04,19
148,Bad service,The hotel was ok but DO NOT use their valley service! I brought a brand new car 2 weeks previous to my visit in London and used their valley service which I had to pay a extra ¬£50 more to get my car back and the alloys are scratched to pieces! The hotel won't do nothing about this claiming they have no CCTV in the car park! Very disappointed in the service here and won't be staying here again!,1,2017,04,19
148,Amazing hotel and staff - shame about Radio,Stayed here last week for a romantic get away with my parter. We had booked the hotel as close to the Theatre and Rules bar but also to enjoy Radio which unfortunately was closed without our knowledge but that didn't stop the staff making up for it. We were given a suite which was unbelievable as well a few extras and can honestly say it was a really wonderful hotel. Will definitely recommend and will definitely return. ,5,2017,04,19
148,Fabulous weekend,"Had a wonderful weekend, with our three sons. One of our son's is in a wheelchair so we were concerned how it would work out! But the staff were absolutely amazing, they met us when we arrived and helped with the wheelchair and luggage. Nothing was a problem for them. The hotel and staff were so friendly, we would certainly recommend this hotel and will certainly be returning for another weekend visit.",5,2017,04,18
148,"Modern hotel, very clean, superb staff, convenient location","Very modern, clean and excellent staff.   The location in the center of London near Temple Tube station and next to the theaters is very convenient.   The staff is very friendly and always helping out.  The rooms are superb !  ",5,2017,04,18
148,"Black and white modern, comfortable, quiet and spacious hotel in optimal central location.","Quality of service and of furniture/beds excellent. Modern and spacious common areas in (my) room.
Optimal central location. Very good sound proofing (room to room and from outside noises).
Decoration in corridors was shiny dark/black, which gived a very special secluded atmosphere but this darkness is not to my taste. However the room was light and bright (my room had floor to ceiling window).
Extremely comfortable top service hotel.
",5,2017,04,18
148,Great hotel,"I had a joyous time at me hotel; the reception staff were very friendly. When I called down Sam was a delight (even the phone operators are incredible!)

I can't recommend this place enough, my husband and I will be staying here again- #1 anniversary destination (ruby coming up!!) 

Thank you me hotel!

148,My bday visit,"This hotel is top quality. Quality venue, quality service and quality location.

Communication prior to checking in was personalised and v friendly. I spoke with Simona and she was so lovely and welcoming and made sure everything was right with my stay. It was lovely to meet her in person also, she wanted to make sure everything was perfect for me.

Our room was lovely, everything modern, clean and high tech. 

Conciege was so on point and friendly.. we parked the car and for ¬£49 we received a top quality valet service, the car ready in a matter of minutes when we needed to use it; luggage loaded for us and opening car doors for us. All staff just so friendly and genuine. 

Breakfast service was also top quality, food was lovely, we recommend the omelettes. 

Nothing was too much for any of the staff, really is the best place I have stayed in a long time. Recommended to all! For special occasions this place is just unmatched!

The hotel reception area is just so wonderful also!! 

10/10 experience!!!! Can't praise enough! ",5,2017,04,15
148,"Great hotel, and great staff!","Everything about both of our stays here was amazing. Even before arriving, all of the staff corresponded with us to make sure everything was in place. They spare no expense to make sure everyone feels like they are in their own personal hotel at all times. Rooms with a terrace are amazing and I couldn't complain about any of the accommodations. We left for Amsterdam for just a couple days and they had no issue whatsoever with caring for our extra luggage that we didn't need for the trip. Absolutely a wonderful hotel in a great location for everything. Can't imagine staying anywhere else in London!",5,2017,04,15
148,Top shelf hotel for a weekend in London,"Spent a 3 night weekend at ME London.  This hotel is top shelf.  The location, the staff, the rooms...all of it.

This was a family visit, so we did not visit the club and the roof top bar was closed to renovations.

The Vibe room we stayed in was quite nice - good size with windows jutting out allowing for good views of the action on the street below.

It was our daughters birthday and they made the effort to have a little something waiting for her upon our arrival- a nice touch.

The bed was super comfortable, the lighting features are interesting and the technology of the room is great (once we figured it out).

The bathroom is amazing...spacious with separate shower that makes you feel like you are in a spa.  Room is well equipped with snacks (for a fee) and the hotel is walking distance to Covent Garden and Soho.

I highly recommend ME London - particularly for those coming to the city to watch a show..ME is in the heart of the theatre district.

Check it out.",5,2017,04,14
148,Great Location,"Chose this hotel primarily because of it's proximity to Theatre Royal Drury Lane. I was not expecting to feel totally wowed by the hotel's modern and minimalist style and decoration. The first floor reception area was amazing and the experience was enhanced by a complimentary glass of sparkling wine while check-in was completed. Our room was on the 8th floor with amazing views from the balcony over the London Eye, The Shard and even as far as Tower Bridge and Cary Wharf. The room was very white, bright and modern in contrast to the colour schemes of the external corridors. Breakfast the next morning was very good with a good choice of hot and cold as well as a la carte offerings. The hotel location is amazing, so close to theatres, Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square the river Thames. All the staff we encountered were first rate from check-in to check-out.",5,2017,04,12
148,Brilliant central London hotel. Recommend it!,"We stay in London on a regular basis and we so impressed with the new hotel. Ideal location opposite Covent Garden. The rooms are really big! We stayed with my daughter and there was plenty of space. There is a great attention to small details with little extras. The service was very good and the staff were all friendly & accomdodating. 

My only gripes would be:
A) their rooftop bar was closed until April 21st. It is one of the best features about the hotel so that was a shame. I think a discount on a return stay would be a really nice idea. Ie. Sorry you couldn't use the rooftop during this stay but here is something to welcome you back soon to see it in it's full glory. 
B) the breakfast wasn't as good as it needs to be for ¬£30 per head. Children are charged at ¬£24 per head! Most London hotels don't charge for small children. I wouldn't have breakfast in the hotel again as I don't think it is special enough to warrant the charge. For example some of the cooked breakfast wasn't cooked properly and had to be returned, no pancakes or waffles offered, croissants cold. Other hotels do it so much better!",5,2017,04,12
148,Birthday Celebrations,"I had a wonderful stay with my daughter.  Service was impeccable.  Room very comfortable and luxurious.  Double shower magnificent!  I would have liked to have spent more time in the hotel, but we packed two theatre trips into one day.  This hotel was very well located for the theatre, only disappointment was that the Radio Bar was being refurbished and therefore not able to use, but I will definitely be back.",5,2017,04,12
148,Great fancy hotel in Central London,"Great fancy hotel in Central London - very close to Covent Garden, with a good choice of Restaurants and bars within the hotel and the area around. Very clean room and very friendly staff. Gym was well equipped for a hotel and the Radio Rooftop Bar offers a great view over London. Highly recommended.",5,2017,04,12
148,A hyper stylish hotel in London,"The ME Hotel is a very stylish contemporary hotel in London. The rooms are very comfortable and well equipped. The staff are some of the most helpful I have encountered and will go out of their way to help you. We stayed as guests of friends, so we had never heard of this hotel before, but we will be coming back.",5,2017,04,11
148,Very pleased.,"All was excellent. The way we were treated  made us feel  very special, especially  as we were celebrating  our anniversary. The communication before we arrived, checking  our reservations made us feel at ease. We would  definitely  go again. ",5,2017,04,10
148,Service service service,"Stayed for four nights in March and loved every second. The service in the hotel is fantastic, the rooms are massive but the roof top bar is a joke. The view from the bar is fantastic but the service is appalling. I/we went three times and each time it took forever to get service. 

I would definitely go to the hotel again, but I do not recommend the roof top bar if you are used to proper service. ",4,2017,04,10
148,"Lovely stay, great service","My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in April, as an unexpected trip to London to see friends. And the projections in the lobby are so incredible ‚Äì  apparently every night at 8 PM there is a big light show, which I'm sorry to say I missed but I need her to come back and see it again because I love that sort of thing. :-)

I found the service uniformly excellent at the property, and in particular I was very impressed with the hospitality from Luis L in guest relations, and Karen and Liliana at the breakfast service. 

The room itself was excellent‚Ä¶ We stayed in room 404 and it was great. The bathroom was huge, the shower had great water pressure and lots of hot water, and I liked the little built-in desk/vanity mirror. The bed was enormous and the seats were great‚Ä¶ it was hard to get up in the morning. :-) 

You can't beat the location and again, the service was great. I would highly recommend this property for anyone planning a trip to London. ",5,2017,04,10
148,Romantic Weekend Away,"Booked this hotel for my Boyfriends Birthday weekend. The staff were so attentive, polite and welcoming. The hotel was extremely clean and modern and we loved how spacious our room was. 10/10 from us.",5,2017,04,10
148,Fab hotel,"Stayed here for the weekend, really great hotel. Staff are fantastic, rooms are really chic, quiet and comfortable and location is great. Would definitely stay again.
Roof bar was unfortunately shut (on one of hottest weekends in ages!) so that was a bit of a downer but will stay again and hopefully find out what all the fuss is about!",5,2017,04,10
148,Great hotel and service ,"4 of us stayed here this weekend for birthday celebrations. Fantastic hotel, stylish and beautiful. We were disappointed after booking 2 non refundable rooms and then finding out that the Radio rooftop bar was shut when I enquired about it. It was the only reason we picked the hotel in the first place. When I mentioned that I was unhappy via an email, Luis got in touch with me and upgraded our rooms. Nice touch but still disappointing and I think it should have been pointed on before booking. The staff there go above and beyond and if the rooftop bar was open, I would have no complaint!  Thanks to Luis and all the staff there for the treats in the rooms for the birthday people.",4,2017,04,09
148,Trip to london,"My wife and I always stay at me Hotel. This time the staff and room were lovely as ever, and the location could not be better.
Slight issue in room with no milk for coffee but this is nothing major. We were emailed after bookin to say rooftop bar close so we could not use this.
For the first time we had a poor breakfast, cheap hash potatoes,normally big field mushrooms now looked like boiled button mushrooms,over cooked scrambled egg, dry bacon with anaemic fat made worse as all cold with cold coffee( yes I know I should have complained but in hurry and had to eat before journey home.) 
This may seem small but at ¬£60 for 2 it should be spot on, as I have been a Chef for 40 years, the front of house should be probing the food.",3,2017,04,09
148,Fabulous position but a little disappointing ,"My husband booked ME London a couple of months ago as part of my birthday gift, as he knew that I was really keen to visit the Roof Top Bar. Unfortunately about ten days before the trip he received an email that the Bar would be closed for refurbishment.  We felt a little cheated at paying full cost for a hotel and all its facilities when an exclusive part of it would not be available. 

However we were welcomed warmly when we arrived and our room on 9th floor, although small, was bright and clean and had a lovely balcony overlooking the city and river. Sadly when we came back to our room after being at the theatre, our used wine glasses and a bag of rubbish had been left on the floor after the turndown. 

ME is an unusual, modern hotel which has a lot of good things about it (especially its staff) but for the price, doesn't quite come up to the same standard as other London hotels in which we have stayed. ",3,2017,04,07
148,"Outstanding service level, cool vibe, great location,","It was my second time at the ME hotel. Unique hotel, cool atmosphere, great location, room is extremely comfortable, the team is doing everything they can to make your stay amazing and perfect. I got a unique experience when I had a small problem and they compensated me immediately with complimentary breakfast. I stayed with my daughter and we both enjoyed our time there. ",5,2017,04,06
148,50th Birthday Trip,"We have recently visited the hotel for 3 nights my husbands 50th birthday. The hotel is lovely although there is little lighting on the corridors, a great location for bars, restaurants and theatres. Lovely rooftop bar, just a shame some of the bar staff let the place down.",4,2017,04,05

148,Great  hotel,"Upmarket  classy hotel  , staff are excellent  and go the extra mile to assist  with anything you require 
and best off all the rooms are sound proofed so you cant hear any traffic noise  
Wished we had more time to stay  ",5,2017,04,04
148,Another Great Stay at ME,"It was a pleasure to stay at the ME again.  The rooms are spacious, the bed is very large and comfortable.  I slept like a king and was fully restored from my 14 hour flight from Singapore, ready for the day of meetings ahead",5,2017,04,04
148,Great hotel on the Strand!,"I arrived at the ME London driving my rental car in the afternoon and didn't see anywhere to park for the valet... on my second drive around the block, I stopped on the street outside (the hotel is on a bend and I was a little apprehensive about stopping on the corner, but it was ok!) and was met by a staff member who arranged for my luggage to be unloaded and took my car off to be parked.  The charge for valet is cheaper than most places in the area per night, which is great. 
Once inside I went upstairs to check in.  The lovely lady at reception upgraded my room to a balcony for a nominal fee and I went straight up to check it out!  
The large room was on the 9th floor (top of the hotel) with a view of Big Ben. Amazing.  The hotel is very modern, clean and central to everything that you could want.  I highly recommend booking with breakfast as it is wonderful!  
The staff are very friendly and helpful and were always willing to answer questions that I had.
The only thing that some people might find off-putting is that there is a club that is quite loud.  I could hear it from my room until quite late at night, but as I was working, it didn't really bother me as it might others.  
All in all, great place to stay and would highly recommend it to others!",4,2017,04,03
148,Mr & Mrs Hall,"Superb hotel. A true 5 era establishment.

148,Mum and daughter trip,"Checked in to this hotel yesterday for a couple of nights with my daughter and have been nothing but impressed. Staff are all helpful and welcoming. A lovely glass of prossecco at check in and a very welcome bottle of champane and chocolate mouse in our room as we were celebrating an occasion.
Lovely bedding, huge towels, robes, slippers , all worthy of a 5 star hotel. The shower area is amazing and the mood lighting adds a special touch.",5,2017,04,01
148,"Excellent hotel, with a few caveats","The ME London is a first rate hotel, the accommodations are excellent, location is central and very nice, the staff is amazing, and the overall stay of three nights was very good to excellent.  The rooms are designed with style and by people who know what you need in a hotel room.  The toiletries provided were top rate and the bedding was very comfortable.  The lighting is a bit odd, but once you figure it out it's fine.  The staff is always trying to make sure you are happy without being overly attentive.  The maid staff is very nice and clean twice a day.  I had two rooms while at the ME, one on a lower floor facing the theatre district and the other on the 9th floor with a balcony facing the Thames.  If you have a choice, do not stay above the 9th floor facing the river?  Why?  The river side, while pretty, also hosts three main roads and a bridge that expose you to traffic and sirens.  Unfortunately the door to the balcony is not soundproof and the sounds come in easily.  Also, the bar on the roof has a DJ until midnight or 1am and the beat of the bass vibrates into the room.  Alas, I was so tired, these annoyances did not temper my overall impression of the hotel.  It is an excellent place with a great staff and I'd stay there again, just on a different floor facing the other side.",5,2017,04,01
148,Great Hotel for London visit,"This hotel is in a great location. The staff are great and they made some great reservations a very good restaurants. The staff was helpful with directions and suggestions on what do to. They were also very prompt. Full breakfast was worth the money. Also, the breakfast times were perfect.

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,03,30
148,Great Stay,"Stayed here for 1 night in March, everything was great from the prosecco at check in to the chocolate hearts on your pillow at bed time! The rooms are really nice we had one with a balcony with a  great view overlooking London! 
All the staff here are really friendly. Want to thank Karim in security as I left some jewellery behind and soon as I reported it a few days later once I realised it was sent back to me the next day!",5,2017,03,29
148,It's ME for me! ,"I stay here each time I'm in London and am generally very happy with the location, service and staff. Elonora deserves a special shout out as she always goes out of her way to make my stay special.

PROS
- Quirky rooms, interesting lobby, mood lighting, nice toiletries, good location (near covert garden/theatre district)

CONS
- The grumpy guy that mans the reception in the night shift. He is so grumpy! 
- loud rooftop bar (I would avoid rooms on the 8th floor)

148,Birthday treat,"Great hotel in a superb location that never lets you down.
Top service every time we stay.
Radio Bar is a must in the day and by night!
We always stay at this hotel as i feel it has everything to offer.
Keep up the good work.",5,2017,03,28
148,Best service and superb location,From the minute we booked ME London the staff couldn't do enough to help and make our stay a memorable one. Organising transport from Heathrow to birthday breakfast - nothing was a problem. The hotel is in a great location and walking distance to most central London attractions. Modern with beautiful rooms and an amazing rooftop radio bar. Will def be back and recommend anyone staying in London to book this hotel - it's hard if not impossible to beat the welcome and service here !!,5,2017,03,28
148,Fantastic hotel :),"This hotel has everything you need.  Its trendy, the staff are super nice and friendly and the rooms are big and fresh :) 
I stayed here for 4 nights and I only had positive experiences. 

This hotel has that little extra ;) Just coming home from a  night out, and you find pink chocolate hearts on your pillow,  a bottle of water by the bed and slippers by the bed <3 

Absolutely loved it! :D",5,2017,03,28
148,High Design For Low Culture,"Very stylish hotel with modern room touches like mood lighting and funky, walk-in windows, rain shower heads and, shall we say, not-very-soundproof glass bathroom doors. A bewildering array of light switches is a bit confounding when you want to go to bed. And, for a low-rise building at the crossroads of a number of busy streets, you dont hear much street noise. The reception area is very cool, but the ground floor is pretty dead space, nicely designed but with no reason to be there.

It's always a gamble staying in a hotel with a destination bar on the roof: a lot of people who are not staying here are in and out, and if the guests find them too noisy, well, who cares? And this bar, while offering nice views, draws a crowd very different from the hotel guests. It's a clash of culture, but not in a good way. I wish hotels would figure out who their market is and stick to it, not try to be two conflicting businesses for two very different dempgraphics.",4,2017,03,28
148,Me loves ME London ,"This is my 3rd stay with ME London, from its fantastic central location to the little personalised touches in the room, I would not stay anywhere else in London. The team look after you with absolute finesse from the moment you enter the hotel. 
From breakfast to dinner to drinks I have received outstanding service in all areas. It truly is a gem in the heart of London. 
Thank you ME!

148,Another magnificent stay,I was lucky enough to enjoy my 3rd stay in this magnificent hotel. If you want a luxury hotel in the heart of London look no further. It truly is a beautiful hotel and the staff will make you feel very welcome. The Aura team make sure your stay is the best it can be from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. We had breakfast in the hotel and must make a special mention of Anna our server who delivered impeccable customer service. She was absolutely fantastic and really made our stay. Hope you'll pass on our thanks. See you again soon we hope.,5,2017,03,27
148,Excellent stay,"I thank mr Sam Cortez for his help for my booking on 7th march .
I had an amazing stay and the room was so comfortable. The mini bar offering was great - lots of temptations that were impossible to resist. 
I highly recommend this hotel and am looking forward to the next stay. 

",5,2017,03,26
148,Fantastic Hotel!,"I visited ME with my wife for our anniversary. From the start my experience was personal at ME.  I can't say enough about staff and the how they made me feel they had gone the extra mile to make our trip special and memorable! 
As the for the hotel, it's edgy, crisp, clean and modern. Great rooms with quality products! 
Our return is a gaurentee! 
",5,2017,03,26
148,Lovely stay at ME London!,"Had a great stay at for a week in Londontown.  Beautiful, sleek modern hotel with a great location - at the southern  edge of Covent Garden on The Strand - close to everything worth walking to, and to two tube stops, Covent Garden and Temple.  Excellent proximity to great shopping and theatres.  Norman Foster designed exterior and interior. Astonishing check in lobby on the first floor inside a pyramidal light well that goes the full nine stories up to the roof, lined in triangular white onyx, and projected with animated images that slink up the walls (including jellyfish).  Great service from professional and warm staff.

Room
Beautiful black onyx hallways - very dark but atmospheric - lead into bright white minimal, but luxurious rooms.  We booked a mode room and asked for extra space and a bathtub and that is what we got. Beautiful modern room on the seventh floor, large by London standards.  Only minor flaw was that the seventh floor rooms don't have the triangular bay windows that the other rooms have;  ours was a square window that was slightly high for viewing out - faced Covent Garden.  We specified that we would need a tub, so note that if you're booking a Mode room with the huge tub you will have to settle for the smaller window as apparently there are none with the bays in this category.  Was fine for us as the tub and bathroom were amazing.  

Thoughtful and modern interior design with attention to detail - for example the back of the entrance door was all mirror - great for checking yourself before a night on the town and expanded the space of the long entry hall.  The main bedroom area was minimal and modern with white paneled leather walls and a black glass entertainment centre. Amazing food and drink in minibar, local chocolate, chips, cookie bars etc.  The illuminated panels and the changeable colored backlighting were a nice touch and easily worked via touch screen adjacent to the bed.  Beds were low slung, huge and pretty nice but not as plush as we thought, on the firmer side but still very comfortable.  Plenty of outlets with universal adapters incorporated.  We did not see an iPod dock or combo dock alarm clock which was strange.  There were what looked like speakers on the ceiling over the bed but we didn't know how to work them.  There could have been a more detailed explanation of the suite and the electronics in it when we were shown our room. 

The bathroom was super modern, all black back painted glass with white frosted glass accents. Single vanity and huge oversized tub.  Large separate shower and giant rain shower head with great pressure.  The shower interior was all white back painted glass with an onyx accent shelf and it was a beautiful slick space. All the doors were floor to ceiling sliding frosted glass panels which made the space feel larger and taller. 

Restaurants and Bars
We had breakfast at the hotel once and it was ok. It was good but there are so many other options in the area and at ¬£30 per head (we did not include breakfast in our rate) we preferred Balthazar and The Delaunay for fancy and Bill's for cheap and cheerful. Interior design was nice and service was very good.  Did not try STK, having experienced them in both NYC and Miami (ho hum).  Radio bar was good - beautiful space with spectacular 270 degree views of London, ok drinks. For drinks the ground floor Marconi bar was better but without the incredible view.  Amazing cocktails - try the Seve - and good service, but was never buzzy or busy.  Sweeping, curving chrome rod screens were instagram worthy.  

Service 
Overall Excellent.  We were emailed prior to our stay by the Aura team and we had already emailed prior to that for room requests, to let them know that that this was a special occasion trip, and for restaurant inquiries and reservations prior to our stay.   The hotel responded within 24 hours and the concierges did so the same day regarding reservations.  The concierges in particular were amazing and managed to score reservations at Gymkhana and Ting on very very short notice when web reservations indicated they were unavailable.  Ronan was indispensable for information, great for reservations, and wonderful to chat with, amazing Joseph who achieved the reservations at Gymkhana, and Sam and Armand were great all around.  All were very charming and generous with their time and knowledge of the city.  Maid service was excellent and unobtrusive and rooms were super clean (even with all the glass and polished surfaces).  Overall this is a really great design hotel with a fantastic location, large modern thoughtful rooms and warm, wonderful service. We will be back.

148,Loved it,I stayed at this place and it was amazing!!! I will stay here again with no hesitation. For the same amount and sometimes even more I've had smaller crappy rooms. This one was excellent from check in to housekeeping!!!,5,2017,03,25
148,On point,"My fianc√© and I stayed at the Melia for 2 nights and had the best experience, every aspect of the hotel was on point, the staff couldnt have been more helpful, the food was fantastic, rooms were clean and modern.We will definitely be returning. ",5,2017,03,22
148,Fastastic hotel.,"Fantastic experience. Definitively come back!!!! Great location. Rooms incredibly insulated against road noise! 
Little bit pricey. Bed very comfortable. Breakfast was great. Spanish paper to choose from",5,2017,03,22
148,Unbeleivable!,"I cannot fault this hotel, they went all out, decorated the room and looked after us from start to finish. My fianc√© and I were there celebrating his birthday.

Simona was AMAZING and we are already planning our next visit! 

",5,2017,03,22
148,21st birthday celebration for my daughter,"from the time of booking through to check out the staff could not have been more lovely, a surprise chocolate mousse and a bottle of fizz on arrival was such a thoughtful touch. An amzing building in a great location we will be back.",5,2017,03,22
148,Stunning hotel,"Booked for a trip  to the ROH to see Sleeping Beauty and needed  a hotel. What a hotel to choose. The pictures are great but the hotel is stunning. Could not have made a better choice 5* plus. The welcome, staff and upgraded room superb, could not ask for better, and not forgetting a glass of prosecco at check in.
We also had dinner in STK restaurant and both had a fantastic steak. Breakfast was also first class. I'm looking for another London show so we can come back. Thank you all at ME London.",5,2017,03,21
148,Great Stay at a Unique Hotel,"Stayed at ME London on Wednesday last week.  I was greeted at the hotel and made to feel very comfortable.  There is wifi throughout the hotel, so even if your room is not ready there is a comfortable lounge to wait and be able to connect.  The check in process was very fast and the area is fabulous. There are projections on the wall that are great to watch - sounds odd but it is wonderful to watch. The room was nice and functional. This is a hotel that is not cookie cutter and I had  a great stay.",5,2017,03,20
148,Great Night Out," Top drawer Hotel. First Class service, spotlessly clean, staff very helpful and totally professional. Roof bar fantastic place to be, both at lunch time and in the evening, great food, great music great views. Faultless.",5,2017,03,20
148,Ridiculously Good Hotel - Would recommend to anyone!!!,"Overall amazing stay, booked up for Ibiza hotel whilst we was staying there in London, can't wait to go back if we get the chance. Experience was amazing and staff were fantastic. Made to feel very special as it was my girlfriends birthday. Very convenient for all surrounding night life and things to do. STK was amazing and we finished off at the amazing Radio Rooftop - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING",5,2017,03,20
148,Valentines Day,"Stayed here with my boyfriend for Valentines Day. We got to the room and it was rather on the smaller side which was a bit of a shame. The service is excellent at the hotel and we were offered prosecco on arrival. Once we headed out we realised our bedroom door wouldnt lock when it close. We informed the hotel and they had someone come and fix it straight away. As we were in a rush we did have to trust them to keep our valuable safe.

The hotel is extremely accommodating and were able to book us into the rooftop bar in the evening, even though it was extremely busy. The drinks are pricey but the views and atmosphere is excellent.The inside of the hotel is rather dark and 'moody' but is designed in a really interesting way. It's completely different to any hotel I've been to - in a good way.

Would recommend if you are looking for something central, with good restaurants and bars in the hotel.",4,2017,03,19
148,Hotel that has the wow factor ,"Booked this for a joint birthday for myself and husband. I contacted the hotel before hand and they arranged for some treats to be in the room. When we arrived we were greeted with a glass of prosecco and personally shown to our room. Luis who was our host had arranged for some chilled champagne and 2 chocolate desserts, lovely touch. The room was fabulous, the beds super comfortable, technology was great and bathroom was fabulous. 

We ate out but came back to experience the rooftop bar and it didn't disappoint, great views of London. 

Will definitely come back at some point as it was a great experience as well as being in a great location. 

Thank you ME London!",5,2017,03,19
148,Great Hotel - great location - great vibe...,"Stayed for Valentines day and only just got round to writing a review....still very well remembered and would love to come back.

We stayed in a passion suite which was amazing!! great decor, very stylish, bed was really good, shower powerful, bath big enough swim in!! 

We had a small issue with the in room media hub (it broke) but the response to fix it was superb from the hotel staff - we actually declined to have it fixed whilst there as did not want to get in the way of our precious time together.....however, we where offered another room (we declined) they sent champange for the inconvenience and gave a very generous reduction on our room rate as further compensation!! very impressed and speaks volumes on how to deal with problems!!

The Hotel offers an incredible Vibe - this is apparent as soon as you walk in the door and directed to the reception at first floor - the interior design of the hotel is super modern and very well done....the lighting is very moody, some may say to dark but thats the point!! it pours on the ambience in bucket loads - the visual spectacular when you get to reception is mind blowing!! instant smile, all other thoughts gone from the mind and a glass of bubbles placed in your hand - perfect!!

We had a drink in the STK restaurant - actually, quite a few!! the cocktails are very good and the bar staff making them are really friendly and helpful when choosing!! we went for dinner elsewhere as we never made reservations - the staff did move things around so we could have a table which was amazing considering they where full and it was valentines day but we made other arrangements....disappointed that we didn't eat at STK but next time....

In short this hotel takes some beating!! the shard was top of my list but this has nudged it into second place....Next time we stay here we are not leaving the hotel!! we are going to eat at STK go to the rooftop bar (we never did it this time either!!! schoolboy error again) and enjoy everything ME has to offer...

Final point which I should have mentioned earlier....THE STAFF - they are all brilliant!! so friendly, helpful, courteous, professional - always said hello and nothing a problem...

Thanks ME - see you soon... ",5,2017,03,17
148,Radio Rooftop Bar,"I attended ME London for dinner at STK and Radio Rooftop Bar which was amazing. This was for my birthday night out, I am from Glasgow and booked both prior. Radio Rooftop does the best cocktails and a great atmosphere. I went with my boyfriend and had such a great time. The service was world class, we got a welcoming introduction and as we reserved a seat we had table service. 

My partner left his jacket and we flew home the next day, I emailed the bar and the security confirmed they had the jacket and posted it out. The communication from Stefano made this process easy.

Overall the bar has great music, a lovely view over London and is very clean. 

When I am back in London I will definetly be back. I cannot recommend it enough.",5,2017,03,15
148,Unique,"Super cool hotel. 
Loved the vibe - checking in is an experience in itself . Beautiful reception area ( wont give the game away about the space ) - offered drinks etc at check in to make it all the more comfortable. Room was clean and bed very comfortable. Only downside - there was a great coffee maker in the room but NO tea. Had to ask at reception. Great location . Staff were really great. Rooftop bar is great - lovely views from outside area. Sofas and heating lamps if cold. Music as well. Will be going back.",5,2017,03,15
148,Stunning modern London hotel,"This was my first stay at ME, London and it definitely will not be my last. The room and the hotel interior are incredible. The in room dining was awesome, I ordered their breakfast at midnight when I was feeling peckish and was absolutely floored; this is hands down one of the best breakfasts I've ever had and not a ""hotel breakfast."" 

There simply isn't another 5 star modern hotel in London, in a great central location such as Strand (literally minutes on foot from Covent Garden and other hot spots), that can compete with ME at this price range.

This is a must visit/must try for anyone celebrating a special occasion, such as couples for an anniversary/birthday etc.",5,2017,03,15
148,Accommodating Reservations Manager,"I'm the booking manager for my company and Reservations Manager Ray Garcia was able to assist with my reservations without any issues.

148,Londons Best Kept Secret,"Hotel is gorgeous! Ultra modern and ultra clean! I stayed in theVibe room, which was spacious and had top notch facilities. Loved the mood lighting and the surround sound system.
Room service was great - truly 5 stars! 
The staff are the icing on the cake - polite, helpful and super friendly! 
Rooftop bar is fun and has beautiful views of London and the most comfy lounging areas! My fav hotel in London! ",5,2017,03,14
148,Fabulous stay,"My wife and I spent one night at ME London to celebrate my wife's birthday. We arrived early at the hotel and was able to check in. The staff had gone to a lot of effort to make my wife's birthday special , with champagne, cake and a lovely birthday message on the mirror. The reception staff were very friendly and informative about the hotel. We had a lovely spacious room which was immaculate and well thought out. The bed was extremely comfortable, we had such a good nights sleep and the really good quality bed linen and towels made all the difference. The staff throughout the hotel were friendly in particular the housekeeping staff who always greeted us with a smile and a hello. I was impressed with the quality and service of this hotel and would definitely stay again.",5,2017,03,13
148,Fantastic,The staff were brilliant . Room out of this world I just felt special from the time we booked in to the time with left . I have stayed in Hotels in New York and Vegas and I can honestly state that the Me Hotel is very special indeed . Have booked for New Year's Eve as I was so impressed . Have never had such a fantastic stay,5,2017,03,13
148,"Great hotel, great location ","Loved this hotel, great location. 
The staff couldn't be more helpful. 
I used the lobby area for several meetings it's perfect central enough and private enough.  The roof bar is to be experienced on a summers evening but gets very busy so need to book. ",5,2017,03,13
148,Superb Customer Service!,"My Partner and I stayed at this hotel for my birthday celebrations. From booking until arriving home after our stay, we received service that went above and beyond. 

We travel to London quite regularly and have stayed in many 5star hotels including The Mayfair, Shangri-La and The Hari but none have compared to the service we received at the ME hotel.

After booking, we received emails from Luis as a point of contact in case we needed anything prior to our stay. Emails were prompt and friendly, even letting us know of road closures that may have affected us during our stay. These emails couldn't have been more helpful, from enquiring the reason for our stay to making dinner reservations for us. 

When arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with a glass of prosecco and shown to our room. Waiting in the room was a bottle of champagne, birthday cake and a greeting message on the mirror. As well as the room being gorgeous these small touches added to the stay. 

Another plus point for my partner was the car parking facility they have, They valet park your car within the hotel in the basement with generous size spaces (my partner saw this as I left some belongings in the car that he went to fetch!) Most hotels in London charge a fortune to valet park your car in a NCP or similar which can be miles away from the hotel. 

When arriving home after our stay we were emailed to see how our stay was. Responding that we had a fabulous time I also mentioned that we had gone to the Radio bar for drinks and then brunch during our stay. I expressed that it didn't meet the excellent service the hotel offered and mentioned the issues we had. This didn't spoil our stay, however, I just thought I would mention as feedback. I also enquired about how long the points from our stay would take to show on my melia rewards account. I was emailed back promptly by the general manager with apologies about the Radio Bar and for the opportunity to correct this when we stay with them next. Also, they manually put the points onto my account which appeared the next day instead of it taking the usual two weeks. 

Overall, the hotel is gorgeous and the location is perfect, especially if you have booked to see a show. However, I believe what stands out most about this hotel is the service they offer. We will definitely be returning to this hotel for our next trip to London!",5,2017,03,13
148,Trendy and stylish,"A very well placed hotel for central London.  Reception on arrival through a black designer hallway leading to a minimalist space with a few sofas. Efficient check in with Wine  offered.  The whole,hotel is black and silver in design whilst the rooms white. Good sized superior room with comfortable bed and good sized bathroom with a shower only.  Coffee in the room with NO tea making facilities . Had to phone for this and it took 2 calls to get if delivered which is not good enough in a 5 star hotel. It's great fun to stay in once you work out the lifts which serve different floors.  Extra gifts were made available for this birthday stay which was appreciated . Would stay again",4,2017,03,13
148,Birthday celebrations ,"Thank you so much to the me hotel for such an amazing weekend . From check in to check out the staff were so friendly . The rooms were amazing and every little detail was taken care of. We had water champagne balloons and cake awaiting us in our room as a lovely birthday surprise from the hotel. We dined in stk which was also lovely, as was the Marconi lounge for cocktails . Will certainly be back. This hotel really knows how to stand out . Thank you so much ",5,2017,03,12
148,Birthday Weekend,"Stayed from 3.3.17 to 5.3.17 to celebrate a birthday. Had another excellent stay and staff remembered us from our previous stay. Easy check in with glass of nice fizz. Had a Mode room with view over towards Novello Theatre. Excellent room with bottle of champagne waiting in the room and a birthday message. Found all the staff excellent throughout from check in, to Radio Bar and especially the downstairs Marconi Bar. Will definitely be back later in the year and would highly recommend.",5,2017,03,09
148,The most wonderful service I can't wait to come back!! ,"My fianc√© and I stayed this weekend we arrived on the Friday night had the best service from the hotel, stk and the radio bar. We loved it so much we stayed an additional night!! I cannot wait to come back we had a really special time. It will b seriously hard to beat the service we received this weekend. The hotel was lovely mini bar was filled fully stacked with goodies, in room dining was delicious and the restaurant just fabulous, many thanks for the fab experience ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2017,03,08
148,Husbands 65th Birthday,"Had a great time in the hotel.  It was my husbands 65th birthday and a surprise weekend away. From  the minute we arrived at the hotel, we were made feel very welcome.and pampered.  Glass of prosecco on arrival, very nice touch, relaxed immediately. All staff very polite and helpful, but have to single out Simona Casula who was so nice and friendly to us at arrival area.  She brought us to our room and had a surprise for us there, which was greatly appreciated.  Also, loved roof top bar.  Breakfast served to us, not usual buffet, excellent.",5,2017,03,07
148,Beautiful Hotel with lovely reception staff,"We stayed at the ME Hotel for my mum‚Äôs 60th, the hotel staff and reception staff were lovely and extremely helpful. They checked us into two rooms which were upgraded and had a connecting door to each other. 
The rooms are stylish & comfortable! We were looked after very well by hotel staff, they were friendly and welcoming!
The only faults that I have is the service on the tables at the Radio Roof Bar are terrible! It took so long to get noticed that we ended up just giving up in the end and leaving! The other issue was the price of breakfast is extortionate. It is ¬£20 per head for continental and ¬£30 per head for hot breakfast, taking in to consideration what we ate off the breakfast buffet (a bowl of cereal and a small hot breakfast) it was far too overpriced!
I would stay at the hotel again but will not be visiting the Radio Roof bar or eating breakfast at the hotel again. 
",4,2017,03,07
148,Stunning interior,"We were booked in for two nights. Stunning modern interior. Glass of prosecco on arrival. Rooms was clean and lovely.  We had a car which was valet parked, However we managed to book this separately from the hotel at a fraction of the price the hotel would have charged. Staff were very helpful. The rooftop bar is worth a visit for the views however expensive even for London pricing.",5,2017,03,06
148,Birthday Vacation,"Stayed at ME for my husband's birthday. This hotel is in a great location, just a minute walk to the gorgeous Covent Gardens.

The service was excellent. The concierge helped arrange all our dinners and a complementary bottle of champagne and birthday cake. It was set up in our room after our day out and my husband was more than surprised! 

Rooms are very modern and clean. Our one complaint would be that the hotel keeps the lights very dimmed in the hallways and it feels a bit desolate. They could brighten it just a little so it feels more welcoming.

Overall excellent experience.",4,2017,03,06
148,Wow!! What a great Hotel!,"What an amazing hotel! Stayed for two nights in one of their 'Passion Suites', looked out at the front of the property, straight down The Strand! Very minimalist, no artwork on any of the walls in the rooms, so to fully appreciate this Hotel you really have to like modern, clean lines. If you do this place will undoubtably wow you.
Amazing customer service from start to finish! Charming guy took our cases from the taxi, we were shown to the Reception on the first floor, and given a lovely glass of Prosecco whilst checking in. Extremely friendly and efficient reception team which set us up for a great stay. Extremely comfortable beds and pillows, which made for a great nights sleep too!
The 'Aura' concierge made our reservations at Radio Rooftop, the hotels rooftop bar, and throughout the trip called to check all was good, which it most certainly was!
This was a totally different experience to most of the Hotels we have stayed in London before, very funky, modern, chic, and we had a great time!! Our sincere thanks to all the staff that looked after us so very well.
Anything to complain about, not really, but if I was to be super picky, just two very minor things.....didn't like the room toiletries, all based on honey which I really dislike the smell of, but this is a personal thing. Second, whilst we had tea making facilities in the room together with a Negressco Coffee maker, there was no milk in the fridge. I did say these were very minor points!
Overall, a wonderful experience for a couple of nights in a great area that is Covent Garden, thank you!",5,2017,03,05
148,Another fantastic stay at a 5 star London hotel. ,"Stayed in a Mode room at this great hotel. As always the team at Melia go out of their way to ensure your stay is memorable and hassle free. I was lucky enough this time to be presented with a lovely bottle of champagne and macaroons. 

The whole experience with Melia from the minute you enter the hotel to checkout is both professional and friendly. If you want a hotel in London that has amazing architecture, an ultra modern feel and luxury at its best, this is the hotel for you. 

Thank you Melia.

148,Best modern hotel to stay in central London,Simply a great experience - have stayed twice and both times memorable not stuffy like so many top hotels in town . Well located for theatres and West End shopping and restaurants - couldn't recommend it more .,5,2017,02,28
148,Looking forward to returning soon. ,We have an upcoming reservation here in a few weeks. We stayed here twice before. It's a great 5* hotel in a perfect location for Covent Garden and very much looking forward to returning for drinks at the roof bar!,5,2017,02,28
148,FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY,"From the moment you enter this hotel you can see luxury.
It's the most modern even ahead of its time looking hotel I've ever stopped in.
Yes it's not cheap but it sure is worth every penny
We stopped on the 8th floor and paid extra for a balcony and the view was outstanding only to get better at night.
The top floor at night turns into a party with Dj playing great music and such a great atmosphere.
Rooms are very spacious again very modern and very comfy bed .
I will go to this hotel again for sure.",5,2017,02,27
148," Modern trendy hotel",Spent two nights there over a weekend. Trendy lobby. Need to take elevators to lobby where they serve you a glass or Proseco as you wait. Smooth checkin. Clean modern room with view overlooking the street in Coventry garden not the Strand. Ask for room not facing the Strand as it's a very busy thoroughfare.  My room was clean comfortable only negative is the desk ahead a bit small to work but it's really not a business mans work hotel. Everything else was good especially the brunch,5,2017,02,27
148,Brilliant!,"Hotel is just lovely, great location, all the staff were fantastic there was nothing too much for them to do. We stayed in the urban terrace and it was just perfect. Will definitely return. 

We sadly didn't have the greatest experience at STK, however, the hotel staff sorted it out just brilliantly.",5,2017,02,26
148,Birthday weekend,"Booked the ME for a special birthday weekend away, prior to the arrival I was contacted by guest services to see if they could help with anything and I mentioned it was my partners birthday. They offered to do something special with the room.
Arrived and checked in - luggage was taken off us in the lobby and then magically arrived in our room! Reception on the first floor was extremely lush, very helpful staff and welcoming with a lovely glass of fizz, the room was an aura room and there was a free bottle of champagne and small cake with a candle in! Very thoughtful. We didn't eat in the hotel, went out for dinner and to the theatre and booked a table for 10pm in the rooftop bar. Arrived back after the theatre and met friends in the rooftop bar. The rooftop bar has fantastic views over London, however unless you want a 'TOWIE' experience or footballers wife's then I would give it a miss! Perhaps I'm just aging, but it felt like we were in a club. The service wasn't great so we left and went to a local bar. 
Overall, a fantastic hotel, luxurious rooms, excellent staff - but the bar let it down. I wouldn't definately visit again but would avoid the bar!",4,2017,02,26
148,Night iut,"We booked to stay here as part of a pre arranged show booked for the following day....

Hotel staff are polite and helpful, the rooms are expensive but decent.... location is great.

Breakfast was lovely and very reasonable times.

We will use hotel me again probably next month.",4,2017,02,25
148,Ultra Modern Luxury,"We were booked into the Chic Suite and when we arrived were upgraded to the Passion Suite.. Beautiful and large suite. The staff are so friendly, the food is impeccable. The only thing is, on the website it states :
-playStation & a selection of games ready for playing - This was nowhere to be found.
-Bathrobes and slippers - Nowhere to be found. 
-Some of the lights didn't work, the bulbs were blown I assume. 
-Couldnt get to the rooftop bar because it was fully booked was told that I need to call 24 hours before to book a table. 
-Asked to Check in early and late but was told that wasn't guaranteed and then never heard anything after that.  

We spent some time in the marconi bar and the bartender was quite abrasive, didnt seem like he was too friendly. 

However with that being said it is a beautiful hotel and I will return but I just hope when I do the things I listed would be fixed.",5,2017,02,25
148,Overall very good,"Very modern clean hotel. Service good, room good and Radio bar very good. Did not eat in the hotel as it was expensive. Check in area was very impressive and a nice touch with being offered a glass of wine whilst checking in. Would go back. ",4,2017,02,25
148,5* In Every Way First Class,"We stayed here which was truly Amazing, very spoiled, food perfect, try the Roof Bar lovely views.

Set within the Strand and easy to get to the Theatre and Shopping, Clubs.

River trips, the Palace and Odeon Leicester Sqare, just Perfect we will be back.",5,2017,02,24
148,ME London,"My experience at ME London was fatastic. I visited London last week and I stayed at ME London. The Hotel is a piece of art and the employees are friendly and so helpful. They have two things though. The concierge service is good but the worker need to be more relaxed and smile more. The second thing, I think the price is little bit high. ",5,2017,02,23
148,My favourite,"This hotel from the minute you step through the doors oozes style, I love the modern look and style and the reception atrium is one of the most incredible spaces to stand in. Rooms are very comfortable and well appointed with an excellent mini bar if you have arrived late. This is my favourite hotel in London and I always try and use it if I am able.",5,2017,02,22
148,Conference & business meeting,"Stylisch Hotel in the city of London.
Friendly service, impressive reception ""seperated"" in the first floor. Bar at groundlevel and skylounge are well equipped for spirits, lesser for beer (one Japanese, one other - no tab and UK)
Rooms are stylish and very comfortable - shower is massive and lighting invites to feel good. Overnight and drinks are ""London priced"".",4,2017,02,22
148,A few issues  :( ,"Having stayed at the ME a couple of years ago and happy to give a glowing review I was very excited to return with my daughters . The trip was for my 50th Birthday and initially on checkin we were very impressed by the upgrade offered for my daughters room - to the same level as our booking - unexpected and appreciated - I also have to say that the champagne and birthday dessert in our room was a kind gesture.  We first went to our daughters room and loved the view from the balcony, they had a bottle of champagne in their room veuve clicquot ( this should have been a surprise gift in our room from my daughter, so a bit of a mix up and the edge taken off for her gift to us) we then went to our room and the smell of cigarette smoke was overpowering - quite disgusting and there was no way we could have stayed let alone sleep in the room .  We went back down to reception and within an hour or so we were shown to a new room so the problem was resolved .  Dinner in steak was fabulous and great service , breakfast buffet  was good, 1st trip up to Radio bar no problems but on our third night we were told we weren't guests by a very rude girl and she made it clear she didn't think we should have access to the bar - only when I insisted we were guests by showing my room card and my daughters had shown their id did another bouncer step in apologise and allow us up to the bar ! Couldn't believe how rude she was with no reason at all to have an attitude .  
I should also mention that on the first night my daughter had to go down to reception twice as there was a real noise issue with the door to their room, it kept banging and sounded like someone was trying to open the door - the reason she had to go to reception - the phone in the room didn't work ( this was fixed the next day) so not much sleep for the girls in the first night üò¥üò¥the hotel reported that she had a noisy neighbour and this was the issue ??
So in summary, yes the hotel has a wow factor but our visit was let down by the detail - why didn't someone smell the smoke when the room was cleaned, mix up with champagne to room, phones not working, arrogant staff at lift to radio bar, small things make the difference between an ok visit and a great visit .  We love Melia as a brand and are Gold members of their loyalty program, I hate to say this because my gorgeous husband had arranged the whole trip but the issues we experienced took the shine off the trip - a real shame. ",3,2017,02,21
148,Exceptional! ,Exceptional staff/service. Best hotel within this area by far. Complimentary champagne and macaroons on arrival. Cannot compliment the staff enough. Will certainly be returning when next staying in the city! ,5,2017,02,21
148,ME review,A very comfortable hotel with friendly staff in an excellent area. Very quiet room with a nice view. A lot of attention to detail in the rooms. Reception friendly and helpful. Very close to all the theatres and shoes ,4,2017,02,21
148,Very modern and lovely hotel ,"I stayed at the ME London for a week and it was great. The location is good close to Covent gardens, and talking distance to many good restaurants. The rooftop bar is one of the best in the city, a must go on a Sunday. ",5,2017,02,18
148,Brilliant location amazing room,Stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary and emailed ahead to let them know. They kindly decorated the mirror and left champagne and chocolates in the room. Room was very smart and stylish and very comfy. Would highly recommend breakfast in room as the service was bang on time and very tasty with a full English and croissants and roast. Central location with bars and theaters within easy walking distance. Will definatley be going back. Thanks for making our wedding anniversary even more special and keep up the high standards ,5,2017,02,16
148,disappointed,Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel rooms are over priced and on my stay room was filthy. Dust in bedroom and shower and toilet area wasn't clean. Car Parking was expensive aswell. Stay in a lot of hotels in London and would return sadly this one I wouldn't ,2,2017,02,16
148,Superb hotel and situation,"A wonderful hotel with a great location, the staff are extremely well trained, courteous, friendly and professional. The hotel has a great restaurant that combines excellent food served within a fun relaxed enviroment, the Radio bar is also very good.",5,2017,02,16
148,Great stay with outstanding service,"My wife and I stayed here for her 30th birthday trip to London. The staff decorated the mirror with a birthday message and provided a comp bottle of champagne to the room which was a nice touch. The check in area is awesome and has its own light show. We were offered Prosecco while we sat back and watched the projections light up the walls. Great stay, lovely hotel and excellent customer service!! ",5,2017,02,15
148,Birthday treat,"Another fabulous stay at the ME London. This hotel really does have it all. We stayed 4 nights on this occasion with friends joining us for 3 of those nights. Ambience, facilities and service exemplary.",5,2017,02,15
148,Mrs Hopkins,My husband and I stayed here for our Valentine's break away from the children and home.. we could not fault one single thing with the hotel it was simply amazing.. staff were so efficient and made you feel like celebrity's and the hotel is beautiful all through! Only downside.. was that we couldn't stay longer!! ,5,2017,02,15
148,ME Hotel Hits Home Runs in Every Catagory,"One of the most amazing properties in London! The attention to Detail is amazing. 
Perfectly located. 
An additional plus was having Radio-the Night Club on top of us. 
Looking forward to going back again and again.",5,2017,02,13
148,"Amazing, birthday celebration with upgrade champagne and cake","Booked this for my wife's birthday as a treat, fantastic modern hotel, stunning uniquely designed building probably used for fashion shoots etc. Terrific customer service from booking onward, emailed about arrival etc, at least 5 breakfast options, 3 in room, had excellent breakfast on ground floor. Residents get guaranteed entrance to the Radio rooftop bar which is an experience in itself. We enjoyed an excellent Champagne in our room greeting us next to a birthday cake, highly recommended for all except people living in the past since this is an ultra-modern standout raising the bar in 5-star expectations",5,2017,02,13
148,Great place to stay in London,"We often stay in London if seeing a show and make a weekend of it. ME London is a very smart hotel. Amazing service from check in all the way through the weekend. We had a Chic Suite and it was really great. So many nice touches and we really enjoyed our stay. As we are in the older category of guest we went to Radio rooftop bar before dinner and then to STK restaurant. All very swanky and smart although STK did get incredibly loud and not sure they need a DJ, but as I said we were probably in the older category of clientele. Nevertheless our weekend stay at ME London was great and would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,02,13
148,Birthday supprise,"Booked this hotel for a trip to london for a theatre show to celebrate my partners birthday.

I was contacted before we arrived by the hotel Sergio (hotel reservation agent) and Maria from the aura team who helped me arrange the birthday supprise.

When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted at reception with a lovely glass of prosecco and were shown to our room by a lovely lady from the aura team ( im so sorry i cant remember your name but i will not forget your wonderful treatment). We had been given an upgrade to a vibe room with a complimentary bottle of champagne and a little chocolate mousse cake to celibrate the birthday. A beautiful supprise and a lovely start to our stay.

The hotel is beautiful, the staff very friendly kind and curtious. We visited the radio bar on the roof with wonderful views over London and STK bar.

My partner and i were delighted with every aspect of our stay in this delightful hotel and i would like to pass on a heart felt thank you to every member of staff who work so hard to make this hotel special and a place we would live to go back too.

THANK YOU and see you again soon
Stan & Frances",5,2017,02,13
148,AMAZING STAY!!!!!,"I booked a one night stay for my girlfriends birthday. From the minute It was booked, the hotel team were in contact to make sure everything was perfect for our trip. 
Luis Lopez, the Aura Host was fantastic and really looked after us. From start to finish, parking right outside the hotel and having them take my car away, zero fuss for the busy streets of london, just what you needed. Prosecco on arrival in reception, the personalised birthday message on the mirror, rose petals and champagne in the room waiting for us, it was simply the best hotel experience i have ever had. EVERY member of staff wishing my girlfriend a happy birthday was a particularly nice touch, they truly went above and beyond for us.
I also wanted to book reservations at STK and Radio Bar however I was told directly that they were both busy. Luis Lopez somehow managed secure a table and access to the Radio Bar that night for us which, I couldn't thank him enough for. He made our stay go from 10/10 to 1000/10!! he was amazing and so helpful and personal. 

I would recommend this hotel to absolutely anyone and everyone, I will 100% be coming back here to stay.",5,2017,02,13
148,Very overrated ,"The hotel on its own is very nice and stylish, but... from a 5 star hotel I would expect more... There wasn't even complimentary bottle of water!!!  the reception staff didn't give any information where is gym or spa, not really helpful, bit disappointed to be honest. Won't be staying again.",2,2017,02,11
148,Wonderful,"Wonderful stay!! 
Even before arriving the reception was perfect.
Great attention and courtesy from the staff.
Beautiful hotel with a modern and sophisticated style.
A Roof Top like few in London, not only for the view but also for cocktails, the atmosphere and the music.",5,2017,02,10
148,"Cool vibe, great staff, fabulous stay","I have passed by this hotel many times but this was my first stay. In the midst of a city filled with historic and grand lobbies, this place to immediately projects it's cool, hip vibe. The staff was very welcoming and efficient. Offered  champagne on arrival. My room - though not the high end of their offerings - was nicely sized and extremely comfortably appointed. Bed and linens divine. Shower room brightly lit with large walk in rain shower. Rich amenities kits including a gentle foamy face wash and cleanser. The most tempting mini bar. Any request of the staff was handled promptly and warmly. 

Location is terrific for theater, Covent Garden or a late night stroll over Waterloo bridge. 

Highly recommend the ME in London. I will be back!",5,2017,02,10
148,Fabulous Hotel,"8th floor room with outside terrace and views looking South towards Canary Wharf, The Shard and the London Wheel. The perfect hotel room. A Norman Foster & Assoc. designed building which accounts for its fantastic appearance. ",5,2017,02,09
148,Good times good drink,Service was fantastic. Hotel more wow than the room itself and the resturant style and atmosphere was better than the food. But both still good. One of the best day/nights for a while would definitely return,5,2017,02,08
148,Fabulous!!!,"Right from walking into ME to when we left we could not have had better service!!
There was quite a few of us there to celebrate a birthday and we ee looked after superbly- we visited the Radio roof bar and eat in STK where we had outstanding service - great food and atmosphere!!
We will return!! 
Has also made us think to look at Amelia hotels in different locations ",5,2017,02,08
148,Perfect! ,This is our 3rd and longest stay in ME london. I love the location because it's so central! You can walk to trafalgar Covent Garden or Leicester Square. Staff are friendly and helpful and as always the rooms are fab and roomy! I had breakfast at Cucina for the 1st time and it didn't disappoint! I got treated to a bottle of champagne for me birthday which was very sweet! What can I say? We love ME london.  ,5,2017,02,07
148,Very trendy boutique hotel in a fantastic location,"The corridor is dark and when I opened the door the room was entirely white!  Room service  and food was great.

The bed was slightly hard for me.  There was plenty of space in the room. Two sinks in my 'bathroom' and space for makeup.  
",4,2017,02,06
148,Fantastic service and beautiful hotel ,"Can not fault this place, amazing service would definitely recommend and definitely be back again!! From check in to check out everything 5 üåü thank you to me London team, especially Sergio at reservation and luis from aura team, we came for a birthday celebration and everything was perfect.
",5,2017,02,05
148,Fantastic!!!!!,"Now where do we start....
this hotel we passed by back in august last year, and were very impressed by the look of the downstairs entrance and bar.
Decide to book for 1 night to attend a wine tasting, how amazing from the arrival to check out all very smooth and friendly.
we will most definitely go back many more times.
Thank you",5,2017,02,01
148,Another great stay at the ME london,This was the 3rd time we have stayed here and we receive the high level of service everything from the Aura team who are more than happy to personalize your stay to however you wish. The team have also helped me create the perfect engagement surprise which couldn't have gone any better.,4,2017,02,01
148,Great Location with Amazing Staff,"Approximately one week prior to our trip to London, we were contacted via email by the hotel staff to ensure that we had transportation from Heathrow to the hotel. Since we had not arranged transportation, they did that for us. I've never had a hotel in the US do that. We were greeted at Heathrow by the driver who was fabulous. Along the way to the hotel, he pointed out much of the surroundings in London. Upon arrival at the hotel, the staff greeted us and assisted us to check in and to our room. Throughout our stay, the staff was amazing. The rooms are very nice. They are equipped with electrical outlets from several countries; however, the only problem is that the US outlet was 240 volt. As a result, the hotel  provided me with a conversion plug from UK to US 110 volt that I was allowed to use during our entire stay. The hotel has a restaurant and bar on the 8th floor that provides an amazing view of the city. Guests are permitted to go to the restaurant simply to check out the view if they do not want to eat or have a drink. 

The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic. Harrods is a short 2 mile walk from the hotel, Big Ben, Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, and China town are less than 1/2 mile away, St. Paul's Cathedral, London Tower, Camden are all approximately 2 miles away. We love to walk so we walked everywhere. 

I can't say enough positive things about this hotel. Every hotel employee was friendly and accommodating. We will definitely return to this hotel in the future.",5,2017,01,31
148,Post Christmas get together,"Fantastic experience in what is undoubtedly one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, The level of professionalism from all the staff was second to none, coupled with a incredibly well designed hotel made it a real treat to stay in.",5,2017,01,31
148,superior service,"All employees were extremely friendly, helpful, attentive, but not overbearing.  It appears that this hotel has extensive customer service training that pays off with the customer experience.  Although, many guests were present during the week we stayed, several employees would even acknowledge us by name.  As an unheard of gesture, after we had checked out we received an email offering for our daughter, staying behind in London for school to drop by if she ever needed anything.  
",5,2017,01,31
148,Very modern,"I enjoyed my stay here on business, pleasant change from the commuter hotels I usually have to stay in. The rooms and facilities are uber modern, bathrooms are spacious and exceptionally clean. Would be a nice place for a weekend away with the hubby. The bar upstairs has nice views and staff were very pleasant. ",4,2017,01,30
148,Amazing Hotel,"I went to see a Banksy exhibition here and the facilities are second to none which you'd absolutely expect  for a central London location, situated right next the west end it's absolutely perfect if you're attending a show, it's pricey but if your after luxury for one weekend its well worth a visit.",5,2017,01,29
148,Fantastic and personalised stay!,"My beautiful girlfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary at ME London. Much to our surprise, we were greeted on arrival with Prosecco, and the hotel upgraded our room!  When we arrived in the room, there was a bottle of champagne and cake, as well as a quote about love written on our bathroom mirror - it made our anniversary celebration even more special.  

The staff was fantastic, and the receptionist (who was from Rome) gave us a great recommendation for a local Italian restaurant - we also exchanged email addresses and she's offered to help plan our trip to Rome in March!  We can't begin to say enough great things about ME London - thanks for making our stay so great!",5,2017,01,29
148,Fantastic,"Visiting London and staying at ME was a great experience for us. 

The room was of an incredibly high standard, we had a balcony riverside so could appreciate the view across the city. 

Simona and the team set the tone for our stay by supplying flowers and champagne and leaving some nice messages for us in the room.

Service was first-class and discreet.

I would definitely stay again.",5,2017,01,29
148,Very Convenient,This is a very modern hotel  being well situated  for West End Theatre and Dining. The staff were polite attentive and efficient and our room was well appointed and very comfortable. The pricing was representative of this type of hotel in London. As it was my wife's birthday the hotels we choose on this occasion are key to the success of the event and ME didn't disappoint.,4,2017,01,29
148,Amazing!!!!,"I want to personally thank Maria and Aura Team for making our visit incredible! Little did I know my boyfriend was proposing to me and these guys helped him by making the room look fantastic! Maria was so polite and a pleasure to talk to when showing us to and around our room. This was without a doubt the best hotel I've ever stayed in and all the staff were so lovely and welcoming. We will most definitely be returning in the future and hope to see you all again. P.s. I said yes!  #aurateam üíû

148,Christmas 2016,"Read the reviews before booked and couldn't have been more pleased, exceptional hotel, the location is just perfect. The room was very comfortable and the staff very friendly and helpful. We spent the weekend in London and enjoyed every minute, will be back.",5,2017,01,28
148,Me London,"What a super location, the staff were amazing,so helpful and polite. The decor of the hotel and the rooms was fabulous. The valay parking was very useful 
Will definitely us this hotel again and would look ",5,2017,01,27
148,"Great hotel, great location",Very good experience. The staff is exceptional and the rooms are very comfortable and well appointed. I usually stay across the river close to my office. But it's a short taxi ride away. The area is vibrant with theater and restaurants.,5,2017,01,26
148,Absolutely Fantastic,"I stayed for one night for a business trip and i was very impressed. The hotel is very plush and the service is great. Nothing was too much trouble and all of the staff were very helpful and professional. The rooms were huge and the bed was both massive and ridiculously comfortable. There was a great selection of toiletries in the room as well as robes and slippers. There was a great desk and work station too. The breakfast selection was very good and the staff in the restaurant were very attentive. Good location too and no noise from the road or anything.
The corridors and communal areas are quite dark! But the decor is fantastic and the rooms are very tasteful.",5,2017,01,26
148,Fab Stay,"Stayed for just one night midweek as we were down for the day for my birthday. We were early for check-in so room not ready, but that was no problem. We were offered to pay for a suite upgrade that was ready, for one night (out all day, and dinner with friends) there was little point as not in the room enough so declined. However, the very friendly receptionist offered us a free upgrade to the next level instead as we were in no hurry. We then got a complimentary glass of prosecco which was great! 
Super sleek and modern hotel, all the staff we came across we're really friendly & helpful. Really great room - lots of space, all mod cons and huge bed! 
When we got back after dinner at Mint Leaf (highly recommended) we finished off with a drink on the roof top Radio bar and then returned to the room to find a bottle of champagne! This was a birthday present from the hotel which was such a nice touch, completely unexpected and it's these little things that will definitely bring us back. 
Thank you to all the team at ME London for making my birthday even more special. ",5,2017,01,25
148,"Wow, Wow, Wow","What an absolutely superb hotel, location, rooms and staff all impeccable. To help celebrate our wedding anniversary, a chocolate cake and bottle of Champagne were left in our room, plus had a fantastic view from the small sitting area. ",5,2017,01,25
148,let down by lack of infomation and roof top bar,while the hotel was amazing it was seriously let down on the other hand in my opinion by two things 1. the roof top bar the service was painfully slow and in no particular order 2. the lack of information about the hotel within the room - we didn't know there was more than one restaurant or a gym etc ,3,2017,01,25
148,Hotel or Nightclub?,"I booked two Vibe rooms and stayed 11/30-12/04.  Arranged for airport transport through the company that was included on my confirmation e-mail from the hotel.  When I travel, I always arrange for a transfer through the hotel, with that be said, this had to be the worst experience.  Our flight arrived on time and after immigration and luggage claim we had to wait over 40 minutes for the driver to arrive.  I even called to see where he was, this is the last thing I want to do after traveling 16+ hours.  To top it off it was an old dirty van, not a pleasant way to start our vacation. 

We did arrive at the hotel before the check-in time and the rooms were understandably not ready.   After two hours at the radio bar and spending 80 pounds we checked in.  The staff was efficient and friendly.  The reception area is modern and very soothing. I did like the dark hallways.  The room was somewhat small, which is to be expected in London.  It was clean and modern.  The bathroom was also small and clean.  I never really did get the hang of the lighting in the room, my girlfriend did and she changed the colors and all of that cool stuff.  But when she was not in the room and I decided to take a shower, during the shower all the lights went out in the room and bathroom.  Not happy to say the least.  The bed and bedding were nice enough.  We really did not hear much noise in the room from the hallway the entire stay, however we did hear the music on the weekend from the rooftop bar, and this is with our rooms being on the third floor.  Sometimes I just felt this was a nightclub with a hotel attached to it.

I guess the question of whether I would stay here again or not....I do not know.  I am currently planning my trip to London for the end of this year and I am debating on where to stay.  I might stay here due to the location, which is central to many sites.  If I am able to get a good deal with a combination of Melia points and decent rate like I did for this visit, I might just pull the trigger...but I would definitely choose a different transfer provider.",4,2017,01,25
148,SIMPLY THE BEST !,"It feels very Strange & unusual to be able to find no fault with this Hotel, When it first opened it was terrific & then a few years on started to go downhill. It is now back where it belongs at the top. So it must all be down to management, They now have it right. From the online check-in & the welcome Email that arrived after with an offer of an upgraded room. I have nothing but praise. We were met by Luis in reception who made us feel so welcome, we were travelling with other friends who had booked separately but he still managed to book them into a room adjacent to ours. The rooms were presented beautifully with a welcome bottle of bubbly, Spotless rooms with everything working perfectly. The breakfast was faultless & much improved since our last visit. In the four nights that we stayed we were made to feel appreciated by everyone working in the hotel. This is a fun place with the emphasise on customer satisfaction. We hope to return very soon & LUIS your great. ",5,2017,01,23
148,Great,Superb staff and cocktails. Most amazing 1st floor reception lobby. Very different. World class. Had New Year's Eve here and the view from the roof top bar was spectacular. Late check out time was a great plus ! ,5,2017,01,22
148,"Wonderful Hotel, in every possible way.","From the minute we arrived at ME London, we knew we were somewhere special.  We took our daughters to London for a treat and staying here was the best decision. The interior is breathtaking, stylish and definitely wow!  The  staff are lovely, warm and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble. 
The rooms are simple and elegant, not overly large but feel light and airy.  My daughter assures me the 'mini bar' is the best she has ever seen ( a selection of gifts, underwear, cashmere socks,  as well as an excellent selection of drinks and nibbles)
We didn't eat in the restaurant, something we will rectify when we return, and we will defiantly be returning, but we did have a superb breakfast, everything you could wish for, again served by staff who made you feel really welcome.
We had cocktails in the quiet downstairs bar early eve and they were perfect and we did visit the trendy bar on the roof, very busy and a great place to meet up before dinner.  Getting served was something of a challenge though, needed more staff.

The housekeeping team were a little over zealous, we were disturbed twice while we were sleeping well before 9am. 

We definitely recommend ME and will return.",5,2017,01,22
148,Balcony Room on the 8th,"Checked in for a one night stay.
Firstly the reception is stunning a great feeling of space and you are welcomed with a drink.

A short wait for the room and we were in.

All rooms are accessed by inserting your key into the elevators.

The room itself was spacious with a very comfy bed, Twin rain shower, Mini Bar and access to a small balcony overlooking the city.

A great hotel with friendly staff.
I will be back again soon",5,2017,01,22
148,Fantastic hotel,"I was given the stay as a present and it was a great present 

The hotel is very different to any hotel I have been in before and chic is the world.

The service is excellent and the rooms are spacious, quiet and comfortable 

There are windows that point out onto the steamy and you can stand in them as they overhang the road

There is a roof top bar Radio Bar and the view across London is great 

Summary 

Service - excellent 
Room - excellent 
Decor - excellent 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone want a high standard hotel in London 

I will go again

148,Incredible experience,"We stayed there for three nights, to spend New Years Eve in London. We arrived at 11am and we had a very warm welcome. As the room was not ready (we arrived earlier than the checkin time), instead of keeping us waiting, they upgraded us to a better room. We also offered a prosecco glass while the checkin.

Room was full of surprises, illumination, food, media... everything was great. The atmosphere of the hotel is a bit dark but at the same time very modern. 

Doormans are very educated and always willing to help. Really enjoyed the hotel. I'll be repeating again!",5,2017,01,21
148,Not that Great,"Located in the Soho district witch is very nice near all the theaters on the heart of London. The hotel is nice but not that super. Rooms are ok, and has a couple of restaurants. They try to much to have vibe but unfortunately I dis not find it.",3,2017,01,20
148,Another Great Experience at The ME,"Arriving with friends and bags, the ME experience began at the main door where a smile met us and our bags were seamlessly dealt with behind the scenes. Reception was friendly and efficient and the check-in process was very easy. 
A big thanks to Luis from the Aura team who gave us such a fantastic greeting and made us so very welcome.

The hotel is so beautiful and the rooms are lovely, everything we needed, the beds are big and comfortable and we had a great nights sleep. The room was spotlessly clean.

The breakfast was fantastic, again very attentive staff and a good choice of food which was delicious.

We really enjoyed ourselves and we look forward to returning.",5,2017,01,20
148,Chic hotel,"Loved this hotel-decor is chic and modern (possibly not everybody's cup of tea). Staff exceptional. We are fortunate enough to have stayed in many amazing hotels around the world, so it makes for a refreshing change to stay somewhere that is a little different from the usual '5star hotel'. Pictures don't do it justice so if you like modern, chic, attention to detail, I can certainly recommend the ME Melia. Added benefit is the location and sound proofing of rooms. This is the first Hotel in London we have stayed and not been bothered by traffic noise despite it's location.",5,2017,01,20
148,Gorgeous in all respects; bad experience with housekeeping,"We visited for my birthday and were given a free upgrade, which was a lovely and much-appreciated gesture. The design and decor of the hotel was stunning and we loved the effect in reception! The complimentary prosecco was a nice touch, and our room was beautiful and very, very comfortable. The bathroom was extremely good, with high quality toiletries including a face cleanser - wonderful. Super comfy bed and pillows. We would have preferred kettle, tea and milk to be available in the room, but it arrived quickly when we requested it. Bit weird having to hold down the kettle lever continuously until it boiled. 
Sadly our stay was spoilt by housekeeping. We rarely get the chance for a lie-in, and decided to put the DND sign on and sleep late and watch tv in bed. We were disappointed therefore, when housekeeping knocked on the door at 8:30am and opened it. Luckily I'd put the bolt on, but I was cross because it woke us up. Half an hour later, disappointment turned to irritation when the same thing happened again. I went to the door to check the sign was the right way round, which it was, and received a 'sorry, sorry' from the housekeeper. Irritation turned to downright anger half an hour later when our tea was brought up. The housekeeper was once again at the door, asking what time we were going to vacate the room. My husband replied that we would leave by the time we were required to, at noon. By this time (about 10am), our morning was pretty much spoilt, and the amount of door banging that was going on also didn't help, so we got up and checked out. Such a shame, as everything else was so good.",4,2017,01,20
148,Funky hotel In Covent Garden,"We stayed in the ME just before Christmas on a girls shopping trip. 
The hotel is very centrally located in Covent Garden. 
We ate in the Radio roof top bar and had drinks on one evening. The food was tapas style and you are provided with blankets for out door seating. 
We also ate in STK in one evening which as always was truly amazing. It's located on the ground floor of the hotel. 
There is complimentary champagne in the hotel lobby throughout the day which is a nice touch. 
The room was spacious however there was no view to speak off and the window was very small. This wasn't a basic room I stayed in so I can't imagine what the window would be like in a basic room. That being said we weren't there for the view and didn't impinge on our stay what so ever. 
I will definitely be recommending the hotel to friends. ",5,2017,01,18
148,Fabulous treat,"My sister and I treated our parents to a Theatre trip recently at The Coliseum and wanted to find them a hotel close to the venue. We chose ME London because of the location but also because the reviews were so positive. We weren't disappointed. Everything about the stay was fabulous. The hotel arranged for my parents to be met at Victoria; made them feel very very welcome; the room was great; special non feather bedding was arranged; they left a complimentary bottle of bubbles in their room; assisted with just about every detail of their theatre trip and ensured they made it back to the train station in good time the next day. They felt that all the staff were lovely but did want to particularly mention Emiliano Del Pizzo (Senior Concierge). His attention to detail, help and service were exemplary. Thank you for helping us spoil our parents Emiliano! Would definitely recommend.",5,2017,01,18
148,"Excellent location, great modern hotel","What an excellent location right over the road from The Lyceum.  We had a lovely room but everything was done through the computer, you couldn't just turn the lights off, that took some getting used to.  Great staff, friendly and helpful.  Rooftop bar was interesting and fun.  The lobby bar was very relaxing and fast service.",5,2017,01,17
148,Fantastic experiance!,"My husband & I had the most amazing stay at ME last weekend. The hotel is stunning with a fantastic location. Rooms were very big, comfy & clean! We went to both radio & the hotel bar which were both great. The best part of our stay was the Aura team, especially Simona who made us feel so special & welcome for our entire stay. And as we were celebrating our marriage had a few very thoughtful surprises for us on our arrival which we were thrilled with! We are already looking at dates for our return. Can't wait to come back! ",5,2017,01,17
148,Fabulous hotel and staff,"I stayed at the ME London for a week while on business.  The location allowed me easy tube access to the City (short walk to the District/Circle lines), but was still close to the West End attractions.  The facility is great--new; smart features in the rooms and common areas (for example, closet light turned on on approach and there was a dim but sufficient bathroom nightlight); large room.  But the staff is what made the hotel really special.  The reception staff were friendly and helpful with requests such as printing.  The concierge and door staff welcomed me by name from the first day as I came and went, and gave me good directions when I needed them.  Among the helpful staff were Arman, Eleonara, Emiliano, Ilaria, Omar, and Simona.  I apologize to anyone who helped me that I didn't mention--to a person, all of the staff were helpful and friendly.",5,2017,01,17
148,A beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. This was my second visit. A couple of issues.,"Second visit and not as good as my first trip. First night no turn down service and no water provided in room. Resulting in a room service charge when I requested some. Limited hot buffet on our first morning, this improved at our second breakfast and the menu wasn't explained to us. We tried to book a table at the Radio Bar but no one got back to us. ",4,2017,01,17
148,AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING,"I would like to start by saying this is the most incredible hotel me and my partner have ever stayed in and we have stayed in a fair few we stayed here from the 13th-15th of January. We have stayed in hotels one hundred times worse than this one and paid a lot more. To say it is briefly as possible once you stay here you will really struggle to find anywhere else who treats you the way all the stay at ME London do, we felt like VIP‚Äôs throughout the whole experience.
Firstly as we were arriving to the hotel we realised how beautiful the location is, a two minute walk from Covent Garden, right in the centre of the Strand so easy to get to wherever you are in London. I and my partner personally are bigger fans of getting taxis to and from where we want to go which is perfect as as soon as you walk out the hotel there is a taxi rank for them to pull up to save you walking far which isn‚Äôt always pleasant especially with the rain when we went. And if you need to travel somewhere and you don‚Äôt have any transport planned if you were to inform the lovely concierge in the Lobby they would organise it for you. On the other hand if you are doing a lot of travelling and the tube seems like a more sensible option the tube station is just over a 5 minute walk from the hotel so also in a very convenient location. 
The hotel from the outside is very simple which is such a nice touch as when you enter the lobby you are completely mesmerized by the incredible layout and modern interior, it really is something else. At this point I had already fallen in love with this hotel it was so classy and original. After I finished admiring the Lobby two lovely gentlemen took our suitcases for us and escorted us to the reception, situated on the first floor. We were welcomed by 2 glasses of champagne and the Reception was even more mesmerizing than the lobby. Check in was simple and fast and we were informed that our room had been upgraded which has to be the nicest thing to be told whilst checking in, we were then taken to our room by the amazing Simona who was the loveliest lady ever and I have to thank you again and again for everything you did for us during this stay. We entered the room and wow wow wow I have never stayed in such a modern, clean, bright, spacious room as you enter the bathroom is there with a double sink which is brilliant for me and my partner as in any other hotel I have to wait for him to get ready and then use the mirror but this mirror was big enough for 4 people. As we walked in there was a message on the mirror saying ‚ÄòHappy Birthday Kayley‚Äô Simona then showed us into the bedroom to balloons, a bottle of champagne and happy birthday cake I couldn‚Äôt believe it when I noticed the effort the hotel had gone to to make my birthday so special and memorable as I can easily say it‚Äôs been the best one yet and that‚Äôs all down to the hotel and my partner for organising everything for me. It wasn‚Äôt until after that my partner told me that he had been in contact with the hotel for the past week trying to organise everything and that Luis especially through emails was so helpful to him and sorted everything he asked for without question. We did have plans to go to the restaurant STK in the evening of our check in and later on realised we wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it but as it was fully booked for the whole weekend so we asked Simona if there was any possibility if there was any availability for Saturday night so she said she would try her hardest for us, later that day we got a call informing us that we had a table booked for the exact time we wanted, what incredible service that was and thank you so much again Simona. 
We didn‚Äôt get breakfast inclusive in the rate as we like to book room service breakfast when at the hotel, as we missed the 3am request form on the door we decided to go down to the buffet breakfast and thank god we did not only could you have unlimited continental breakfast, full English breakfast, hot drinks, cold drinks and you could also have an extra dish on the side, both me and my partner went for the eggs benedict as we are big fans and it was cooked to perfection as was the whole breakfast. I was so surprised when I realised it was only ¬£30 per head for this breakfast as due to the quality of the food, the amount you can have and unlimited drinks is incredible. Enough food to keep us going throughout the whole day of shopping. Whilst at breakfast the lovely Luis came to see us and welcome us and introduce himself what a lovely gentleman he is, just the fact he had gone to the effort to come and find us in the morning was amazing and made us feel very important and welcome in the hotel. 
Later that evening we had our STK booking which had to be in the best location ever especially when it‚Äôs raining outside, from outside the doors you could hear the music from the restaurant and for people like me and my couple who love the high life and love a good atmosphere this was the best. I expected due to the restaurant being so popular to have to wait a while before being seated but we were escorted to the bar and we hadn‚Äôt even finished one drink and they already were over to seat us. For a starter we both ordered the LIL burgers which were something else and actually quite filling so don‚Äôt underestimate them haha they are amazing. For our mains we both had a large sirloin steak, and we added additional fries, mushrooms and macaroni cheese alongside our steaks. It all made a wonderful combination and tasted OUT OF THIS WORLD. Next time we come we will be eating there each night without a doubt, considering how much we ordered with 2 alcoholic drinks each, 3 sides, a large steak and a big starter each our bill didn‚Äôt even reach ¬£200 such amazing value and if that does seem quite pricey wait until you‚Äôve tasted the food, you are 100% paying for value. After our meal at STK we decided to have a visit to your radio rooftop bar which again was out of this world, the atmosphere was incredible with amazing music and the most beautiful view, if you‚Äôre in London it is definitely worth a visit but I would advise pre booking as it does get very busy. 
The following morning we were organised and decided to go for the room service breakfast and wow the lovely lady who brought It into us was right on time at 10am and was so friendly she sorted it all out for us and then came back later on to collect the table. The food was amazing, we had a huge English breakfast each with every single continental option available and we devoured the lot it was so yummy. I was even more shocked when I realised that it only cost ¬£55 for the both of us cheaper than the buffet breakfast but as amazing quality. 
Me being a women I‚Äôm always rushing when it comes to getting ready so when it hit 12pm check out time and I was still packing I realised how much I needed to hurry up we then received a call and I was sure it was going to be reminding us we should have checked out at 12pm like every single other hotel we have stayed in has done they were just calling to ask if we needed any help with luggage what incredible staff you have they are all so lovely and did everything they could to make it the most relaxed, special stay for us ever. As we weren‚Äôt travelling home until later that night we left our luggage with the concierge which they looked after perfectly. 
The only negative from this whole trip was that we didn‚Äôt book to stay longer.
Overall this was the best stay we have ever had not just at a hotel in London but anywhere, we would just like to thank all your incredible staff again Luis and Simona especially and everybody else again and we can‚Äôt wait to see you again soon, we have planned our next trip at the beginning of march, so see you then, we can‚Äôt wait.

Thank you again

148,Best attentive service and wonderful large rooms,100% attentive staff from concierge to maids - perfect example of indiviualized service in a big city hotel. Very personal attention from every member of staff. Like they really cared about you and your well-being. ,5,2017,01,16
148,Cash stolen from room,"I'm going to start off by saying that it gives me great displeasure to write a negative review about any business, but this is one of those rare instances where it is necessary.

My wife and I stayed here on New Years day, the last night of an amazing trip in the U.K. to visit friends and family. All was well until I discovered that there was several hundred dollars missing from my passport wallet that I left next to the bed, while we were at dinner.
The hotel has conducted an ""investigation"" and acknowledged that a housekeeper had indeed entered our room to turn down the bed at the time we were at dinner, but concluded that there was no theft or accountability on their part, because the housekeeper simply said that it didn't happen and I must have misplaced it.

I am certain that it was taken at this time, because prior to leaving for dinner I had put it in there and counted it.
The whole time I was on holiday, I never exchanged any dollars to pounds because the rates were much better withdrawing from ATM's.
I would never accuse someone of something like this unless I was absolutely sure.
Not all the money was taken, I'm guessing just enough so that I wouldn't notice it.
Even if the housekeeper didn't take it, someone did, and it's the hotels responsibility for making sure their guests rooms are secure.

I've gone back and forth a few times stating my claim with their head of security and then the general manager, and in response I get generic, robotic answers denying any wrong doing. 
In all my years I've never experienced anything like this. Obviously, for only a few hundred dollars it's not really worth pursuing this any further or spending anymore time writing emails to the general manager just to be insultingly dismissed.

I just felt I needed to to tell others about my experience at the ME London and warn them of what goes on here and what this ""5"" star staff is really all about behind the fake smiles and false customer service.
With all the other classy 5 star places in London to choose from, why would anyone want to have to deal with something like this?
My short stay at the ME London left me feeling dirty and I will never set foot on another one of their properties again.",1,2017,01,14
148,Fantastic Christmas Experience,"Stayed  just before Christmas, the Hotel itself is beautiful and a fantastic location. The check in was very easy the complimentary champagne was a nice touch. The .concierge throughout our stay couldn't have been more helpful. The rooms itself was lovely and modern and super clean the turn down service was very nice.
My wife contacted the housekeeping dept and they couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful.
I would recommend to anyone a fantastic London experience",5,2017,01,12
148,Wonderful Birthday Treat,"We stayed at the hotel as we were celebrating my daughter's birthday...and Simona exceeded our expectations by providing a cake, champagne and balloons in the room!!  Emma was delighted with her treats as we were!! Simona even managed to arrange for us to visit The Radio Bar before the theatre.  Hotel in a great location for the various Theatres and close to Covent Garden. All the contact we had with staff was amazing and look forward to a return trip in the near future.  Thank you Simona for making a our weekend wonderful!!",5,2017,01,12
148,New Year's in London,"My boyfriend and I LOVE ME London. The staff are exceptional and the rooms are overall great in terms of size and amenities. STK and Radio Bar are musta if you stay there - great food and fun atmosphere. The location is superb - a quick walk to Covent Garden or Leicester Square with plenty of restaurants and things to do in the neighborhood. The tube is also easily accessed at Covent Garden, Charing Cross or Holburn. For us, the location was perfect for the New Year's Eve fireworks display on the Thames as we only had to walk down the street to gain entry to our ticketed area. The only complaint that I have with the hotel is that the bed was very uncomfortable - too hard. This was our second time staying at the hotel and we don't recall the bed being that uncomfortable during our first visit. I am hoping that this was just a fluke. Overall, we still love ME London, but hoping that they upgrade the beds.",5,2017,01,12
148,Absolutely spoiled !! ,"We absolutely loved the ME london it was our favorite hotel all over Europe!! The concierge downstairs is unbelievable and they really know the area near by and best restaurants bars and things to see! The radio bar upstairs is really great for drinks and has a great view! 

Bravo! this was a great stay for us in london and we will definitely be back. 

",5,2017,01,09
148,Brilliant,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 1 night for our anniversary. As soon as we walked through the door our bags were taken by the bellman, he was very friendly and talkative.

As soon as you walk in the front door the hotel smells very fresh and sweet, more noticeable than other hotels. Reception is on the first floor, it is certainly something to look at with its unique and modern design, after being handed a glass of prosecco (which was very nice also) we were checked in. Smooth, simple, all staff are very helpful and smiley. Nothing is too much for anyone. Being a young couple sometimes you get judged when you go to these kind of places but everyone made us feel at ease and comfortable. 

We were shown to the room on the 3rd floor. Room size was great, very luxurious great facilities in the room. We mentioned it was our anniversary and had a bottle of Champagne with two glasses courtesy of the hotel. Bed was comfortable, tempting selection of snacks and mini fridge. The hotel had a roof top bar which turns very lively at night, has a great view but is very expensive. ¬£27.50 for two single vodka lemonade and limes is a bit excessive. 

We went to the STK restaurant which is also downstairs in the hotel, had a great meal, didn't have to leave the hotel and had a great time. 

Special thanks to Simona and all the staff for making our stay fantastic, if you would like to stay in a luxury hotel with real 5* service this is the place to stay.

148,Super spoilt by Me ,"My fianc√© & I stayed this weekend for one night. We have previously stayed at Me Barcelona so thought we'd give London a go as we were impressed before with the trendy interior & little gestures left by staff. Me London did not disappoint. It was a first night away for some years due to starting a family & the staff really spoilt us with complimentary champagne & room upgrade. Little things like a glass of prosecco upon arrival in the stunning reception, bottles of water placed in the rooms for the morning (much needed) all are lovely touches. All of the staff were really friendly & the sky bar was really special! I would highly recommend this hotel!!!",5,2017,01,09
148,Excellent hotel in prime location for the Westend,Very modern art deco hotel.  Excellent friendly staff.  The rooms are spacious with comfy beds for a great nights sleep.  We chose this hotel for its close proximity to the dury lane theatre.   A visit to the rooftop bar is also worthwhile with fantastic views of the city.,5,2017,01,09
148,Great London hotel,"So I booked a room at ME (because I had been at the bar and restaurant that night) and was given a free upgrade to a Vibe room. The room was of a very high quality, perfectly clean, and everything in perfect working order. Also had a wonderful view of the Strand. Ordered breakfast in the morning which was lovely as well. Lastly, all the staff were very polite and welcoming which is always a nice change of pace in London!",4,2017,01,08

Only negative - dark corridors.",5,2017,01,08
148,Absolutely Perfect,"My daughter and I stayed in a chic suite (room 710) last night - a Saturday. This was our first visit to the hotel and when we entered on the ground floor we were escorted up to the first floor to check in. While checking in we were offered a glass of complimentary prosecco or water, and then escorted to our suite. The suite was amazing! I had mentioned when booking that our stay was to see a show (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and we were delighted to find a bottle of champagne, chocolate macaroons and a theatre programme waiting for us in our room! A quote from the show had been written on the mirror too.
The suite was clean, spacious and comfortable. There is an extensive mini bar (prices are expensive but as expected for a London hotel) with complementary nespresso coffee - you need to phone room service for milk, which is delivered in minutes.
There are a wide range of lovely toiletries provided and my daughter was pleased to find hair straighteners in the bathroom.
The hotel is under 5 minutes walk from Covent Garden and the same distance from Mamma Mia, the Lion King and Charlie. We had a view of the theatres for the last two shows from our windows.
On our return from the show, a turn down service had been provided with candles lit, bottles of water by the bedside and chocolates on the pillows, making the suite even more welcoming. 
The room was exceptionally quiet and we ordered breakfast from room service which was lovely. Staff are genuinely friendly and helpful. As checkout is not until 12pm there is plenty of time for a leisurely breakfast and a last stroll to Covent Garden before leaving. We were sorry to go but have already booked our next stay and I don't think there's a better recommendation than that!",5,2017,01,08
148,MAGNIFICENT,"The upscale hotel has all the bells,and Whistles ,located in the theatre district,a short walk to Knightsbridge .
The architecture was contemporary ,as an art major ,I've never seen anything like it!
It's the Rolls Royce of the Melia  chain.
The roof bar, the drinks and food in restaurant,over the top!",5,2017,01,08
148,Superb,"I really can't fault my stay at Me London. I travel extensively with work and I am used to the high level of service you receive at the top hotels. This however was a level above.

148,Stay at ME,This is the second time we stay at this hotel and was just as good as the first time. Staff at reception very friendly and helpful and make you feel pampered from the moment you arrive. Our room was ready when we arrived early afternoon and was just missing the extra bed we requested which was set up within 10 minutes. Superb service. Extremely clean and modern room with nice ambient lights which you can control from a touch panel. Location is excellent as it's next to Covent garden and good choice of restaurants and cafes nearby. Will be returning in February this year.    ,5,2017,01,06
148,New Year Stay,This was our first time staying at the ME and we were not disappointed. The attention to detail and level of service was exemplary.

148,It just needs a little soul!,"I stayed here in late November. I was scouting potential locations for a 50th birthday party next year. I saw the checkin, the room and the radio bar. Public areas are impressive. Room was clean and spacious with a good size bed. Shower room has unusual flooring that feels a bit cheap. Also chairs in the room were also rather poor quality. Toiletries were of fair quality. A bit pricey for the room but, perhaps worthwhile if your use of the public areas is more extensive than mine was.",3,2016,12,26

148,Can a Hotel get more than 5 stars?,"I have to start from the beginning with this review as it was perfection from start to finish - actually it was perfection even before we got to the hotel!

I want to use most of this review to tell you about the concierge Luis. He greeted us at the hotel, offered us a glass of champagne while we waited for the room to be ready (we were allowed to check in 3 hours early without charge!). He was polite, passionate, professional and overall so warming and flexible to our needs. He showed us around our beautiful room (top floor with balcony and the most amazing views) and also has left a nice few surprise and touches in the room including champagne and a Christmas message on the large mirror. I was just blown away by the room, the cleanliness, the service and just the overall experience. The hotel really is a top tier 5 star hotel!

We had made reservations at STK - which is a really good place for steak and had some cocktails at the rooftop bar which was super cool and romantic. You can see that although we only stayed for one night that the experience was amazing. The hotel made our trip to London very special and memorable.

I cannot recommend the hotel enough - I have stayed in many 5 star hotels but this may be my favourite. Its cool, modern, fashionable but still has personality and great customer service. Not to mention its in a great location on the Strand - only a few minutes walk to do your shopping or to see the sights.

The hotel is luxury and you pay luxury prices for the rooms - but just treat yourself and dont expect anything less than perfection. It will not disappoint!",5,2016,12,23
148,First Class,"This was my very first stay at ME London. I chose this hotel only from reading reviews from other guests, and I was not disappointed. This hotel is absolutely first class. Modern and comfy and the staff was very helpful and caring. Highly recommended.  ",5,2016,12,22
148,ME Hotel stay,"Lovely hotel & experience. The steaks were the worse I've experienced in years, completely over done, the time this took to get resolved was not acceptable for a top-ish London hotel. The rooms were great, something different & the reception had a wow factor with the overall staff very attentive. ",3,2016,12,21
148,The most visually stunning hotel I have ever stayed in,"We took a 36 hour trip to London from Charlotte and cashed in some Melia rewards points.  We paid nothing, but had we paid the full price, this hotel would be worth every penny.  Sleek onyx walls, projected imagery on granite surfaces, and the service and standards you would expect from Melia make this among my top hotels worldwide.",5,2016,12,20
148,"High expectations, more than exceeded","When you decide to stay at a 5 star hotel from a reputable hotel chain, you expect a certain level of service and treatment. Moreover as a Young couple you want the rooms to have a sufficient level of design and an appropiate ambiance to enhance your experience.

ME London not only goes over the bar but in many aspects flies above it, specially thanks to the close personal touch delivered by the aura team. They came down to the breakfast lounge just to make sure everything was ok and also suggested a couple of plans for the day for example.

The room setup was unbelievable every night which made our stay even more magical.. We would probably come back to ME anyway, but thanks to these little details, we wont even consider another hotel.",5,2016,12,19
148,Superb,"Stayed for one night and hugely impressed. We have been to the hotels STK and Radio on numerous occasions but never stayed. The check in at the very impressive reception is flawless, the welcome prosecco a lovely touch and the light display on the walls kept our 2 year old amused! Staff at Radio were so helpful at lunch and made us feel welcome and relaxed. The turn down service is a nice touch. The rooms itself was spacious and spotless, my only point would be a children's TV channel would have been good. Breakfast offers a variety you would expect and which we thoroughly enjoyed. Concierge also need a mention for remembering our names even though we only stayed one night. This has now become our favourite London Hotel - preferable to Sanderson and even Rosewood as staff make you feel welcome and a bit special.",5,2016,12,19
148,I was again a great stay,"I like the architecture of the Hotel, the style of rooms, reception, corridors, bars, restaurants in combination with old and new. I met expected clean rooms including bathroom. To have a bar at the enterance and on the top is helpfull for Business to meet People and to discuss our issues. ",4,2016,12,19
148,First class. As always ,"We have stayed here around a dozen times in the last 2 years, it never disappoints us. The modern interior design of the corridors and the lovely rooms do not fail to impress me every time. We were upgraded to a balcony room this year which was wonderful. Staff are always pleasant. The only negative we have found is that the staff in radio bar are a little standoffish and because we weren't suited and booted, seemed to look down on us a little. Might have just been me but that's the impression we both got. Nice food in the breakfast room and good service. Can't wait for our next visit. ",5,2016,12,17
148,A very special hotel,"We chose this hotel based on two things, where it is located and the exceptional reviews. If I am honest I was a bit apprehensive before arrival as I thought it might be too 'hip' for us retirees! Not so, we felt very welcome and a bit special too. We chose the Vibe room which was a very good size and although at first appeared quite minimalistic was very comfortable indeed. The funky pink lighting warmed the room on a dismal November day. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the room was very quiet. The bathroom was lovely with a walk in shower and double sinks. Very high end toiletries and fluffy towels. The turn down service was brilliant. When we returned from an evening out we found a bottle of bubbly on ice and a chocolate dessert wishing us a happy anniversary which was so thoughtful. We were given a kettle and tea bags when we enquired about using the coffee machine. What we thought was very special were the very friendly staff. We did not have breakfast as we thought it was a bit pricey and there are plenty of cafes nearby. If I were being a bit picky I would say the entrance is quite drab and does not really compliment this lovely hotel. We did not use any of the bars so cannot comment on these. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,12,13
148,Original,"Great for a special occasion if you want a completely different experience. This is a unique hotel - stunning bars (the rooftop bar is amazing) and the ""communal"" areas really are exceptional as are the staff who are so attentive. I stayed in an Aura room ..... First reaction was ""WOW"" ...... but not long before you start noticing the room really isn't that great - especially for the price. A pity they didn't spend a little more time and money on the actual room rather than throwing everything at the gadgets and lighting! Disappointed unfortunately.",3,2016,12,13
148,Fantastic customer service,"We have just returned from an overnight trip to London for my husbands birthday. The ME hotel was amazing. From the moment we stepped through the door every single employee was so helpful and served with a smile! The hotel is very modern and the bedrooms are gorgeous and huge by London standards. There is also a nice trendy roof top bar which has a good buzz and fantastic views of the city. The location is also perfect for visiting all the city highlights and for a quick stroll back from the theatres.

But it is the customer service that makes this hotel stand out!",5,2016,12,13
148,Simply the best (place I've stayed in London),"Just returned from an amazing stay at this hotel, after hours of research found this one to be the perfect; location, style and design we were looking for.  Immaculately clean, friendly welcome from all the staff we encountered, huge comfortable beds, prosecco welcome in the jaw dropping architecture of the reception room. The room was more spacious than we expected, had a double shower, views out to Covent Garden and so well insulated from the busy road outside and our neighbours didn't hear a thing.  Possibly the most well stocked and extensive mini bar I've ever seen, cool RGB mood lighting, only realised on leaving we could bluetooth our music to the TV.  The Radio bar, very cool place, and views across London is well worth a visit but do book if you want a good seat and expect high prices for the experience. Didn't try any of the restaurants as plenty of options 2mins walk from the hotel (can recommend Sophie's Steakhouse) and boat to the O2 can be caught from London Eye pier which is only a 10min walk over Waterloo bridge. The hotel and room was just perfect (for a romantic city break) and worth paying that bit more for a decent room.  I don't think my wife will let us stay anywhere else when we next visit to London and I look forward to our next visit.",5,2016,12,13
148,Excellent experience,"Hotel is great. Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms are fantastic, comfortable beds and very cool lighting features. Food somewhat expensive and the minibar extremely overpriced, but overall I would reccomend 100%.",5,2016,12,13
148,"Location, Location - That you pay for!","The location of this hotel is amazing; central to all things in 'Theatre Land' and Covent Garden with fantastic access to various transportation options.  You pay for the privilege of staying in this modern, minimalist environment that offers professional and courteous service.  Unfortunately did not make use of the skybar or the Hotels notable Restaurants.",4,2016,12,12
148,A little dissapointed,I have stayed at the me many times it has always been lovely and it was so this time but my husband and I had asked another couple to come with us as they wanted to experience an evening in the radio bar only to be told when we checked in we would only be allowed until 5pm as there was a private function although we really wanted to go later  if we had been told this when booking the room we would not have gone on this date and we were all dissapointed ,4,2016,12,10
148,"Great location, modern and quiet","Very friendly staff. Interesting futuristic lobby. On the main road, but very quiet rooms. Can walk everywhere - Covent Garden, Houses of Parliament, Leicester Square, Tube close by.
Family friendly, set up a free crib for us.",5,2016,12,09
148,Great Stay,"Well what a fabulous stay from start to finish. Made to feel like stars. Nothing was too good. 

Was able to go to the Radio Bar on the top floor which was a great experience. There is a difference in how we were treated when they realised we were hotel guests & not just popping in. Still can't decide if that's a good thing or not! 

We had a lovely suite & great lighting. Would definitely go back. 

",5,2016,12,09
148,Fantastic Hip Hotel,"My husband stayed here before me. He gave me know indication of how amazing this hotel is. Superb, helpful staff. I was offered a glass of prosecco at check in. The room was sleek, modern, high tech. Nice music available via the TV. I am in the financial markets and could. It find Bloomberg or CNBC, but otherwise, great range of channels. Free wifi that works and is fast. Wonderful bed. Lights were a bit tricky, but I finally got the right ones on and off. Unbelievable choice of drinks and snacks, even cashmere slippers for this so inclined. I had a light dinner. Prices were reasonable for such a high end hotel, food was excellent and service perfect! The lobby is quite dark, so even day looks like night. But that is part of the art and design! ",5,2016,12,09
148,Great stay at the ME,"What a great stay......... The service was brilliant from walking through the doors and the polite friendly doormen to the check in and the house keeping staff. This was our second stay, this time my sister and I took our 83 yr old mum who has limited mobility and the service was so good, the attention given to mum was really good. The radio bar can get pretty loud from early afternoon but the views are great so well worth a visit. The location is good it's close to many theatres and Covent Garden. Unfortunately the restaurant has closed and is only used for breakfast although strangely a question still pops up on their questionnaire about what you thought of it, the STK restaraunt is still going. I would have ne hesitation in recommending the ME to anyone. Unfortunately I didn't get the names of all those who made our stay memorable but Anna who served our breakfast was very attentive and friendly. We would definitely stay again. ",5,2016,12,07
148,We loved it,"We were there as family; my wife and 14 years old twins; we all loved the style and elegancy and service and location and.... all what you can imagine. 
The only issue was, the service doors on every floor slammed so often in day time with big noise that we had no chance to sleep as we had kind of jet lag. They should find a way to close doors more quite. 
Go for this hotel...",5,2016,12,07
148,Great Covent Garden digs,"Amazing hotel, friendly staff, and great location. Only issue I had were maintenance issue on both occasion I stayed there. Middle of the night hot water and water pressure is off. Its okay the next morning.",5,2016,12,07
148,Not the comfiest mattress,"Booking arrangements between my client and the hotel didn't go smoothly- which isn't anyone's fault but worth a status phone call check. But I lie here at 5.25 in the morning on a mattress that feels like a slab of concrete. No doubt this is good for me, but I'd rather the sleep. Hint - you turn the lamps off using a button at the end of the light. Oh, I want to go home.",3,2016,12,07
148,Amazing,"The service was impeccable felt like a superstar. Really was an amazing hotel would definitely stay there again. The staff couldn't be more helpful and the rooms were amazing. Only fault was no bath, would be nice to have the option. ",5,2016,12,05
148,Great stay,"Great experience, attentive service. madleine are yummy.
Bed very comfortable, atmosphere happening.
Concierge very helpful , specially a big thank you to Arman Benardino who's readily smile and warm welcome are always appreciated. Home away from home!",5,2016,12,05
148,Repeat stayer!,"Love this place.  My favourite place to stay in London. Expensive but modern, super cool and luxurious!
This is the third time we've stayed here and we are never disappointed.
A perfect treat for a special occasion.",5,2016,12,04
148,Impeccable ,"The hotel is absolutely impeccable in terms of upkeep and cleanliness. Ultra modern and the check in desk area is very impressive and warranted a couple of photos. Room was good and well equipped. Up there with the best mini bar selection I have seen. The STK restaurant downstairs was very good but unfortunately the Rooftop Bar didn't seem to be of the same calibre, although I appreciate it is a novelty and attracts non staying guests too. Good service received. Breakfast was pretty good too. ",4,2016,12,04
148,Amazing experience from star to finish,"From the moment you get to the hotel to the moment you leave, every member of staff makes you feel extra special. The attention to detail is amazing! 
We stayed for my wife's birthday and special thanks to the Aura team for the champagne and cake in the room on arrival. 
The views from the Radio bar are amazing and the cocktails are beautiful! 
We ate at STK and the food was top notch. 
This is now are go to hotel for London. 
Can't wait to come back and stay again. See you soon guys, we're already planning our next night out.",5,2016,12,03
148,All round 5* hotel! Fantastic!,"Stayed here for 2 nights as a treat to my boyfriend for his birthday. Massive thank you to the Aura team for personalising the room on arrival! The personal message on the mirror, champagne and chocolate were a brilliant touch!

We opted for a Vibe room and were upgraded to a room with a balcony city view( I have a Melia rewards card) we also had breakfast included. 

We kept our luggage in the concierge for a couple of hours whilst we went around london and then checked in at about 3pm,where we were greeted with a glass of Proseco!

The hotel itself is very modern and chic, we used the gym too whilst we stayed and it had what we needed. 

Room service was prompt and again staff, just so polite and professional.

We had dinner at STK, then ventured up to Radio Rooftop bar, which we had visited before and enjoyed! Then came back to our room and were greeted with MORE chocolate on the pillows! 

Overall brilliant weekend and I cannot thank the staff at Me london and the amazing Aura team enough for their hospitality and for making my boyfriend have such a memorable birthday! 

We will be back and hope to visit other Melia hotels in other cities!",5,2016,12,02
148,WOW ....What an amazing place to stay...,"what a surprise this was, a really beautiful hotel and amazing staff.
a most modern 5 star hotel 
we would love to stay in this most exquisit place again....
the most ambience available in a central London hotel which was perfect for a special anniversary weekend away.

148,Amazing!!!,"Love love love !!!!! Such a fab hotel!!! Everything was perfect for our stay, was my sisters birthday and they did so many little thoughtful things to make it special! Would defo go back as I could not fault this hotel in anyway :)",5,2016,11,29
148,Out of the Dark into the Light,Fabulous Hotel only spoilt by having to leave.  Walking the corridor to our room was full of anticipating. But the darkness is a little eerie once you head out into the day.  Beautiful rooms lovely people and great service. ,5,2016,11,29
148,Not cheap but fantastic,"From the first minute to the last our stay was perfect.
Top floor rooms with balcony has wonderful view. You may hear music from the bar above and some customers will flick their cigarette butts onto your balcony, but this was not a major issue for us.
We just loved the style, the space, the cleanliness and the comfort.",5,2016,11,29
148,Amazing,"As soon as I walked in lobby and there was a champagne lounge right upon check in I knew this was my type of hotel. The ambience was so beautiful. My room had a nice size balcony overlooking the city, and the room was very comfortable. I will definitely come back and stay at this hotel again ",5,2016,11,29
148,Balcony river view room 912,Was very nice view of London at night & was given complementary champagne as it was my birthday the staff were very helpful and our had a very good night sleep despite being on the top floor below the radio roof top bar you could hear no in wanted disturbances.,5,2016,11,28
148,Our number 1!,"This was a repeat visit to the ME for us and yet again, we had a wonderful stay.  We cannot fault the staff and the service they provide, always with a smile.  I enjoy the relaxing feeling the dark corridors provide and the perfect location on The Strand.

We were in room 914 which provided wonderful views from the balcony but sits just below the Radio Bar.  The downside is the customers in the Radio bar tend to think it's okay to throw their cigarette ends over the wall.  Not so bad if someone isn't sitting on the balcony below!  

The rooms are modern and spotlessly clean as expected. 
Another wonderful stay, thank you!",5,2016,11,28
148,Definitely for me.,"Loved the stylish modernism of this hotel.Maybe a touch dark in the corridors. Location was very close to Covent Garden, Trafalgar and Leicester squares and of course theatre land.
The staff were all young people and the service and help they provided was impressive. Only had breakfast in the hotel and it was very good.
Radio the rooftop bar was super and the views over London at night was spectacular.
Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will definitely use again next year.
A big thank you to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2016,11,27
148,great location and exactly what you would expect from this brand.,"Superior room was great, loved the decor and amenities. Really comfy beds and bedding and higher rooms are really quiet. STK is one of the best steakhouses in London and staring the evening with a drink in Radio Bar was really cool. Hard to beat for a central London location.",5,2016,11,27
148,Party people palace,"My best friend and I were lucky enough to stay here for a night this weekend-paid for by her fianc√© which was a lovely treat. When we arrived we were offered a glass of bubbly which is such a nice touch and makes you feel like a VIP. Unfortunately as he has paid on his card and wasn't present as he bought it for us as a gift the receptionist said they would not honour the booking and instead had to refund his card and we had to pay for it on one of our cards. This was a bit of a pain and could have caused a massive issue if we didn't have enough money on our cards to pay for it but as it turns out we did. This policy seems a bit backward for such a modern hotel-needs rethinking as not customer focused! 

The room wasn't quite ready and we had lunch reservations at the Savoy so headed out and didn't get back until approx 10pm.

We checked out the room which was spacious, modern and lit up pink with mood lighting which was funky. We freshened up and thought we would head up to the radio bar for some tapas and a couple of drinks before bed to relax as we had been out shopping all day...OMG! We came straight back down as it was rammed, no tables available until for around an hour and a half and it was booming with house music. Not for us-we wanted to relax and chat over a few drinks with some cool background tunes. This was just not 'us' and was clearly the place for the IT crowd to party and be seen.

We headed back down to the lobby bar and had a glass of champagne there and then the concierge kindly booked us a table round the corner for a late night meal-Chicetti Italian absolutely gorgeous. 

The beds were like clouds and I wanted to take the duvet and pillows home but sadly we couldn't work out how to turn off the mood lighting and had to sleep with the light on which wasn't the best sleep-when we mentioned it to the reception the next morning they apologised and gave us complimentary breakfast which was a nice touch. Had we not have been home late and tired we would have worked out the you use the control panel. Oops!

The bathroom was gorgeous, modern and clean, with lots of nice toiletries, hairdryer and robes.

Breakfast the next day was fab with anything you wanted including pancakes, full English, fresh fruit and pastries. Lovely staff took your order, cleared you plates as soon as you had finished and made u fantastic coffee. 

Lastly the concierge service were the stars of the show-getting us a taxi, booking us a restaurant, printing off a voucher I needed, charging a phone...nothing was a problem and they were charming, polite and professional. Thank you!

I would definitely stay here again because of the fantastic staff and location however although it was really modern and posh it didn't maybe suit us. More for the young, it crowd party people and we are only early thirties! I think we would have preferred somewhere less party people and more quiet. Thanks for a lovely stay.",4,2016,11,27
148,Will return,"First time trying this boutique hotel that is by the Strand/Aldwych.

Arrived at 9am and they gave me a room despite the very early check in - that was a good start.  Room was not huge but more than big enough for me staying alone and bathroom was decent sized.  Window was small but you don't expect any view anyway when the room is overlooking the Strand.  

What you pay for is the service and the location and for me both was good. Staff was consistently friendly and helpful and being a short walk from Covent Garden was superb.  Only short walks to the Covent Garden or Temple tube stations and bus stop is just a few mins away which had buses going to Bond Street, Regent Street, Knightsbridge, Victoria etc which was convenient.  

Breakfast was decent and ground floor hotel bar was nice place for an evening drink.  All in all it was a good choice and I will go back and stay there again.  ",4,2016,11,26
148,AMAZING EXPERIENCE ,"stayed one night for a night, a break from the hustle of family life. Can't be faulted, hotel reception is a must see, as is a visit to the Radio Bar, rooms are amazing as is the attentive service. Christmas Lights were in so view from the room was such a special treat. All in all a must go! ",4,2016,11,24
148,ME HOTEL IS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO STAY SUPERB!!!!," Superb hotel, location is ideal, radio bar was major plus we throughly enjoyed our time at the hotel, staff all very friendly and made us feel welcome throughout our stay...definitely returning with other members of the family.  Thank you.",5,2016,11,22
148,Stylish hotel with good location,"Great hotel, expensive though, with a very good location and high quality. Stylish, friendly and attentive staff, with great bars and dining nearby. Especially appreciate the design and service provided.",5,2016,11,21
148,Great Location for Covent Garden and the Theatre.,"If you are visiting London and not on a budget, I would highly recommend the ME. Rooms are first class, food is excellent and there is a great roof top bar to finish the day off!! If you would like to visit the theatres nearby also ask reception for help.",5,2016,11,18
148,Birthday treat,"Gorgeous hotel with very stylish decor and beautiful attention to detail . Location is great , bang in the centre of the theatre district . Beautiful suites and excellent friendly staff . It was my mums birthday and there was a birthday cake , champagne and a hand written message from the hotel . Lovely touches which made us feel special . My mum doesn't drink so we had asked room service if we could have some alcohol free beer . They didn't have any in the hotel but within half an hour there was a knock at the door with 2 chilled bottles of becks blue . It's this kind of customer service which makes an excellent hotel . Thank you very much and we will definitely be back the next time we are in London . ",5,2016,11,17
148,Love this hotel,"Second time we've stopped here and I wouldn't stop anywhere else. Great location, close to all the theatres and shopping in Covent Garden. Outstanding service from the staff, valet parking brilliant. The rooms are spotless with everything you need. I can't wait to go back. ",5,2016,11,16
148,"Outstanding hotel, we were treated like Royalty","Just back the most incredible stay at the hotel. We were warmly welcomed with glasses of Bubbles and met by the hotel Manager who was very friendly and efficient.
The hotel has a calm, relaxed cool vibe to it, even the guests were very friendly and chatted to us in the lifts!!!
Our room was gorgeous, very cool mood lighting, champagne and a birthday cake and a cute little message written on our mirror.
We spent the night at the Radio roof top bar where we treated with complimentary Champagne again, a perfect table with cuddly blankets and patio heaters with incredible views.
The cocktails were delicious, very drinkable...too drinkable LOL.  Superb atmosphere in the bar where we danced the night away until 2am.
Altogether, I would stay here again and again. The staff and hotel were absolutely fabulous.",5,2016,11,15
148,amazing hotel,I went to ME for my first time. It was an incredible experience. I wish I could repeat it again. The room was very comfortable and the atmosphere really amazing. I hadn¬¥t got any problems there. The staff was very helpful and friendly all the time. The hotel is very modern and smart. ,5,2016,11,15
148,"Chic Hotel, Amazing Staff","I recently stayed here for two nights with my family. The hotel is very modern and stylish design. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were very sleek  and modern albeit a bit on the small side. The location is amazing as you literally have all the theatres and sights of London on your doorstep and we'll as many delicious restaurants. The staff were extremely attentive, kind and helpful. I was really impressed by the service. ",4,2016,11,15
148,Amazing!,well what a Hotel ticked all the boxes the service faultless the room modern funky and the radio bar on the roof great place to relax! only downside is the tv was over complicated and no tea in the room!,5,2016,11,15
148,Beautiful,"My partner booked this hotel for my birthday and it was perfect! They had written a happy birthday message on the mirror, champs and a small cake saying happy birthday. Customer service was generally extremely on point! Best hotel I have stayed in London as of yet. The room is beautiful and modern and the mood lights are to die for I loved every second of my stay!",5,2016,11,15
148,Good at what it does if you like that kind of thing,"The ME is a five star hotel in a great location on the corner of the Strand but it won't suit everyone. Making the most of the limited footprint, reception is on the first floor which is a little disorientating, especially when the whole place is black. It feels a bit like a nightclub that's trying too hard, The rooms of course are white, minimalist, clever and trendy. However, I'd swap the mood lighting and sensor-activated lights on the wardrobe for a proper make-up mirror. I'd rather feel cosy than cool in a room but that's possibly an age thing - I felt this is a place for the hip young crowd and it serves those tastes very well. A few of the fellow business I talked to found the nightclub piped music a bit much. Sound proofing in the room was very good - my room looked out onto the street but I could barely hear in the traffic, in contrast to the Waldorf across the road. Staff are excellent and it wasn't their fault they didn't have a room with a bath - the hotel was completely full - but at ¬£325 per night, I really was hoping for that bath! Breakfast, delivered to the room for a very reasonable (for London) ¬£3.50 was extremely good. The showpiece here is the rooftop bar (open to the public too) with stunning views of London - don't wear sandals with socks though - this is a place to see and be seen by the bright young crowd.",4,2016,11,15
148,I had a good stay in Me London,"I was here for my birthday party, and ME London had surprised me with the cake and also the birthday wish on the mirror. The room was in pink lighting, the atmosphere was very nice. The staffs were very polite and friendly and the service was excellent! I would return and totally recommend any travellers to live in ME London! ",5,2016,11,14
148,Spectacular ,Blown away with the beauty and the incredible service we had here. It was my birthday and the left me a gift in the room of champagne and macaroons...they treat you like ryalty from the moment you enter until you leave. We accidently left keys in the safe and they got them back to us so quickly and efficiently. Highest recommendation ,5,2016,11,13
148,Great location and perfect services,"Lovely hotel, modern, chic, nestled just the right distance from the hustle and bustle of London. I have to say the attention to detail was amazing, the staff were attentive, friendly and welcoming. We were greeted in the lobby by concierge, brought to the reception on the first floor, greeted with glasses of processco and then escorted to our room where we were inducted to the vast array of modern facilities....amazing. a huge thanks to Basem who was helping us in our stay.
The roof top bar provides a lovely view of London, any drink you could want, and great music. Overall a great experience, can't really fault it. If you like modern & trendy, this is the place for you.  one we won't be forgetting anytime soon!",5,2016,11,12
148,Beautiful hotel,This was a gorgeous hotel. Beds were so comfortable. Staff were very pleasant. It was a very modern hotel. You are greeted with a glass of champagne upon check in. Rooftop bar was great. Drinks are expensive but that is expected and they are well worth the cost. It was nice they had reserved seats for hotel guests. Even mid week was very busy there. Would go back in a heartbeat.,5,2016,11,12
148,Excellent bed,"New hotel , great staff and good service,very good and modern room,
The bed and bedding are perfect, breakfast was good, and we asked for a late checkout and received. Thank you . The rooftop bar is very nice and active.
Location is good. ",5,2016,11,10
148,Modern and chic with a fab rooftop bar.,"Although the rooms are dark, as are the corridors, the rooms are airy. We went for a suite, which was probably over priced, but we were on a two day break from the kids. The real gem is the rooftop terrace bar, with great views over to the shard.",4,2016,11,09
148,Super Sleek!,"Very impressed by the modern style and beauty of this hotel!  Love the ""moving"" lobby.  
The touch panel lighting was very nice touch.  The STK restaurant in the hotel was fabulous as well!
I also like the security of having to use my key in the elevator, made me feel safe in a hotel that had a restaurant and a bar in it!",5,2016,11,08
148,Fantastic,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel. The rooms were incredible, as was hotel as a whole. I cannot stress enough how wonderful the staff are. Every single member of staff we met during our stay where more than happy to help with everything, with a smile on there faces. Absolutely wonderful. The breakfast was delicious & the view from the rooftop bar is something I will never forget. Phenomenal. Thankyou for making our weekend so enjoyable.",5,2016,11,06
148,Partners birthday weekend,Very enjoyable stay at ME London. From arrival to departure we were looked after and was a lovely hotel. Beautiful inside and staff very friendly and accommodating. It was my partners birthday and we had champagne foc and happy birthday written on one of the mirrors which I thought was a nice touch! Definitely be staying here again.,5,2016,11,06
148,Amazing experience.,"We were celebrating a very special birthday (due to having a difficult year, which is irrelevant) and the ME hotel staff made sure that our stay was crafted to perfection as soon as at the booking confirmation was received. Everything we kindly asked for was presented amazingly and every detail was immaculate. 
We cannot thank you enough. ",5,2016,11,06
148,Fabulous in every way ! ,"We stayed at the ME to celebrate my husbands birthday and our wedding anniversary. This hotel blew me away. 
It's super sexy with an amazing interior and beautiful rooms. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a passion suite and the hotel had arranged champagne in the room and there were so many lovely touches. 
We stay in lots of hotels but this has surpassed them all. 
Every single detail has been thought of to make the stay comfortable. We had a great night at the Radio rooftop bar. 
The staff ( every single one of them from front of house to housekeeping ) were charming and welcoming. 
The only difficult part was having to leave the ME is now my all time favourite hotel. 
It's flawless !! 

",5,2016,11,06
148,great hotel,"very  recommended , top location. near underground.   i would like the breakfast include in the price of hotel. the room was grate, and everything was good and clean. i would defiantly consider to come back  ",5,2016,11,04
148,WOW,"this was a one night stay for my boyfriends 20th birthday purchased by his father. VERY expensive hotel for youngsters however it was in immaculate condition. Upon arrival there was trouble confirming card details however this was quickly dealt with and resolved. Our room was outstanding with surround sound features even in the bathroom, changing mood lights, comfy bed wonderful toiletries and helpful staff! Location was perfect - less than 8min walk to covent garden in fact this was our primary tube station and great location for theatre also. the roof bar is one of the main qualities although very over priced! however there is a cheaper option accross the street. Trendy, modern and upbeat hotel perfect for business travellers and couple treats!",5,2016,11,04
148,"5* means excellent, this was not.","My expectations of ME were that it would compare favourably with my usual hotel, sadly it did not.  On the plus side the staff were charming and helpful, doing their best to please.  The roof bar had excellent views but there was a cigarette burn on the sofa and when we went inside there was panel missing on the ceiling and evidence of mould, generally the decor was bland and somewhat scruffy.  Design is a matter of personal taste but when everything is black and the lighting very low finding the door to the lavatories was difficult!  Going from the gloom of the hallway into a sun filled room was more promising and at first sight the bedroom looked OK, however on closer inspection it was not cleaned to the standard I would expect, for example the area of carpet along the skirting board was a different shade from the rest because it was covered by a thick layer of dust where it had not been cleaned, the TVs screen was covered in finger marks and the glass screens in the bathroom were smeary and still had whatever had been used to clean them streaked across their surface.  This was decidedly not a 5* experience which was a shame.  Sorry to the nice staff, but there it is!",2,2016,11,04
148,Best hotel in London,"From the minute you walk into the ME you feel in a surreal, relaxed place. Have never had such a smooth, attentive check in before in London! Attention to detail here is amazing from the mood lights to the mini bar! . Will definately be coming here again maybe on a Saturday night instead of a Sunday!",5,2016,11,04
148,"A Hotel, but not as we know it","Not sure if this a 18-30 club with rooms? a shop as there was so much for sale in the bedroom on an open shelf?? ( awful if you have kids as there was liquer and a thong! etc for sale) all complimentary items difficult to find and hidden, cup of tea from coffee machine, which is fine if you know about it, roof top bar was difficult to get to and seemed like a private party, awful strong air freshener smell, a lovely big bed with a big gap in the middle(should have had one big topper not two) lifts complicated, as has separate  lift solely for rooftop bar, but still has buttons for rooms with no explanation, didnt answere phone when i called for room service at around 10 pm, was latet told most staff leave at 8 pm.Would probably suit young couples,NOT families",3,2016,11,02
148,Great service provided by Bob at the Marconi,"I was at the Me London for a meeting. Waited at the Marconi bar in the lobby and was offered exceptional service by Bob. Although i was only waiting for some guests, and was not going to consumer anything, he went the extra mile and offered to bring me a glass of water with lemon. And even better, he came back to refill it. Thank you for your exceptional service. These kind gestures definitely make a difference in hospitality. I will come back next time to try some of your cocktails with a bit more time.",5,2016,11,02
148,"ME, London","ME, London is a nice, modern hotel to stay when in London. the location is very convenient, walking distance to Covent Garden. This hotel has a roof top bar, very nice view of the Theme River and London... 
The lobby is decorated with some interesting scultures.",4,2016,11,01
148,Great location. I did not like the design.,"Location is great, close to the Thames , Covent Garden, Courtald Gallery, theatre shows, good restaurants... I did not like the deisgn of the hotel, is is very dark and seems like a labyrinth. Rooms are OK, not warm or cozy at all. ff The bar at the terrace is  worth a visit. Its view is amazing.",4,2016,11,01
148,Anniversary trip,"A fabulous 2 night stay for our wedding anniversary. 
A fabulous modern hotel. 
Fabulous Staff, very helpful. 
Parked the car and brought it back. Helped with the luggage 
When we arrive and left. Even opened the car door for me. 
",5,2016,11,01
148,Fantastic hotel right by Covent Garden with fantastic roof top restaurant/bar,"This is the ideal location to escape for a special occasion. The entrance is modern and well presented, but the surprise is the checkin, which is amazing by day or night.. will leave that for visitors to see for themselves. 

Once checked in and Prosecco in hand (courtesy of the hotel) we were directed to the rook top restaurant where the views are amazing, the service courteous and the food was great. 

The rooms are not massive, but beautiful in presentation and lighting with all sorts of mini-bar treats on offer.. 

An amazing place right in the heart of Londons Covent Garden.. highly recommended!",5,2016,11,01
148,Hotel rooms and Conference,"I was tasked at work with organising a conference and it is not usually part of my job- after searching for an appropriate venue, i found that the ME hotel was both lovely and reasonably priced. Plus Franziska, the point of contact, was the most helpful person by far that I came across. She made everything easy to organise. Including, but not limited to, offering nice touches to ensure guests felt special such as messages on the mirror on guests arrival, agendas left in reception to be handed to guests on arrival, they made best efforts for early check in where possible, assisted with booking drinks and dinner in the impressive bar and steak restaurant within the hotel, a packed breakfast and the 20 of us really enjoyed out stay and our time at the conference. Highly recommend the venue for a stay or a conference.",5,2016,11,01
148,"Stylish, modern hotel in a great location","This was my second stay at ME London and again I chose it mainly for its location near Covent Garden and the Royal Opera House.

As I was staying for a couple of nights with a friend I decided to go for the Chic Suite, which was certainly a very good choice.  It has a decent sized lounge and bedroom (plus huge bed) and large bathroom with both bath and walk-in shower and separate WC.  Unlike the standard Aura room I booked last time it had plenty of wardrobe space.  The d√©cor is modern with large TVs and touch sensitive controls for the lighting.

It was a nice welcoming touch to have a bottle of champagne waiting in the room on our arrival.

We didn't have dinner in the restaurant but did order some room service, including a disappointing and very small omelette. However, breakfast was good with a pretty wide selection on offer.  We also had a drink at the ever popular and buzzing rooftop bar.

Service was friendly and efficient.",5,2016,10,31
148,Weekend Break,"My partner and i stayed at the hotel for a long weekend getaway in London. The hotel has an excellent location and despite a slightly different check in system where you are shown to the check in desks on another floor the staff made everything smooth. Glass of good Prosecco while checked in by friendly staff.
Room was excellent with great facilities (Mode Room).Used rooftop bar which although expensive is worth the money with great service and views to match. Bar staff were great in the downstairs Marconi Bar and remembered us each time we visited. Excellent location within walking distance of most of central London and friendly door staff / concierge when leaving and returning. Definitely booking for next time we visit London early next year.",5,2016,10,31
148,Good location for Theatre land and Covent Garden,"A nice modern hotel with lots of appealing features. Decent sized room for London and good bathroom. Front of house Staff were very friendly and helpful, restaurants less so. Experience the STK restaurant.",4,2016,10,28
148,Wonderful,"Stayed at the ME for two nights earlier this month, stayed in a mode room overlooking drury lane, on both nights went to the rooftop bar and ate in STK one night. Ordered breakfast in bed both days. Can honestly say couldn't fault anything and the staff were wonderful, they couldn't do enough to help
Planning to stay again in December as wouldn't want to go anywhere else!!
Thank you",5,2016,10,27
148,Admiration of architectural creation,"Œóaving the pleasure to visit the ultimate architectural for the second time was a life time experience ! The visitor have the chanse not to see a modern, well decorated place but also a very friendly and helpfull stuff. 
Is well placed close to subway stations and many theaters and restaurants, the highlight is that it has one of the best restaurants in town, STK London steak and bar restaurantsand also a super view roof bars RADIO bar.
We  stayed in October 2016 for the ocasion of my birthday. They offered a class of champagne to wellcome us.  The room was an excecutive double with plenty of facilities and last type of technology. The bathroom was huge with all kind of necessaries  that we might need  Most importantly though it was extremely clean, the house keepers visited it at least twice a day. I would never thank them (and of course My boyfriend Napoleon)  enough for making my birthday unforgetable!. the had a surprice cake for me at room, a botile of wine and a message at the mirror.
I would definitely recommend and of course i will visit it again.If had to say something that i didn't like was the fact that they had to charge extra for breakfast even though we had an executive room.",5,2016,10,27
148,Crystal Maze!,"From outside this looks dull and like no-one's home, but inside a maze of silver and black corridors!  Very modern interior and I played 'find the door' quite a few times.  Once we did find the restaurant door the setting is lovely and the food and waiting staff were very good.  Only one fault, the bottle of water we ordered was warm, like it had come just out of the tap??  Didn't spoil a good meal and would recommend the restaurant and bar.",4,2016,10,27
148,Great Hotel,"From the moment we arrived for a two night break, we were very well looked after by excellent, attentive staff. We drove and booked parking (parkuphere) which was a bargain and so easy as concierge took care of everything once we handed over the keys to them. The decor is outstanding and so stylish. Reception on the first floor is seamless (complimentary, very drinkable prosecco on arrival) and made our stay even better by upgrading us to an 8th floor terrace room as it was my birthday - along with a bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us in the room too. The room was great, lots of space, double shower, spotless and HUGE bed with luxurious bed linen. 

The rooftop bar is just brilliant and advisable to book if you want one of their outside booth tables with a heater. Great music and attentive staff - great fun. 

Love the ME brand and have stayed at Melia hotels in Mallorca - equally as good. 

Thank you ME London for making our stay so perfect, cannot wait to go back.",5,2016,10,26
148,Wonderful!,"Husband and I stayed here along with some friends for a leisure trip. We were looking for a modern hotel in a good location (near bars and restaurants) and we all loved this place. I can't say a bad thing about it, not to mention you're greeted with Prosecco. The service was excellent, the atmosphere was very sexy, and the rooms are clean and simple. You must go to the rooftop lounge, Radio. They have good drinks, great views of London and deep, sexy house music. Next time we're in London we will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,10,25
148,"ME,On the Strand.","Excellent Hotel, from Concierge meeting us outside to park the car, to check out, all good. 
Radio bar and stk Restaurant excellent. Concierge Boys really, good, nice chat about cars. Very knowledgable.",5,2016,10,25
148,Amzing Anniversary Weeken!,I cannot emphasis enough how amazing this hotel is! From checking in to checking out the entire experience was fantastic. As it was out anniversary weekend ME went the extra mile and supplied a anniversary cake and bottle of champagne to celebrate the occasion. Thank you for a unforgettable stay ME London :),5,2016,10,25
148,pre paid valet parking,"This was an amazing little find pre parking for all day right in the heart of London.
concierge was friendly and helpful perhaps the easiest way to park in central London.
seems a bit pricey but street parking around this hotel is ¬£ 4.50 an hour so the ¬£26 for all day meant that after 5 hours this safe and secure parking was paying for its self. we needed parking close to the theatre as we were treating my aged mother in law to a day out and lion king matinee . this is literally over the road and 50 yards away from the lyceum theatre. 
highly recommended",5,2016,10,24
148,A luxury boutique feeling,"I really loved ME London. It's really not very easy to achieve a boutique hotel atmosphere in a place like this, but ME succeeds. Quite, comfortable and very luxurious and modern in a way I really like. Definitely staying here in my future trips to London.",5,2016,10,22
148,Great time at the ME.,"Great experience for my birthday and visiting family.  Close to museums, transportation and decent restaurants.  Excellent service from door to room.  Breakfast was also excellent.  Updated full English breakfast I had every day!",5,2016,10,21
148,"1 week vacation, first time in London","Absolutely loved staying at this fun hotel. The staff was excellent. Although they get first time visitors every day, they never seem bothered and always anxious to help.
The location was perfect.We could walk to several of the main attractions as well as the markets, restaurants, theatres and pubs. Only a few blocks to the tube. Exciting neighborhood!

The room was smaller than US rooms but modern and sufficient. No dresser, but we survived. 
No pool or hot tub on site but I'm told not common in UK hotels. Excellent shower and bathroom.
 
The roof-top Radio Club at the ME is a must visit both day and night for the great city views.
I saw reviews from some, complaining that hotel guests received no priority to this very popular and often crowded club. Well I think management followed through on their promise and corrected this. We were given priority when they recognized us as hotel guests. Thank you Michael !!I

Absolutely loved this vacation and the ME Hotel was a big part. Thank you all.",5,2016,10,21
148,This place is incredible!,"I visited a friend who was staying here for a few nights in London with her partner - it's very stylish and defninitely a unique experience! You actually take the lift up a floor to reach reception, which has a light show (!) and a bar. All the decor inside the corridors and rooms are sleek and modern, and everything in the room screamed luxury. Their customer service is good too - they were polite, courteous and patient with our requests, and my friend was even given a free bottle of bubbly! There is a rooftop bar which was a great way to spend an evening - lovely views of London and nice cocktails. Location-wise it's in a fantastic part of the city, near lots of the main attractions and shops/restaurants in Covent Garden etc. It's obviously not the most budget-friendly place to stay but our visit was certainly memorable - I'd say if you can afford to stay here without breaking the bank, go for it!",5,2016,10,21
148,Very trendy hotel,"This is a very contemporary hotel, set in close proximity to Covent Garden. The Radio bar on the roof has a great vibe and made a mean mojito. The rooms are well laid out and comfortable and ours had a great view over London. We ate at their restaurant STK and it was brilliant, one of the best steaks I have eaten and the service was excellent.",5,2016,10,21
148,"Fantastic hotel . Clean, comfy and peaceful","The hotel was clean , well presented, modern , great value for money , I will most definitely stay here again very soon for some Christmas shopping, the roof to bar has great cocktails which I ran down the list  :) ",5,2016,10,19
148,Great Staff,"Our overall experience was excellent.  The hotel is interesting, well laid out and comfortable.  The staff were all excellent and looked after us at all times.  Very pleasant interlude and would definitely recommend.",5,2016,10,19
148,"A great central London hotel, with friendly staff that go the extra mile","All of the staff at the Melia in the Strand are incredibly friendly and efficient, nothing is too much effort. 
We stayed in October 2016, tour second stay this year. 
The level of service with a smile is given, right from the reception staff, to room maids and  bar staff.
We will be back for sure.
Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2016,10,19
148,"Outstanding Service, Beautiful Hotel & Top Notch Facilities","I recently held some meetings at the ME. The service I received was impeccable; all of the staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything ran smoothly. I must give an extra special mention to Franzi our onsite event coordinator who's attention to detail and level of service made my job so easy - thank you! This has now become all of the delegates‚Äô favourite venue in London, we shall return!",5,2016,10,19
148,Amazing weekend,"Great hotel, very modern. Booked it for a surprise weekend for my wife. Got free upgrade on check in. Bar on roof nice(Radio) , but was too full. Rooms are so smart. Breakfast was buffet and varied - really nice. Made for an amazing weekend. ",5,2016,10,17
148,5* at its best ,"Amazing !   We loved the ME

We celebrated a triple birthday for 2 nights and had the best time 

Service throughout the hotel is first class and the hotel and staff should be very proud 

You get what you pay for and it's worth every penny",5,2016,10,16
148,Serious Downtown,"We spent 3 nights at ME in September.  The roof top Radio bar was a great place to unwind, with a stellar view over the city.  The interiors of the hotel are very high-design, urbane and sophisticated.  The room was decent sized, nicely tricked out.  We had a room with a patio, with view over city, which was a nice plus.  Radio bar is still somewhat of a scene, with loud music thumping away in the evening.  The location is good, just south of the theatre district, with many excellent restaurants in the area.  Many good things to see in walking distance.  We will definitely be back.",5,2016,10,15
148,"Amazing hotel, best in deed in Europe","I thoroughly recommend you the lifestyle Hotel,  the location is amazing, just 2 minutes away from Covent Garden and from river Thames, it s at the centre of London. The rooms are huge and the cozy bed is very comfortable, the bathroom is fantastic with a highly pressurised water shower and a hot tub. The breakfast is unbelievable, there is every type of food you can imagine. The service is as well awesome, the decoration is contemporary and modern. It is a luxurious hotel and if you come to London, stay at ME London, you will not regret it.",5,2016,10,15
148,Stylish Hotel with great location,This super modern hotel lives up to expectations but spoils the experience but over charging in all its bars and restaurants. A typical meal for 2 with wine in its STK steakhouse will cost over ¬£200 and drinks tend to be over ¬£10 each plus everything carries a service charge. ,4,2016,10,14
148,Fantastic time at ME London,"From the moment I arrived, everything about my stay at ME London was terrific.  Angelo greeted me upon arrival and from that point, ensured any question would be answered and followed through.  The food in every restaurant was spectacular and Friday and Sunday evenings at Radio were quite fun.  Rooms were clean and housekeeping very attentive.  Design of the hotel was beyond excellent.  I will definitely come back my next London Trip.",5,2016,10,13
148,Good but a bit too stressful,"Dont get me wrong, it's a great hotel. Very central, very modern and the rooms are amazing. Everything is very swanky so I'm just going to focus on the things i didnt like:

- the corridors are too dark. I understand it's a design trend but I find it very useless and disorienting
- it's really difficult to find the breakfast restaurant.
- the restaurant STK is too noisy, you cant hear the people you are talking to.",4,2016,10,13
148,Birthday Treat,"Very contemporary in all aspects of design. Staff attentive and helpful to the right level. Champagne on arrival. STK restaurant was excellent with top menu choice and standard of cooking. Main courses were pork and bouillabaisse - both very very good. Waiter was friendly and efficient. Ended the meal with a Tia Maria coffee which was the best I have had in a long time.
Our balcony room was very well equipped but not so big. Comfortable bed. Great bathroom.
Excellent stay and will probably go back.",5,2016,10,12
148,Everything you need,"I have been in London several times, but recently stayed at Me London, and it exceeded my expectations. Location is perfect, close to Covent Garden, with several pubs and good restaurants nearby. The room was very spacious, what is not common in London. Big bed and a complete bathroom, with everything you may need. Breakfast was very good, and if you like to party, the rooftop bar is always busy, with a spectacular view of the city. Last but not least, the hotel staff was always very friendly and trying to help. A fantastic hotel, in central London. I will most certainly return.",5,2016,10,12
148,beyond expectations,"upon arrival to the ME we were impressed from the start, valet parking and bags taken to the room. check in was simple and easy, reception was stunning with the door into the amazing STK just to the left as you walk in. up to the room and the smell of the corridors was amazing, into the room and it was flawless, bathroom almost behind secret doors and the bedroom was modern and stunning. ample space and more than enough treats in the minibar to choose from. we were greeted into the rooftop bar later for drinks and did not have a table reserved but they accommodated us when they knew we were staying in the hotel. 

all round amazing!",5,2016,10,12
148,All you can expect from a perfect hotel in London,"We really enjoyed this great modern and fashionable hotel, with excellent facilities.
From its great location to the comfortable design of the rooms, and the nice views from the upper terrace.
But overall, the warmness kindness and helpfulness of the personnel.
Totally recommended whether you travel in couple, business or family.",5,2016,10,12
148,Fantastic Central London Break,"Loved our stay here, could not fault the service, from check in to check out they were helpful friendly and efficient.

Rooms are small but it is central London, they are very well fitted out, the mini bar is amazing, bed very comfortable and the mood lighting great fun.  Bathroom is very big and again well appointed great shower! 

The reception atrium is amazing looking up to the skylight, so modern and just gorgeous so impressed, welcome glass of prosecco was another nice touch.  

super quiet rooms no noise from the road or the bar or the rooms next door so a great quality of sleep.

Walking distance to Covent Garden theater district and plenty of restaurants.

Would stay again next time in London.",5,2016,10,10
148,Boys night out,We stayed here on a boys night out. It was exquisite. Lush is an understatement. We are all had a wonderful time. Service was beautiful. Atmosphere was grand. All in all it was a perfect London stay in Luxurious hotel ,5,2016,10,10
148,Absolutely Fabulous Hotel and Exceptional Staff,"We spent 2 weeks at the Me on the Strand.  This hotel was the perfect place to stay.  It is within walking distance of Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, the London Eye and so many more London sights.  The hotel staff was outstanding.  Everyone we encountered was pleasant and helpful and made us feel very welcome.  Our room was fantastic and it was the quietest hotel room I have ever stayed in.  Even though our room overlooked the busy Strand, we heard no traffic noise and no noise from other hotel guest. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.",5,2016,10,09
148,Exceptional Hotel,"I love this hotel.  It is perfectly located in the theatre district.  Within walking distance to many of the major London attractions.  When I return to London, this where I will stay.  The staff are amazing and the hotels itself it fantastic.  I highly recommend.",5,2016,10,08
148,Loved my stay!,This hotel is only couple of blocks from the London Eye and across the street from shopping and many dining options. I enjoyed my stay because it was such a central location in london close to anywhere I wanted to go. The service and the staff were awesome and can't wait to stay there again!,5,2016,10,06
148,Perfect Location- Posh in Every way,"The ME Hotel in London was the perfect location for the theater, great restaurants and seeing the London sites. It was across the street to the hop-on-hop-off  Bus tour and other sites and great restaurants were in walking distance. Covenant Garden was a short walk away. Service was perfection and the rooms were luxurious.  We enjoyed our stay very much.",5,2016,10,05
148,Week night stay,"Lovely hotel, with good service. Hotel and Rooms have a very modern feel to them. Would definitely stay again.

Radio bar on the roof offers some lovely views of London. Went in the after for a meeting in the afternoon then later for drinks. Both times the place had a buzzy atmosphere. Drinks are reasonably expensive but then it's a bar in a london hotel so it's to be expected. Went ",5,2016,10,03
148,"Lovely hotel, good location - thin walls","Stayed here for 1 night, it's a bit odd because you have to go up to get to reception rather than it being in the lobby, but when you get to the room they're really well furnished with HUGE comfy beds.
The walls can be a little thin but apart from that it was a very good 5* hotel

Breakfast was a little average, nothing ground breaking - pastries could be a bit better, selection could be a little wider.",4,2016,10,03
148,Lovely but a bit over priced,"The over all look and feel of the hotel was good. Greeted with complementary prosecco upon arrival and the bags taken to the room. 
Many reviews on here say the staff were rude, but I found quite the opposite. Very friendly and polite, very approachable. 
Breakfast in the morning was very good, lots of choice and very tasty. Very impressed with the variety of milks and bread options (vegan, GF).
The room we had was the basic one, a bit small but absolutely stunning views of the city from the balcony. Bathroom was very nice, great rainfall shower and nice toiletries. The celling was a bit shabby, and the media system in the room didn't seem to work properly (we requested someone come to have a look for us which they said they would do but none ever turned up).
Roof top bar was good - but again let down by saying they'd booked us a table then when we got there, spending over ¬£30 on two drinks were told there was no table. Then having to kick up a bit of a fuss which eventually led them to producing said booked table. Great views from up there - worth a visit if you can.
Over all, a very good stay. Great location, lovely staff, rooms could be better but compensated by fabulous views. A tad over priced but an enjoyable night in London!",4,2016,10,02
148,Good hotel in central location,"My stay at Me hotel in London/SoHo was a pleasant one. The service was good, friendly & professional. The rooms are comfortable & very quiet. The rooftop bar has a killer view of the River Thames & much of London.",4,2016,10,01
148,Radio Rooftop Bar,"Fabulous views, Great Sunset spot over London! Trendy, drinks, Cocktails, Wine, Small Plates, Tapas, music, lively atmosphere. Lots of young people and some ""young"" oldies like us!!!  Enjoyed the birds eye views! Could see the London Eye, St Pauls, The Shard, BT Tower, Big Ben and right above the Strand, Theatres and the streets of London.",5,2016,09,30
148,Great modern hotel!,"Lovely hotel, really modern and clean with all amenities. Mini bar had lots of choice. 

AMAZING roof top bar is a must - a spectacular view! 

Great location can easily walk to Covent Garden and even Waterloo station across the bridge if you wanted to. 

Would go back!

Only down side was that some staff didn't seem very happy or willing to help. Others were brilliant though. ",5,2016,09,29
148,Trendy,"For anyone early 30s and under this hotel is amazing. So trendy and modern. Radio Rooftop bar is very lively, and steak dinner in STK is lovely.

Rooms are small but the overall rating of the hotel is amazing. Staff were attentive and helpful.

Definitely glad to have tried, but prefer the hotel to the actual room itself.

Location is ideal as close walk to theaters and Covent Garden.

Hotel decor is amazing.",5,2016,09,28
148,Amazing,"Very impressed, very fancy and staff was friendly and approachable, very helpful. Only stayed one night, and plans for that evening had changed, but made the most of our night in ME London hotel, absolutely loved our room, and would 100% stay again.",5,2016,09,28
148,What a finding this was!,"Visited London last March for a week as a 15th birthday request from our daughter. Arrangements to get there were easy... trying to fit a location/budget with a hotel was a different story. Call it our introduction to the British Pound. Thanks to an Expedia offering, we opted to bundle the ME Hotel, never realizing what a jewel of a place we were getting into regarless of all the hoopla that accompanied it. Once there, we realized our location at The Strand was  just one block away from the Waterloo Bridge (access to the other side of the river), less than ten minute walk to many underground stations all around, and sorrounded by theaters, restaurants and entertainment- yet without all the big town noise. A short description of this place would have to incorporate centric, modern, minimalist with easy access to the City either on foot or public transportation. It displays a marvelously quiet and personalized lobby on the second floor, wonderfull gastronomical offerings and a superb view of the City from their rooftop bar with a mix of drinks and tapas. Cucina Asellina, which triples as a breakfast, lunch and dinner option has a strong menu for each occassion staffed by a very warm and professional personnel. Access to the rooftop bar, which draws big crowds from around the City, enjoys a separate elevator, thus eliminating the elevetor competition for hotel guests. You will appreciate a consistently friendly and attentive staff at all levels of endeavor, including the casual but always present security personnel. ME Hotel offers a great number of hardcore London attractions on foot and within minutes.      ",5,2016,09,27
148,Staff at ME bent over backwards to help customers 5*,"This was the first time I have stayed ant the ME but definitely won't be my last. I did not book direct with the hotel, but through a booking agent and had nothing but problems and when I contacted the agent they sort of brushed me off and washed there hands of me.( Booking.com ) Anyway after contacting Me by email the next day gentleman  promptly called me back and couldn't do enough to help me sort out the problem there and then. That alone tells you it's the sort of place you would want to stay at and when i arrived your looked after from the start, I would like to thank all the staff there and the room was top class, you can see  why this Hotel has 5***** 
Thank you for a lovely welcome stay from me a me 6 year old daughter whom also loved staying there.",5,2016,09,25
148,Amazing hotel. Worth the money,"Recently visited the hotel on business, from the moment you walk into the hotel you can't help but be impressed by the decor and architecture. 

The Radio Bar on the top floor is a most impressive location to enjoy drinks and conversation in one of the best settings I've been to. 

If you visit London and want somewhere special to visit, especially if you doing a show you have to visit the ME London!",5,2016,09,25
148,Cocktails!!!!,"We spent a good few hours sipping cocktails and watching the day turn to dusk. Think we went through most of the menu. Great service, nice atmosphere. Great views. Would highly recommend as the sun goes down for the views.",5,2016,09,23
148,Me London,Very nice and contemporary hotels. Rooms are almost too sleek. Not one drawer in the room and a really small closet to put things away. The rest of the property is very nice and it is in a great area. Very central and not too close to the real touristy areas that can become obnoxious. ,4,2016,09,22
148,Design excellence,"What an impression this gives the first time you walk inside. The location is good for sightseeing, art galleries, shopping, with a lot in walking distance.
The staff are helpful and smooth operaters, nothing was too much trouble, even if we were!
Our room was sleek, finished with taste and comfortable to stay in. The roof top bar and terrace is beyond stunning with views far and wide. We were here to visit the Royal opera house and it was a five minute amble.
If we have a reason to visit London we usually don't stay over night, having stayed here it made the day into a mini break so would definitely do the same again.",5,2016,09,22
148,Great night in luxury,"My husband and I stayed at the ME London for a kid free night. Was perfect. The hotel smells amazing, the staff are professional, the rooms are small, but really high quality. The Radio Bar (rooftop) is great for early evening cocktails - great views of London. We did not eat at STK, but know it from other cities, and enjoyed a post dinner drink at the bar. All around great hotel n a great location. 

Only frustration was how slow the lifts are! Leave a good ten minutes in advance.",5,2016,09,22
148,Beyond perfection,"I decided to stay in Me London cause I was going to stay 2 weeks in London and I wanted a lovely place to stay and relax at the end of the day. Everything was perfect, the room, the bed, the pillows, the views... The room service: every night when my husband and I arrive at the hotel: two bottles of free water, chocolates, chill out music and romantic lights. The wifi very good, the staff, all of them so kind! Music everywhere! And the experience in the Rooftop bar was stunning! We enjoyed warm days drinking white wine on that rooftop twice with one of the best views of the city. I truly recommend this hotel and undoubtedly we will come back soon.",5,2016,09,21
148,Thrilling London,"Had a wonderful stay at the he ME London. Excellent service and ambiance. Great value for the money. Only draw back is the rooftop bar which was overcrowded and service was not to standard. However the views are spectacular, even better than the eye.",4,2016,09,20
148,Favourite hotel!,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for my 21st birthday! It's in a great location, and too say it's a lot more reasonable prices than some of the hotels I couldn't fault a single thing! They couldn't do enough for you and service for me is that makes a hotel great other than the fact it is absolutely stunning and nothing like I've seen before! Having STK and the radio rooftop in your hotel is great but make sure you book! 

Thank you for an amazing weekend!",5,2016,09,20
148,Stunning ,"I am a big fan of ME hotels and this did not disappoint. From the moment you walk in you are made to feel special. Prosecco on arrival is a nice touch and the reception area is stunning. Cracking room, amazing views from rooftop bar. Great location on The Strand where we could walk everywhere we needed to go. ",5,2016,09,19
148,One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in!  Exceptional venue!,"I attended ME Hotel for a business conference and can honestly say it's one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in.  This is a very classy and elegant hotel, the food is superb, and the staff are excellent.
We ate in the restaurant  (sorry I can't remember the name) however lots of us ordered steak as the waiter said it ""was the best steak in town"".  Now saying that in London is quite a statement, however we weren't disappointed, and we were a large party of 25 people.  I would go as far as saying it's one of the nicest steaks I've had in a restaurant !
The sound proofing they have is amazing!  My room was on the second floor, facing onto the street and I didn't hear a sound from outside!  Great for light sleepers!
The rooftop bar is a great place to enjoy the views over London City on a pleasant evening!  I would definitely recommend this hotel and I hope to return!   One minor negative is the dark decor which can be challenging if you have any sort of visual impairment.",5,2016,09,17
148,Not as good as previous visits,"We arrived here having been before. The main reason we stay here is for the rooftop bar which is very good. However upon arrival I was informed that there was a private function on and we would not be able to use the bar that evening and were then told that there were other bars in the hotel !!! Not great comfort.

We had a red DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door which was ignored by Two maids who bounded into the room. Having being the victim of hotel room theft previously in another hotel I simply dont allow maids in if I am on a short break. I informed the manager of this and told him that the maids then removed the DO NOT DISTURB sign. He said he would sort this straight away. Then upon our return yet again we found that the maids had, once again been in the room.

Room service breakfast was simply a joke, I asked for over easy eggs and they turned up raw. Quickly sent back the breakfast came back for a second time with no butter for the toast, no beans on the breakfast and the rest was cold, there was even no teabag in the teapot, just hot water. Although I was informed I would not be charged the ¬£35 this was little comfort.

This time our room was on the 9th floor and sleep was impossible until after the bar closed at 2am.

Overall disappointed on this visit , the service just was not there, certainly instead of last time when I would describe the hotel as WOW, This time I would describe it as just average.",4,2016,09,17
148,Beautiful!!!,"This was my first time at the ME.  I loved it.  It was in a great location and easy to walk to sites or to take the tube.  It is a few blocks to the Thames River.  I love how modern it is.  All employees were very professional and helpful.  The room was immaculate and bright. 
Thank you for a memorable stay!!!
",5,2016,09,15
148,Great location ,Great location among many of the theatres.  Also a quick walk over the Waterloo Bridge and easy access to the tubes.  Room was very comfortable and soundproofed so I got a good nights sleep after being jet lagged.,5,2016,09,14
148,Modern Black Decor difficult for vision-challenged traveller. Techno to a fault.,"Great location, wonderful, well-trained staff, clean and modern to a fault.  Decor and architecture were difficult for me, vision-challenged and disabled. Everything inside the room functioned well, but understanding the electronic keypad for choices was challenging and frustrating.  Had to call staff several times for advice or help. Black marble hallways, ceilings painted flat black. Even though the elevator takes one to the ground floor for breakfast, there are several steps to climb to get to the breakfast room. It was OK for me, with a cane but Not for anyone in a wheelchair!  My room was well-designed for one needing wheelchair accessibility, # 418. Room was large with porcelain-white walls that were meant to be backlit with the many (100 color choices) keypad- activated mood lightings. (It was a family member, also staying at the hotel,same floor,  who was tech savvy, that  could figure out the controls for me.) The ME London is far from user-friendly. Without their good staff, I would have been stuck. Was ""Too Much"" for this  weary, jet-lagged guest to sort out once the bellman had departed. 
I suppose the hotel could send room service for those who could not access the dining room.  Room service was OK  but menu and flexibility fall short.  To accompany a Caesar Salad with chicken, I asked for a dinner roll or French Bread.  They had none, offered to toast a slice of sandwich bread. ( Had had multigrain bread, rolls and other  bread options at the dining room, at breakfast.  Strange that Room Service hasn't access to the same foodstufs.)  A fine hotel location, near two tube stations and busses stop outside the door, across the street. Great staff, always cheerful. (Paid for their excellent car&driver  to meet us at LHR as we arrived evening, a friendly attentive man who guided us to the car then pointed out landmarks as we traversed the city.) Stayed four nights because of special rates that were prepaid or would have moved for more traditional well-lit hotel.",4,2016,09,13
148,Absolutely amazing!,"This review is a little late as I stayed at Me London with my boyfriend on the 19th August. But I have to say this was the best experience I could of dreamed of. As my boyfriend and I were celebrating our birthdays together we decided to stay here, and they exceeding our expectations. From the moment we walked in to the moment we check out the service was outstanding. Upon arrival we were greeted by every worker we walked by which was pleasant. At the lobby we were offered a drink (I had Prosecco, My boyfriend had Orange Juice) and then we were escorted to our room. The lovely lady explained how to use the air con and made us feel very welcome. We were given a complimentary bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and a lovely message was written on the mirror to mark our birthday. After returning to the room later on it had been tidied up, mood lights and music had been put on and chocolates were placed on the pillows which was a nice touch. In the morning we were served breakfast in bed which was delicious and we ordered it when we wanted it. (We also attended the rooftop bar and STK but I will speak about that in another review.) I could go on but overall this was the best birthday we had both ever had and a big part of it was the service at the hotel and the standard they uphold. I will without a doubt be returning to experience this again, it was truly amazing! Thank you!",5,2016,09,12
148,Very stylish interesting hotel.,"We got the pleasure of staying in this hotel. A young professional team is working very well. All our requests were solved almost immediately.
Propositions can only add that it is necessary to increase the assortment in a pillow menu. 
",5,2016,09,11
148,My favourite place in London,"By far the best place to stay in London - I couldn't imagine a better room or service experience in the city. The meals were superb and the area is walking distance to the best theatres, attractions, restaurants and retail therapy.",5,2016,09,10
148,August Bank Holiday,An excellent time at a wonderful hotel as always and a special commendation for Demetri (Manager Front of House) who first of all remembered us and second helped to make our Bank Holiday break fabulous.,5,2016,09,09
148,Fabulous hotel experience,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the ME London in August.  My husband and I stayed for a few nights for our anniversary.  We were greeted with Prosecco at check in. 
The staff was amazing.  Every staff member we encountered was above and beyond accommodating.  Special thanks to Ronan and Arman at the concierge desk for all their recommendations and arranging reservations for theater, restaurants, etc.  We mentioned on our way out one evening that we were celebrating our anniversary and when we came back to our room they had left a lovely note, bottle of wine, and chocolates.  
Our room was excellent.  Very modern.  We did have a balcony room.  May depend which side of the hotel you are on but we did not have any trouble with noise from the Radio bar mentioned by other guests.  
The Radio rooftop bar was also excellent.  Very busy but as hotel guests have preferential entry.  Wonderful for a last drink or two at the end of the night.  
Location also very good.  Very close to Thames river with lovely walk along the river to most tourist sights.  Near decent shopping, all theaters, and tons of great restaurants.  
Overall can not say enough about the fantastic experience we had at the ME London.  Well done!",5,2016,09,08
148,Sublime Sublime Sublime,"I stayed here on a biz trip..a while back....simply amazing. 

The entry foyer is on the first floor and has an amazing atrium that runs the full height of the hotel to the roof skylight. Me as a photographer wanted to grab a shot of this so later in the night I came back and asked if they could kill the lights and let me take a shot lying flat on the ground ....they did....thats service!

It has a bar on the roof, super trendy, worth a visit for the vistas of gorg london town",5,2016,09,08
148,Great Location,"We started our holiday in the UK here. Stayed for 2 nights. It was good place to recuperate from jet lag. It is located at The Strand and Waterloo Bridge - a short walk to Trafalger Square and many other great spots. The check in lobby is something to behold. Stark and modern, it resembles the interior of a pyramid with a  glass roof top to let the light in - very striking. The hallways felt too dark - low lit and black walls, but the rooms are bright and light.

We were offered a handicapped room to get additional square footage - don't do it. The extra space goes into the bathroom to make accommodations and it's a strange layout for someone who doesn't need the modifications. Our boys had the same level of room that was non-handicapped equipped and it was a better use of space for 2 people (2 full size sinks, normal shower with glass door instead of curtain etc.).

The room itself was an adequate size and had a balcony. You could see patches of The Thames, The London Eye - nice to have - room 817. I'd go for a similar room with a balcony and skip the ""extra square footage."" It's white and modern. Felt clean and fresh. Our boys stayed in 517 which was almost identical, except for the bathroom and no balcony.

Breakfast was included and was okay - buffet. Didn't order off the menu, might have had a different experience with the food. Nice fresh squeezed OJ. Staff were super friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the central location and modern vibe. Their rooftop bar and STK restaurant seems to cater to a 20's and 30's crowd. 

Overall a fun, central spot.",4,2016,09,07
148,My stay at the ME London,"Me and my wife had a wonderful stay at the hotel the room we stayed in was superb and very clean and the staff made you feel very special and could not do enough for you, from front of house to the reception staff and cleaners the location is excellent for the theatre and restaurants around Covent Garden also I just wish I could have stayed longer. 
",5,2016,09,07
148,Absolutely amazing! ,"I browsed for ages and then decided for this hotel Il be honest but I couldn't be any happier. This place was stunning! Worth every penny I paid! My girlfriend was over the moon with this place! I will be definitely back! Staff are brilliant, 
thank you! ",5,2016,09,06
148,Summary: Choose if you don't care about being close to the businesses areas and want to have effortless nightlife. It's,"The location: As this is my first time in London, I'm learning that the SE end of Convent Garden is not the most convenient or the touristy for the business traveler, as most might prefer to stay in Mayfair or Kensington. That said, it's removed enough from that nonsense to be quite a different and pleasant experience. I love that it's close to the Sanctuary Spa. As most check in in this city is 3pm and most Americans are landing early in the morning, this is the perfect spot to sleep off your jet lag and still feel you've done something... if you're a lady, as it's a very short stroll away (lady's only). If you're a dude... sorry... haven't been here long enough yet to figure out a nice solution for you

For joggers: Great runs available along the Thames. There is actually a running store extremely close by in case you forgot to bring gels or blocks. They will not have chocolate though. Something weird I found was that all the brands that sell chocolate in the states don't do so overseas, except for Gu..... Odd....

Amenities: The basement, windowless gym downstairs few treadmills and similar equipment. There is no on-sight spa facility, but the Sanctuary Spa (on Floral Street) is likely the best bet. This place is all about the bar options. The rooftop has lovely 360 views and requires a fairly long wait. Guests have advantages, though it can be rough on the truly busy nights. Reception has a lovely little meeting bar and the walls light up to make you feel as if you're inside an aquarium. The downstairs bar appears to be quiet happening until late in the evening. The entry way bar is fantastic as well if you're meeting a large group of friends or clients. WiFi works well in the hotel and is fairly hassle free. No silly charge or anything. 

The rooms: I got upgraded to a vibe room. The look is quite modern. I love the padded leather walls and sleep modern furnishings. The windows are quite modern and overlook lovely views. Quarters are a bit tight, but to be expected... I think. The linens are extremely comfy. I love the large king size feather pillows. They really do have just the right fluff. The sheets are clearly higher thread count. I always like white linens as you know if ""something"" happened and mine were quite clean.

The one thing that is a bit odd is the electric plugs. So in the bathroom, the plugs appeared not to be able to accept the larger energy output of a hair dryer or curling iron. Instead, I came out to the bedroom area and did this activity in front of the desk mirror. On the one hand, this isn't so bad because the lighting is actually better there for make-up etc. However, if you're using this as a work desk then it's a bit of a hassle to also turn it into a vanity. this also indicates that a dude designed the bathroom in the vibe rooms, e.g. the light is not ideal for putting on make-up.

The showers are nice... but alas, no tub in the vibe rooms. As a jogger who also found London to be cold this was a drawback. However, if you are more a shower person, the shower is a really nice, high end zero gravity overhead type, so you should be happy.

I like the use of Apivita products. It's particularly awesome that they have a facial milk cleanser that works as an eye make-up remover. Huge bonus to have legitimate stuff to use on your face.

Service: The rooms are well kept with a nice chocolate during turn down. While maid services does a good job cleaning and generally tidying, they don't take that extra step that some of the highest end 5 star places do. At some places, the maids are OCD and will even tidy your make-up neatly as if it were a store display. Same thing with any papers on a desk or items on a table. Oddly, my maid at home does this and I love it! Here, it's more just leaving your stuff as you left it, with minor pick-up and cleaning of trash.

I would mention the concierge, porters and reception were quite amazing. It's a bit hard to call down and get in touch with them though during the busiest bar hours as they end up taking a ton of calls for reservations upstairs. That's a little annoying, but if you go downstairs and find them they are lovely.

Worth a stay if you're visiting alone and this happens to work as a location for your purposes.",4,2016,09,06
148,"Good Hotel, great location, very friendly staff","We spent a long week end at the beginning of september. I ve booked an Energy Urban room. At the arrival we have been kindly offered an upgrade to an Energy River Room which was actually 2 classes higher however it has been said it s a special room for the disabled. The view to the river was fantastic however the room was ""scratched"" all over the place and it had various amenities for the disabled which we didnt need therefore I ve requested to change the room. A very kind Lady at the reception was very helpfull and given us a Mode room instead. The room is bigger then normal room and is much bigger then the Energy rooms but instead of terrace a small window which is probably the only disadvantage. For the rest a wonderful stay.",4,2016,09,06
148,Lovely stay,"Just had a 2 night stay at this hotel, breakfast included, I must say it was lovely nothing s too much trouble for the staff. Went the radio roof bar Friday and Saturday , there door staff were nice, we didn't book a table or anything the staff were fine with letting us in. The hotel is on no way pretentious, I think good service can be confused with pretentious, anyway our room was lovely and clean bed was fabulous, will come back and stay here in December üëç",5,2016,09,04
148,Sleek and stylish hotel but no breakfast included...,"I stayed for one night at ME London and I enjoyed my stay. I stayed in the Aura room which came with a double bed. The bathroom had a twin sink, toilet and shower. There was no bathtub but that didn't bother me.

The bed was really comfortable and there was AC in the room so you could adjust the temperature accordingly. The view from my room wasn't great as there was a tall tree right in front of my window so I couldn't really see much of London but once again as I was only there for one night this didn't bother me. I liked the special feature where you can change the mood lighting in the room - that was a nice touch. The hotel provide a complimentary bottle of water which is handy.

The lounge area of the hotel is stunning. The decor is lush and luxurious looking. All the staff are very well dressed.

On top of the hotel is the Radio Rooftop Bar. There is a designated lift for the rooftop bar which will take you straight there. Normally you have a minimum spend per person (region of ¬£50-¬£75 pp) if you want to book a reservation at the bar but as we were staying at the hotel there was no minimum spend for us which is handy. 

The only downside I will say is that the room rate did not include breakfast. Considering the room for one night was expensive I would have at least expected breakfast but we didn't even get any complimentary tea or coffee! This definitely put a downer on things as I have stayed at many hotels in London which have always offered breakfast when you book a room - even when booking the cheapest room! In the end I had to go down the road and eat at McDonalds!

However, the hotel did allow me to check out late (1pm) which was nice of them and they did not charge for this.

Overall I did like my stay at the hotel and the room was comfortable and a good size. But for the price I would have liked to have had some breakfast included too!",4,2016,09,03
148,ME London,"Our 9-day stay was thoroughly enjoyable. This is a modern, higher-end property conveniently located within walking and easy-tube access to a great many of London's top sight-seeing attractions, shopping and theatre. The hotel has a high service standard. Design aesthetics of the entire hotel are innovative, attractive and efficient. Rooms are well-soundproofed and quiet despite being in a high-traffic area. There is a wide range of restaurant options nearby. Area felt safe at all times of day and evening. Overall cost/value for us was very good as we booked online through 3rd party for signif savings. I would stay here again. I will recommend it to family and friends.",5,2016,09,03
148,Hipsters meet fashionistas in the 21st Century on the Strand,"Hipsters meet fashionistas and minimal design in the center of London. This hotel, part of the Melia chain, is an experience. Style is king, from the Tom Cruise lookalike doorman, to the subdued lighting and high tech gizmos in the rooms and elevators. Lots of digital gadgetry in the rooms and slicked hair among the staff. A nightclub at a side door with a bouncer and an attractive your woman with a clipboard to separate the ins from the outs.

Breakfast good but inordinately expensive, even for London",5,2016,09,03
148,The bar lets the hotel down.,"Had an amazing time here. Arrived 4 hours before check-in time expecting to leave bags with concierge, but was pleasantly surprised to find our room was ready and that we'd been upgraded to a larger room! I find the check in process convoluted; arrive on ground floor, leave bags, get lift to first floor, check-in then the bags are brought to your room. Room was beautiful and bed was amazing. Had reservation for Radio rooftop bar, and I felt this experience let our stay down, but will leave separate review for bar.",4,2016,09,03
148,ME experience,The hotel is very stylish and staff were very attentive. A warm welcome at check in. Rooms very well equipped and laid out in very modern fashion.The rooftop bar provides great views across London and with DJ has a great atmosphere.,5,2016,09,02
148,Lovely bedrooms but very pretentious,"First of all, I will say that the building is beautiful, the architecture inside the hotel is amazing and the rooms are extremely comfortable with superb beds, however I don't think I've ever stayed in such a pretentious hotel since the Metropolitan.

Upon arriving, you're greeted by the doorman, which is fine, but he directs you to a desk on the ground floor where I began to ask to check-in.  Oh no.  You're interrupted and told that you will be taken to check-in on the 1st floor.  It's completely ludicrous, confusing and just over the top.
Then there is the general air of the place.  I want to be relaxed and enjoy my stay, not feel on edge and like every step I'm taking is in the wrong direction.  For example the lift that only goes to the bar on the roof, the very very dark lighting, the ridiculous check-in process, listening to the roof bar stuff aggressively turning away people who were willing to pay (their very high prices) because they hadn't booked (and it was half empty), the fag ends flicked on our hotel balcony by roof bar guests who obviously didn't care.

There was a lot that was annoying with this hotel in all honesty.  However, the room was superb, the shower was amazing, the toiletries lovely, the view of London incredible and best of all, the bed was just fantastic.

The in-room dining was pretty good, although they got the breakfast wrong.  I wanted to love this hotel, but I didn't and I won't return, however I'm glad I tried it.",3,2016,09,01
148,Birthday visit,"I booked his hotel for a night away in London for my boyfriends birthday, on arrival walking up to the hotel we was greeted by the concierge who took our bags from us in doors. We arrived at 13:00 even though check in wasn't until 15:00, our room was ready and our luggage was taken up stairs for us. The reception desk is on the 2nd floor and the whole hotel has such a fresh feel and is spotlessly clean and modern, the reception was very quick and efficient and we were even greeted with champagne on arrival to take to our room. We stayed in the Vibe room which was out of this world! Would definitely say the best hotel we had both stayed in, the bathroom is fantastic with a his and hers sink, waterfall shower was was fantastic. There was mood lighting in the room and a massive queen sized bed! The whole room was spotlessly clean and modern and we had a lovely view over the street. It seemed soundproofed as we heard no noise at all even from staying right in the centre of Covent Garden and having a bar on the top of the hotel. We went out for a couple of hours and on out arrival we had a bottle of champagne waiting for us and small cake with happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate with a  candle and happy birthday written on the mirror which was a fantastic surprise for us. The staff are impeccable and treat you like royalty. If you needed a cab they will go into the street to find you one and take notes of anything you ask for. I could not recommend this hotel enough and will be definitely be staying again. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay! ",5,2016,09,01

Champagne on arrival and room service from popular restaurant STK was delicious. The views from our room were lovely and from the radio roof top bar. Though expensive I would definitely return as has such a wonderful time,5,2016,08,30
148,Cool and convenient ,"Stayed at this hotel on a short stopover. Although it is a really cool hotel and lends itself to couples and those in the know, it was a really convenient place to stay with our young kids. It is right near the theatre so at the end of a long day it is a short walk back. The staff was very friendly and a roll out bed was provided to fit our 3 kids in a room. Great restaurants and the transport museum nearby. Highly recommended ",5,2016,08,29
148,Perfect stay!!,"This hotel was everything we expected and more. First of all, the architecture is amazing, truly unique and stunning. The room was modern, comfortable and luxurious. The service was excellent. We had appetizers in the rooftop bar which was a great night spot with skyline views. Not great for a family dinner, but still very nice with unique appetizers and drinks. The location was perfectly central to walk all over the city and very convenient to great shopping and restaurants. We will absolutely stay there on our next visit to London. ",5,2016,08,28
148,Wonderful visit,"If you're looking for somewhere extravagant and unusual in it's architecture then this hotel is for you. Reception is on the first floor and as you exit the lift you find yourself in a towering, marble pyramid. The corridor walls are made of black marble, the carpet also black and the subdued spotlights made us feel slightly disorientated. The suite however was light and airy and contained everything you could want including hair straighteners! The staff were helpful and attentive especially Solomon who served us at breakfast.  The breakfast was a feast, plenteous and delicious especially the freshly squeezed orange juice and cooked selection. Altogether a memorable night away.",5,2016,08,28
148,Just great!!,"I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone, is just great, plus the radio bar (roof top terrace) is one of the best ones in the city. The rooms are nice decorated and everything looks quite renovated. Definitely will come back.",5,2016,08,28
148,Honeymoon,Stayed here for a few nights as part of our honeymoon and was blown away by the service. Felt like royalty during entire stay. Would absolutely recommend to anyone visiting London.  The location was great  ,5,2016,08,26
148,Stunning,"Stayed here for 1 night although so could easily have stayed longer. 

Staff were great and the reception something to behold. Certainly not your standard business hotel and what a change it made.

The room was comfortable, great gadgets and facilities and so so quiet. 

I was informed that unless I wanted to mix it with the fake tan crowd then I may be best to the roof-top bar for a beer. Maybe I just look too old and didn't fit in with the line of beautiful people queuing for the lift up to the terrace. I hid in Covent Garden instead!",5,2016,08,26
148,ME looked after me!,"You can buy a beautiful building and make a fabulous hotel, but you can't buy amazing staff that are incredibly helpful, kind, humorous and professional. This is what sets the ME apart from all the rest! 
Happy staff make a happy hotel!
I wish other establishments would take a leaf out of ME's book.
Long may it last.
Love Carolyn and her Mum! July 2016",5,2016,08,25
148,"Modern, Cool, Hip & Reasonable Price","If you're traveling to London tongs tongue theatre this is your safest bet. It is conveniently located in the epicenter of the Theaters. Furthermore, it is very design oriented. The music, the decoration, the fragrance and music in the hallways. I mention this because some people want a silent hotel. The service is good and the price by London standards is very reasonable. ",4,2016,08,24
148,nice hotel but expensive,"the rooms are small but very nice, the drinks etc are expensive as you would expect in this location, in rooftop bar the service charge is very dear! with minimum spend areas that could make it uncomfortable, very busy at weekends which is great.",4,2016,08,24
148,"Trendy, luxurious hotel in a central location.","It's really expensive, but staying here is a real experience. The building is incredibly beautiful, and especially the lobby is super impressive. The staff is really friendly and we were treated like royalty. The rooms were nice and clean. Inside the hotel, a lot of the walls are black, which gave a really cool, intimate atmosphere. The bar on the roof is a great place to view the city from and totally worth visiting. The cocktails are expensive, but so amazing, you have to try them. One downside: when I was staying there, one of the maids stole my watch. I reported it to the front desk and the next morning, they already had everything taken care of and gave me my watch back. I would still totally recommend it. This can happen in any hotel and they handled it the best way possible. You won't regret your stay here!",4,2016,08,24
148,Best hotel ever!,"This is the best Hotel i've ever been too!
The room was clean and the service was excellent.
The location was perfect, it is right in the middle of the most touristic places.
If I ever go back to London I would be definitely stay at ME London!",4,2016,08,23
148,Expensive but worth it,"To celebrate my 50th birthday I decided to take my wife and four children plus oldest daughter's boyfriend for a short break in London. The idea was to see a show whilst enjoying a real top end hotel experience. 
The last 5 star London hotel we stayed in was certainly luxurious but also soulless, overly formal and with all the atmosphere of a library. Based on a bit of web research we chose the ME London because it appeared to be ultra modern, cool and trendy plus we liked the idea of the rooftop bar and the central location.
In short we enjoyed very minute of our stay. Customer service was excellent and every member of staff we spoke to or even walked past in corridors was smiley, friendly, welcoming and keen to be of service. The hotel interior was really stylish and like nothing we've stayed in before. Lots of moody black corridors with chrome and trick lighting. If you like traditional, you'd hate it here. We absolutely loved it.
The Radio rooftop bar at lunchtime was a great chill out place for us to lounge on big sofas and take in the views plus the general ambience of the place. Out of interest we visited again at around midnight when it had transformed into a deafening nightclub crammed with young city types. Not our scene so one quick drink and we retired to our rooms.
The rooms were about what we would expect in any decent 4 star hotel. Bed was very comfortable, there was some fancy lighting, decent shower room and good wardrobe space. TV was unnecessarily complicated to use, so didn't bother. We had booked rooms with private balconies giving views of either Covent Garden or the river. Unfortunately from inside the room all you could see was the balcony wall. We tried sitting out on the balcony for about 3 minutes but the novelty of staring at a concrete wall soon wore off. Even standing up and peering over the top of the balcony, the actual views were nothing special so my advice would be not to bother with the balcony upgrade at all.
Breakfast was particularly good - an extensive buffet style selection that gave us plenty of opportunity to try a bit of everything in an informal, unhurried setting.
We also tried the ground floor STK restaurant which was very swish with excellent food but ridiculously expensive. 
Overall we found the ME London offered a great luxury experience. Objectively there are probably a number of good hotels offering a similar service for less money, but if you want to feel you've been somewhere special, this is the place.",5,2016,08,22
148,Let's all go down the Strand,"ME London is in a great position and gives high class service.  It is within easy walking distance of many tourist attractions such as Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery.  Many theatres are nearby.  The Marconi bar is an attractive place to relax with friends and try some excellent cocktails. My stay was a real treat.",5,2016,08,22
148,Great hotel and location,"decent place to stay in London . Great rooftop bar (excellent in Summer). Comfortable rooms, centrally located. Not the cheapest, but a solid choice if you want to stay in high-end comfort in central london.",5,2016,08,21
148,Beautiful hotel ,"Loved the hotel .. The bar on the roof top has great ambience .. Great crowd at the bar and the cocktails & food are excellent ..One of the most happening places in London ..the rooms were large and luxurious.. The lobby is beautiful and you are served champagne when you check in ..
",5,2016,08,20
148,"Very modern, and fantastic location.","ME London was a fantastic hotel.  The staff were very friendly, and the location was great.  The service was great.  We did have a bit of an issue getting service at the bar at the Radio Rooftop bar, they were very busy and my Husband stood there for 15 minutes and still did not get served.  So we went back downstairs as we were tired anyway, and mentioned something.  The Hostess took our name and made sure we had a table reserved the next night.  The next night our table was ready, and we had a great time there.
The only other thing is not being able to pack our clothes away in the closet as there  was no drawers or enough hanging space.  We were staying there for 4-5 nights, so it would have been nice to hang our clothes rather than leaving them in our cases.",5,2016,08,20
148,Ultra modern hotel with super staff.,"Short 2 night stay last weekend for birthday treat.  Booked through Melia using Rewards card and got an excellent price otherwise pretty pricey.  Stayed in room 210, which was a Chic suite.  Really spacious rooms.  Bathroom enormous with great toiletries.  Hairdryer and straighteners for the ladies which is great.  Daughter joined us on the second night and they provided a camp bed in the lounge area, not the best but only for one night.
Turn down service  happened on the first night but not the second which was a shame. Lights, air con all,operated by panel on wall and seemed to be sensor operated.  Unfortunately the  lights switched off while one of us was in the shower, a real pain cos you have to get out of the shower to turn them back on in the bedroom!  Not great.
Excellent soundproofing, no noise from road 2 floors below.

The staff really are so friendly and go out of their way to help if they can.
Didn't bother with breakfast, ¬£25 each is a lot to pay and there are a number of much cheaper options nearby.
Didn't spend much time in hotel as had lots of other stuff to do in London but a fab place to stay with easy access to Covent Garden and surrounding area.",5,2016,08,20
148,Pit Stop in London,"Fantastic hotel for the value.  First hotel we stayed in Europe that actually understood service. You were welcomed from the moment you stepped on the property.  If you had any needs or issues at all their first response was to try and find a solution.  Never was I told no.  

We had been traveling all over Europe and were starting to get frustrated with the terrible service you receive in country after country.  ME made our short stay in London fantastic.
",4,2016,08,19
148,Thank you for making my vacation perfect,"I am regular hotel guest and this is not the first or the last time last time i have spent 17 nights but  everytime I come to this hotel I always been looked after me and all my friends by a member of your security called Sidi not just us but even other guests at the hotel said the same things he is always there for everyone , absolutely amazing customer service.
I have written in the past  that u have an amazing hotel with perfect views and rooms also service but I forgot to mention the best staff ever (sidi) i am not sure about his name 

I am member of your me rewards i am writing this  because i like to speak when i see something nice and beautiful specially that people always write a feedback about something bad , but never they mention good things everything is perfect thank u GM",5,2016,08,18
148,Architecture meets hospitality,"This hotel is located in a stunning building in the very heart of London, halfway between the City and Trafalgar Square, only minutes away from Covent Garden. The building was entirely redesigned by Sir Norman Foster and boasts modern, minimalist yet very self-appointed bedrooms. Breakfast and service are excellent: when we checked in, we were immediately treated to a glass of champagne, and the people who manage the breakfast room deserve very high marks indeed for their professional yet relaxed and friendly attitude. The hotel used to have a great Italian restaurant, Cucina Asellina, which is now unfortunately closed; the other restaurant is called STK, but we did not try it. It also has a rooftop bar that is immensely popular with Londoners and offers great views and excellent cocktails. I regret to say that we were not 100% satisfied with our experience at the bar, though, as we had been promised a table outside by staff at reception and not only had to wait for one but were made to feel as though we were expected to leave as quickly possible. All in all a great hotel, though!",4,2016,08,17
148,Excellent,"This hotel is honestly amazing never experienced anything like it. The staff was amazing and very welcoming,
Highly reconmend staying. AMAZING !! Also the building is incredible to sit in the reception and look around the features is just breath taking.",5,2016,08,17
148,London Stay,"Fantastic Hotel, Great location, Staff are very polite and extremely helpful. Although I did not use the restaurant I did use the radio Roof top bar which was Brilliant with great views over London. I will be back",5,2016,08,16
148,Incredible ,Cannot say a bad word about this hotel. How many hotels have sexy lighting? This is the only one I know of. Sheer beauty mixed with classy design and decor. Loved staying here. Our room had a view of the Thames and the London Eye. Could not beat that. The rooftop bar had great funky music and the cocktails were world class. The staff were friendly and accommodation to our every need and I look forward to returning soon,5,2016,08,16
148,Amazing ,"I stayed here in July with my husband, we arrived had a staff member park our car which was very convenient. The reception area looked lovely, very friendly staff. 
Our room was amazing with an Amazing view of London, the room was very modern. Highly recommended going on the roof top bar stunning views, drinks, music great atmosphere. The hotel is Very classy and modern. We walked from the hotel & had a day walking around London close to many tourist attractions. I will 100% be going back in the near future. ",2,2016,08,14
148,Can't fault it,"One of the nicest hotels I've been to in London. Received a glass of prosecco on arrival check in and out was very easy. Room 909 out of this world big balcony and big room in comparison to others, great staff and the rooftop bar is a great place to enjoy the sun and a drink, well recommended. ",5,2016,08,14
148,Modern Hotel walking distance to many sites and attractions,My husband and I stayed at the ME for the first two days of our London vacation. We were in town for a wedding. The hotel was very modern- too much for my taste- especially the hallway leading to the room.-  but that's not the hotel's fault. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was pretty big by Europe's standards. We stayed in a king size room and the bed was very comfortable. I loved the nightly turn down of the bed with chocolates on pillows and slippers by the bed. Nice touch! Thank goodness for the AC because it was HOT in London that week. Shower and toilet were separate areas. It was fine for me- husband thought toilet area was too small. Double sinks in this room. All in all it was a great hotel that was walking distance to many sites and attractions. I don't know if I would stay here again only because of my own taste not because anything the hotel/staff did.,5,2016,08,14
148,Superb Hotel,I was lucky enough to return here for my birthday weekend. This was my second visit to this stunning hotel and it is easy to see why people return. Situated at the end of The Strand and a stones throw from Covent Garden this places oozes luxury. From the moment you walk in you are made to feel welcome by staff who are genuinely pleased to see you. Special mention here to the absolutely delightful Christala in reception who is a total joy. The cathedral like reception will take your breath away and the room on the 8th floor had a balcony with an awesome view of the city. Don't wonder about what 5 star hotel to stay in when in the capital. It has to be this one. You won't be disappointed. They even left me wine and a special birthday message. First class all the way. Thank you.,5,2016,08,14
148,Tacky,"First fell for the Me brand in Barcelona, enjoying great service and a relaxed vibe. This is a poor relation. The rooftop bar for one is over priced and tacky. Rushed us with our drinks so obviously trying to make us rush our champagne to order another. Euro trash feel. We left and went across to the Savoy instead",2,2016,08,13
148,Absolutely Amazing,"I stayed here for a few nights and thoroughly enjoyed each minute. The hotel is beautiful all around and has fantastic staff. Emiliano at concierge was fantastic the entire time, helping with questions, advice and car service. The Radio Rooftop was great as well, good cocktails and great views. The room was magnificent with its comfortable bed, lighting and amazing shower.",5,2016,08,12
148,Outstanding!!!,"Highly recommended!! Couldn't fault anything!! Room was perfect, food was perfect and so was the service!!

148,Superb Hotel and Excellent Staff,"What a great hotel and brilliant staff running it, we had one night in this hotel and will be revisiting very soon, such a great place and the location was perfect, the rooms are superb, we chose a river balcony room and the views are spectacular. Once again the service was impecable, well worth a visit. No complaints.",5,2016,08,11
148,On Business put enjoyable stay,"Well designed Hotel, great staff. The reception is in the middle of a huge granite pyramid with a glass of prosecco on arrival, its a great start !
Rooms are functional, modern and comfortable and reasonably priced for such a high standard in the heart of the West End.
Radio bar on the roof is really trendy and great view out over the Thames and the City.",5,2016,08,11
148,Vacation stop.,"Very good hotel & excellent staff. Always willing to help. Hotel was very quiet & peaceful with contemporary decor. Really enjoyed our stay. The breakfast was good with decent varieties. 
The entrance of the hotel could do with some touch up, looks a bit dull & obscure. 
You don't have to go for the room with the balcony, as we didn't find it useful during our stay. The balcony wall is high so you really can't see althe street or anywhere outside. ",4,2016,08,11
148,"Brilliant stay, best hotel Ive ever stayed at","I always have the best experience at this hotel, the staff go above and beyond in their friendly service, and they remembered me from previous visits !! I would never stay anywhere else in London. It is exemplary in every possible way",5,2016,08,10
148,Classy hotel on edge of Covent Garden,"As good as it gets hotel wise in London. Service exemplary - sets the standard for other brands to follow. Will definitely look out for other ME hotels worldwide.
Radio Rooftop is a brilliant bar - you wouldn't need to leave the hotel if you didn't want to.",5,2016,08,10
148,"Stylish,cool and comfortable","This really is a cool place to stay in London if you want a central stay in a cool and comfortable environment which just happens to have a must visit rooftop bar. Reception, rooms and restaurant are all stylish and accommodating but it is the trendy rooftop bar that is part of this hotel that sends its cool credits through the roof. Settle in for some great views and dj while drinking your favourite tipple and then stumbled back to your roof. Great way to spend the evening.",5,2016,08,10
148,"Lil burgers at STK and cocktails at Radio, all with a great soundtrack","As the title says...! Great for a blow out once every few months... If u stay in hotel remember to tell the staff at stk and radio, as they will look after you and ensure you get a table etc... Standard rooms are great, but the suites are fab!",4,2016,08,09
148,Delightful,All staff were extremely friendly and helpful which made the atmosphere very welcoming.

148,Lovely stay!,"The stay at the ME London was absolutely lovely! When checking in we were offered a glass of champagne and the layout of the Reception is like something I've never seen before. It's marble and looks right upto the 10th floor of Radio Rooftop bar. The room itself was lovely with the bed being extremely comfortable and a beautiful bathroom. It's very spacious and there are controls which allows you to change the lighting in the room. We visited Radio Rooftop bar and were very impressed with the atmosphere, large array of cocktails on offer, lovely food, and incredible views of London.",5,2016,08,08
148,City break with relatives,"Hotel is probably the most truly contemporary one we've stayed at very well appointed through out roof top bar is very nice ambiance but they ran out of Diet Coke breakfast was fabulous on arrival regretfully allowed valet to park my car what a mistake as valet thought we had gone in hotel he simply got in and floored the accellerator something me my wife my cousin his wife and bell boy who was pushing our luggage will never forget that moment of total disrespect for someone else's property, the manager did wave the parking fees but this did not alter my opinion of that action and purely for that reason I would not return as when the valet tried to make a feeble attempt at apologising he blamed the car saying it was powerful I pointed out that most people would realise this and as he was supposed to be a professional he should drive my car in a professional manner and with respect ",5,2016,08,06
148,AMAZING THANK YOU,"We normally stay at The Savoy several times per year but decided upon a change for my wifes birthday,what a great decision that was.
We had a passion suite and a room for our daughters,nothing was to much trouble for the staff and the attention to detail for my wifes birthday celebrations was fantastic.
The roof bar views are the best we have seen in London,having statyed in the capital over 50 times.
The rooms were immaculate and very cool and high tech with great views.
The rooms were the quietest we have ever had in central London.
We will return again and whilst at the hotel we booked a short break at Melia Majorca.
Again thank you!!
Regards The Ford Family",5,2016,08,06

148,My new favorite hotel in London,"I stayed at this hotel for about 12 days this July and it was incredible. Starting from the check in til the check out, the hotel is a dream in the heart of london. The location is superb with all the shops, covent garden and tube stations nearby. The service was impeccable and the room was so cool with its mood lighting and was very comfortable that I miss my bed already! They have an uber chic bar Radio rooftop at the hotel as well as the STK restaurant, if you can snag a table it is definitely worth a try. What makes this hotel a gem in my eyes is their contemporary chic art deco style. It is so modern and fresh with all the white and minimal decor. I highly recommend staying at this hotel because from price point of view, it doesnt get any better than this !",5,2016,08,04
148,Pure luxury,"A real treat, location perfect, concierge very polite and helpful, a very pleasant stay, thank you.theatre land moments away, spoilt for choice for things to do
Location could not be better, really luxurious ",5,2016,08,04

148,Lovely,"I used to go very often when I was living in London.Even if you're not spending the night here,if you are in London,book a table   at Radio Bar which is on top of it.The view is breathtaking and the atmosphere great.Can't wait to go back to London.I will definitly go there!
Thank you,everyone at Me Hotel!",5,2016,08,03
148,"Fantastic location, great service","The hotel is very well located just a few blocks from the Convent Garden area, with a lot of restaurants and bars. There are four different metro stations within walking distance (Convent Garden, Temple, Holborn y Charing Cross). The rooms are big, confortable, a bit dark for my taste though. The concierge service is great (quick, efficient). Check in and check out was very fast. 
Just one minor detail: the wi-fi was not working well during the first three days. But afterwards it worked fine.  
I would come back.",4,2016,08,03
148,Very good! Only a few issues!,"Booked a two night hotel break at ME London as we wanted to try a different hotel that was centrally located! Location wise it's perfect for The Strand, Covent Garden etc. When we arrived we were offered a glass of Prosecco which was nice! Git shown to our room and was shown how to work the lights, air con etc! After the man went we could not get the music system working (the rooms have speakers even in the bathroom!) a maintenance man arrived but he could not get it working! We also found the toilet was on constant flush!!! I went to reception and explained the issues and we were moved into a bigger room on the next floor down, which was good! Everything was working!! They come in and out chocolate on the bed and change the lighting which is a nice touch!! The hotel is very dark and modern and the reception area and all areas in fact are impressive, staff very friendly! I called reception to ask for an iron and some ice and it was delivered very fast!! The breakfast was very good and us worth bolting this on- great choice of buffet and all the food was very nice!! On the second day we left our room about 10am and arrived back about 3.15pm advice anted to take a shower- we had been out in the rain for most of the day! The maid service had not been which I was surprised about! Luckily s member of staff was close by and he arranged for it to be cleaned! I thought they would of done all rooms by 3.15pm!!! We did go to the rooftop bar on the first night, quite expensive! Overall it's s really good hotel and it's not cheap to stay here! Would I return? Yes probably and I just hope the little niggles would happen next time! ",4,2016,08,03
148,Quite pricey but an unforgettable night..,"Beautiful hotel but it would only be something I visited once because of the price, staff were brilliant and attentive and the rooms were beautiful. Although the halls were quite dark we had to use the torches on our phone to comfortably find our way to our room..",3,2016,08,03
148,Nice,With 2 boys at 19 and 22 the internet was NOT okay. It Can be better. Nice people but a too strong smell of flowers i the lobby . Nice room and no noise from other room and the hallvay. Aircon Nice and light fantasi good,4,2016,08,02
148,Centrally located,Everything within walking distance. (Covent Garden reachable in three minutes.) Taxi always just around the corner. Friendly staff and modern rooms. Choose a room with a balcony and great views. On the roof there is the Radio Rooftop Bar.,5,2016,08,02
148,21st Birthday,"Stayed here for my 21st Birthday and had the most amazing time! From the second we walked in the service was exceptional! Had a room with a balcony with views of Big Ben and London sky line which was out of this world! Had roses, champagne and mirror message which was such a lovely package. By far my favourite hotel to stay in! Defiantly will be back soon staying in Innside Manchester this weekend just love Melia brand",5,2016,08,01

148,The only part better then the locaiton is the architechture.,"From the lobby to the rooms this hotel is a work of art. STK on the ground level and the roof top bar and patio are lively spots every night we were in town. 

Pricey stay but well worth it, great staff and beautiful rooms.",5,2016,08,01
148,Birthday Weekend,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Me London and neither of us can find a fault! We were greeted on the door and taken to reception where we were both offered a glass of complimentary prosecco and then shown to our room where we were shown how to use the lights, air con, etc. We opted for the Mode room and will highly recommend! 

We stayed on the weekend where London bike ride was taking place and Me London sent an email advising of this and guaranteed the concierge would be available at all times - another great touch!

Overall, an excellent stay and we will definitely be back. Thank you Me London!

148,"A bit expensive, but most iof London is! The staff was totally exceptional...the best we have encountered!","The hotel is extremely modern and beautiful? We found the windowless hallways (in beautiful blavk marble) a little allienating. The rooms were airy and pleasant...especially on the Thames side We did have to upgrade by ¬£50 a night to get the view.
The staff took note that it was our anniversary, and spoiled us with additional Prosecco!  We found that all of the staff seemed to bend over backwards to be accomadating!",4,2016,07,31
148,A day night difference,"The hotel is very nice. It is very modern if you like modern you will love it. The rooms are very nice and well equipped. Perfectly located for Covent Garden and the west end. It is possibly a little dark in the corridors. The service on check in is second to none, as was the service in the lobby bar. Breakfast was another matter, they appeared to be very under staffed and even after three attempts I still didn't get the coffee I asked for. All in all very good, I would think twice about booking again as I have had the same for less. I would stay again without hesitation. ",4,2016,07,31
148,Amazing!!!,"The customer service in this place is beyond anything I have seen before. You truly feel looked after and spoiled. The decor is very avant-garde and chic. Rooms are immaculate and bed so comfortable. Selection of drinks is pretty great. Breakfast is also pretty great. All this so close to everything, it is definitely worth the extra pounds...

148,ultimate modern luxury,"i stayed at the above hotel for couple of nights , and i was really amazed by the service provided and the decors of the hotel , it was very luxurious, modern, and simplistic .
the rooms are very comfortable and has high tech facilities , and the most outstanding features of the hotel , i have seen the hotel manager Mr Marley and the resident manger Mr Moretti , during the 2 nights that i have stayed, at several places at the hotel , welcoming and checking the comfort of the guests , something that you do not notice else where .",5,2016,07,30
148,Great Location!,"From the moment you arrive you know you're in for a treat when the friendly porter greets you and leads you into the chic interior. The general ambience is very calming after the hustle and bustle of the City outside and this continues through the rest of the hotel and indeed for the whole of our stay. The staff were helpful, friendly and polite. The location as stated is fantastic with most of the sights within easy walking distance.

We had a room on the 9th floor with balcony overlooking the river and spectacular views over the city. The room itself was immaculately clean as one would expect, not overly large but more than adequate, with a large flatscreen TV. All the controls for lighting AC/heating were on an intuitive panel beside the bed which a 5 year old could operate. The mini-bar was one of the best stocked I've ever seen! The bathroom had a large walk-in double shower.

So, you may be wondering why I haven't given ME London the whole 5 stars, there are 2  reasons. The most annoying one being, our room directly under one of absolutely the best roof top bars in London which we very much enjoyed ourselves, however some  revellers seemed to take delight in flicking their cigarette ends over the edge, not to mention the occasional prawn shell. A summer's late night drink on the balcony of our room was spoilt by wondering if the next lit cigarette end was going to land on your head or clothes. I was even wondering if the maid would think we were so messy and couldn't be bothered to use the ash tray provided on the table, actually there were a couple of good shots who only just missed!

The second reason is that although the breakfasts were good, they were limited. It consisted usual fare but was missing flair which I would have expected from this standard of hotel. The cooked breakfast was very good, however there was no menu to tempt you with something a little less ordinary. One morning we had pancakes and  asked if it would be possible to have strawberries or blueberries to accompany them, sadly not. In fact there were no summer fruits or compote on offer, although there were 2 types of melon, grapes, pineapple and a selection of dried fruits, there was also no granola, only muesli and the normal boxes of single servings of various types of cereals.

Having said all that I will certainly look forward to returning to this beautiful hotel and hopefully award them 5 stars the staff deserve.",4,2016,07,29
148,Check your change!,We were charged twice for our nights stay with ¬£550 being removed from our account for over a week until the bank finally managed to get it returned. Hotel is beautiful sadly it is unlikely we will return if this is how guests are treated. Had I not complained to my bank we would have been charged double and that is simply inexcusable.  ,2,2016,07,29
148,Afternoon tea radio bar,"Took my sister for her birthday treat today, can honestly say it was absolutely wonderful. We both agreed that it is our best one to date. Everything ranging from the sandwiches to the fruit cocktail in the middle and the scones and cakes were to die for. The service was outstanding thanks to Richard who took us through what we were eating and the different types of teas etc. Will be going back soon. Alison fisher",5,2016,07,28
148,nice hotel but ...,"if you evacuate people at 3 AM because of fire alarm you should compensate.
one time our room was not made until we came back at 3 PM then we asked to do it and they did.
nobody explained me about things to do  in hotel

148,July 2016 4nights,"The location of the hotel was great. 

Informed the hotel about our early arrival if there was a possibility of and earlier check in. Did not get one but in the end did not matter and enjoyed London until check in and room was available. I was suppose to get a callback from the reception when the room was ready, but never did. The receptionist was very polite. 

First night woke up at 3:30 am when the fire-alarm went off. Went into the courtyard as did most of the guests. Took us until 4:00 am when we were let back into our rooms. No explanation was provided the following days. 

The WiFi in the room was extremely spotty and unreliable. 

The room was on the 5th floor (515). Clean, quiet and comfortable. ",4,2016,07,28
148,Amazing hotel and roofbar,"Luxury hotel with ultra modern rooms and an amazing roof bar overlooking some of the best parts of the Thames. Always space for residents although definitely with booking if you want a table by the edge.

Rooms are spacious and the reception on the 1st floor is quite breathtaking on arrival. Staff were very helpful and accommodating and the hotel is ideally located for exploring the capital or business use.",4,2016,07,26
148,Perfect,"Beautiful hotel. I emailed them that this stay was for my boyfriends birthday and they wrote a message on the bathroom mirror which was a nice personal touch. Everything was amazing, the bed was so comfortable, we had the best nights sleep. No problems at all. In a great location amongst theatres, shopping and restaurants",5,2016,07,25
148,Perfect stay,I have stayed here many times. Excellet location. Everything was perfect. The room was spacious with a balcony view. Staff team was extremely friendly and helpful. Radio roof top bar has a breath taking view. ,5,2016,07,25
148,Modern hotel in excellent location,"I would have given the hotel a 5 rating apart from a few details. To get these out of the way first, my only complaints would be a lack of storage space for clothes, not the most comfortable beds and thin walls between rooms. But these would be outweighed by the positive aspects of the hotel and I would definitely stay there again. Firstly the location is unbeatable, central, within walking distance of Soho, Covent Garden, the river, St Pauls etc. The staff were excellent and extremely professional and courteous. The roof top bar was fun but don't order a cocktail! Order a bottle of wine/champagne and relax and enjoy it. The cocktails arrived 20 minutes after they were ordered so we couldn't be bothered to order a second one and left. The interior of the hotel is very cool, funky and slightly minimalist. We booked in advance and got an extremely good rate for a 5 star London hotel.",4,2016,07,25
148,long weekend,"I have stayed here many times and never got around to review it.
the location is excellent, check in / reception team are really good.

the rooms are quirky, and my family like them.

Valet parking is a huge plus for me, and the ability to be able to walk to so many local foodie places - again is excellent

This hotel is my hotel of choice now whenever my family and I stay in Central London.

My only negative, is that they always try to sell you an upgrade, rather than simply offer you a free one",3,2016,07,23
148,Poor breakfast,Did not organise child's bed as requested through bookings.com paid extra then to accommodate the bed ! Terrible breakfast !!! Had better in premier inn .. Cold coffee which we had to keep asking for and ignored by staff - nothing special about  breakfast tasted awful,1,2016,07,23
148,Beautiful Hotel!,"I have stayed for 5 nights! From the entrance I could feel the professionalism of the hotel team! Everything was perfect, everyone was smily and helpful. The room was a standard room, quite spacious, clean and nicely furnished in minimalism style. The bathroom was big with cristal separate glass from the mail room and what I liked about details is that there was a make-up cleansing milk even!! For me as for a woman this detail was very nice! In fitness room there are not so much choice BUT! They have Power Plate which was fantastic rescue for me after late nights!))The breakfast was good, I had a choice of the buffet and I ordered eggs Benedict or porridge the other days. The stuff in breakfast area was very attentive and quick! 
The concierge was very helpful with all my questions about restaurants near Royal Albert Hall, railway station,taxi or any other advises. And the doorman is very nice guy! In general everyone who I've met at the hotel left only positive impression! Thank you,guys, for being a part of my wonderful holiday and hope to stay at this ME hotel once again! Well done!",5,2016,07,23
148,Fantastic Weekend,"From start to finish one of the best weekends in London, ME Strand has one of the best front of house team - nothing is too much, from the valet parking to the VIP reservation at the Radio Bar. 
Will definitely be returning. ",4,2016,07,22
148,Engagement treat,"I booked myself and my girlfriend into the hotel for a treat following our engagement and from the minute we arrived it was fantastic. All the staff were brilliant and friendly. The concierge Ronan in particular went out of his way to help make the night extra special for us, getting us a table at stk and also a table in the roof bar. Room was great also had a balcony which had wonderful views of the city. Hotel is trendy looks great and is most definitely 5 star!! 
I would highly recommend it to anyone and will definitely stay there again. ",5,2016,07,22
148,Birthday treat,"Had a great check in and was given a complimentary upgrade at check in due to it being my Birthday. Was offered a lovely glass of prosecco too. Once in the room I was delighted to see that the Manager Catherine had arranged for a balloon and wine, macaroons and a rose, also they wrote on the mirror Happy Birthday, this made me feel really special. The room was so lovely and trendy, with mood lighting throughout, the TV had a great range of music which was fab.. Lovely toiletries, iron, ironing board, but the bed was the best, beautiful and so comfy, we had dinner in STK which was wonderful, then we went upstairs to Radio City, again up there I was surprised to see that Catherine had arranged for a lovely bottle of Mo√´t for me and my friends to share, such a lovely and kind gesture. The hotel is in a fab location, the lobby bar is amazing too, the staff are so friendly and cannot do enough for you, the hotel is spotless, so trendy I absolutely loved our stay there, the staff made my Birthday a real treat and will definitely be returning.",4,2016,07,20
148,Perfect stay,"Everything was spot on, from the free glass of Prosecco on arrival to the stressfree efficient check-out. Staff are friendly and professional throughout, and the standard of accommodation cannot be faulted. ",5,2016,07,20
148,Slick and Hip,"Loved this hotel. Had visited a Melia in Madrid before but this was on a different level. The reception area was amazing. Tiled floor to ceiling and the staff right from when we arrived at the front door were nothing short of 6*. A wee glass of Prosecco on arrival hit the spot. Bathroom was fabulous, double rain showerheads and the clean sharp feel to the room was great. Only thing that was a little bit of an issue was connecting our phone to the bluetooth media thing that was also hard to reach as it was tucked underneath the bedside table, to get the sound working through the speakers. However Simon the chap that had showed us to the room and how everything in it worked came back up and got it working. All the staff could not have been more helpful. Central location as we were attending a concert at Somerset House which is just opposite but central for lots of other things to do in London. The rooftop bar at 2am on the Saturday morning was jumping. Great vibe and stunning views down the Thames. Would have no hesitation in booking this again. Highly recommend.",4,2016,07,20
148,Amazing,"Amazing hotel with amazing quality, location, staff were awesome all in all a great hotel at a great price and would stay here everytime I visit. The bar area is great and gets lively on an evening. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Perfect stay. You will be amazed by this place it's luxury",5,2016,07,20
148,Faultless!,"Stayed here for 2 nights 17-19 July with my wife. She has never been to London, and this hotel seemed perfect and well located.

The actual hotel is sleek and chic and very professionally run. All the staff are courteous and friendly. The reception on the first floor is striking to look at, especially the ceiling! The complimentary prosecco was also a nice touch.

The room itself was on the 3rd floor and was spotless and very comfortable and luxurious. The bed was super comfortable. The bathroom tidy and fully stocked with impressive amenities. 

The hotel is located perfectly for tourist adventures, Buckingham palace was only a ¬£7 taxi ride away and we walked from there to Big Ben (10mins) and then to Trafalgar Square.. Then our hotel was about 10/15 mins walk back along the Strand..Many restaurant and bars around the locality as well. We didn't go to the acclaimed roof top bar (Radio) but from the pictures it looked very nice. 

We would and are returning in September for another few days of sightseeing and dining:)

Thank you to all the staff that looked after us during our stay, you were all great!",5,2016,07,20
148,"I highly recommend this hotel. If you are looking for chic style, attentive & professional staff, delectable cuisine, sp","I recently had a week stay at the Hotel ME London on 336-337 Strand.
My stay was flawless and pleasurable.  Upon my arrival I was greeted by friendly & professional staff.
Checking in was quick and efficient.  I was then joined by the General Manager Mr. Marly and Mr. Simone Moretti the Resident Manager. Together we viewed the property. I inquired about restaurants in the area and they were quick with suggestions and made
reservations.  I had cocktails at the Roof Top Radio Bar where the panoramic view of London is 
spectacular.  You must experience the Marconi Lounge, where an English Tea is served.

The ME London hotel as well as their restaurants are worth a visit.  The ambiance is modern, chic with a touch of elegance. The restaurants from the Roof Top Bar to the Italian cuisine to the delectable steak are a must to try.  Especially after 10pm where the mood changes and the DJ‚Äôs get you moving.

In summation the ME London is a fabulous hotel from arrival to departure. The amazing staff attends to your every need.  The concierge is quick to assist with transportation arrangements and anything else you require.  Mr. Moretti made my stay most enjoyable.  I look forward to my next visit.

I highly recommend this hotel. If you are looking for chic style, attentive & professional staff, delectable cuisine, spotless rooms and managers who pay attention to detail to ensure your stay is pleasurable, 
then the ME London is your choice.",5,2016,07,19
148,Wonderful Service and Staff,"I recently hosted an event in the Penthouse suite and the staff were fantastic and so helpful from beginning to end. 
Every wish was accommodated for and event day ran so smoothly. I would definitely recommend the ME hotel for small events or gatherings. 
The view from up there is something else and so impressive!",5,2016,07,18
148,50th Birthday,"We have eaten at the STK restaurant inside the hotel & had drinks here many times but never stayed so my wife booked it up as a 50th treat with our friends.
The hotel itself is in a great position for getting out & about around. It's ultra modern & very nice & clean.
The shower was lovely, the mood lighting & balcony was really nice & the best mini bar I have ever seen really quirky.
But the thing that really made our stay special were the staff.
Very proffesional they just couldn't do enough for us.
We had champagne & chocolate dipped strawberrys waiting for me with happy birthday balloons & a birthday message written on my mirror from my wife. We all received a glass of bubbly on arrival. There was a table reserved for us on the Radio Roof Top Bar.
We're given complimentary parking(because it was my birthday) it was all very very nice & made it extra special.
There was a very friendly feel to the place because of the proffesional staff.
A special thank you to our Hungarian  waitress, the security guy with the gold tooth, the ex soldier security guy, Siddy who was very charming & looked after us with late night snacks(a very funny guy) & most of all a great big thank you for making it a great memory & being so helpful & proffesional the receptionist who arrange everything for me & helped my wife carry out all her little plans.",5,2016,07,17
148,Best birthday weekend,"Thank you to all the staff at the ME hotel for a great stay!
A perfect location for a show, cocktails in the radio bar, and a lovely breakfast in the morning. 
Our room was clean, modern with a comfortable bed and the decor of the hotel was mesmerising - the reception area is the highlight of the hotel with bubbles on arrival. 
Just be aware of the flakey lifts, I was stuck in them a fair few times for about 10 Minutes - not worth complaining about as our stay was worth every penny, but if your afraid of lifts - Take the stairs !! 
Thanks ME hotel - We will be back!",5,2016,07,15
148,Amazing experience,My husband and I stayed here on holiday and absolutely loved it.  The rooms and public areas were very modern and clean.  The staff was amazing and concierge had the best recommendations.  Would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,07,12
148,Room for improvement,"This is not a 'traditional' hotel in any sense. Most of the surfaces are black and highly polished with 'club' music throughout the hotel including the elevators. It is a 5 Star hotel for its staff, notable mention to Marco and Dimitri, and the guest suites. It is a 4 Star hotel due to the Melia group leasing out the roof top to the 'Radio Bar' which makes the 9th floor, directly under the bar, un livable. The bar also sadly attracts a definite un 5 Star crowd that hoot and holler whilst queuing in the Aldwych prior to admission aswell as attempting to gain entrance via the hotel guest's elevator and wonder why they have ridden the lift for 10 minutes without being able to get out on the 10th floor. 
There is nowhere to eat in the hotel without a club scene as STK also has a DJ in attendance. 
Owners of the ME group need to get a grip on these issues as Radio Bar and STK will fall from grace way before your 5 Star investment should. ",4,2016,07,11
148,Amazing hotel.,"Really funky and gorgeous hotel. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the Thames. Bed very comfy and the room was lovely. The rooftop terrace was the perfect spot for lunch, and the food was top notch. We were really impressed. Staff were really lovely and so helpful. Probably would suggest breakfast elsewhere though. Pretty steep on price.... cost us over ¬£60!!",5,2016,07,11
148,"Modern and clean hotel, friendly staff","I booked this hotel for its location and the fact that it appeared to be modern and clean. Location was great being situated on the Strand, close to the theater area and walking distance to Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus. Like all hotels in London, it was expensive for what you got: a rather small room. But that was to be expected. At least it was clean and the hotel staff was very friendly. All in all a good hotel I can recommend, that met or slightly exceeded expectations.",4,2016,07,10
148,Honeymoon,"We had a very pleasurable stay at Me London. Great staff, turn down service and champagne to start the 3 night stay was nice. Amazing view toward the river, so that was well worth it. Breakfast was average, and the drinks at radio were as expected overpriced but great view. 

They found out it was our honeymoon and had a bottle of wine sent up to our room which was such a treat. We had an amazing balcony facing toward the river on the 5th floor with stunning views. We were directly below the rooftop bar but could barely hear the music or conversation from our balcony or room. We will be staying there agin. Also very centrally located to main attractions such as Big Ben, Globe Theater, Tower of London, Tower Bridge, London Eye etc. ",5,2016,07,08
148,Memorable time,"We arrived at the hotel early and we were welcomed by your friendly concierge team. The staff were super lovely, and before we even entered the hotel, our luggage was taken. We were escorted to the reception by a charming gentleman from security, named Karim; he accompanied us throughout.
The hotel was extraordinary and room was luxurious. The venue was extremely vibrant and we really enjoyed our time at Radio Bar.
I cannot emphasise how much we enjoyed our stay, and would definitely return.",5,2016,07,07
148,Great hotel,"Great service and rooms with amazing maxibar. Breakfast is perfect. 
Poor service on the rooftop, long waiting time and the hostess was not really nice when welcoming, even in so demanded places they should be more kind to people.",4,2016,07,05
148,Modern stylish hotel in a great location,"This hotel is a very modern addition to the luxury hotel market.  The decor is outstanding, and the reception area is especially magical in early evening with the use of lights.  The touch of a glass of prosecco at check in, is a lovely idea, and very welcome.  The rooms are expertly designed, in that everything you need is there, but behind screens, so the rooms do not look cluttered.  The bathrooms are spacious with up scale products in generous sized bottles.  We loved the window, with views over the Aldwych. Breakfast is on the ground floor, and again lives up to the expectations of a hotel of this style.  Thoroughly recommend this hotel, and the location is perfect, a short walk to Covent garden, Waterloo Bridge and South Bank, also a  short walk away.",5,2016,07,05
148,Awesome location with 5 star service,"This hotel was very close to restaurants, and my favorite covent garden. We took a cab to the theater district, but there's also theaters around the ME. Being our first time in London, we took the epic big red bus which stops close to the hotel. Great service and awesome rooftop radio bar.",5,2016,07,04
148,Superior and Modern,"The room was exotic and modern, we absolutely love our stay, the staff accommodated our every request, and even though the room was small but it was perfect, the lighting was very modern and it added to the excitement of the occasion. ",5,2016,07,03
148,Hands down most unique luxuary hotel!!,"Met up with my boyfriend when I came into London and he took me here! As soon as you walk into the building the architecture is lavish! The room was a suite with a big balcony overlooking London that was stunning! The room itself was brilliant we stay in a lot of luxury and boutique hotels and this one blew us out of the water! We even had to call to get someone to explain how to use the lights everything was controlled by touch screen. Even the accent lighting around the TV and AMAZING mini bar changed colors. Very romantic we didn't leave the room, staff and service was excellent! The next day we checked out the roof top bar which had amazing crafted drinks and stunning views! We will defiantly be staying with this hotel again.",5,2016,06,30
148,Excellent Anniversary Stay,"We stayed here 19/06/2016 to celebrate our First Wedding Anniversary. We chose ME London because we stayed here the night of our engagement in 2014 and it was wonderful. 
On walking into the hotel a lovely scent is pumped through like air con so it smells immense. 
We booked a room with a balcony. The room was beautiful, lovely bathroom with double sinks and large walk in shower with enough room for 2! Large comfortable bed, dressing table & large mirror, full length mirror on the door and small table with 2 chairs, mini bar & tv.

We had dinner at STK restaurant on the ground floor which was delicious and a lovely setting. We then followed with a drink on the rooftop bar and returned to our room where my husband had arranged a lovely anniversary message to be written on the mirror and real rose petals on the bed. 

We ordered room service breakfast, they forgot the coffee and brown bread toast but brought it up when we rang to inform them of the error. 

Overall a delightful stay, lovely hotel and I am sure we will be returning for a third visit in the future. We'll also return to the restaurant and bar when we're not staying at the hotel. 

Highly recommend this luxurious, highly modern hotel with lots to offer! ",5,2016,06,30
148,"""Flash""","Two nights in London, central location, quality & accommodating essential. The ME hotel ticked the box's. an interesting design for an interesting hotel, Glass of fizz whilst checking in ( Not a bad touch ) comfortable & clean room, A visit to the roof top bar/restaurant is a must  ( But if you would like a dining table booking is best ). a good quality and selection for breakfast, we would be happy to go back.",4,2016,06,29
148,Luxury hotel,"Great service, the staff are really helpful. It has an amazing rooftop bar (radio rooftop) great atmosphere i'd recommend it to anyone . 21+ . Book in advance. Spacious rooms, clean. The food at their restaurant STK is mouth watering!! Overall great experience",5,2016,06,29
148,Great location - not cheap !!,"I've stayed in a few 5* hotels, and found that vs others ME just didn't have that wow.

The entrance on the Ground floor, and reception on the First have clearly had a lot of work put into them with nice art pieces, but within the room it fell a little flat.

I was given a easy access room (i'm not disabled) so i think i benefited from a slightly larger room with big walk in shower etc.

The room was pleasant and clean with some clever touches like the light controls etc.

Coffee pod machine was provided in room together with the obligatory mini-bar products laid out in a tempting free form basis on the shelves.

Nibbles got the better of me and one ¬£3.00 bag of crisps later...

Overall it was a fine one night stay with a pretty good breakfast in the price. Staff were always attentive and helpful. Though it was hard getting a drink after the Radio Bar had closed.",4,2016,06,29
148,Stylish,"We really enjoyed our stay, there was an open plan bedroom, products were perfect, spacious living space and the radio rooftop bar was lively.

All in all, a fab stay which I would recommend, make the most of it!",5,2016,06,28
148,Excellent ,"Excellent staff, great atmosphere, beautiful view of london, love this place., good location, lovely drinks. Like the way they take care of the guests from the door to the lift...worth recommending to friends and family.. Try it, won't regret ",5,2016,06,28
148,Rooms need to be cleaned properly,"I previously stayed at the ME London hotel in 2013 and loved the nice welcome with a glass of prosecco and host to escort you to the room, so decided to stay here again for the weekend. We booked an Aura room and a Vibe room and as we were Gold Melia reward card members both rooms were upgraded to Mode rooms...

After checking in the host escorted us to one of the rooms and explained the features and as my room was the same she did not need to show us again. I went into my room which was nice and big with views of the theatre. I decided to go into the bathroom and noticed that the toilet seat was up. I found this a little strange..so i went into the toilet to discover that the toilet had been used and not been flushed. It was absolutely disgusting. I immediately telephoned reception who apologised and sent a member from house keeping to inspect. This member of staff behaved as if I was lying and explained she had checked the room and it was not left like this. I then asked her to check the CCTV to see who had gone into the room from the time the room had been cleaned to us being escorted to the room. I still have not received an explanation. 

I later spoke to the Supervisor at reception who changed us to a new room....everything seemed with this room until i found a piece of chewing gum stuck to the wall. The rooms are not being cleaned properly which is a real shame as the hotel is in a great location.

We had afternoon tea at the Radio Rooftop Bar which was really nice. Great views of London, good food but the service was too slow!

Hotel is in a great location, staff are generally polite and accommodating, however rooms really need to be cleaned properly!",3,2016,06,27
148,Great luxurious location ,"Although at that time I was living in London, I decided to try out this hotel for two nights when my friends came over to visit me. The hotel is situated between Strand and Aldywch where all the shops and restaurants are. Few minutes walk from Lyceum theatre (Lion King) and Novello Theatre (Ma Mamia). It's also few meters from Covent Garden and it is perfectly situated across from Waterloo Bridge (you can have a good walk on the bridge and take pictures of all the sights; Big Ben and London Eye, Saint Paul's Cathedral, and the Shard) .

When we first checked in, the manager apologised and said she couldn't accommodate is in the reserved room because the window glass was broken! She offered us another room which is (less what we paid for) but we insisted to see the room and whether the glass would actually affect us. It looked really bad but won't really affect our stay because we wanted the good room. To make up for this mess and the long time we've been waiting, we got tickets to the roof top Radio for free drinks, the view is just mesmerising.  

The room is amazing with all the lights, the radio roof top is a great place to chill and enjoy the sun set. 

",4,2016,06,27
148,Hip SoHO Hotel,"Me London is a great spot for the hip crowd to go to at night and listen to music at the club upstairs.  So, if you're here on a weekend expect crowds and loud music late into the night from people having a good time at the club on the top of the hotel.  Great staff with bars and food on the premise.  ",4,2016,06,27
148,Fantastic stay,"Loved our stay in this hotel, rooms (we had city view with balcony) are high spec and extremely comfortable, double shower and bathroom gorgeous.  Staff really friendly and can't do enough for you. Breakfast was great and fabulous quality. Interior design is amazing and reception area gorgeous , will definitely return ",5,2016,06,26
148,Not as good second time round,"I stayed at the ME hotel a few months ago and was really impressed with the attention to detail, the amazing welcome (including a glass of prosseco) escorted to my room and was made to feel very special... I had lots of hotels to choose from so without hesitation decided to re live my ME experience.. I'm sad to say that it just didn't live up to expectation.... During check in the couple in front were offered a glass of something fizzy but alas we weren't... Once I asked though they kindly obliged.. We had to make our own way to the room with no one there to escort or explain the room features.. I opted for breakfast but at ¬£25 per head (¬£50 for 2!!) it was disappointing and over priced in my opinion... They say you should never go back and I'm sorry to say that this was the case for the ME..... I will be sorry to say that I've experienced the very best and the very average at the same hotel so I'll be on the look out for somewhere new to stay in London on my next visit.....",2,2016,06,23
148,Disappointed,"Booking a last minute trip to London, myself and my mum have wanted to stay at ME Hotel for a while.
Check in was fab, offering prosecco and taking us to our room to explain how everything works..
The room was nice, decoration minimal, which is expected. The bathroom spacious, however the shower- awful! there is some horrible uncomfortable cheap flooring, to ensure people dont slip maybe i dont know? We had a room with a balcony- dont bother! its not like you can sit and see the view- the walls are too high!!
There is just no ambiance to it- its too simple for what your paying.
We ordered breakfast in bed- unfortunately we had to complain- the eggs were no cooked and totally tasteless, it was cold. The pastry selection was stale, they forgot our toast- we couldn't eat it, it really was that bad.
Our positives for the hotel are the Radio bar- but you can access this without being a hotel guest- there is no advantage at all of being a guest- no table reservations or easy access.
The staff were more than happy to assist and were very pleasant.
Overall unfortunately serverely disappointed- maybe we were so excited that  it didnt live up to our expectations-  but would not recommend for this price- id find elsewhere.",3,2016,06,23
148,Fantastic stay,"I spent my engagement night in the hotel and everything from the staff service to the accommodation was superb. We spent a night in one of the mode rooms and as a frequent traveller I was impressed with the set up, view and tech features. I wanted to add a few personal touches to the room to celebrate the occasion. The staff were excellent in helping to accommodate all of my requests and executed them perfectly leaving my fianc√©e blown away (phew!). We spent the evening at radio bar with stunning views of the Thames and great table service. Throughout our stay I was extremely impressed with the the staff who were charming, efficient and responsive. ",5,2016,06,20
148,Disappointing and expensive,"Had one night stay. Room expensive and small and shower room smelt of drains. Bedroom white one side and black the other, didn't really work. Room had a clinical feel to it and no character. Drink and food expensive and food disappointing. Breakfast ok, but service very slow, my toast was cold by the time I was given a knife and jam. Staff had an attitude and did not seem happy in their work. Would not recommend and you can get better for the money. On a plus side, location is good and the roof bar has some good views over London.  ",2,2016,06,18
148,Looks stylist but does not deliver the quality,"I stayed one night at this five star hotel and was very disappointed by the room size, layout and the service at the radio bar. The room is all in length, narrow with only shower and a view on the busy street. The overused black colour makes the atmosphere very clinic and depressing. Breakfast choice and quality was good. I am not sure all this justify a 5 star rating. ",3,2016,06,18
148,Great stay,We had a lovely stay.  We were upgraded and the room was amazing!  Very high end fixtures and the beds were very comfortable.  The whole property is a very unique experience and you are transported to another place and time.,5,2016,06,16
148,Outstanding hotel,"The check in at this hotel was outstanding.  I would stay here again based on that alone.  

The location was extremely convenient; I could walk to major shopping zones and restaraunts.  

I enjoyed the Apvita amenities,  

I stayed on floor 8, and my only complaint is that I could hear club music at night, presumably from the rooftop terrace.  

Also, all of the minibar food is placed plain sight, so you are forced to stare it down and resist temptation.  

I also found the lobby a bit cold.  As reception is one floor up, the lobby is a bit empty, and you don't get the feeling of a warm greeting every time you arrive.  

Overall, I liked this hotel and would stay here again.",4,2016,06,15
148,Loved it..,Pricey hotel but very much worth it. The only thing was the small rooms for what you pay. Rooftop bar was amazing and so was STK. Would definitely return for another special occasion. Staff were very friendly and helpful!,4,2016,06,15
148,A bit of luxury to end our trip,"We stayed at ME London for 3 nights at the end of our 4 week holiday to UK/Europe.  Accompanied by my husband and 1 year old son, we were impressed on arrival by the decor and friendly concierge.
The room was spacious and had everything you would expect.  The bed was amazing!
We found the location to be perfect; restaurants, theatres and shops right out the front door. 
Would recommend this hotel!",4,2016,06,15
148,Lovely views ,"Loved this hotel, great views , great bar, lovely staff! 

Hotel room was with a balcony facing the city, next time I will go for a river view! 

Some aspects of the room were a little worn, carpet a big ragged, chips in woodwork, and considering the price tag, no nice complimentary treats everything in tea cupboard had a ridiculous price tag! 

Radio bar was fantastic, we asked for a table as we were drinking LP rose by the bottle , and couldn't get one, which was annoying but we decided to go back to our room and went and got another bottle. Great views! 

Would stay here again :) ",4,2016,06,14
148,An Unlucky Experience !,"You can only rate something against the amount that you have paid for it. We paid a pice where we could have stayed virtually anywhere in London and chose the ME. Would I go again ? We had a number of problems with dinning especially breakfast which was included. We were down on the breakfast check in as not included. After they double checked, that took 5 minutes they still told us we would have to pay for breakfast. In the end I had to find my confirmation and prove that I was telling the truth. The manager appeared eventually and apologised profusely but we had been there 15 minutes and hadn't even ordered any tea ! We had an appointment at 9am and had a rushed breakfast feeling irritated by the event.
Some love and money has gone into the design of this hotel. If you enjoy design and a super modern theme you will enjoy this hotel. 
We had lunch on their roof bar which is trying to be trendy London offering with a dedicated lift and smart door persons welcoming you. All lovely except the service was dismal. It took for ever to get our first drink and menus. One of the meals came 20 minutes after the 2 others even after being chased twice. It was a burger and the chef had told the waitress to tell us it was because it was ordered well done !! By this time we had had enough and we asked for the manager who was a gentleman and sent us away happy. However this hotel wasted about 45 minutes of our day hanging around for mediocre expensive food. 
I have to say though I would go back even after being woken by a fire alarm at 5am in the morning ! 
Generously, I am going to put these experiences down to some bad luck.Let's hope my luck picks up when I go back !!",4,2016,06,14
148,My favourite 2nd home,"I've stayed at the ME London on numerous occasions and can't find one fault from the moment you enter the hotel to the moment you leave. The staff, room and ambience of the hotel are first class. It's my first choice of hotel whenever I am visiting London. Whatever fragrance they use in the hotel is amazing and wish I could bottle it up and take home. The only thing that is missing is a pool, but I can live with this. ",5,2016,06,13
148,Lisel,"Great hotel, pleasant, clean and top modern rooms, fantastic staff! A must do when you stay at Me Hotel, visit the Radio roof top bar, great view over London and really nice atmosphere! I can really recommend the hotel.
",5,2016,06,13
148,Bank holiday weekend,"Fantastic hotel, just a bit disappointed at a couple of reservations that were made and didn't live up to expectations.
Nice touch that you are given a glass of prosecco while you are checking in.
Plenty of choice for breakfast, and a great view of London from Radio Bar on the roof.",4,2016,06,12
148,Amazing hotel with a great roof top bar with views across the whole of London.,"Definitely the place to stay for a treat. The staff were friendly, the room was clean and super modern. The roof top bar was amazing. Prosecco on arrival was a great way to start our weekend! We will visit again. ",5,2016,06,11
148,great hotel,"fantastic hotel to stay in. loved almost everything. the rooms service is grea. Alanna at front desk made a hugh difference. once the turn down was missed when we asked fo it and she even helped and fixed the issue. check in and out was incredible because of her service!(from italy)
room is amazing eveything. could not use the gym i am surprised with all this look and hih tech the gym is awful. who ever complaining about the place than not sure where would i send them. even has meeting spaces. location is great",5,2016,06,11
148,Great hotel in central London ,Very nicely located hotel in central London. Walking distance to most attractions and sights. We have a view of the London eye from our room and a nice balcony (upgrade). Very hip bar on the top of the hotel (reservations needed Friday and Saturday). Stk steakhouse on the ground floor is a must for steak lovers ,5,2016,06,11
148,"Modern, lovely room","This was my first stay at the ME Hotel. Don't be put off by the name. It is very modern with bright modern rooms. A nice change from the more standard business hotels for not much more. Breakfast expensive at ¬£25. 

Enjoyed a business dinner in the restaurant and drinks in the rooftop bar. Good location for Covent Garden shopping. ",5,2016,06,10
148,Chic. Very boutique chic. ,"Many trips to London; first stay in the ME. Loved it. Good location for a variety of activities esp. the theatre; courteous, attentive staff; marvelous quiet rooms with lovely firm beds; funky architecture--my family found the dark hallways to the rooms disturbing but I thought they lent an elegant serenity to the space and to the quiet of the rooms. I would definitely stay there again. PS, the rooftop bar has an amazing view of the city, perhaps one of the best.  And it's priced accordingly. Worth a visit, but perhaps not routinely.  ",5,2016,06,08
148,All Around Excellent,"Tis as out 10th time in London and have stayed all over the city.  This hotel has an excellent location and terrific service.  The staff is exceptionally friends and helpful  Our child's toy went for it's own voyage to the laundry and the staff went out of their way to reunite it with our happy child.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for value, location and of course service.  Check out the rooftop on a sunny day!",5,2016,06,08
148,The Best HOTEL In Central London,"Let me start by saying i have not been paid to write this review nor was given a free room in exchange for the review. 

I stayed here with my fianc√©e on the weekend of the 3rd of June. From the moment we walked in we were treated like VIP guests. We was not dressed like we have just walked out of Armani. I normally stay in other central London hotels of a similar price range if not more per night. But on recommendation we stayed here on our stay to London. My expectations were far exceeded from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. We were escorted up to the main reception and introduced to a lovely front of house staff member called Simona, who greeted us with the biggest smile this side of italy, We were offered a glass each of prosecco which went down a treat. 

Once we were checked in we was escorted to our room by a very smartly dressed gentleman called Balasz. the halls off the hotel smell divine if molten brown done hotels this is how they would smell. Once in the room we was shown where everything was and what each each plug and switch does. This is a very modern hotel with a warming feel. the bed was a double king and the shower was an amazing walk in shower with speakers you could control so playing music in the shower was a nice change. 

The following day on check out, we met the duty manager Ruairi by coincidence who i truly showed a interest in our stay and not just to exchange niceties. whist awaiting for our driver to come and collect us we were once again offered a glass prosecco. 

All in all one an amazing trip with staff who genuinely care and a hotel that would not feel out of place in Dubai or Monaco. 

I will be staying here again on my next back to London the next couple weeks. 

Mr G (monaco)",5,2016,06,07
148,Super Hotel BUT awful rooftop bar,"This is a very mixed review - first the hotel, absolutely stunning. The staff were incredible extremely attentive, pleasant, welcoming and happy to cater for every need. Balazs who is apart of the concierge team before the trip was brilliant and provided a number of options to make my girlfriends birthday celebration that extra special (some great options to consider to make that special occasion that bit more special). The vibe room we stayed in was on the 5th floor (513) and was spacious and we particularly liked the mood colours you can set in the room. I also requested the divinity package (extra charge) which the hotel staff delivered well with flowers, champagne, strawberries with a fantastic message written on the mirror! 

Now for the negative - we had a table booked at the rooftop bar (Radio Rooftop Bar) which was booked efficiently by Balazs before the trip. When we arrived for our booking we were taken up to the bar where they called up to say we were coming up. We arrived at the top exited the lift and waited 10 minutes before we were even greeted by anyone even though they knew we were coming up! Then were told 'your table will be ready in a minute', 15 minutes later with the host just leaving us still nothing so we just went to the bar fed up of waiting for the table. When I spotted across the bar the host had returned to where we were waiting were escorted to our table (which is table service). We waited for 20 minutes for someone to take our order but even though the tables around us had their orders taken we were ignored!! We had to get a drink ourselves and then left as we were disgusted by the rubbish service. I still to this date cannot comprehend why we had been ignored and were on the end of atrocious service. Seriously needs to be addressed as this is letting an amazing hotel down. We did complain the next day and the duty manager/ assistant head concierge (Ruairi McDowell) was fantastic, professional and managed our complaint brilliantly and just showed what great service the main hotel staff deliver. It's a shame they don't work in the bar!

I would stay at this hotel again but would certainly avoid Radio Rooftop Bar and would advise all hotel guests to as it WILL ruin your stay. ",4,2016,06,06
148,Great rooftop bar,"Had a pre- dinner drink in the radio bar on the roof of the hotel. Managed to get a cobana on the outside.  Extremely comfortable, not for a quiet drink. Disco going full pelt inside, and the views spectacular.",4,2016,06,05
148,Centrally located.,"Hotel lobby and rooms were beautiful and comforting. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. STK has a strick dress code. Was not able to enter because of my sneakers. Bartenders in Radio Roof Top were discriminating. Servers didn't want to help until I bought a bottle. Overall, hotel and hotel staff were great. Radio Roof Top is garbage which was the real reason I chose this hotel. I will not be coming back to this hotel. Better value elsewhere.",3,2016,06,04
148,Fabulous Stay!,"Cannot wait to stay at the ME London again, Bags taken to room on immediate arrival Champagne received at Check-In desk (great touch) The decor of this hotel is simply stunning and oozes luxury (which I love) Room was spacious. 
Staff were friendly and informative. Room service delicious, access to the Radio Rooftop Bar was easy and this is a bonus of staying at the ME, this is a must see bar in London. 
One of my favourite hotels, I will be recommending to Friends&Family.",5,2016,06,04
148,"Chic, cool, contemporary","Very well-located near to Covent Garden, within walking distance of many theatres, restaurants, tube station, etc. The hotel building is at the corner of the main street (the Strand), so car drop off is rather awkward. Once inside, the reception lobby is on the 1st level up, and is impressively modern and cool with tall high atrium ceiling, and interesting light display. We stayed 3 nights in an ""Urban Terrace"" room, which had an outdoor terrace overlooking the buildings of Covent Garden. The weather was quite nice so we were able to sit outside in the evening, and enjoy the sunset views. Also nice to have morning coffee ! The room itself was rather long and narrow. Not much walking space between the end of the bed and the wall, which had the flat-screen TV, in-built cabinets with mini-bar, coffee machine (very nice organic Espresso coffee capsules !), and interesting unusual snacks. Everything felt new, with modern design. But white colours dominated- white leather walls, white furnishings, white sheets, white bathroom ! Felt like we were in a space capsule ! (or some may feel it's too ""Clinical"" !) Bathroom was also long and narrow, no bath - but the shower area was huge - the ""Bali"" rain-shower, with lots of space for 2 people. Lots of fluffy towels and nice amenities. The room was quiet and we were able to sleep very well every night. Only slight problem was that the room was at the end of the corridor, so we could hear the service door shutting loudly in the mornings. Rooftop bar was a nice experience, especially since the weather was good. Many stylish people coming and going - again making the atmosphere feel upbeat and contemporary. Overall, a good hotel experience and a place we will come back to ...",4,2016,06,03
148,Impressive service,"We've stayed at the ME twice, enjoyed it both times.

On our last visit a child's toy was left behind, mixed into the bedding that was sent to the laundry.  It was an important toy, and we wanted to get it back right away, but the laundry was closed on the day of our departure.  We spoke to an employee (Basem) on the morning of our departure, and he said he'd look into the matter.  He contacted housekeeping, but they had not seen the toy.  He contacted the laundry service, and found that they had rescued a toy similar to what we described.  It was delivered to him the next day and validated against a photo we sent.  Found!  The toy is now on its way across the Atlantic.  Great service!",5,2016,06,02
148,Very cool,"Super cool interior and atmosphere in this design hotel with relatively large and clean rooms. Despite a very hip approach, the room was still quiet at night. Great rooftop bar (book a table) wuth excellent view over London.",5,2016,06,02
148,Truly Great!,"When my partner and I went on our first date we talked about cities we love, London was at the top of our lists. So it was only fitting that when the time came to celebrate our 10th anniversary, London would be the first stop on a two-week trip to Europe. We knew we would love London, but not having been there for some time, neither of us had a ""go to"" place to stay or any recent experience to guide us on which hotel would make for a truly perfect 10th anniversary. So, not knowing for sure if the hotel we chose would live up to the reviews we saw here and elsewhere, or would come up short, we chose the ME Hotel and hoped we made the right choice. Much to our delight, we did! We had an amazing time. Our room was gorgeous. The bathroom was beautiful. Both were spotless clean. The service at the hotel was excellent. The location was perfect. The breakfast was awesome (and I'm very particular about hotel breakfasts). In fact, the breakfast here was probably the best breakfast at ANY hotel I stayed at in quite some time (including stays in Brussels and Amsterdam on this trip, plus two other trips to Mexico City since then). Lastly, there's the rooftop bar. Simply put, we LOVED it. Breathtaking views of London...drinks well done...delicious food, all that plus great service and a cool vibe! The only thing I would want to suggest as a cautionary note about the rooftop bar, is that timing could be tricky as some party ""themes"" on different days and times may not be everyone's cup of tea, so it is best to be aware of any parties that may be scheduled, and if you think it's a vibe that works for you and anyone you may be traveling with or want to invite as a guest. For example, my partner and I went up to the rooftop lounge in the early evening one time, weren't ""feeling"" the vibe at that moment, and decided to go elsewhere instead. However, a few hours later we went back up and had an amazing time then -- and on our other times when we went there.",4,2016,05,31
148,Trendy friendly & great location!,"We recently stayed at the ME London with family and can honestly say we had the best time! From the second we walked through the door we were treated like royalty- the staff are so helpful and kind. The rooms were very trendy as was the whole hotel. I actually left my watch in the room when I checked out and the staff called straight away to have it sent back to me!!! Also what we noticed most was the excellent location, our taxi rides in London had never been so cheap- literally ¬£10 away from Leicester Square. We will definitely be staying here again in the future!",5,2016,05,31
148,Impressive Stylish Hotel,"A business meeting in London and put up this time in th ME. I arrived early afternoon and right from entering the hotel you can see that the hotel has stylish elegance. Oddly reception is not on the ground floor so a quick one floor journey in the lift to reception. Check in was efficient and I was pleased my room was ready. After a train journey and tube trip across London the offer of a glass of Prosecco was well received and added to the pleasant check in experience.

It was back to the lifts and up to my room. Exiting the lift the stylish elegance continues, but the overriding thought was how dark are these corridors! The rooms follow the same style and modern look and are good sized for London. It was very comfortable and well equipped. Not sure why, but some hotels make it hard to find basic things like the coffee machine, which in this case was hidden behind matching side panels by the TV. Only found it when I had exhausted looking everywhere else. Oddly the cupboard contained the usual mini bar, snacks etc as well as some potential gift items including a ¬£30 Agent Provocateur Thong. Perhaps I am missing something? The wifi is free if a member of the Melia loyalty programme, which you can join on line. It's also thankfully fast so good for business use.

The roof top bar is a great attraction with great views of London and even from early evening was very busy, be it, quite a young crowd. I went out for dinner, but returned later when it was even more busy with a spectacular night view of the city. A DJ was playing music and still a very young crowd so had just one drink before going to bed. Looked like a great place for being seen if you are a little younger than me.

Returning to the room you step from the low lite corridors to the pink glow of the room. The maids clearly tidy the room and replace linen etc and then turn on these pink lights which if travelling with my wife could have been romantic ambience, but alone felt a little weird. I slept well and breakfast was great. Overall a very pleasant stay and exposure to a few quirky hotel nuances. The staff here are very professional and deliver great service in all areas of the hotel. There also appears to be plenty of them so the hotel is geared to provide the resources for an exceptional guest experience. If staying in London a very stylish and up market hotel.",4,2016,05,30
148,Weekend break,"Fantastic service, the staff really can not do enough for you. I stayed here alone and was made so welcome. Paid for breakfast which was perfect, I will definitely be staying again when i'm next in London",4,2016,05,30
148,My stay at the Me London hotel,"Great hospitality and the staff are so friendly, the hotel is well decorated and the room service is excellent, housekeeping  are always on time! Another advantage of the hotel is that it's located near the covent garden market which is a good place to spend your day in!",5,2016,05,29
148,Great rooftop bar/restaurant,"We saw an article in the Covent Garden paper about this new hotel with a rooftop bar and the great views from the top.  We decided to go and were not disappointed.  They have outdoor heaters so it is even comfortable outside when night arrives.  We had a couple drinks, enjoyed the view and left.  It was an great place to see the rooftops of London.",4,2016,05,28
148,Allergy sufferers beware,"To put my review in context I am a sucker for a luxury hotel. I don't cheap out. I'm willing to pay and I don't whine about price. I'm always working remotely so wifi and a nice desk matter.

**if you're sensitive to pets or have allergies or need to work I suggest reading my entire review - especially at the end

A friend who lives in London recommended this hotel and two others. This hotel is on the fine hotels list with American Express, which means you get a $75 credit for your stay for incidentals and a room upgrade.

I should point out that to my knowledge, the room upgrade did not occur. Room is exactly what I booked. I know they have openings because they are still online with open rooms. I did inquire at the front desk and the gentleman kept repeating ""we have you in a lovely‚Ä¶"" 

If I were not by myself I would have gotten a bit more aggressive about this to get a larger room and 180 view like Amex said would happen.

I am not impressed by things like Prosecco when you arrive, so I won't be commenting on things I think every 4-5 star hotel should pretty much do but instead on differentiators.

Pros:
Comfortable bed.
Robe.
Slippers.
Lots and lots of space for luggage and hanging garments.
In my room there is a lovely little table in a want to be balcony area with a view of the city that is perfect for breakfast in the morning
Very well-stocked minibar
Perfect separate desk with a comfortable chair
Wonderful shower and large bathroom
Great toiletries.
Linens are nice.
Good aircon 
Ability to order an in room massage or facial through a third-party. It's quite pricey but they are OK. Don't ask for deep tissue because I have had two of these ladies now and they do not understand deep tissue!
Room in the minibar for your own things also
Lots of goodies in the room you can purchase (this could be a bad thing too!)
The concierge and the gentlemen at the door are lovely and helpful.

Cons:
Pillows are bad. I brought my own. 
The television has absolutely no American channels. I expect that in France, but with so many to choose from and a sports channel in Portugal being on the list, I'm kind of surprised they don't have CNN international.
I cannot for the life of me find the media center to hook up my iPad, and no one in the hotel seems to know either. It's mentioned in their in-room note. 
They chose a hotel hairdryer that doesn't actually work in the bathroom socket. Kind of baffling. You have to take it into the room.
The ""follow me"" lighting is annoying. I actually want my desk to be lit up even if I'm not sitting there so I can look for specific things coming in on my computer! The entire lighting system throughout the room is very confusing. The panel is easy, but the light switches don't always turn on and off the things that they did just half an hour ago. High tech is cool, lacking usability is not

Read my separate review about radio. Horrible experience up there that I hope to update on Saturday.

Sometimes it can be difficult to find things in the room because of the poorly lit areas

And finally‚Ä¶ The Internet is absolutely crazy slow. It is free, so many people say you can't complain, I say that isn't true. I would prefer a paid option where actually can work quickly! 

And most importantly of all‚Ä¶ I am allergic to cats. Very very allergic. Ironically, I am staying here instead of at my friends house because he has a cat. The minute I walked into the room, I had the itchy eyes and painful jaw feeling‚Ä¶ Like there was a cat in the room. Exact same feeling - and it SMELLS like cats in the halls and the room.

I called downstairs and reception confirmed no cat had been in my room recently. It's obviously in the filtration system. They are a pet friendly hotel (if I had known this I never would've come to this hotel). Changing rooms would have been useless. I can smell it in the hallways.

People. If you're going to have a pet friendly hotel you absolutely have to change the filters like every couple of weeks. Tell people with allergies not to come here. I have been double dosing on medication to avoid scratching my eyes out. The two massage therapists that have come into my room have mentioned the same thing- The cat odor. I don't know what it is, if it's deodorant on the carpet or what, but it smells like cat boxes.

I love many pieces of this hotel and it is romantic and sexy like others say, but I won't be coming back strictly because of the allergies. It's miserable. Slow internet isn't helping.",2,2016,05,27
148,"Maybe not so great for business, but a very cool hotel!","I stayed one night in Me (Melia Strand) hotel and therefore had a very limited experience ‚Äì I did not have breakfast and barely had time to explore my room before I had to rush for a meeting. Ah here: if you are in London for business please note this hotel is not so meeting-friendly (unless you book some meeting rooms): the reception area is open space dark hall (although nicely designed!) and the ground-floor bar area is‚Ä¶ a bar with a few people enjoying their cappuccinos etc. With quite a small area, if you are discussing something important, this could be a nuisance.

On arrival I was ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to a bigger room‚Ä¶ for a disabled person. Whilst I admire that more and more hotels are accommodating disabled people (some hotels still don‚Äôt), I found the absence of a proper bath and a shower full of various tubes and hooks disarming. But okay ‚Äì they offered to wait for my standard room before ‚Äúupgrading me‚Äù.

Not sure if it is hotel-wide problem - but windows in my room steamed up from the evening on until my check-out time.

Last but not least ‚Äì the personnel is very friendly and helpful and never in your face. Ah! And the toiletries are in abundance made of natural ingredients in Greece. Well done!

I just wish I had time to visit the rooftop bar.",4,2016,05,26
148,Brilliant! - cannot fault,"Sorry this review is not for the Hotel, but worthy of inclusion as it demonstrates the level of customer service here.
I was there yesterday, needed somewhere quiet to work, and relax in between my afternoon appointments.
Chose the ME Hotel, over a nearby hotel, to be honest, my first time, and ordered a drink in the ground floor bar. Whilst there enjoying the ambience and drink, I noticed my iPhone needed a charge so asked for a charger if possible, one was brought to me within minutes, a real cool looking white cube design, mmm! I thought cool!
Then whilst working, I remembered a greeting card in my bag that needed posting, probably days ago, you know how it is? so thought to give to front desk, to add to their post, to be included in on the afternoon collection, so did just that, gave to front desk, who in turn gave to another young gentleman who, after much embarresment to me, ran to a nearby post box to post my card......
After approx 15 minutes, the barmen came to my table to ask if all was OK, which of course it was, to be honest I was very happy, and then asked if he could please have his charger as he was finishing work! - Wow! it was his own personal piece of kit!!
ME hotel you have some great staff, wonderful, in fact, I am planning a special treat for my wife, normally we would stay in another hotel but think this time will certainly be booking a room with you..",5,2016,05,25
148,Perfect...,"We stayed here for my sons 21st birthday and it was perfect.  The staff are very welcoming and helpful, the roof top bar is a must and the whole experience was excellent.  A glass of fizz on arrival was a nice touch and the selection of food at breakfast was extensive.  I would stay here again.",5,2016,05,25
148,Modern elegance in foyer bar,"Nipped in for tea and to catch up with emails whilst waiting for car to be retrieved from car park. High quality tea and pastry, served with aplomb on fine bone china. Lovely. Staff solicitous and friendly. Cocktail list looks impressive, I'll be back to give them a try. ",5,2016,05,25
148,Cool hang out with freinds.,"From the moment we booked to the moment we left, nothing was too much trouble. Really cool hotel, beaten only by the really cool employees!

148,Love these rooms....,"This was my second stay at the ME London and I really like this hotel.  Needless to say, the location is great with easy access to Covent Garden, the City, shows, etc.   But what I like the most is the minimalistic design approach to the hotel and the calming room.   I was upgraded to a 'vibe' room (715) which offers a bit more space than the basic 'aura' option.  I was in town for work, so what  I appreciate most is pretty simple: a quiet place to sleep, comfy bed, good shower and a nice breakfast.   ME delivers on all fronts. My room faced the Strand and I promise that I could barely hear a peep of noise from the street.  On the top floor, the bar was pulsating away, but I could not hear it in my room.    Meanwhile, beds are comfy with a down comforter and a mix of down and poly pillows.   Sheets were white and crisp.   Air conditioning works well.   The rain head shower and hand spray make for a nice way to get going in the morning.  I also enjoyed breakfast at Cucina Aselina - my favorite is the very simple poached eggs with avocados and toast.   Service at Cucina Aselina was super friendly and quick.   I would happily stay here again.",5,2016,05,22
148,Fantastic Hotel,Such a great hotel ..cool vibe..great location and the staff are absolutely amazing..love the radio bar with fantastic views across London always nice for a few cheeky drinks !!! Just one of the many reasons why We love coming back..,5,2016,05,19
148,Fabulous Decor and Great Location,"I frequently stay on business at hotels in The Strand, but had not before had a room at Me London.

This is a Hotel with true WOW factor. The reception area is simply stunning. Corridors are matte black. Rooms stylishly understated.

Mine was a two-room suite. Neither room that large. The first a comfortable sitting area with extremely well-stocked (but not complimentary) mini-bar.

The second, the bedroom. Large TV's in both. Wonderfully comfortable bed.

A beautiful bathroom, too. Decor perfectly condusive to a romantic evening. 

This place may be overkill for business. Try the Charing Cross Hotel instead. However, It has the wow factor in spades. For a special night's stay it is perfect.

Staff were a little too low key for me. However, room service was attentive and prompt. A last minute reservation for the Radio Bar upstairs was also arranged, with no fuss (or insistence on minimum spend).

Thoroughly recommended for a very special evening with that ""wow"" factor.

",5,2016,05,18
148,"Excellent Hotel, service and Staff","Felt very well looked after. The hotel offers a fantastic and unique experience as far as hospitality is concerned. 
Special requests were considered and delivered and staff were very efficient and attentive. ",5,2016,05,18
148,Really trendy high end hotel,"Fab Covent Garden/Theatre district location.  Excellent first impressions carried through from lobby to quirky upstairs check in area with a view right up through the centre of the buiding!  Prepare to be wowed!!  Bedrooms stylish and you can even purchase a pair of designer knickers via the minibar, however, prices are reflected in the hotel costs - EVERYTHING is top price!
Take a shower cap (this was missing from the toiletry pack provided!!)
Radio Rooftop bar is fab with lovely outside area overlooking some of the most famous London landmarks.  Saturday late afternoon had a DJ on duty.  Sunday a lot quieter.  Small bottle beer ¬£6 Cocktail about ¬£15 Glass wine ¬£10.
Would definitely return for a treat :)",4,2016,05,18
148,What a place,"My wife and I stayed at the London ME over the last weekend in April. The hotel is unassuming from the outside; but when inside it is a stunning environment. You'll need your night vision goggles for a couple of corridors due to the moody lighting; but the opulence of the finises is sumptuous. 

The foyer (on the first floor) has an amazing atrium and all guests are provided with a glass of prosecco when you go up to your room.

The room we stayed in had a balcony that gave great views over the river and down the strand. 

All in all, the staff were great and the roof top bar is very nice; although I'm probably a bit old for the surrounding patrons.

Great place for a weekend in London. I would highly recommend it.",5,2016,05,17
148,Amazing hotel!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here recently for the bank holiday weekend. We were visiting to celebrate our anniversary. 

We had requested in advance if there was anything they could do to make our stay even more special and they definitely didn't disappoint. 

We were given an upgraded room which was really stunning and they left lovely messages written on our mirrors! When we returned from our evening out we were delighted to discover they had placed roses and rose petals on our bed and left a complimentary bottle of champagne chilling in an ice bucket! 

They really do have everything right. They went the extra mile to make our stay one to remember. A special mention to Kristy from reception who went above and beyond for us, her rapport and charisma was especially charming. 

We had dinner reservations in STK and then spent the rest of our evening in radio roof top, the staff we encountered everywhere were very helpful and welcoming. 

I honestly can't recommend this hotel enough, and we can't wait to return. 
",5,2016,05,17
148,Birthday in Style!,"A super hotel, booked so I could celebrate my birthday with friends up on the Radio Rooftop Bar and enjoy the view. The hotel was stylish and opulent without being snobby or stuffy. The location is fantastic for a pootle round London trying to remedy the post party hangover! ",5,2016,05,17
148,Excellent hotel,"Fantastic room, amenities and staff, lived up to expectations . Didn't visit the restaurants and bars but will definitely do that on my next visit. The rooms were a good size and then espresso machine a nice added bonus. The balcony room was great with lovely views over the city and the Thames.",5,2016,05,17
148,Lack of sound proofing - Help!,Room very clean and tidy and bed comfortable. The website states all room are sound proof but this was not the case in our room as we endured one hour of the couple next door having intimate relations. ,4,2016,05,16
148,Such a waste of money.,"Badly built hotel.  For the price we paid the rooms are an embarrassment. There was nowhere with proper lighting and fingerprints on the windows.  The shower was a trickle coming from the ceiling.  The staff in the bar are snobby and we were treated badly.  Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in, in London.",1,2016,05,14
148,Like Las Vegas in London,"Hotel is in great location near Covent Garden.  It is ultra modern and feels like Vegas.  Trendy Radio rooftop bar was hopping.  Lobby and check in were very interesting.  Rooms are chic, but have small windows.  Fantastic bathrooms and huge shower were great.  Main drawback was horrible bed, it was two twins pushed together for a king, but both mattresses were lumpy and overly firm.",4,2016,05,14
148,Good but Could do Better,"An excellently located hotel with a different but, modern twist. Spoilt by a lack of detail of attention.  used coffee cups left in room after room made up. Room not serviced until 4pm and only after request to reception. Disturbed sleep from night club noise. Night club and roof bar drew many non residents who congregated in lobby and around lift area. Even staff remarked about poor impression for such a prestigious hotel",3,2016,05,12
148,Weekend away,"I surprised my boyfriend with a weekend away in London and we stayed here. Very luxurious and the staff are very hands on and helpful. Great atmosphere and amazing room! Perfect hotel. Lovely stay and brilliant decor. So stylish and spohisticated. Such a good location, within walking distance from everything ",4,2016,05,11
148,"Great hotel, great staff, great bars!","Excellent hotel, stayed here the night before last and was able to upgrade to a balcony room for an extra ¬£50, friendly helpful staff.  We ate at STK restaurant downstairs and it was very good - only one small criticism - as a vegetarian I would have liked more options but having said that the butternut squash tart was well executed and with fries made a filling meal and the dessert was good.  Really busy on a Monday evening and a real mix of clientele; great atmosphere.  We were served by a lovely girl in Marconi bar, charming and very helpful.  We then went up to the rooftop bar which was amazing, great views over London, excellent cocktails - I can recommend the Remember Me - a gin based cocktail with strawberry, lemon and Prosecco.  The concierge was welcoming and I briefly met the manager who was also very charming - would not hesitate to recommend or book again, looking forward to our next stay already!!",5,2016,05,11
148,The best location in the ciry !,"The ME london hotel has a lot going for it: High class accomodation, great service, very good restaurant (we loved the breakfast ...), and a open-air bar on the roof which is to die for. But above and beyond, this place is right at the heart of the city, within walking distance from Covent Graden, the Soho, Theatre district, the river, southbank, and lots more. If location is what you're looking for, and you can afford it (it is quite expensive, even in London standards) then this is the hotel for you !!",5,2016,05,11
148,Hip Hotel in Central London,"The location of this hotel is excellent as it's central and in the heart of the theatres. Service by all staff is 1st class and they genuinely care for the customer, from the moment you walk in to when you leave.
We were upgraded on arrival to a larger room which was a nice touch as it was my daughters birthday.The room was light, chic and modern, which appealed to my fashion conscious daughters and to the birthday girls surprise, the hotel had left a hand written Happy Birthday on the mirror! Being on such a busy road, you'd expect to hear the traffic noise from your room but they are sound proof! 
The rooftop bar is cool with brilliant views of London. Very busy at weekend nights.The young, lively crowd partying until the early hours!",4,2016,05,08
148,London weekend stay,"Romantic weekend away and absolutely loved the ME hotel and the little suprise the staff arranged for my wife.. The rooftop bar was incredible and once again the staff were great, STK did awazing food and shocked that the price was very reasonable... Will definitely return.",5,2016,05,08
148,Amazing Hotel....,"What an amazing hotel.  We have stayed in a number of London hotels but have to say we think is the best.. We were made to feel very welcome at the hotel as soon as we entered, every member of staff we encountered greeted and welcomed us... We were escorted to Reception which is on the first floor - reception was breathtaking - an atrium which was just amazing.  The decor on the floors is black marble which is quite calming.. You cannot use the lifts to the rooms if you are not staying as you have to use your card which is comforting  The rooms are large, welcoming and bright - full of technology which is great..  The bed was large and sooo comfortable - slept like a baby.. Everything is catered for the mini bar was well stocked.. The rain shower was fab.. Would highly recommend a stay at this hotel - well worth a visit...",5,2016,05,07
148,Lovely 2 night stay,"Booked 2 nights at the me , room was urban terrace room very modern and clean and light  , wasn't a big room but big enough !! Service was great and  hotel staff  friendly , didn't t eat at any of the restaurants but did drink at 3 of the bars radio bar has stunning views & lovely cocktails . Would defiantly would go back . ",5,2016,05,06
148,Our ME experience!,"Excellent location, gorgeous hotel, chic, clean, contemporary.  Helpful concierge and amazingly comfortable room/bed/showering facilities. Feeling of luxury and a very tasty breakfast with excellent service and plenty of choice ",5,2016,05,05
148,Sir Norman Foster. Ideal.,"Hotel is renovated from Marconi radio house. The room is tiny and small, but the Foster design is pleasing eyes. Reception room is stunning, inside a pyramid. Rooms have color lighting options. Shower is spacious enough for two people. The rooftop bar expected to be great, but turned out to be crowded.",5,2016,05,03
148,Great views,The view from the 9th floor is very impressive. Room a tad small but cleverly and tastefully appointed. The reception area is magnificent and the Radio Bar is well worth a visit. Breakfast was a bit average. Well situated for a London stopover.,4,2016,05,02
148,Luxury hotel with really good location,"Luxury and modern hotel with very nice big and quiet rooms. Cool light system in the room, and very nice breakfast. Stunning lobby and roof top bar. Very good location, easy to walk to shopping and restaurants. Our teenagers loved the hotel in every way!",5,2016,05,02
148,Catalogue of poor standards,"Firstly I can tell you this is a stunning building with a beautiful room in an excellent location . So what can make it an average review ?? The staff .......it goes from excellent at check in to a total lack of professionalism or courtesy in the bars and restaurants ... It even involved a waitress in the radio bar pouring a French martini over my wife's white designer jeans and stating it wasn't a problem as she was very pretty ???? ... Result , ruined jeans worth over ¬£200 and a feeling this was truly not a 5 star establishment. They offered to make up at dinner in their flagship sk restaurant ... A bottle of champers was waiting so an excellent start I thought ... Not to be however as the food was shocking and the manager who tried to resolve the situation not capable of a satisfactory response... In short guys , to be 5 star you have to excel in all areas , not just have an excellent building in a great area .... Send the staff to gleneagles and see how a 5 star resort hotel should really be ran .... Sorry me but you were wide of my mark and overall were only a 3 out of 5 at best ....",3,2016,05,01
148,Birthday Surprise,"This was a total surprise from my wife for my birthday 

It was an absolute experience from the beginning to the end.

We arrived mid morning so we could enjoy exploring London and was more than happy to leave our bags and come back to our room later in the day, but we were met by Marco who told us that our room would be ready in a short while and offered us a glass of refreshments whilst waiting.

We were already staying in a room which had a balcony and was offered an upgrade to the other side of the hotel overlooking the river at a small additional cost, which we accepted.

Wow... Our room was amazing and what a bonus to be able to see across London.

There was a personal birthday message written on the mirror, with a complimentary bottle of wine.

Everything in the room had that luxurious touch, from the bathrobes to the well stocked food drawer.

The surround sound throughout the room and bathroom was a very clever design.

When we returned in the evening after seeing Beautiful Carol King musical, our bed had been turned down, with certain other additional touches.

Breakfast in the morning was perfect, and checking out again we were met by Marco who made our visit very personal.

My wife told me that the communication between her and Llaria before our stay was excellent and made her feel very confident that the whole experience was going to be perfect.

The architect and design of this hotel made it stand alone from other hotels that we have stayed at.

The only points that were disappointing was that we had booked a table for after the show, in the Radio bar, where we were hoping to have a quiet supper and drink, they had not reserved a table for us, even though this had been confirmed during the day, but we quickly realised anyway that this was not the place to be for a quiet bite to eat, and we were disappointed with the initial service when  we were shown to our table at breakfast time. 

But apart from this we will definitely be back.... 

",5,2016,05,01
148,Nice hotel but didn't meet expectations,"This is a really nice hotel, but it fell short in a couple of areas.  Maintenance of the room was lacking - the entertainment system was clearly broken and the shower controls were also falling apart.  Service was excellent, and the best arrival routine of any hotel.",4,2016,05,01
148,What a terrific place to stay in the West End,"I was looking for a place to stay in London for a 2 night stopover, in the heart of the city, close to West End  when I chanced upon this wonderful hotel on the Internet. The reviews and photographs on the Internet do not do it justice. 

The building, as far as I can tell is new, the site of the former Gaiety Theatre and next door to the old BBC HQ, according to what I could find on the Internet. Its location and architecture intrigued me enough to make a brief search on the Internet to find out more. It has a wonderful Art Deco- like style, which catches the eye along the Strand. 

 Inside, the check-in atrium is breathtaking. It has a ten- storey high ceiling leading up to an oculus, which, although looking amazing during the day, is even more spectacular at night, with some fabulous light displays that will keep one staring enraptured for ages while one sips Prosecco. 

I don't have the necessary words and knowledge of interiors to describe how wonderful the rooms are but suffice to say, mine was great. Nice lighting, intriguing array of items in the minibar for consumption and also to purchase ( sober-up for the morning after ! ), great bathroom with double rain showers and a handheld shower and nice flooring in the capricious shower area, touch panel for controls by the bedside and a truly great bed and pillows.

Radio rooftop bar is definitely worth a visit or two. Hotel guests get priority for table reservations. The views of the London skyline are fantastic. Service and tapas were excellent. For me, it merited sunset drinks and tapas as well as a revisit the next day for a light lunch before a West End matinee.

My stay at ME London was a good one. It was a highlight for my short stopover in London and I would most certainly stay here again for future visits to London, next time, with family in tow. ",5,2016,04,30
148,One of the best hotels i have been in london,"Its very modern , what i like about it the most is that the have the best staff to help u with everything , 
I am platinum member at marriott and i used to say in different hotels and i didnt receive what i deserve 

Lovely room and view 
And  if u stay at the 8th floor has a balcony 
Its the first time for me here and it will not be the last and i am thinking of extending my stay  
Thank u very much (Me hotel ) for making my vacation pleasured",5,2016,04,27
148,Great business or leisure hotel in great location,"The hotel is modern, clean, and very welcoming.  Great location near key squares and galleries and restaurants.  The international staff was lovely, spoke multiple languages and was always helpful and cheerful.  We were on a business trip but had to take our daughter, they also were great help to our nanny and babe for meals.  Would recommend for business or pleasure. ",5,2016,04,26
148,21st Birthday Fun,"Me and my partner stayed here for his 21st birthday, this was the first time we have been and it is safe to say it did not disappoint! The hotel is absolutely stunning! The reception is so modern and beautiful and the rooms are just fantastic! We had a room with a balcony which was perfect, all the amenities added were exactly what we needed, breakfast was very tasty and service throughout out stay was great! Prescco on arrival and the touches in the room really made our stay! We cannot wait to return again!",5,2016,04,25
148,Amazing Hotel - Best views of London over the river,"Well what can I say apart from its an amazing Hotel, with a unique design and wow the staff could not do enough to make you feel welcome.  So we had an Energy River room on the 9th floor and the view from our balcony was great.. My husband booked this for my birthday and the staff wrote happy birthday on the mirror, there was a cake, rose petals on the bed and a bottle of Mo√´t..  We stayed there as it was right in the middle of theatre land, Covent Garden and Leicester Sq.. What else can I tell you about the hotel well when you check in on the first floor you get a complimentary glass of Prosecco and then some one shows you too your room.. You can set the lighting to what you want and if you go out then they do a turn down service with the chocolate on the pillow, softer lighting and chill out tunes on the TV. In the room there is complimentary water, coffee, tea and toiletries..  There's a mini bar but it was crazy expensive..  Whilst we were here we booked a table at the Radio Roof Bar which was lovely.. Highly recommend..",5,2016,04,25
148,So amazing. Highlight of my London stay.,"This hotel is impeccable. Service was top notch and all the amenities were perfect, from the robes to the high end toiletries. The shower, the space in the bathroom and overall minimalist luxury design of the rooms and overall hotel made the London trip so much more special. I've never wanted to hang out in a hotel room until now. The floor to ceiling windows were awesome. I would never stay in another place in London and I am a huge Melia fan now. Oh and lastly, the location was just awesome. You're away from the craziness and touristy areas but close enough to the most amazing restaurants.",5,2016,04,25
148,Birthday Luxury I will never forget ,"Me and my partner have just returned from a night in an energy river room 816,

Hotel beyond amazing in every sense. Decor is super modern and makes you want to explore every inch of the hotel. 

Views of the Thames spectacular

We had the added aura experience with champagne, roses chocolate covered strawberries and roses petals scattered on the bed and table. The mood lightening was amazing as well as the ceiling speakers for surround sound. We ended up purchasing a ME signature candle because I just had to have a memory of this amazing room. 

Make you sure you get breakfast in bed as we did, pictures enclosed, beyond phenomenal. 

I can't wait to return. 

Thank you for an amazing stay.  ",5,2016,04,24
148,Super cool but without the attitude,"An iconic new build buty Norman Foster makes it an experience.  Check in is under an awesome atrium and there are very dark and moody corridors with marble walls.  If that's not cool enough for you the walls in your room are clad in white leather! The rooms are relatively small but I had a balcony, so what's to complain about. There's no room for a comfy chair and no draws to put your clothes.  Curiously, while  they seemingly have thought of every design detail there is no clock, no pen, and a TV that can oly be viewed from bed.  The bathroom has a great walk in rain shower and the roof bar is worth a visit if only to see the view beyond the beautiful people.  Most memorable was the quality of the staff. Everyone I came in contact with went out of their way to help with any query or need.  They are totally professional, friendly and always helpful.  The  Hotel is minutes from Covent Garden so close to Theatres and transport. It was a great experience but I suspect the minimalist decor and white leather walls could make you yearn for your old couch after a while.",4,2016,04,23
148,Birthday Celebrations,"My husband and I often visit London for the weekend and we decided to stay somewhere different this time.  The ME did not disappoint !! The reception area is spectacular, we chose to stay in the Chic suite which was very spacious and a fantastic bathroom. Radio Rooftop bar is really lively and the views across the city are really something. Overall a really good hotel in a great location.",4,2016,04,21
148,Another great visit!,"In the city where hotels in general are not so great in my opinion, ME is a very good choice. Amongst old-fashioned buildings and so much history, it is so refreshing to stay in a hotel so modern, edgy and fashionable. The service was great as always. We were upgraded from Aura room to Vibe room, which was slightly bigger. The room was very stylish but comfortable and the naughty amenities, romantic lights and music and all the little details in decoration, minibar selection and so on make this a great place for a little getaway.
Location is also good, walking distance to theatres, Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and a lots of little pubs and bars to stop for a drink. We will be back.",5,2016,04,21
148,Me me me ,"Stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend for our one year anniversary... Upgraded on arrival ... Room was amazing ... Service fantastic!!! Would definitely stay again! Can complement the staff enough... Only downside we had breakfast delivered to our room, was cold and not nice to eat !! :( 

Central and if you like 5 star like me this is for you!! üëå",5,2016,04,21
148,Organised efficient and on it,"Great food very professional we'll run with lots of security and concierge etc.
Tough to get to by car with London traffic ..easy use of taxis.
We enjoyed it and would return it's not cheap but delivers value.
Nice location very handy for the area.",5,2016,04,20
148,TV Appriance,"Super friendly but professional front desk. The reception area was very cool and the complementary glass of champagne added to very welcoming mood!

148,Amazing 1st class service,"Stayed 1 nightand was so impressed with everything! Decor was trendy, room very spacious and all the staff extremely helpful, especially Ana from breakfast! She was amazing, professional and gave us very warm welcome! Lobby host Maria was super nice as well! Moreover, left some clothing in the room and they sent it back the same day without any charge. That's a real 5st service . Good job everyone!! ",5,2016,04,15
148,Brilliant place to stay and excellent service,"This hotel is really impressive and the room we were staying at was superb. Upon arrival, Aura Host Balasz Pavlik greeted us and throughout our stay he was taking care that our experience would be excellent, which he accomplished! :) 
We booked  a room for two people, but as we were 3 of us (2 adults and 1 child)  we expected to share the bed, however, as we arrived an extra bed was already in our room(what a relief!) and a bottle of champagne already waiting for us on the table, thanks again to Balasz! And for 3 days my little brother couldn't get out of the shower as he loved it so much. :) Will definitely comeback to stay here again!",5,2016,04,14
148,Love Love Love,"What a fantastic hotel, fab location, great service, cool rooms. even cooler bars and the staff were amazing, Christala who works for the Aura Team is oustanding, lovely touch of sending chocolate covered strawberries to our room, as it was my boyfriends birthday, and a free room upgrade.  will book again in the very near future, here and Europe! thanks ",5,2016,04,14
148,"Excellent experience at ME, London","My husband and I selected ME for our week in London because of it's excellent location and full breakfast. While the very avant-garde style was a bit arresting at first, the outstanding full, and healthy breakfast, and the highly attentive and professional staff made our stay a solid 5/5. A special shout-out to bellman ""Larado""(sp?) from Brazil and all the staff at Cucina who prepared a healthy filling breakfasts that fortified us for full days of exploring. ME London was a very pleasant surprise! Our sincere thanks.",5,2016,04,13
148,great location great hotel,excellent hotel in a fantastic location.  staff very friendly and helpful. my major complaint is that at night it was difficulty to get an elevator to our room given all of the people going to the radio bar on the roof. the hotel seemed to give preference for elevator service to the people going to the bar rather than the hotel patrons as they had two elevators dedicated to the bar and only one for hotel customers which resulted in my wife an I waiting over ten minutes one night just to get an elevator to get to our room. I think this situation should be improved.,5,2016,04,11
148,Another great stay at the ME hotel,"Second time me and fiance have stayed here now and we cant wait to go back. I contacted the Aura team so that i could have champagne and flowers in the room upon arrival, yet again Catherine could not do enough for us throughout our stay and had everything organised to ensure it was perfect.
The hotel is excellent, the views from the roof top bar are perfect and we both recommend this hotel to all our friends and family.",5,2016,04,11
148,The best 1st hotel Birthday experience EVER!,"Amazing customer service!!!. We had a slight problem with the taps in our room, the manager happily moved us after taking a look and finding that it couldn't be fixed then and there. They moved us to a room with a higher floor, with a balcony and gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne!!! It is a beautiful building, everyone was lovely and friendly. The restaurant we went to had an amazing aroma and the food was amazing too. We'd definitely be going back!",5,2016,04,10
148,Break in London,"The Reception is on the first floor.  it is very dark here and in the the corridors to the point of feeling claustrophobic.
The lifts had a mind of their own on the first day of our visit which coupled with the darkness did not fill me with confidence about my surroundings.  However, the bedrooms were light and airy and quite spacious. ",4,2016,04,07
148,Very trendy and ultra stylish design but..,"It's a very stylish design hotel with fantastic social areas, namely the rooftop bar Radio.
But the staff need to be helpful and friendly. Most of them are very helpful and with careful service but, namely at the Radio bar they are somewhat arrogant and do able to satisfy you.
I requested to go to a part of the rooftop with the view to Thames river but they had it closed and not available to let me only go there to take a picture.
Drunk a gin tonic Oxley which was not done in the proper glass nor with the proper tonic water.",5,2016,04,07
148,Very very happy,"My husband, daughter (age 6) and I stayed at Easter weekend. From start to finish we were made very welcome, there were plenty of obliging staff on hand who were very friendly and helpful. The rooftop bar is well worth a visit to see the panoramic views and the lobby is a lovely place to chill and watch the light show after a long day sightseeing. Our room was huge and very well equipped - only small moan is that the beds were harder than we all would have liked. Location superb. Can't wait to stay again one day...",5,2016,04,07
148,Amazing hotel,"Stayed 4 night here with my family during the Rugby world cup having watched the semi's games, truly a remarkable hotel with amazing hospitality and environment. Staff are great and very friendly! The roof top bar/ restaurant has an amazing view and the gym is perfect to burn a bit of good food off!",5,2016,04,07
148,A very nice contemporary hotel,"A great stay and the rooftop bar is a must. All staff were friendly and prompt in whatever task they carried out ie car valet, concierge, reception, breakfast etc. we will definitely return to this hotel.",4,2016,04,06
148,Wonderful - as expected ,"ME by Melia London is a beautiful hotel. The staff are welcoming and helpful and the hotel lobby and reception 'floor' are absolutely stunning. Very much a haven in the centre of London. 

The rooms themselves (we have stayed in two similar rooms) are spacious and functional. The beds are huge and so comfortable and the lighting is wonderful. We had a broken remote control, the only issue we had, which was fixed within minutes of calling reception. The mini-bar and room service selection are incredible but pricey. 

The location is the best thing about this hotel. Almost directly off of Covent Garden, it's incredibly convenient. The traffic outside can be heavy, but it is central London. 

We will stay here again, our favourite hotel in London. ",5,2016,04,06
148,A great cocktail party!,"We were not allocated in the hotel, but we wanted take some drinks in the Roof Top Bar.
When we  arrived we met Helvia who was very friendly with us and she showed us the hotel as well.
The hotel is amazing and the Radio Bar with the views worth it.
We can`t wait for stay in the hotel in our next stay in London.",5,2016,04,06
148,An architectural contemporary experience,"Spent a wonderful 2 nights at this fabulous hotel on The Strand which is a must if you are taking a theatre break as shows are a short distance from the hotel. Hotel is very Bond-like and dark and dramatic and the ME essence wafts as you enter the dramatic atrium and corridors. Service was exemplary and was offered Proseco on check in! Rooms are very spacious for London and very comfortable and I spent ages looking for lighting controls to discover there was a remote control panel by the bed! Restaurant is very hip and trendy and serves amazing steaks to rival Gaucho and atmosphere was really buzzing with a live DJ. I had the Rib Eye with Lobster Tail topping for an additional ¬£17! The fairground dessert is very clever too with candyfloss, toffee apple, marshmellow etc served on a metal ferris wheel. Lastly the roof top bar is the jewel in the crown with the most amazing views of South Bank. I want to be there for New Year fireworks for sure! Thanks for superb stay and best ever in London for sure.",5,2016,04,06
148,"Fabulous public areas, shame about the rooms.","The service at this hotel from the doorman to front desk was excellent. The staff at the hotel were exceptionally helpful and a credit to the hotel. The ambience of the hotel was good and the bars and restaurants are fabulous. The view from Radio bar on the roof is fantastic. However, the downside was the room itself. The door to the bathroom had a hole in the bottom corner, it shook when the air conditioning was on and the toilet door closed with a bang because it wasn't magnetised and there is no handle or lock. Call me a traditionalist but I prefer to keep my toilette habits private and the arrangement of these doors don't help! The room had various scuff marks, not good enough for a five star and we were interrupted in the momring, twice, by someone intent of checking the mini bar. Housekeeping walked in without knocking and although she clearly had expected us to have vacated the room, she didn't bother to check first by knocking! We won't be a staying at this hotel again, but we will be back for a meal and cocktails.",4,2016,04,04
148,"""DIVINE"" ","The hotel is divine, London has a shortage of luxury hotels. This is a diamond ! It's absolutely shinning literally with its sleek stylish atmosphere with slick music. Just where I would like to be seen night after night. Staff always very helpful rooms clean, modern what more could you want ? Great restaurants and a roof top bar! Always a few famous people in and out keep your eyes peeled ;) you never know who you mite bump in to... Stayed in room 106 this time round couldn't here a thing from inside, not one bit of traffic. Can't fault this hotel or any of the other 'Me' hotels I've stayed at! The consistency in keeping appearance and experience factor at each of their hotels is always 100%. Can't wait to return, keep up the good work ! ",5,2016,04,04
148,As Advertised,"Staff very willing to help, not that we asked too much of them but eager and polite. Rooms as advertised although the offer of an upgrade at a discount was still an additional ¬£260 ($450) felt like I was being played, all the more given I had not seen my room yet. That was not a bargain.

Radio bar nice but I'm afraid it was a bit trashy, too many non-guests, smokers and people who were out of step with the price I paid and who were not staying. From my perspective this damaged my view of the hotel and facilities.

I think based on this I'd try another on my many frequent visits to London.",3,2016,04,03
148,Best hotel in London,It is our 3rd visit to this hotel. We wouldn't stay anywhere else. The style of this hotel is amazing the staff and location Perfect. Love it. Can't wait to go back  Originally found it by accident. LOVE IT xxxxxx,5,2016,04,03
148,Great experience!,"Had a fantastic stay at the ME hotel, meeting friends to see Adele at the O2. Wow check in area, made to feel very welcome & glass of prosecco whilst waiting (same on checkout) concierge booked our external restaurants & again very helpful, phoning me to confirm details.  They really went out of their way to meet our requirements. Fantastic room service breakfast. In room music selection with a range of chill out tunes. Definitely would recommend & will stay again!

148,Fun weekend in london,"Make sure you try stk restaurant for cocktails and steak and radio bar on a sunny afternoon for pre dinner / club experience.
Excellent hotel in every way except for bed and pillow comfort, too soft for me.",5,2016,04,03
148,Heavenly,Best service and staff !!! Cocktail barmen (wish I could remeber the names) made the stay! Would definitely come again!! And inroom service so good! Thanks to everyone for a great time!!! Concierge for knowing your name before you approach the desk is so special!!  And the doorman...  just everyone!!! To many to mention!!!Keep up the great work! Can't want to come back!!! Mr Kay,5,2016,04,02
148,Ten out of ten,I have just returned from a stay at the ME hotel following birthday celebrations for my friend. The service at this hotel was impeccable from every single member of staff we encountered. After a mild hiccup with our table at STK ( the hotel restaurant) the staff went over and above the call of duty to accommodate us. A special mention to Ronan Gawronski for his kindness and generosity. Overall the hotel is fabulously located for the West End and Covent Garden. Would stay here again without hesitation. ,5,2016,04,02
148,Favourite Hotel in London,"This was my second stay at ME and it was even better than the first. The decor of the whole hotel is incredible, I love the vibe and nothing was too much trouble from the staff. Everything is a little pricey including STK restaurant but you really do get what you pay for. Can't wait for my next stay!",5,2016,04,02
148,Amazing anniversary ,"We returned to the Me hotel for the 2nd time on our anniversary, this is by far one of the best hotels in London. 
All the staff are welcoming and extremely helpfull. 
Helvia and her team showed prepared our room with even a suprise for us and was extremely friendly and welcoming. 

It's an amazing hotel with brilliant staff and the added bonus of a great rooftop bar. 

Brilliant and thank you to all the team at ME London.

We will be back in August !",5,2016,04,01
148,A great stay in a splendid hotel with top-of-their-game staff,"Right from the Concierge greeting at the front door (who then walked with me to the first floor Reception), every single member of staff I encountered was excellent. They were friendly, and very efficient. Check in was fast and the reception team's level and style of service was splendid. And the room!! I loved it. Enough of the fixtures and features in the room make it a unique experience in London. I was on the 5th floor, and the building feels so solid and silent. I didn't hear a peep from either neighbouring room, no doors banging along the corridor.

Breakfast felt busy, but the team were equally as friendly and efficient. For the Full English your order is taken and it is served to you from the kitchen rather than being buffet style. There is an additional buffet area of continental items. 

The rooftop bar has to be visited. Views on the river side of the property are iconic. The properties location makes it perfect for business trips to The City, a short walk to either Temple or Embankment station for District Line to Mansion House/Cannon Street etc
 
I sincerely hope the property becomes a firm London favourite.",5,2016,03,31
148,Amazing views,"Checked into our fab u lous ""room with a view"" plus balcony today and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff are so friendly and helpful, the rooms well appointed, the location on the fringe of Covent Garden and The Strand so convenient and the views to die for. Had tapas at the bar on the tenth floor - food was excellent - and could see from there St Paul's, Tower Bridge, Oxo Tower, The Shard, The Gherkin, Waterloo Bridge and National Theatre, The Thames of course, London Eye, Big Ben, Battersea Power Station and more.  Love it!!!",5,2016,03,30
148,"no hot running water in the mornings, credit not given to rewards card",This is a fairly upscale hotel in central London. My experience was not positive as water would not come out of my sink or shower in the morning for about 5 minutes. Loyalty credits also not credited.,2,2016,03,30
148,My favourite hotel in London by far,"I spend a lot of time in hotels in London with work... I've stayed at the Corinthia, the Waldorf, the Mayfair, Granges etc. And I keep returning here... No matter how far away from work I am! I stayed in the Waldorf last week to give it a go and felt sad walking past the ME in the morning.. Great location opposite Covent Garden. 
Incredibly friendly staff who are more than happy to help, no matter what you need. I love being greeted with a glass of prosecco and a warm welcome after a long day. 
The rooms are spacious and very modern, with great facilities and the best stocked mini bar I have ever seen. Love the rainbow lighting panel and the bathrooms are great - good lighting for makeup! I am looking forward to having an energy urban terrace room in summer when I can actually enjoy the balcony.
Also great being in the same hotel as radio rooftop. 
No complaints, ever. Looking forward to trying the Ibiza ME over summer. ",5,2016,03,29
148,Very clean and spacious rooms in perfect Londong location,"Service is of great standard, Rooms are very clean and modern, big room compared to London hotels, exact location you want to be in the middle of everything and price is quit good value for money. breakfast is a must although it is small one but you will love it. look for a lady called Maria in the Breakfast area, she is great.",5,2016,03,28
148,Wow what a find!,"Came across a review of the ME London by accident and decided to book a room for a business trip.  Fantastic hotel, amazing staff all very friendly approachable and knowledgeable.  Room and the facilities were absolutely fantastic.  Great style and ambiance and the food was first class.  The location was also perfect for my needs.  I will definitely stay there again very soon.  Highly recommend it.",5,2016,03,24
148,How to be pampered,"Right in the centre of London's theatre district this hotel can only be faulted in minor things.
From the smooth friendly and efficient arrival to the similar departure this is an hotel that you can only enjoy. 
The staff, in particular deserve a 10 star appraisal. Never have I been so well treated by everyone who truly seemed to care that my experience was as good as possible. 
The room (801) was lovely, modern and everything worked as advertised. The bed was sumptuous and a great nights' sleep was had; the noise of London was effectively silenced. The double shower was to die for. My only niggle was that the 'bed turn-down' service somehow managed to arrange the room for a single occupant: used towelling was resupplied for one; one chocolate; one pair of slippers by the bed etc. (I note that this has been mention in at least one other review - the check out staff too were surprised and aware of the previous comment).
Breakfast was stunning, and excellent value for the price. 
OK this isn't a cheap hotel but when you take in its location, it's amenities and above all its staff I feel it is exceptional value for money. ",4,2016,03,23
148,Fashionable hotel.,"Really nice and comfortable hotel. Breakfast was very good. The room neat and comfortable . Comfortable beds. Friendly staff. Fashionable hotel with several bars and restaurants, good menu for room service. We will definitely stay here again !
The only negative was the lighting and mirror in the bathroom. When applying makeup you have to take a pocket mirror and stand in the window of daylight, the mirror was too far away and only spotlights in the ceiling.",5,2016,03,20
148,First time at Me London,"I spent 3 nights here during my business trip to London. Nice & friendly staff offered an early checking at 8.30 am though the room is for disabilities which I didnt mind but the reception didnt tell me all the fact that it's a connecting room and the bed is not a real king but twin beds putting together. Btw, i could move to the new room w/o any problem next day. Nice complementary drinks and good foods. ",4,2016,03,19
148,"Great stay, a few finishing touches missing","We stayed here for one night midweek. The hotel is stunning with amazing design. 
I would highly recommend staying here. 
It is a great hotel but for the price and being 5 stars out should be perfect. 
The missing touches were the locks were missing on the bathroom doors and this meant that the shower door would not stay closed. 
Turn down service only turned the room down for one person yet two of us were staying. 
Only small things but as I say for the price it should all be good. 
Will probably stay again. ",4,2016,03,18
148,Quick stopover in London for the night,"I found the location to be excellent for my quick trip to London. I normally take the Heathrow express into London and then cab to a hotel but I had a very small case this trip so I jumped on the Piccadilly from Heathrow straight to Covent Garden. It was a fast and easy shot and then I walked through covent garden and very quickly found the hotel. I found the check in experience to be very pleasant (the concierge greeted me as I walked through the doors and then took me up to the check in area via elevator). Then I entered a very interesting room. The room kind of reminded me of a super luxury (black granite walls and white leather couches) version of the chamber in interview with the vampires where the vampires are executed via sun. I say this because the walls extended all the way up to the top of the building to an ultimate small skylight. Weird shaped room but very cool. Anyways, so I was offered a beverage (glass of bubbly) while I checked in. The staff were warm and accommodating. I was offered an upgrade to a slightly larger room for only 70 GBP more. ""only"". I stuck to my standard Aura room and it was lovely. The bali shower was amazing and the beds were comfy and plush. The tech savvy room is hooked up with very modern electronics (music, tv and ambient lighting). I was able to request a late checkout which provided me with an extra hour and a half to stay in bed. 

I paid extra to have breakfast included in my original booking at the Cucina Asselina. It was ok. I didn't really think the value was that exceptional for the money. There was a decent selection of pastries and yogurt and juice in addition to some menu items but I wasn't particularly impressed in the quality of the hot meal and think the 30 GBP that they charge is too pricey for the product.

Overall, I would stay there again but likely eat breakfast elsewhere unless I was feeling lazy.",4,2016,03,18
148,Location and service,"Great location, nearby Tube circle line, great service, quiet and clean hotel, great sleep, maybe an average but honest breakfast, A must see view at the Radio Club. Although you need to love the modern, clean-cut, pure design of the hotel and of the rooms. Not the place for the typical British B'n'B. Really hip place. Will go back and worth the price",5,2016,03,17
148,Excellent stay,"The ME London is an extraordinary hotel with an amazing interior design, luxury rooms and outstanding service. You immeditaly recognise the well trained employees from the doork over receiption to bar - you feel welcome all the time. Perfect stay - I found a new hotel for my monthly London visits.",5,2016,03,15
148,Top Hotel!,"Had such a great time at ME London. The location is great, perfect place to experience London, the decor and rooms are fabulous and there is a great selection of restaurants and bars. But the staff really make this experience. We were greeted by a friendly and helpful concierge who offered us a complimentary glass of Prosecco. We then met the hospitality staff at reception who were so friendly and really welcomed us to the hotel. We were helped with our luggage and all questions were answered knowledgeably and in a warm friendly manner. We received a voucher for a drink at a choice of two of the bars. We visited the Italian restaurant - lovely and the roof top bar - very lively with great cocktails. We had our complimentary cocktail in STK bar which was so good we stayed for another 3! Communicating with Room Service was the easiest I have experienced in a London hotel. Also, booking this hotel was least stressful booking I have made in a long time! I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2016,03,14
148,Impossible Better,"Outstanding, excellent location, service, atmosphere, perfect location in the theater district, great restaurants in the neighborhood, really walking distance to the Trafalgar Square. It is simple Awesome.",5,2016,03,14
148,"Expensive, but worth it.","Awesome hotel with all the mod-cons. Great location, walking distance to loads of amazing restaurants and attractions. Lovely staff. Rooms are very technological, which is both a plus and a minus. It's pretty hard figuring out where to plug your phone in to play music, but we got there eventually! ",5,2016,03,14
148,Modern WOW,"ME Hotel is perfectly located to visit the West End and Covent Garden. We stayed for one Friday night and loved the stunning high ceiling in the first floor reception, hurricane candles and deliciously cold glass of prosecco on arrival. 
Our Aura room was very modern, clean and comfortable with great pillows. Only niggle was no plug near a mirror so tricky to style hair. Great range of toiletries and mini bar offerings. 
We visited STK for cocktails before we went to the Adelphi Theatre (5 min walk away) and instantly agreed we must come for a second stay and eat at STK as tables looked great.
After our theatre visit we went back to the hotel and went to Radio, the roof top bar. Great views but limited seating as very popular. Cocktails were created with an entertaining flourish. We visited again on the Saturday afternoon and managed to get seats. 
Overall we loved this modern hotel, would stay again. Loved the hotel scent!",5,2016,03,13
148,In London When its all about ME,"Great location for this hip London hotel right in SOHO right beside the theater district.
Fun, great design quite rooms, nice size beds and well situated.  I had a nice king size bed looking over the street the room was quite, nice size especially for London..Service was attentive, everyone super friendly and the bar at the top is a blast...Enjoy, I know I will be back",5,2016,03,11
148,Highly recommended!,"Very clean and up to date, perfect room service. Great central location (London Eye, Big Ben, National Gallery: 10 minutes walk). The rooftop bar and the restaurant are very pleasant and the breakfast (buffet + √† la carte) is great.
A special thank you to the friendly receptionist (Liverpool fan) who helped me with my quest for food magazines.
This is my second visit at Me London and I highly recommend this place.",5,2016,03,10
148,Simply Stunning!,"What an amazing hotel! Would highly recommend to anyone!
The suite was stunning, staff were faultless, food to die for and cocktails like no other! Couldn't fault a thing...looking forward to our next stay! Thankyou ME London...we will be back! üòçüåÉüçπx",5,2016,03,09
148,Stay here,"You should stay here. Innovative space, memorable experience, outstanding location, and a truly remarkable staff. The sense of welcome was impressive. Their desire to make your stay the best it could be was both honest and inspired based on their response to a minor complaint.  The rooms are chic and well appointed with really comfortable beds. Great restaurants and a unmissable rooftop bar. The pride in their service, their property and product was remarkable.  Thank you Kenya and Guillaume for just really great service.  They care, it shows.  Highly recommend. ",5,2016,03,08
148,ME Rooftop Bar is fantastic!!,"Visited the ME Rooftop Bar for a business function.  Truly stunning bar with amazing views of London.  Plenty seats, space & panoramic views. .  Staff very professional, friendly & great service.  
Highly recommended when in London for a drink",5,2016,03,08
148,Excellent Experience,"The hotel is stunning, with an excellent staff; They were all very friendly and professional, specially Balazs Pavlik, the Aura Host, who helped us with all our requirements and made our stay really comfortable.The mexican girl at reception was also very friendly.
The hotel itself is obviously a looker, having been designed by Sir Norman Foster it is in itself an architectural landmark, and the reception area is simply amazing. The rooftop bar is fantastic and has wonderful and extensive views of London.
The room we got was very big and comfortable, very stylishly decorated and high-tech, with a very user-friendly ambient light panel to make the room more personal.
The breakfast was also very good, with buffet options but also served at the table I recommend the fantastic poached eggs with salmon and bearnese sauce...delicious!
The location is also perfect, within walking distance from many of the tourist attractions in London. If you're after a place that is luxurious and modern, this is your place.",5,2016,03,07
148,Amazing! üíó,"Had the most amazing stay! 

When we arrived we were greeted by lovely staff who offered to take our bags from us and also asked if we would like a glass of prosecco such amazing service, we were then taken to our room which again I could not fault!

We have eaten within the restaurant on many occasions and visited the radio bar however had never stayed within the hotel and it was incredible.

Thanks for the great service ME!",5,2016,03,07
148,Superb service (great view in the bar too).,"From the moment you enter the hotel and are guided to the reception, the staff are without exception helpful and friendly. Check in was quick and efficient. The Quality Manager accompanied me to the room and took time to explain all the functions (it is quite hi-tech so this was very welcome). 

I booked a Chic Suite which was beautifully appointed. As I had an evening meeting which required a video conference I had mentioned this to the Quality Manager to ensure that I would have bandwidth for the call. She was kind enough to call the room prior to my meeting to ensure that it was all working correctly - great attention to detail. 

The location of the hotel is tremendously convenient for Covent Garden, with lots of dining options nearby. I highly recommend a cocktail in the Radio Rooftop Bar at the end of he evening: Great music and stunning views towards the Thames, the City and the Shard. Magnificent. 

Great hotel. Highly recommended. Thank you. ",5,2016,03,06
148,Superb 5**,"ME London is superb & located right in heart of vibrant London. It is very close to Convent Garden. 

Hotel & rooms are of a high standard! Hotel staff were very friendly & helpful. 

Having a drink in Radio Bar is a must & STK is located at the rear of the hotel. 

Thoroughly enjoyed our experience & highly recommended.  
",5,2016,03,05
148,Where's the 5th star??,"My husband and I stayed here for a 'romantic getaway'. We paid a lot of money for what was supposed to be a treat for us. We booked a room with a terrace on the 8th floor. When we arrived the concierge lady only spoke to my husband and didn't even bother to give me any eye contact or say hi, this is the general attitude of a lot of the staff members. went to reception which is where the wow factor is, it's a huge marble atrium which I must say is impressive (but boiling like the rest of the hotel in general). I don't like lifts so I'm more than happy to take the stars- that's my choice and I'm fine with it. However the staff are not. Every time I went to the stair case I was stopped and asked where I was going and looked at like I had two heads. At one point I was stopped in the stairwell by a staff member who didn't speak very good English- he asked where I was going- I told him I was going outside - he then told me to come with him THROUGH THE STAFF QUARTERS and out of a fire exit down the side of the hotel! I can only assume he thought I was a member of staff. On the second day my husband got stuck in the lift.. It went completely black and he called the alarm button which did not work. Luckily after 10 minutes someone called the lift from the ground floor and the lift started up again and went back down. Thank god I wasn't in there as I don't think I could have dealt with that as well as my husband did. Obviously this is an issue for the lift company and not the hotel itself though. I didn't find the room particularly luxurious, very plain, a nespresso machine but no instructions or coffee menu, or any instruction on how to use the fancy lighting systems or air conditioning so we were left to figure that out. There were stains on the curtains and the terrace furniture. After the lift incident my husband complained and we were moved to a suite which was nicer but no terrace.We left the 'please clean the room' sign on the door but when I returned that evening it hadn't been cleaned as they said we had the do not disturb sign on. I can only assume someone had knocked it off and replaced it on the wrong side. I asked for the cleaners to come but they didn't replace the toiletries or bins. The walls are paper thin and we could hear are neighbours having a 'good time' during the night!! I wouldn't advise walking around the ground floor on a Saturday night as there were a lot of people hanging around the lifts swearing and waiting for the lifts up to the elusive 'Radio' Bar. We went to the bar in STK on the ground floor which was a horrible atmosphere, loud and full of older gentlemen entertaining their ''girlfriends'' (I use that term loosely). Of course there's little that the hotel can do about their clientele but it was generally pretentious and unpleasant but I guess that's personal opinion. The breakfast was pleasant but after ordering in the restaurant on our last day we waited 30 minutes for it to arrive and mine had a hair in it. This is a very expensive hotel and apart from the location I can't see the value at all, if we hadn't got a buy two get one night free deal I would have left after the first two nights. I do understand that perhaps we just had bad luck with a few of the things that happened but some things need addressing. ",3,2016,03,04
148,Amazing hotel in the heart of The Theatre District,"From check- in, it becomes clear this is no ordinary hotel. The interior is stunning and innovative. The main lobby is a marble oblisque which projects beautiful light shows right upto the hotel roof-top bar ""Radio."" 

Staff are all super friendly and helpful and the rooms feel luxurious. I wish we had had more time to chill in the bar where Alexander McQueen dresses Re displayed all around. at check - in you can lounge watching the light displays and enjoy acomplimentary drink. 

We did go to STk to restaurant downstairs. Food is fabulous - best steak ever - but a bit too loud for me - it was near impossible to talk! 

I can't wait to go back, it's in such a great location , when you come out of the door - you are 2 minutes away from Covent Garden!",5,2016,03,03
148,Elegant ,Visited for business reception and awards ceremony. Excellent facilities and first class service. Food excellent and the ambiance was perfect for the event. Even the house DJ was good! Second visit. Couldn't be faulted on either occasion.,5,2016,03,02
148,Luxury at it's finest,"The pre-arrival service is brilliant. All our requests were taken care of before we arrived.

The hotel offers excellent facilities, exclusive services and superb personal attention. A special mention to Catherine the Aura Manager who made our stay unforgettable.

The entire experience exceedingly surpassed our expectations. 

True professionals, from the housekeeping team to the management team, all working together to make your stay awesome and spectacular.

We are returning in May 2016 and and have also booked a family holiday at the ME Hotel Ibiza in September 2016",5,2016,03,02
148,Great stay in the ME again.,Great hotel in a fantastic location. Staff very helpful and attentive. Decor modern and fresh. Bed very comfortable in a most comfortable room which was always a pleasure to return to. Food great in the restaurants ,5,2016,03,01
148,Good but not really me,"Second visit to this hotel. Had a chic suite again (710). Even after two visits I'm still not sure what to make of this hotel. It is a very good hotel but there is something about it that leaves me feeling slightly unresolved. This could well be me rather than the hotel. It is very modern and 'funky' etc etc. This translates into positives and negatives - e.g, the suite had one of the best mini-bars of any hotel I've visited but the lighting in the corridors will leave you wishing you'd packed a torch.
The staff were very efficient and for the most part genuinely friendly. Both hotel bars are good. I prefer the quieter Marconi bar on the ground floor. The hotel attracts a young, and in some limited cases, quite a raucous crowd. On one occasion a bit more 'supervision' on the ground floor would not have gone a miss.
The hotel is constructed around a 'hollow' pyramid. The reception is at the base of this pyramid (second floor). Standing in reception and looking up reveals the inherent problem for me - it is ultra modern, imaginative, striking, impressive, creative but slightly cold and ever so slightly dehumanising. ",3,2016,02,28
148,"Avant-garde hotel with innovative design, cosmopolitan atmosphere and contemporary music","Loved the ambience of the hotel. The Cucina restaurant was amazing. Not rustic italian home cooking, more like italian contemporary fusion. Super quiet rooms given its location on a busy London junction off the Strand. The Radio roof top bar on the 9th floor has a open 360 stunning view over London and the Thames, with a funky dj, and buzzing atmosphere.",5,2016,02,28
148,Excellent!,"Quality throughout. 

From the well presented staff with exceptional manners to the ambiance of the hotel itself. The experience we had at ME London was first class. An excellent location and great for romantic getaways. I would most definitely recommend ME London to anybody considering a weekend break.",5,2016,02,28
148,Nice experience ... Rooftop bar staff let this hotel down.,"My friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a night here at the ME.
The concierge were very friendly and made us feel welcome on our return.
This carried through to the reception staff also whilst checking in. 
Very professional and made us feel special.
We were offered a welcome drink of Prosecco which was a lovely touch.

Our room was amazing. Modern, clean and an amazing view of London. Bed was large and very comfy. We were very pleased with it.
We had a drink in the downstairs bar/restaurant which was nice. Friendly bartender ... Friendly staff.

Unfortunately the let down to this hotel is the Radio Rooftop bar. The bar staff upstairs were so rude !!! 
It was shocking !!
A complete opposite experience up there compared to the rest of the staff in the hotel.
In my opinion the bar staff were young and quite full of themselves. We waited for 20 mins at the bar to be served. When we finally waved a hand to ask if we could be served ... A hand was waved in our face as if to say ""I'm ready now"" !!
Unbelievable.....
If I was the manager of this hotel i would be investing training skills to the ""young bar staff"" on customer service and respect.

The views from the rooftop are amazing and that's about it really. A real shame.

Our stay here was a pleasant experience but we probably wouldn't stay here again.

148,Superior Service and Hotel!,"This was our first trip to London, and as such my wife and I were nervous about the hotel and location. Prior to arriving, I was in contact with the Aura manager, Catherine Precilla and her staff who made every request of mine come true! Our time at the ME London was beyond any experience my wife and I have ever had. We were treated like royalty from the second we arrived until we left. From the moment we checked in, we were greeted by name and offered a refreshment. When we walked into our room, we were greeted with personalized welcome gifts and a card. The room was impeccable, the service was five star, and Mrs. Precilla was the one who made our experience so wonderful. 

This hotel is very professional and modern in every way. From the moment you get dropped off by your car, you‚Äôre welcomed by the ME London staff in suits offering to take all your luggage and transport it to your room. The hotel is in an amazing location and within walking distance of some of the most iconic landmarks London has to offer. Again, with this being our first trip to London, my wife and I couldn‚Äôt have picked a better place to stay. I HIGHLY encourage you to stay at the ME London, especially if this is your first time! Going forward, we will only choose to stay at the ME London. 

A very special thank you to Mrs. Precilla and all the staff there who helped make our week in London so memorable.",5,2016,02,27
148,"Super modern, super service","I recently stay the ME for 5 days during a business trip and would certainly consider returning. A few things to know about this hotel: It's a very slick, modern hotel. Lots of black, white and marble. If you are looking for a traditional hotel experience, then you might want to choose a different property because this may not be your style. My only complaint is that in trying to look ultra luxe, they've installed a lot of black marble, dark carpeting and black paint in the hallways and public areas. It gives the whole hotel, and especially the hallways, a really dark look. 
That said, once you open the door to your room, you've got a really beautiful, clean, white room. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. It was quiet. I enjoyed the little extras like the rain shower, mood lighting, extra thick towels, free wifi, well stocked mini bar and Nespresso machine. I also really appreciated the nightly turn down service with a complementary bottle of water. I also ordered room service a couple of times-good food and quick service. The service at this hotel is really terrific as well. I checked in at 8 am and they had a room ready for me immediately. That was a nice surprise after an overnight flight. I also needed to leave a day early and they were very accommodating. Location is terrific too. You are short walk from many of the London's best sites and you are surrounded by several theaters and great restaurants. 
Other than the dark hallways, my only other issue was the temperature in the room. It was very hard to get the room cooled properly. It wasn't a big issue during the winter, but if you are staying in the summer, I would be aware of that. 
Otherwise terrific stay and I'd go back again.",4,2016,02,26
148,Great one night stay,"This is a seriously cool hotel In a fantastic location. Tucked in behind Covent Garden with all the sights on your doorstep. Gorgeous check in staff offered a welcome glass of fizz on arrival which helped lubricate the decision to upgrade for a small fee from our entry level room to a Chic Suite. Worth every penny for the huge double-headed shower, extra living room space and large deep soak bath tub. Loved all the little extras like candles dotted around the room, trendy magazines, fruit and luxury toiletries. Techno-heads will like the gadgetry of the rooms with huge plasma TVs and touch screen wall panels that control everything but the sink. Drinks upstairs on the outdoor rooftop terrace were bracing but afforded great views of the city and the concierge even wangled us a table in the fully booked STK restaurant which had a DJ and some seriously good tunes to harmonise with the delicious rib eye and soft shell crab. Only small downside to this otherwise impeccable hotel is the gym which is pretty small and limited for those who like a decent array of fitness equipment. That said you are two minute jog from the riverside and what a great place to work off those very unnecessary Espresso Martinis. I do recommend joining the Melia awards scheme as the perks are better than other hotel loyalty schemes.... Reduced nightly rates and complimentary upgrades when available. I can't wait to go back.",5,2016,02,25
148,"Modern, exciting hotel","Fab stay in really modern, unique hotel.  Made you feel very special as a guest - modern, high spec rooms with a luxurious feel.  Huge, comfy beds and fantastic bathroom/shower.  Nice touches with robes, chocolates, surround sound etc in Vibe rooms.  Great food and friendly, helpful staff.  Would definately recommend.",5,2016,02,24
148,Special Occasion at ME London,"I wanted to thank you for a fantastic weekend. The Luscious package was a great idea and my wife loved it. The hotel was beyond our expectations and we had a great evening in STK and Radio. 

The service you provided before us coming to the hotel and while we were there was exemplary. ",5,2016,02,24
148,FABULOUS hotel!,"Fabulous! Just what I was looking for!
Stay here 3 days January 29th easy and quick taxi ride from London Victoria station. Service is top notch from the minute we approached the front entrance! Excellent service from the front desk- checked us in very early  (9:30am) when we mentioned we just stepped  off a long transatlantic flight. 

Hotel is clean, sleek and modern. Drinks flowing during the check in process is a nice touch. Room was impeccable with a comfortable bed, great mini bar selection, espresso machine and great bathroom amenities. AWESOME location for touring‚Ä¶ hop on and hop off bus at your door. Tons of restaurants, bars and shops within walking distance. 

I really have no complaints! Would definitely recommend and will be back when we return to London!",5,2016,02,24
148,Great place to stay!,"Me and my partner stayed at the Hotel in december. We decided to upgrade our room to 9th floor - and so got a good view of Covent Garden. The location of the hotel was fantastic. 
Had a nice dinner at STK the food was very fine and high quality.  

I left a few item in the room and i contacted the hotel as soon as i had departed. One of the staff from security named karim was super kind to send all my items free of cost to my address. Very friendly staff. I was so happy to have my stuff sent!
We were very satisfied with our stay, will definitely come back.",5,2016,02,24
148,Great stay near Covent Garden,"Very modern hotel with privileged location. Walking distance to some of main turist attractions. Big room ( we've got the one with bay window), awesome rain shower. Staff is very friendly. The hotel has a trendy decor that may not please everybody. We've loved it.",5,2016,02,23
148,Great roof bar with outstanding views of LDN.,"Room was narrow but very long. Lovely room with 'mood' lighting, although the controller was barely fixed to the wall. 
TV was ok but the radio channels kept stuttering somehow.
Bathroom was lovely and big - long an narrow!
Would definitely recommend and stay again.
Lifts to the roof bar took a while but hey, it was worth it.",5,2016,02,23
148,One night stay superior room. Couple,Amazing stay wish we had stayed for longer! Fantastic staff very helpful and quick to assist.  Couldn't fault anything highly recommended and worth the money. Radio rooftop bar was great. Didn't use restaurants but I'm sure they would have been lovely too  ,5,2016,02,23
148,"Funky hotel, great location.","We stayed here the weekend before Valentine's Day, so pretended it was 14th Feb.  The hotel is very modern and funky.  We were able to book a table at the Radio Bar on the 10th floor with no minimum spend as we were guests in the hotel, so headed here for pre-dinner cocktails.  We were seated by the door to the outside terrace and it was freezing.  The kindly staff were able to move us to a high table with stools away from the door.  However, the music was too loud to make conversation without shouting.  We were woken in the middle of the night by a couple having a huge row at high volume, much banging and crashing of furniture, and it went on for ages.   In the morning the Reception staff apologised for the disturbance (they had to call the police) and offered us free breakfast (which we didn't want) or a free room upgrade if we stay in a Me Hotel in the future, which we thought was a nice gesture.  We would definitely stay here again, and perfect if you want to eat at Roka, just over the road.",4,2016,02,21
148,Attentive and thoughtful,"My partner booked this hotel as part of a surprise birthday trip for me. Balaz, the host of the Aura rooms had been extremely helpful when planning parts of the surprise for me, and everything was done to perfection.
All guests were provided with a glass of prosecco on arrival and the receptionists were thorough and attentive.

We found the hotel bars a little odd. The radio bar being rather bright, cold and uninviting and the downstairs bar was very noisy with some people coming from outdoors simply to use the toilet facilities and quite cold with the outdoor draft coming in. In the end, we decided to relax in our bedroom which was as comfortable as expected for a 5 star hotel.

We were surprised to find that the showers unexpectedly turned off at times, possibly when there were too many other users. Luckily, neither of us had been mid-shower at either time.

There was a good selection at breakfast, with the staff willing to cater for many dietary options.
Overall, I'd recommend this hotel, though hopefully the showers will be sorted out in the near future!",5,2016,02,21
148,Weekend escape,The best hotel I've ever stayed in and want to go back asap! It is such a gorgeous hotel. The lady at reception gave us a glass of prosecco when we arrived. The room was out of this world. The ambiance amazing. The bed was soooo comfortable and really big! We even went on the roof terrace and took in London with a cocktail. Yes it's expensive but believe me it's worth every penny! We will be back. Thank you for making our first weekend away as a couple extra special :D ,5,2016,02,21
148,Fantastic hotel,"I'm one of those very lucky people who gets to stay in some of the world's finest hotels when I am traveling for work - which means I'm completely spoiled, I admit. 

However, I've got to say - Me London did not disappoint. In fact, this was probably the best London hotel I've stayed in. For me, the problem with many of the ""high end"" hotels in London is that they all seem very old fashioned, with lots of chintz and patterned carpets and four-poster beds and heavy furniture and artwork and ugh, that horrible word, ""character"". 

Me London was a whole different animal.  From the warm welcome from Balazs and the rest of the reception/check-out team, to the amazingly quiet and comfortable rooms, fantastic shower, cool lighting and exceptionally friendly and efficient service provided by everyone we dealt with - wow - I really can't recommend this place highly enough. 

We stayed in an ""Aura"" room on the 6th floor and it was like a little slice of heaven. If you're someone that's looking for olde English charm in your own little Buckingham Palace, well, this probably isn't for you. But if you like clean lines and ultra modern decor and comfort, then you won't find anywhere better. My only regret was not staying longer - but I will definitely be back.",5,2016,02,21
148,Trendy hotel,"An excellent staff rooms and food great. The radio bar has great views but gets crowded and service can be slow . Beware most tables get booked but I have always got a seat,. Will stay again as device is great",5,2016,02,21
148,Horrible street noise,"Though I know the hotel was located on the strand, it got such high reviews and no one mentioned anything about noise so I assume everything was fine. Unfortunately, it wasn't true and though the sound proofing is good, you cannot completely block out the rumbles of the bus or honking. It appears all rooms face the street so there is no getting around it (and I had a high floor). So I will not be going back as in this price bracket, I want a quiet night. I will like to point out the service was impeccable and the breakfast was delicious. The design of the hotel is unique (and like others commented dark). Even without the street noise, there wasn't enough extra touches in the hotel that Based on my experience warrant a 5 star rating (but then again it is London). The location for covenant garden and west end cannot be beat. ",3,2016,02,20
148,MUCH BETTER,"My last review was titled must do better. & I had feed back from it. Kindly I was invited back at a reduced price. I have to report that with a management change the place is back to where it should be. 5 Star. The staff are fantastic, Kenya on reception so warm & friendly such an important thing when you arrive. The helpfulness of Antonio who pointed us in all the right directions these are the people that make a stay worthwhile. The issues I had with the lack of maintenance of the rooms has all been addressed. It just goes to show how important good management can be. It does lose out on the the franchised breakfast @ the Cucina. Better than it was but they still seem only to have about 6 teapots & still run out of white toast at 9.00 am. Perhaps that could do with a new manager also ? This is a fantastic building in a great location. Wonderful for theatre land, shopping & sightseeing. Rooms are spacious & light with great bathrooms & Beds. Nice  fresh crisp bedding This is one of my favourite hotels in The West End.",5,2016,02,19
148,Beautiful hotel but not very nice welcome.,"This hotel is beautifully designed and the reception area is gorgeous. The rooms are nice, although a little bit small, and the food was great. The hotel restaurant we went to was very lively (not too lively), and we had a great time celebrating my friends 18th. However before my mum, my friend and I arrived, my mum's friends who were also going to be there too, got there first and wanted to check in. However the man at reception would not let them check in and said that they had to pay, when my mum had told the hotel that her friends were coming. The man at reception was very rude and not welcoming. However the concierge, a very nice man, let them in as he could see that one of my mum's friends didn't look very well. When my mum complained we got an upgrade on our room. The staff were very quick and friendly dealing with the error but it slightly ruined the experience as my mum's friends entered the hotel with excitement and got to the room feeling tense and worked up. Saying that, the rooms were very nice and we got a nice view of the strand. My mum and I came again in January and the room was free as the hotel still wanted to compensate us for the mistake. I feel the hotel dealt with the whole mistake very well and were very apologetic. This is a modern, luxurious hotel with great food and nice rooms, it was just a shame that the welcome was not very nice. I would still recommend this hotel to everyone, as this mistake is unlikely to happen to anyone else.",4,2016,02,19
148,Excellent venue for recent media launch experience,"We recently used the ME London as a base for over 130 european media guests as part of a brand launch event, and every last detail was perfectly taken care of. The hotel staff bent over backwards to make the event as smooth as possible, which resulted in some very happy media and a very happy client too. The buffet lunch we had at the STK restaurant was delicious, and the rooms of the hotel were all exquisite. 
We would definitely recommend this hotel to clients again in future.",4,2016,02,18
148,Girly Valentines Weekend!,Amazing hotel! Fantastic food in the Cucina Asellina! The hotel staff were fantastic. I had an incident where my passport and purse were stolen and the security staff were brilliant getting it resolved. Would highly recommend staying here. Regardless of what happened they made my stay very enjoyable. ,5,2016,02,18
148,Amazing stay!!,"We went to the hotel for valentines weekend, it was amazing we got treated like royalty!! The room was lovely, clean, the staff were lovely and helpful and the food was lovely!! Would defiantly go back",5,2016,02,17
148,Modern and trendy with a touch of class,"I have had a few nights in the ME rooftop bar and so decided to book a room and have a night on the town with my wife.

Located next to Covent Garden and a five minute walk from Charring Cross station the hotel is right in the heart of London.

Walking in, you take the elevator up to the 1st floor where the reception is. This is an experience on its own! As you walk into the lobby you find yourself inside a pyramid room, gazing up at the glass roof above. The lobby is huge and also sports graphics moving across the wall gracefully. A very chilled and calming experience. 

Once checked in we were given a glass of bubbles and shown to our room. We booked one of the Vibe suites with a balcony on the 8th floor. Upon entering the room you are drawn to the clean, modern and bright look of the room. 

The bathroom was great with two separate rainfall showers next to each other and a nice large his and hers sink. Very spacious for a London hotel. 

The bedroom itself was smart with a nice large bed and flat screen TV. To the left of the bed was a small screen where you could control all the lighting for the room. Offering a wide range of colours to suit your mood. (I was feeling a in a light blue mood).

Balcony offered a great view of London.

After our night out we had a nightcap at the bar on the ground floor. Nice bar and friendly barman. Be aware drinks at this hotel are not cheap. We had two each which came to about ¬£50. 

Once we were back in the room we were feeling a little peckish so decided to order room service. As we had been drinking we were after the less healthy option so went for a burger! Nice burger but at ¬£25 a go, or ¬£50 for two its not cheap by any stretch.

Over all our stay was great. Good service, clean room and a great view of London from our balcony. 

Its a fun and trendy hotel for the fun loving couple!

Would I stay there again? Yes I would.

Room 9/10
Staff 9/10
Cleanliness 9/10
Atmosphere 10/10",4,2016,02,17

Central to the West End so easy to move around to different attractions...although really did not want to leave the hotel after entering. Design of the hotel is amazing, would definately return for another stay!",5,2016,02,17
148,Spoilt rotten,"Overall experience was luxurious, staff were great when leaving offering to hold our bags without prompting, would definitely stay again although as a special occasion as quite pricey but you paid for what you got. ",5,2016,02,16
148,Fantastic!,"Great experience, style & comfort, something special. From the check-in to check-out we felt as though we were looked after by the staff on our second visit to this beautiful modern and stylish hotel, quality in every area. ",5,2016,02,16
148,Fantastic luxury stay,Celebrating my 30th in the city and what better hotel to stay at than the ME London - so close to all shopping / Covent Garden and an easy journey home. A lovely luxurious hotel with everything at your fingertips. ,5,2016,02,16
148,Amazing Valentines Stay at ME London,"From arriving in reception to a glass of Prosecco when checking in, to having the taxi door held open by a member of the hotel staff as we left, the stay at ME London was perfect.

The hotel room was amazing, with chocolate hearts left on the pillow after we came back from a great night of cocktails and Music in the Radio Rooftop Bar. The bed was huge and provided a very comfortable nights sleep an then the hotel breakfast in Cucina Asellina was exactly what was needed to round off a perfect trip.

Would definitely recommend to all of my friends and family!!!!!",5,2016,02,15
148,A stunning hotel with staff that go above and beyond,"We used Me London for a large corporate event. We had numerous VIPs to impress and the hotel did just that: the hotel provided great buffet in STK restaurant with delicious food in spite of our large numbers; the rooms are impressive-cool, spotlessly clean and somehow homely even though the rooms are mostly white! The selection of in room dining and gift purchase options all contributed to a feeling of super-luxury and feeling very well taken care of.
As a business event venue the property worked very well-a great location on the Strand, close to Covent Garden and Charing Cross. The fact that wifi is free and fast meant doing business there was made easy. Most of all the staff were excellent-nothing was too much trouble for the sales and customer service team who catered for our every whim. 
Highly recommended.",5,2016,02,15
148,Absolutely Fabulous!,"Just wanted to thank you for such a wonderful stay! The service has been amazing, right from my initial reservation to check out. The staff are so welcoming and couldn't do enough for us, from arranging a happy birthday message on the mirrors, booking tables in the bar, to fetching a mobile phone that we left in the car and finding us in the roof top bar to hand deliver to us. The rooms are immaculate and so clean, also with a turn down service and chocolates on the pillow. I was surprised how big the room was considering we stayed in the ""aura"" rooms, the mood lighting and the music is a great touch!  The reception area is ultra modern with a very calming feel. We will 100% be returning and would also like to try other ME hotels. Special thank you to Ilaria, for all your help in making this stay special!",5,2016,02,13
148,1 Night weekend in London,"Modern, trendy hotel with sleek black walls and shiny surfaces from floor to ceiling. Glamorous and exciting while you search for your room.

148,Our Time at ME,"We recently worked with the team at ME London to host our 3 day event there.
The hotel and facilities are stunning, but more importantly Franzi and her team were exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble.
I would recommend hosting an event here to everyone.",5,2016,02,11
148,Thank you Paisana!!,"We were in a Eurotrip celebrating our honeymoon and without a doubt our best welcome was London! We stayed at ME and met our Paisana Kenya who gave us a tour around the Hotel and took us to Radio, all the staff was very friendly and smiley, can't wait to come back to our new favorite hotel in Europe!",5,2016,02,09
148,Good hotel and well located but a bit impersonal,The hotel is very well located. Covent Garden is just a few minutes walk away...the hotel is quite modern in its decor. The reception is on the first floor as compared to the ground floor. Check in was quick and we were shown our room. We were in the chic suite and the highlight was the bathroom. The tub was excellent and the shower was marvellous. We did not like the bed so much and found the A/C a bit temperamental. If you like traditional hotels then this is not for you but if you prefer modern a bit impersonal hotel then you will like the ME.,4,2016,02,08
148,Birthday surprise,"I took my Girlfriend to stay at ME London as part of a surprise for her Birthday and i'm thrilled to say we we're not disappointed, from pulling up in the car outside the hotel to checking out the hotel staff we're extremely polite, professional, welcoming and very accommodating.

Beds are very comfortable. Bathrooms and nice with great showers.  All you need for a great night stay.",5,2016,02,08
148,Extremely disappointing,"Attended for New Year's Eve. Having specifically been asked for feedback post event, I sent the following email - I have never received a reply.

Unfortunately we were rather disappointed with our experience on New Year's Eve. This was my first NYE with my Canadian boyfriend and we wanted to do something a bit special so we had booked to stay in the hotel even though I live in London, and had also requested an indoor table for the event - these tickets we were told were ¬£350 pp as we were staying at the hotel. We were therefore a bit surprised to discover that the couple sitting next to us had paid ¬£225 pp for the same deal. We felt that the seating was too cramped, i.e. it felt like there were as many people squeezed into the venue as possible and it seemed unclear to me that most of the tables were reserved as most people seemed to be sitting anywhere they liked. This was obviously a little disappointing given a ticket without a table was ¬£100 pp cheaper and we had splashed out specifically for a private indoor table.

This in itself was not however the main problem.

We were very much looking forward to the catering for the event as the canap√©s and drinks sounded lovely. The drinks service was fine however the food service and quantity was ridiculous. We had understood there to be three separate selections - one on arrival, another after 10 or 10:30pm I think and one at the end of the night. The menu suggested a large variety. We tried 3 possibly 4 canap√©s at most the entire evening and of those, we mostly received one of each, I think there was one of which we received two each. Initially we were quite patient as we figured the servers would come round to us eventually, but after a while we specifically went up to the bar - 3 times I think - to ask for food to be brought to our area and not once did it arrive. We literally ate no more than 10 canap√©s between the two of us of 3/4 different kinds despite repeatedly asking for food. I don't know if the problem was that the servers kept running out before they got to us but whoever was managing should have instructed them to circulate better - or whether there simply wasn't enough food prepared.

When we returned to our room, we ordered some room service as we were starving which came to just under ¬£60 which I refused to pay for on check out. I don't think this really compensates for the events of the evening.

It is a real shame that this occurred. I have never been to your venue before but ha",2,2016,02,07
148,Excellent,"We checked in our room was ready and prosecco offered upon check in. 
Really lovely room, very modern and comfy bed. 
Would definitely stay here again great location. Went to radio bar, great service and amazing views.

148,Seond Stay & Still Very Impressed,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and this time took my sister for her birthday.  She was very impressed with the reception area and enjoyed the light show with a glass of bubbly whilst I checked in!  We both visited the Radio Bar and enjoyed some lovely cocktails whist the city skyline started to light up around us.  The staff are extremely welcoming, friendly and efficient; in particular Simona and their new Manager Giovanni who we saw a few times during our stay and who went out of his way to make sure we were having a good time, even giving us a little peak at their secret recipe for the most AMAZING Bloody Mary's we have ever tasted and have quickly become addicted to.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2016,02,05
148,Maintenance guys impolite and unskilled,The hotel itself is beautiful and the overall experience was not bad at all. However the maintenance guys were not skilled enough to know how to connect the media hub up to the TV / ceiling speakers. we had three different guys attend our room through the night and none showed any knowledge of the system and the last guy we hqad was extremely rude and impolite to us. We then had to be moved rooms as thety could not fix the media hub. I appreciate that they moved our room to one where the media hub worked and they also gave us a complimentary drink each so I do not blame the hotek itself. Just the maintenance guys that made us feel unwelcome. ,4,2016,02,04
148,"Beautiful hotel, great location","Just back from a wonderful two night stay at the ME hotel in London. It is in a great location just off Covent Garden and within walking distance to Oxford Street. This hotel is lovely for a special treat but it is pricey. 

Check in is lovely with prosecco offered. The rooms are a nice size with lovely bathroom and very comfy beds. Rooms are very clean and modern. 

The rooftop bar can be a bit crazy at the weekends and drinks are very expensive with a service charge of 15% added to your bill if you order from a waitress (and the service was disappointing) but it is something to be experienced. 

Breakfast is really lovely and the tapas food in this restaurant at night is beautiful. 

If you're looking for a treat this is the hotel. 

Would definitely recommend. ",5,2016,02,04
148,in love with ME,"I am a loyal and regular guest of this awesome hotel. Apart from all the stuff you would expect from a five star hotel designed by Sir Norman Foster located in the heart of the coolest city on the planet, you also get the passion from the Spanish (Melia) ownership. Radio Bar has the best views in London from a public bar (but can get a bit noisy at night / if you are getting old like me and no longer want your bars to pulse like the back room at Ministry of Sound). But other than that, this place is world class, effortlessly cool and high end.

If you are a frequent business traveller and the journey is as important as the destination / then book here. ",5,2016,02,03
148,Modern,The Super reception is a very modern white marble pyramid with a very funky light show is quite worth the time spent in reception with the complimentary proseco!  By contrast the floor levels have black marble foyers.  ,4,2016,02,03
148,Highly recomend,"Everything at the London ME hotel did not disappoint, the staff and service we received was excellent, the Radio Bar was a wonderful experience with a great vibe, the room was very comfortable and very modern, albeit on the small size, we booked a room with balcony which offered lovely views, only complaint a leaking sink which wasn't fixed, but only a small problem in what was a wonderful and enjoyable stay.",5,2016,02,02
148,Pete,"Nice hotel, would stay again. Great location for west end, catch a show, bit of shopping. Short walk from Waterloo (over bridge) and tube. Rooms great, clean comfortable, and sound proof which fantastic bonus in central London......Staff also fantastic.",5,2016,02,02
148,Coolest Hotel!,"We stayed in the Me Hotel on Saturday 23rd of January and the entire experience was fantastic.

We chose to drive into London and let the hotel valet park the car. Which worked out around about the same as two train tickets and two taxis. From the doorman to the bar staff everyone we met at the hotel was spot on. We we allowed to check in early at 12 o'clock as our room was free. We dumped our bags and headed out to do some shopping. Only 10 minutes after leaving the hotel Emiliano Del Pizzo, the duty manager, called me to ask if we could stop by reception for a chat when we returned. Which we did. It was good news. Newcastle football team were staying on our floor and might possibly be a bit raucous through the night. 

Emiliano asked us an obvious question 'would we like a free upgrade to another floor into a suite'. 5 minutes later we were unpacking into a suite twice the size of our original room. With a free bottle of champagne for the inconvenience (of which there was none).

The room(s) were as beautiful and trendy as the rest of the hotel! Smart, clean and modern, but with an intimate aura.

We had dinner in STK on the ground floor of the hotel which is a perfect mix of trendy patrons and friendly staff. The staff at STK mirror those of the hotel. Polite and helpful. Going the extra mile, but not being intrusive. 

We followed dinner with drinks in the Radio bar on the top floor of the hotel. Possibly the coolest roof-top bar in London. Emiliano popped in after he had finished work to say good night and to introduce his wife who had joined him for a night cap.

The next day we checked out and went for a bite to eat, returned for our car and generally agreed it had been the best day/night out we'd had in London ever!

We will be returning to the hotel as soon as we can find an excuse to indulge ourselves again!",5,2016,02,01
148,Amazing hotel just the best experience,"Just returned from a night away at this hotel , there really was nothing to fault with this hotel. From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble , we were provided with a glass of bubbles as we checked in and they even turned the light show on for us so I could see the infamous "" jellyfish "" show. Our room was large and we were upgrade to a suite with a deep bath to die for. We had drinks at the bar in Cucina Asellina which had a great buzz. Breakfast was served here and was a real treat with gorgeous fresh items on a buffet or hot items to order fresh , service was excellent. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. Simply stunning , nothing to fault at all which in London is unusual.",5,2016,02,01

148,Great location amd stay for business travellers,"Very clean, modern, well equipped and convenient. Lovely, helpful staff. Very comfortable and well-located. The only downside was its proximity to a huge building site across the street but as I was off to work, not an issue for me as only noisy during working hours.",5,2016,01,31
148,Amazing hotel,"Only stayed here for one night end of Jan what a stunning hotel, best we've stayed in in London. Staff are excellent can't do enough to help. Room was lovely very big we opted for a mode room, huge bathtub. Only problem I could find is there are no mirrors in the main bedroom so getting ready was a hassle as had to sit by the door to use a mirror! Something they should look at really!! Apart from that location rooms staff are fab will definitely be returning!
",5,2016,01,31
148,Will certainly be back,"The contemporary interiors is amazing, great location super close to Covent Garden, Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square.  Staffs are very friendly and helpful.  Also the room size is surprisingly reasonable.  Will definitely come back next time.",4,2016,01,29
148,Thank you Kenya :),"We met Kenya once visiting the Radio Bar and since then she's been our main contact of ME London. She is just extremely helpful and goes beyond our expectations every time we have made a booking either at the hotel or at one of the restaurants. She has really made it a wonderful experience for us every time!

We came back to ME to try first time Cucina Asellina, the new menu is amazing and we were spoilt by Roberta and Daniel, our charming Spanish waiter!

A wonderful experience every time - Thank you Kenya for taking such good care of us!",5,2016,01,28
148,It‚Äôs so ME,"Simply great! From its location, to the cool modern interiors, to the variety of restaurants and the rooftop bar with an unbeatable view over London‚Äôs major sites, everything is perfect in this hotel.

Strongly recommended to anyone that is looking for a place to conveniently experience London.",5,2016,01,28

148,Excellent staff & Fabulous Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel 22-24 January 2016. From arrival at reception were I was handed a glass of Prosecco until we left each one of the staff were helpful and very friendly. This is a very stylish hotel, but not pretentious, which is refreshing. 
We visited the Radio rooftop bar which was fantastic and I can highly recommend the Pink One gin! We also ate in the restaurant with the Italian tapas style which was lovely.
The rooms are very luxurious and modern with smart system lights and aircon.
We will absolutely be back!",5,2016,01,25
148,"Great location, lovely hotel. ","This is a fabulous location for exploring London.

The hotel is modern, impeccably spotless and the staff are fantastic.. Very helpful/attentive and knowledgeable.

Our rooms were on the third floor, they were a good size and had good facilities inside.. Also worth noting it's really quiet within the hotel which equals easy sleep!

We visited the radio bar, reserved a table. I would recommend doing this for after 10.. The view is great.

Our only negative points were.. Saturday morning we had house keeping knock on the door between 8 & 9 when we had hoped for a lye in! Then on Sunday a suited man knocked on the door and woke us up at 7.45am to say he needed to check the room (to check mini bar use I assume).. I told him we were in bed and asked what time check out was: he advised 10.30 which we then checked and it was actually 12.30. 
Needless to say we couldn't go back to sleep following these visits!

I would stay here again happily, a lovely hotel at a good price.

148,Weekend away,"Stayed for one night in a corner suite, views were ok from room and absolutely zero street noise. Staff were very pleasant and the young lad at check in the was brilliant. Location is the best part about this hotel as great for theatres, landmarks and shopping all within walking distance. Some nice perks were thrown in too with a free cocktail at the STK Bar and room service charges waived as they exceeded the normal wait time, they also called to apologise as opposed to waiting for us to call and complain. Only little area which let this hotel down was a tear in the room wallpaper which was a bit of an eyesore and should have been replaced. ",5,2016,01,24
148,"Excellent hotel, exceeded expectations.","What an amazing hotel, great location and staff were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble. Very spoilt from beginning to end.  Will definitely return, couldn't ask for any better. Felt like celebrities ",5,2016,01,23
148,"outstanding night ""in town""","decided to treat my wife to a night in London for her birthday and chose this hotel based on previous reviews and recommendation.

I am delighted we did as it is outstanding

the reception area has to be seen to be believed....awesome is the only way to describe the experience.....i will not spoil it, you have to try it !!!

the staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble and they were extremely polite and helpful......proscecco on arrival (complimentary) 

Our room was amazing and was just one of the ""basic"" rooms, if you can really call it basic !!!

you can EVEN change the background light/mood lighting colours....how cool is that

Fantastic shower and bed and great view.......and very trendy window shades

it is actually ALL VERY TRENDY !!!

Only tiny little constructive comment was the lack of a kettle and proper tea bags !!!!....there is an excellent nepresso machine which makes great coffee but NOT excellent tea !!!

We mentioned this to the fabulous receptionist as we left and he said he would try and sort....and they should, as with a kettle, tea bags (and proper milk) it would have been the best hotel we have stayed at !!!

definitely worth going to and thanks for a great time

OH...by the way, I mentioned that the stay was for my wife's birthday and they put roses and free bubbly in the room, which was a lovely and VERY kind surprise",5,2016,01,22
148,stay with friends,"Very friendly service. Immediate and efficient response to a problem. Beautiful design, really worth the trip. The location is excellent in the middle of all the theaters. The bar has a beautiful view over london.",5,2016,01,21
148,Chic Hotel,"The hotel is very trendy and well located sitting along the Strand and near Covent Garden and various theatres for the popular musicals.

The service is excellent. Everyone is attentive and generally very helpful and more importantly efficient, as in you do not have to wait long before what you need help with is done.

Don't know about the other rooms but the suites are very nice and come with modern equipment from touch pad light switches to entertainment systems that your device can connect to wirelessly. I always find the ""switch off all"" switch very convenient.

The walls of the rooms are thick and then doors are heavy, so the rooms are well insulted from noise.

Wifi is available without password and you don't get lock out just because you have checked out early like what some hotels do.

The suites are pretty good size by London standard, but when you are used to bigger rooms, these still feel a little small.

Not something I would prefer if I were a family with young children, but something which young and trendy guests would appreciate.

148,Great Hotel,"We upgraded to the VIBE room on the 7th floor. Room size was good and all the tech inside (Music, TV, LED lighting, etc...) was great. There are some good views from the upper floors. It is just around the corner from Covent Garden and most Theatre Shows. The staff was friendly and very helpful.  ",5,2016,01,20

148,Fantastic hotel!,"ME is absolutely beautiful. I'm writing this review a little bit late. I stayed here for a little over a week at the end of March 2015 into April. I was traveling from overseas and arrived at the hotel quite a bit earlier than check-in time. My room wasn't ready yet and I waited in the lobby for a little bit of time. After an employee noticed I had been there a while they sent me up to the rooftop bar, which was breathtaking, incredible views. I ordered a few drinks and as I went to pay I had been told that they had been taken of already by the hotel. I was amazed! The room itself was beautiful. The bed was extremely comfy. There was a hand written note and a little snack left upon entering my room, great touch. The mood lighting was very fun. I enjoyed the mini bar and had ordered dinner from room service one night, I had the fish and chips, can't remember what my partner ordered, but both were delicious. Unfortunately during my stay the holborn fire accrued, we were without power for about 3-4 days, can't quite remember. We weren't really given a lot of information as to what was going on, the hotel seemed to empty out as a result of lack of electricity. Tealight candles were left in our room everyday, along with chocolates, and since we were really at the hotel just to sleep and shower in the morning, we didn't see not having power as a problem, we would charge our phones at the Starbucks down the road before returning at night. I think the power returned the day before we checked out and everything returned to normal. Upon checkout I was told that I would be compensated for the days without power, which I thought was very nice. Overall, this hotel is great; location, service, design, everything. Bathrooms were very different to what I've experienced at hotels before, but didn't have a problem with it! Loved that you could control how much privacy you had. Showers were very spacious, as was the room, loved the large window. Think going for a balcony room next time would be very nice! I would have loved to have been able to experience my full stay at ME with full amenities the whole time, really wanted to experience dinner at STK, but I understood that some things were beyond their control, they couldn't prevent a fire from happening! Although there was a slight hiccup during our stay, not having wifi during the power outage did make it hard to keep in touch with family as I was traveling from the US, I sincerely enjoyed. This is a great hotel. Keep up the good work! I'm returning to London in March and would love to stay here again, but I'm on a budget and sadly can't afford it again. Such a shame! I fell in love with this place! Stay here if you can! You won't regret it!",5,2016,01,16
148,30th Birthday Treat in a stunning setting,"Just returned from a truly memorable stay in London's ME Melia hotel.

The stay was booked through the website after I called the hotel and spoke to Marco. One of the many very helpful and sincere team making this such a great place. I asked for a recommendation on which room to book for our stay. He couldn't have been more happy to talk and help ensuring me that the Birthday surprise I had planned would be truly special.

I was then in touch via email and Balazs was also only to happy to help and make our stay first class helping with finishing touches to make our stay even more amazing. The hotel is stunning, staff are happy and can't help enough. The bars, restaurants and views are brilliant. This is truly what a hotel should be. Great location ideal for the show we went to see.

My girlfriend commented many times that she couldn't have asked for a better break for her Birthday and I know that a big part of that was due to your beautiful hotel and service making the stay special and memorable.

Thank you sincerely! Can't wait to come again :)

148,Break away for weekend ,"Fantastic greeting . Staff very welcoming . Lovely glass of prosecco as we booked in. Was upgraded to a balcony room and had a great view across London rooftops Rooms just incredible. Italian restaurant lovely choice of food and a clever "" tapas"" style menu.
Ventured to the roof top bar and as long as you can get a table you will be treated very well",5,2016,01,16
148,A special location.,On a sunny day the Radio roof top bar is the place to  be.Amazing views lovely airy feeling.We had lunch which provided a very interesting selection of tapas. 2 dishes each was enough which we shared.Wine prices sensible but they did not have our first choice in stock. We visited in early January so it was not to busy.Check cover prices for visits after 4pm it can be very expensive. Staff very helpful.,4,2016,01,15
148,Best In London!,"Where do I start, the hotel is great and the service is outstanding.

I booked for myself and my partners Birthday. I emailed the reservation team and asked them to make me a reservation at STK and Radio Bar for our stay, I also mentioned it was my partner‚Äôs birthday and anything to make it special would be great.

I got an email back quickly confirming my reservations had been made and that they would add some touches to the room and also add a birthday message on the bathroom mirror and that I could add bits if I wanted.

Every single member of staff gave top notch service from the moment we arrived to the time we left.

Check in was simple and painless which is always nice, I never understand why some hotels make it such a long process. We was given a glass of Prosecco which is always nice after travelling, we was also give a free drink voucher each to use with our reservations at STK & Radio because it was my partners birthday which was a lovely gesture.

The whole hotel is trendy and cool, the decor is really nice and makes you feel like you are in a 5 star hotel. The room was really nice, the panel next to the bed was explained for the mood lighting and media centre. The bed was huge, I think it was the size of 2 doubles together. Rose petals, water and chocolates waited for us in the room which was lovely and the mini-bar is the best I have ever seen, it has everything you could ever want.

We had dinner in STK which was very good indeed. We had to eat early as we was going to the theatre after so it‚Äôs a shame we didn‚Äôt get to experience the slightly party atmosphere but the food and wine was very good.

We also had drinks and tapas at the Radio Rooftop bar, the weather was a little bad so we started on a table outside but had to move indoor due to the rain and wind. The waitress are very good and look after you really well, it was a Tuesday night so not massively busy, good level of music and the food and cocktails are very nice.

We decided to have breakfast in bed the following morning, room service was very fast and very well laid out and for the price of ¬£22.50 for a full English it also includes toast, pasties and juice along with a choice of hot drink, this was a lot of food and good value for money.

Overall the hotel was amazing and my partner really enjoyed her birthday, I think this has become my regular hotel for whenever I am in London now.

A big thankyou to all of the staff that made my stay special.",5,2016,01,15
148,Contemporary Style,A fabulous hotel right in the centre of London with all the facilities and sophistication that you would expect of a 5* hotel and oozing with style. The rooftop Radio Bar is a must for its great 360 degree views. All public rooms are spacious and dazzling. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade and the suite was enormous and beautifully furnished. All the staff were friendly and efficient. We will definitely return.,5,2016,01,15
148,Service Service Service,"It's rare that one has only positive words for a hotel or restaurant, well this is one such occasion!

148,Stunning hotel,"Booked ME for my daughters 21st birthday for a one night stay.  I contacted them via email re any birthday treats, Balazs Pavlik responded that he would arrange for happy birthday etc to be written on the mirror and leave comp truffles, it was a lovely surprise for her. Staff were very professional, friendly and helpful.  Pedro was lovely a real asset to ME.  The hotel was absolutely stunning, if you like modern, contemporary then you will love ME, our room was beautiful, we didn't want to leave. we dined at STK which is located within the hotel and had a lovely breakfast in the morning. The location is excellent, close to the theatres and a stones throw from covent garden.    We will be back...",5,2016,01,13
148,Luxury in London,"Fantastic location, excellent luxury hotel with plenty of reward benefits once you earn loyalty points. Radio roof top bar is a must for fancy cocktails and fab London skyline views! Excellent amenities in the rooms too, and super comfy huge beds.",5,2016,01,13
148,"Fantastic contemporary hotel, some attention to detail lacking","The hotel public spaces are breathtaking, rooms are modern and bright, nice features and technology. However the toilet in our room was dirty and the glass door to the cubicle had wet marks on it indicating a lack of attention - although the cleaning was otherwise to a high standard. The WiFi was very poor although there is a mysterious very high speed open connection accessible, probably a neighbouring property. The large king size bed was two beds pushed together which isn't necessarily what one might expect in a higher grade room at a five star hotel. It wasn't particularly comfortable either, but that's a matter of opinion. Check out the laser video show in the very impressive lobby after 5pm!",4,2016,01,13
148,"Simply Perfect , Looking at hotels by the Melia group abroad now :)","This hotel is Amazing , and the staff in the hotel exceeded my expectations!
 
I was assisted in arranging personal touches prior to our stay by the staff at the hotel via email and they couldn't do more to help me. Nothing was to much trouble for them even though I felt guilty for emailing them on a daily basis. 

All I can say is it all paid off ! 

I love London but this hotel offers it all and on a rainy cold January day this hotel was perfect (although I don't doubt its perfect all year round) . In room massages , a great cocktail bar (Marconi) and out of this world restaurant (STK) and a outstanding roof top bar (Radio) to finish a wonderful night off. 

I will stay again at this hotel but definitely for a longer duration next time and I'm just booking a stay at the 'Gran Melia' in Rome.  

Thanks again to everyone who made this Birthday treat for my other half even more special.

148,Stay here if you are in London!,"Stayed here after a long days filming in the hotel. Staff were extremely helpful and attentive, beds super comfy, lighting all from a central touch pad and easy to set to whatever mood your feeling. Good variety of restaurants on site and the piece de resistance has to be the Radio Rooftop Bar - really cool venue with amazing views of London....surprisingly warm for Jan too with their outdoor heaters.
Would recommend and would stay here again when in town.",5,2016,01,13
148,Great Hotel,"I stayed here in Jan for three nights with my girlfriend for her birthday. Staff were very friendly and we got a glass of prosecco while we waited to check in (there were two other parties checking in). We mentioned we were here for my girlfriends birthday during check in and about a half hour later some chocolates and a card were sent up for her wishing her a happy birthday. 
The location was great, the hotel staff were super friendly and cheery. We had a great trip and the hotel being what it was definitely added to spoiling ourselves. ",5,2016,01,12
148,Our (not) NYE celebration!,"We celebrate NYE on the 30th and we're going to a restaurant nearby for dinner, so narrowed down our hotel choice. Our friend literally got to London on the day and negotiated our booking for us and we received an upgrade! 

I was really impressed with the reception / check in staff and the lobby it's self was impressive, even if I do hate jellyfish!

Our room was really spacious for a London hotel and the amenities were fantastic. The bed was really comfy. My only gripe was that they didn't have any tea pods for the nespresso machine and I don't drink coffee. 

We drank in the lobby bar before we went out, which was lovely.

We did go up to the Radio bar after we returned from dinner / drinks at about 1am, however that had a really weird vibe and seemed to have a few call girls working, which made for a topic of conversation however was a bit uncomfortable as there were people making out every way we turned! 

Despite the radio bar vibe, the hotel and service was fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay up in central London.",5,2016,01,12
148,Unbelievable!,"This hotel is simply amazing. We originally came to London to see Matilda at Cambridge Theatre (about half a miles walk away), and as a 5 year anniversary treat I brought her to ME London, especially after the reviews it's been given. Definitely wasn't disappointed. The ambiance when you first walk in, to the way you are welcomed by the staff. There are eleven floors in total (including the ground floor) and it is simply out of this world. It's a 5* hotel and me and my girlfriend were treated as 5* guests. We were welcomed wonderfully by a man on reception, before handing us our keys to our room (and two free drink vouchers as he congratulated us on our anniversary!). We stayed in the Urban Energy Terrace room (it's worth it!), the room was spacious, clean, well presented and generally superb. The bathroom had two sinks and a walk in shower, which also had a congratulatory message on the mirror for us.

We ate in the STK restaurant, and with it being a steak restaurant, ordered a steak! The sirloin is out of this world, and the service was top-notch, especially as we received blue cheese bread and truffle dip free of charge.

We also tried the rooftop bar, again, something I recommend you try. The shard is in plain sight next to the building, and you can also spot Big Ben in the distance. It does have more of a nightclub vibe though so if you don't like noise, the reception bar is nice enough.

Would 100% recommend to anyone, simply amazing.",5,2016,01,11
148,Mark,An excellent boutique hotel with impressive upgraded rooms. Radio bar well worth a visit for cocktails and views . STK good but prepare for disco atmosphere later in evening when the DJ could be intrusive if you wanted a quite or relaxing meal,5,2016,01,11
148,Amazing,"As soon as you walk into the building everything is beautiful, all staff are very friendly and it feels like your the only person staying here. Our room was amazing, you can set different lighting colours, there is music playlists on the television.
The massive bed turned out to be 2 large singles but that didn't really matter. 
STK was top class, great service and amazing food(I recommend the STK bold sauce) 
Also radio roof top bar has a great atmosphere and good selection of cocktails 
Overall ME hotel was a brilliant birthday surprise for me from my partner 
Also we saw Charlie and the chocolate factory at drury lane which is literally a stone throw away which is great",5,2016,01,09
148,Unforgatable,"The hotel offers everything you need to feel the most important person in the world!!!
Very modern and very pampered. You really like to stay in. The Radio Bar is fantastic and can enjoy a grest view.",5,2016,01,06
148,Not Worth the Hype,"I have stayed in ME London in August and September. The hotel facilities are in trendy Gothic style (which is cool) but the hotel service quality can be improved. There has always been some mistake to my bill either there would be wrong drinks charge or incorrect billing of laundry services. Definitely review the bills upon check-out.

The housekeeping staff are very friendly but the room is not always properly cleaned. I can often see white marks on the bathroom marble floors left by prior guests which is not pleasant to see. 

The level of service is just not up to the rate we pay. Even I travel for business (so I am not paying for it out of my own pocket), I ended up switching to another hotel in central London after these sub-optimal experiences.",3,2016,01,06

148,Amazing ,"Everything about this hotel was spot on. The room was exceptionally clean and kitted out with everything you could need. The staff were extremely accommodating, friendly and attentive. The dark lighting ad quirky features gave the hotel a relaxing feel. We couldn't hear any noise at all from inside the room. The bed was outrageously comfortable. The rooftop bar was lively with an amazing panoramic view of London. We would 110% stay again. ",5,2016,01,03
148,Post Christmas,"Really enjoyed the hotel. Excellent staff.  Although expensive its a touch of luxury for a treat. Room very clean of s hight standard. Rooftop bar is lovely although maybe more for younger people, that were spending more money than us. ",5,2016,01,02
148,Did not stay hotel but used the just park option to leave vehicle there when we went to the theatre.,When we arrived at the hotel they met us outside and parked our vehicle for us.  Helpful and a very smooth  visit.  Vehicle safe and did not need to walk far for convent garden and theatres.  Would definitely use again.,5,2016,01,01
148,Disappointed ,"Nice hotel, good location, but IT is all about    caring for details.
In the middle of the night our neighbours decided to have a party. We called the Reception three times. After two hours (!), they finally went to sleep. Our night was completely disturbed. So was our next day.
During check out reception did not refer to the situation, we had to mention IT. No compensation, no empathy, just a small I am sorry.
We left with a bad feeling. The hotel can be beautiful but this fades away after a bad experience. Hoe easy IT Should have been to offer a nice breakfast or a voucher. Take negative feelings away!!!",2,2016,01,01
148,Such a beautiful stay! ,I took my boyfriend there for 3 days and 2 nights and I am very impressed with everything we received! Customer service was amazing! Room was beautiful.

148,Awful stay ,"Second time round staying at Me hotel first time round lovely stay so thought we would  book again well were do I start ... 
Waiting for cases as you leave them at the front door on arrival there's no rush 
Taking a shower lights go out left standing in the dark constantly going off every 5 minutes running out to switch them back on .. 
Get out the shower to dry my hair none of the plugs sockets worked at all, rang reception they sent handy guy out for him to tell us the hotel has stored a energy saver system an that's why it is happening so for me to dry my hair charge my phone and keep the lights on we had to open the room door every 5minutes as there was a censor above the door which then made the electricity work again for 5 minutes an this was constant 
Morning ordered breakfast half 8 went out for the day arrive back at 6 pm breakfast trolley still there room stunk no one had been in to clean the room or make the bed 
I travel a lot an stay in many hotels and for a 5 * hotel I can honestly say this was the most disappointing and worst experience I have ever had 
Very disappointed ",2,2015,12,30
148,Disapointed,"I have stayed here before and loved the place hence not hesitating to book again.  This stay was completely different, we are not a picky couple by any means but the hotel seems to have forgotten the basics.  Firstly all the staff are friendly and curtious and the place is stunning.  The main gripe about our stay was the room, due to the energy saving system in the room our lighting and electrical facilities shut down every 10 mins due to the sensors not being activated?? Whilst taking a shower the lights went off? Whilst my wife was doing her hair, etc etc, So after investigation we were told we had to open and shut the door to activate the sensors?? Also there is no accessible plug in front of any mirrors for my wife to do her hair so we had to ask for a mirror? Also we were out all day and came back early evening to find our breakfast trolley still in the room with our room not having been made up? We are not 1 to complain but it seems the hotel amongst all its stunning interior has forgotten the basics and overall it made for a disapointing stay.",2,2015,12,30
148,Covent Garden Hot Spit,"Close to Covent Garden and west end theatres, this hotel offers a welcoming hello before you arrive and throughout your stay.  A hip vibe and nifty room design makes for a swinging stay.  Lots of good spots to eat and drink in the neighborhood. ",5,2015,12,30
148,Best hotel and experience ever,"Stayed at the ME London as a pre Christmas trip with my boyfriend as a treat. We had wanted to stay for a while after visiting the Radio Bar and the Marconi bar a few times and loving the style and atmosphere of the place. To be honest we were slightly worried that we had built the place up to be more than it was going to be but we needn't have been concerned because the whole experience was incredible!!!

We arrived in London early so we could go to brunch at the Ivy Chelsea Gardens, we dropped our luggage off at the hotel and left my number in case we could check in to our room earlier than the 3pm check in time. By 12.30 I had a message saying our room was ready for us which was great as I've had many hotels say previously that they would do this but never heard anything from them. 

The staff at check in were so friendly and a complimentary glass of prossecco was greatly appreciated. 

I had booked a Vibe Room but I'm pretty sure we were moved up to a Mode Room (going by the room descriptions online) we had a huge bath and a big walk in shower. The room was impeccable. I had arranged for champagne and flowers in the room and a couple of little bits which the Aura team did a fantastic job of setting up. 

We had a complimentary drink in the evening in the cucina asellina bar where we could pick any drink we wanted (my boyfriend had a beer and the bar staff even checked if he wanted something a bit more) and I had the best margarita cocktail I have had since I was in Mexico (I couldn't even find this on the menu but he had asked what cocktails I liked and said he would make me one. Great touch) 

We had a table booked at the radio bar later in the evening and it was as perfect as always! 

The bed was so comfortable and the mini bar had everything we could need in it.
Breakfast was buffet with any hot foods such as full English, eggs benedict cooked to order.

We really can't wait for an excuse to come back to ME London, the place is incredible but the staff are what really pushes this place to the next level in experience. Everyone we encountered was friendly, seemed to want to talk to us and couldn't be more helpful.

I would recommend staying here to everyone... And I have so far!!",5,2015,12,29
148,Christmas Treat,"Awesome hotel, great service, lovely decor and ambience. It's extremely funky and modern so don't stay if you want a more traditional London hotel experience! 

Breakfast in the Italian restaurant is delicious - great attentive service and a nice selection of options. The prosecco on check in was a really nice touch as well especially arriving after a long flight from Dubai. 

Fab location which is so close to everything and we loved spoiling our family and friends in the rooftop bar. Our new favourite in London we'll definitely be back! ",5,2015,12,26
148,AMAZING STAY! More than 5 start service!,My boyfriend and I had a great weekend stay in ME LONDON! The guest experience was top notch with lots of attention to detail provided by Nic from the Aura Team. The bottle of fizz and chocolate strawberries were a particularly nice touch. The restaurant and roof top bar are superb and the finish of the rooms are very high end. Thanks a lot for a fantastic weekend! xx,5,2015,12,25
148,Georgie T,What an absolutely stunning venue! The customer service was sedcond to none and the staff were so attentive and friendly. Radio Bar is now a firm favourite of mine whilst in London! Thanks ME hotel for such a wonderful night!,5,2015,12,23
148,The best customer service I have experienced,"This is a review from a stay back in June this year. 

After originally booking a date in April, we arrived at the Hotel during a power cut. My wife and I were celebrating a special occasion and we had babysitters arranged at great expense! The hotel staff were amazing at making our stay as enjoyable as possible considering the circumstances. They arranged for us to return in June to experience the hotel again with power! When we returned we were greeted with the same exceptional customer service and the all staff ensured we felt like VIP's. Our room was fantastic with great views and we enjoyed a fantastic lunch and drinks up at the Radio rooftop bar. I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in central London.",5,2015,12,22
148,Superb,"First time staying at the Me, won't be the last. My new favourite in London.
Check in was fast and efficient.
The hotel is very well appointed, great location on the Strand, easy walk to Covent Garden etc.

Rooms have everything you need and ours was a great size for Central London, lovely rain shower. Mood lighting etc a nice touch.

Radio bar on the 10th floor offers great views over the city and is well worth a late night visit for a cheeky cocktail or three.

We had booked and paid for the room and breakfast, only criticism would be re breakfast, on sitting down we were told slightly abruptly ""its either continental or one item from the menu"" - seems a bit harsh / tight. I would have preferred to have had a bowl of fruit and something else - that wasn't an option given.
Its not a cheap hotel, but even still if you feel the need to charge people twice for breakfast at least offer that option. Plus it may be worth while highlighting to customers on booking that it is a very limited breakfast choice included, having looked on your site there is only one breakfast option and I think its safe to assume that would be all encompassing within reason.",5,2015,12,21
148,Lovely Pre-Christmas treat at the ME.,"First time staying here last Saturday, after wanting to book here for quite a while. 
The customer service and staff welcome upon arrival was very nice, so was the arrival glass of prosecco. The hotel is beautiful, definitelty has the WOW factor!
We stayed on the fourth floor, a room directly overlooking the Strand. The room was lovely, lots of gadgets to play with, how to set the lighting, air con etc. I have never seen a room stocked so much with extras the mini bar was full of drinks, snacks and gifts (all at an extra price) toiletries in the room are gorgeous. 
All staff we met throughout our stay were very polite and attentive and any request was met quickly.
We decided to treat ourselves to breakfast in our room the following morning, this arrived as a feast, plenty to choose from and they cater for all dietary requirements. All I would say is this is not a cheap hotel, but please don't be put off by the price when looking it is definitely worth it. All expectations were exceeded and I for one can't wait to go back!!",5,2015,12,21
148,Perfect 30th Surprise Birthday party in Suite Me,"I organized my wife's 30th birthday party in Suite Me and it was faultless. An amazing experience that my wife will remember for a while!

With regards to the preparation, the Aura team was extremely helpful - special thanks to Catherine and Pedro. Holly from the event team also managed to make things possible with providing solutions to our special requests.

Execution was great, all went according to plan and the surprise effect worked out very well. The room was decorated with nice flowers and balloons; the sound system in the suite supported the party easily. Drinks, food and birthday cake were up to a good standard; very good service - thanks to our butlers.

We really appreciated the late check out - some extra time to sleep off the hangover and enjoy the view with our in room lunch. 

In summary, a great experience, requiring the adequate level of budget, but definitely worth it. I was extremely amazed by the dedication of Catherine, our Aura manager during our stay.",5,2015,12,21
148,Wife's birthday treat,"Great very modern hotel
Unique atmosphere with attentive & efficient staff
Location ideal for Covent Garden And Theatreland
Parking pricey but efficient
Staff very attentive
Would have liked to try the rooftop bar but not enough time",5,2015,12,17
148,Superb,Best hotel I've stayed in for a long time. Rooms are superb style and comfortable. Maxi bars offer everything you need and more. Showers are strong. Toiletries are yummy. Radio bar very buzzy. Stk great food,5,2015,12,15
148,"In a word - ""Superb""","I am blown away by the new level of service given at the ME London Hotel. I recently attended a Christmas event and could not fault the evening from start to finish. The staff were welcoming, friendly and attentive to every detail. The magnificent view at the top of the hotel at Radio bar is worth the visit alone - the best views of London by far. Can't wait to get back to sample STK!",5,2015,12,14
148,ME Xmas Party,"I was invited to the ME xmas party last Tuesday and I must say, it was an amazing vibe, food was delicious, never had a macaroni cheese that good! Oh and the STK burgers, fantastic!

The music and the band was perfect, they entertained more than 300 people constantly, good job. Also the bar, delicious cocktails and prompt service!

Well done once again guys, you are my favourite people!",5,2015,12,14
148,Wonderful oasis in the heart of London,"I've recently attended the Christmas Party at Me Hotel London and it was fantastic.
The staff is very welcoming and attentive, the atmosphere very sophisticated, but jolly. The food is delicious and I will certainly recommend it. 
Honestly, my second home in London!",5,2015,12,14
148,Breathtaking!,"First I was blown away by the video mapping in the reception area/ atrium that also serves as a champagne bar! Our welcome was really warm, and were accompanied to the passion suite where we were spending the night. 

The suite itself was amazing and its name describes it well. We were welcomed with a champagne bottle in the room as I notified the hotel that it was for a special occasion. 

What is also amazing about this hotel is the radio bar! best views in London!

If you like to be in a trendy, modern and well located hotel, this one is for you.",5,2015,12,14
148,Love this hotel ,"
I thought the ME was amazing. Very welcoming staff and very helpful. We had a welcome drink on arrival what was lovely. 

Massive beds and the best mini bar! You have sweets to cheese twists to even a sober up drink...... What I did need that night. 

Me and my friend had room service in the evening and had the club sandwich...probably one of the best I have ever had!
We also had breakfast in bed the next morning also as good as the club sandwich. 

We asked for a later check out because our train was delayed they were happy to do this for us. 

We also went up to the radio bar. This is the only little negative I have. When we went to go up to the bar we were first told we couldn't. Then we said even if we are staying in the hotel? In witch a member of staff was a bit unsure and still hesitant about letting us up until another member of staff came over and said let them in.
It just wasn't as welcoming as it had been when we checked in. 

Other than that we had the best time would highly recommend this hotel and stay again. It really does ticks all the boxes. It's also in a prime location. 

Thank you. 

",5,2015,12,13
148,It's more nightclub than hotel,"I didn't like this hotel. In my room I want comfort and a feel like home, not a Vegas club. The angled walls and dimly lit halls were creepy. The bed was comfortable. The room lighting was over engineered and confusing. The chairs were very uncomfortable, with no cushioned chairs or couches. The coffee pot barely warmed the water for tea.
In summary, look at other hotels for comfort. This one is for clubbing...",2,2015,12,13
148,Our preferred choice in central London,"Great location, good reception, approachable & professional staff, funky rooms with quality toiletries, comfy beds, stunning rooftop bar and decent breakfast. 

I've stayed here about 6 times and never had cause to complain. 
I think the entry level rooms are tiny so suggest an upgrade.",5,2015,12,12
148,Midweek break,"First the good news, pre booked and had to cancel due to health reasons and Maria the reservation manager could not have been more helpful. Thank you.

Over the years I'm fortunate to have stayed in some of the most exclusive hotels in London.  

We decide to stay at 'ME' as it is supposed to be the new kid on the block and ""cool"". 

The entrance and receptions are impressive. But, then you get a room. Totally underwhelming and superficial. The rooms are tiny 9sqm plus small shower room, with nowhere to hang or store clothes. (The wardrobe is 50cm wide) The safe is a trap and I'm sure someone will get hurt trying to use it. Having been out most of the day upon returning at 3pm the bedroom had not been serviced, I requested it to be done and went away for half an hour upon return no one had been near.  I chose to collect fresh towels myself.  The shower flooded and the fixtures and fittings are of a very poor quality.  

On day three at 8am there was no hot water. At a room rate of ¬£500 per night (we paid ""only"" ¬£320 plus a supplement of ¬£20 per night for a useless balcony full of cigarette butts from the bar above). In addition, although breakfast was included we were charged an additional ¬£16 in-room tray charge.

Turning now to the exclusive 'Radio' roof top bar, at 8:30pm on a Tuesday, although there was plenty of seating, it was all reserved, with nowhere for residents to sit. 

In summary, pretentious, superficial and over valued, unless of course you have no clothes, enjoy cold showers in which case you'll love it. 

Oh and please tell your receptionist not to try and justify poor service and quality, it doesn't sit very well! 

",2,2015,12,11
148,Very Disappointing,"Not cheap at over ¬£300 per night, yet room very small and wardrobe could fit 2 coats and was then full plus nowhere for a suit case and safe was dangerous. 
Then I didn't get room cleaned on day one, then no hot water on day 3. Receptionist insulted me by offering ¬£16 off due to no hot water. I'd have preferred her to offer nothing. 
First night went up to Radio at 8.30 and couldn't get a seat yet half the bar was empty with reserve sign's. The gentleman on the desk was very snotty and wasn't interested in making sure guest were happy. Gentleman in lift on our way down summed it up with ""I hate everything about this place"" Overall Hotel was all hype and no substance.",2,2015,12,11
148,***LOVE THIS HOTEL***,"Recently attended the ME Christmas Party - AMAZING! Delicious cocktails, incredible food, the most amazing band, such a good night! The staff are always so lovely and the service so good.. Can't wait to come back :)  thank you ME!!",5,2015,12,11
148,Not as good as usual,"I'm a Melia Gold Member and I've been a loyal Guest for a very long time. I've been at the ME London several time before and I've experienced few different types of rooms, from the Mode to the Chic Suite, etc 
Actually this time I was in London for a quick two days meeting and some Christmas shopping and I was offered to upgrade to a Chic Suite , which I've gladly accepted. 
The suite was at fifth floor and nicely decored as usual. 
Now the negatives:
I had breakfast at the Cucina and as I'm not drinking coffee, I've ordered some hot tea which it was never delivered. Then I've asked for some toast bread for which I've been waiting for 15 minutes and also it was never delivered. As I couldn't wait for ever and I was in a kind of rush , I've decided to stand up and leave, of course after sign a receipt of over 20 Pounds for an orange juice and a kind of croissant. The breakfast service is extremely slow and it looks like that one of the young ladies working there as a waitress has a little clue of what is going on , and , the only thing she does is walking around with a carafe of coffee. The other lady which has been there longer is definitely much more efficient but I guess that the working load during a busy breakfast morning cannot be supported by a single capable worker. There is only an additional Busboy or Runner which is bringing the food from the open kitchen to the tables but it looks like that he needs some additional training as well or again something is not balanced between the working load and the Personnel available. 

The second bad comment is related to the fact that last night (Thursday), at around one in the morning a bunch of Young fellows decided to have a kind of regrouping at the corridor just outside my suite. So they started to laugh and scream loud, banging and slamming each other doors, leaving the rooms and back again after few minutes with more people just to be louder than before. And I'm not exaggerating , all of this lasted till 445am. At 5am I had to get up to get my transportation to the airport as I'm traveling back to the U.S. today. Considering that between the charged to my card, the Melia point (over 50,000), and the amount paid to upgrade to the Chic Suite reached more than 500 Pounds , well I guess that I've the rights to be highly disappointed. Especially if the second night was a very bad experience and I've slept for about ten to fifteen minutes all together. 

As I said at the beginning of the comment, I've been at the ME few times but , if I have to decide today to book it again for my next visit to London few months from now , well, I would think twice prior to decide about it. 
I'm sure that now I'm too upset to think about it and that with the time pass by, I will give the ME another chance to show that this experience was just an episode and it isn't the norm. 
Hopefully the above it will be taken as a constructive comment made by a person which grew up in the hospitality business with the intent to bring to your attention what it can be very disappointed for your Guests. 
Details make the difference. 
Best Regards.",2,2015,12,11
148,Event Space - Christmas Party,"Wow! Love the ME hotel - always a wonderful service & fantastic atmosphere. Attended a christmas party at the ME Hotel this week and the evening was fantastic. Delicious cocktails & food, along with a fantastic band.  Wonderful evening :)",5,2015,12,10
148,Unique Hotel in London,From the unique design of the hotel to the modern decor in the room this hotel is apt at giving you pleasant surprises. The room was wonderful with its minimalistic yet modern design and the rooftop bar is a nice place to hangout with friends in the evening. The staff is very courteous and helpful.,5,2015,12,10
148,Best Christmas Party in a long time!,"I was invited to the ME Christmas Party this past Tuesday and it was hosted in their large ball/conference room. Even though the venue was big it felt intimate somehow. The food was absolutely delicious and both of their restaurants were there serving the guests so there was something for everyone. The cocktails were great and being pregnant there was even some nice options for me without alcohol. My friends were drinking though so the festive photobooth was where we spent much of the evening. All in all, it was just a lovely evening and I hope to be invited next year again.",5,2015,12,10
148,ME Christmas Party,"I attended the ME Christmas Party on Tuesday evening and it was truly fantastic. A really special night, Caroline and the team at the ME really know how to put on a brilliant event. Delicious food, drinks and great company. I love this hotel and all it has to offer.",5,2015,12,10
148,ME Christmas Party 2015,"Absolutely amazing night, all the food was from the on-site restaurants (STK being one of them) and it was sensational! 

The music was perfect, cocktails were incredible, service was on point and the venue is just beautiful.  The room in which the party was held had a beautiful fairy-lit tree in the middle of the space which gave it a unique, sophisticated and luxurious feel. 

Fabulous night and would recommend this hotel and all of its restaurants and bars!",5,2015,12,10
148,ME Christmas Party,"Fabulous party, amazing hosts and beautiful hotel and event space.  They really pulled out all the stops.  Food was lovely they had a little taster from STK and Cucina Asselina.  Also a cholcolate fountain.....need I say anymore.....",5,2015,12,10
148,An Evening of Festivities at the ME,"I attended the ME Christmas party on Tuesday with some work colleagues and we had a fantastic evening. From the choice and quality of the food and drink to the d√©cor and wonderful band entertainment, it was a great night had by all and we were well look after by the Event Manager, Caroline. The staff were extremely attentive and the facilities were immaculate. They had fantastic prizes on offer and handed out a raffle ticket to each person as they arrived, my colleague was fortunate enough to win and that was the cherry on the cake! Not to mention the fun had in the photo booth......",5,2015,12,10
148,Marvellous ME,"This is one of my favourite hotels in London with the all round package and wow factor! Not only does it have a fantastic location, the trendy, modern design of the hotel and its rooms never fail to impress. The restaurants are fantastic, from the roof top bar with the best panoramic views of London to its delicious Italian tapas style restaurant Cucina Asellina. I recently attended an event on the lower ground floor and it was very impressive, hosting nearly 400 people, yet still being very spacious. The function room was decorated beautifully and staff were extremely attentive and helpful. If you are looking for a five star experience without the stuffy attitude - then this is for you!",5,2015,12,10
148,That special weekend,"Great position..friendly staff,and plenty to keep you entertained if fancy and evening in hotel Happy days expensive drinks !! as is most of most of trendy bars in London prices us Yorkshire folk find hard to swallow at times ie: 2 x cocktails ¬£30.....all in all had a great time though",5,2015,12,10
148,"Very modern, clean, beautiful hotel in a great location and with great service","When you enter the hotel, the first thing you notice is the nice smell. It is quite dark, but in a nice and cozy way. The staff that greets you are super-nice. So is the staff at the reception. They offered drinks while waiting to check in, we were quite many that arrived at the same time.
The room was spacious, a bit scaled down but very comfortable. Great lighting and AC, both controlled from an electronic panel by the bed.
Nice bed, nice working area, very nice and luxurious bathroom. Perfect all around! The only negative is the gym - it is new and fresh, but way too small. If more than 2 people are there, it is crowded. 
If not for the price, I would come back there again and again.",5,2015,12,09
148,Weekend treat,"The best check-in ever!  Wonderful hotel and especially loved the roof bar.  Breakfast was superb and the service excellent.  Location is great, particularly for Theatreland and Covent Garden and look forward to staying again!",5,2015,12,08
148,Glamorous hotel with perfect service,"Wow! Booked this hotel as we had a reservation in the restaurant STK and was more than delighted.  Upon arrival we were taken to the check-in reception and offered a glass of fizz.  Our room was fabulous, really comfy bed, lovely complimentary toiletries and great lighting features.  Our evening started with a complimentary cocktail followed by a delicious meal in the SKT restaurant.  We finished our evening in the Radio Rooftop Bar which, although was very limited with seating was a fabulous atmosphere.
Would definitely recommend this hotel and won't stay anywhere else in London again!",5,2015,12,08
148,MOST MEMORABLE NIGHT EVER,"My boyfriend proposed to me at this hotel and it was so perfect! We couldn't be more thankful to all he staff, especially Nicky who helped from the start. When we went for dinner downstairs (which is the best steak I have ever had) the staff had re-done the room and added personal touches, like quotes on the mirrors and chocolate covered strawberries with popping candy. It was so special and beautiful. 

From the minute we walked into the hotel, we felt so welcome. We had no idea where to go, so the friendly staff helped us through to reception where we were greeted with prosecco. The room was spotless and beautiful with a quaint lovely seating area on the balcony. 

Every member of staff we came into contact with was so lovely and genuinely wanted to speak to you. I have never felt so welcome in central London before. The team are so easy to work with and become apart of the celebration. I could not recommend this hotel/restaurant/bar enough...you have to go! 

",5,2015,12,07
148,Pricelessspecials Surprise,The hotel is located close to the center. Easy to walk to everywhere. People working here are very friendly and helpful. The cocktails  on the roof top are as best as the view. Breakfast and Diner was excellent. Quiet rooms - good rest.,5,2015,12,07
148,Super friendly staff,"Great staff , good food , famous rooftop bar , interesting building. Bar one issue with noise from nightclub on first floor we were moved to the fourth floor for a good nights sleep. Generally a good experience but don't book the first floor. Fantastic location. ",4,2015,12,06
148,Funky and chic,A great concept hotel with lots of character and novelty. The Radio bar at the top of the hotel has fantastic views and a great vibe - well worth a visit on its own. The restaurants are great and the service is very good indeed.,4,2015,12,04
148,Cool place,"Excellent hotel in the middle of the West End.   Went for 2 nights and ended up extending to 3 nights, lovely place.  Trendy bars and restaurants.  Expensive but worth it.   Efficient staff.   Greta location.",5,2015,12,04
148,THE PLACE TO STAY IN THE STRAND/COVENT GARDEN THEATER DISTRICTS,"What a cool hotel and a perfect location!  We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to  go. They treat you well from beginning to end and all are efficient and friendly.  Employees including the maid on our floor seem to be truly happy to be working there.  The rooms are large by London (or New York) standards and while still small, do not feel small.  The decor is muted and relaxing and the technology is somewhat daunting for an older couple (we're in our late 60's) but we figured it out and enjoyed the mood lighting particularly.  We ate at all 3 restaurants, Radio, Cucina Asellina and STK London.  The food was excellent in each but all were noisy at dinner with a disco beat in the background most of the time.  I'm sure that the younger patrons enjoyed this aspect but for us it was a little hard to hear each other.  Still a small issue.  They have a wonderful selection of extras in the room available for sale, but sadly they were not replenished 2 days out of 4 for us and we would have had another bottle of Brut Champagne had there been one available.  We could have had one sent up but didn't want to bother.  Again, a small issue.  They offer a wonderful box of 6 chocolates upon arrival with information on how to contact the concierge.  They were delicious and I wish they would have sold them as we would have had another box with our wine two nights later!  We were across the street from the Courtauld Museum with their very nice collection of Impressionist paintings (our favorite).  We walked to the London Eye for the Champagne experience, ate at Simpson-in-the-Strand one night (amazing prime rib according to my husband - I'm a vegan and their vegetables were delicious).  We walked to the London Transport Museum - definitely worth a visit, a play with Kenneth Branaugh at the Garrick Theater that was hilarious, a definite must see, the play the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime - also worth seeing (a drama).  We stayed 4 nights and even walked to the Tate Modern Museum to see the Alexander Calder sculpture display.  A great trip and a wonderful hotel right in the middle of everything we wanted to do.  The room was a nice respite after a day out.  We did have drinks at the Marconi Bar in the lobby one night though it appeared to be closed because the bartender was down talking to the concierge most of the time (several patrons walked in and walked out thinking it was already closed though it was only 10:30 or so in the evening)  The bar has an interesting atmosphere and decor as with the entire hotel.  Definitely stay here if you can!",5,2015,12,03
148,Marriage Proposal at ME London,"Hi,

I would like to share my experience with ME London. I have decided to propose to my girlfriend there and I can say I that everything was planed and executed to perfection. The hotel staff made our stay magical and my girlfriend was amazed from service we've received. Catherrine  Precilla which is the Aura Manager at ME London did plan the whole proposal for me and she did a brilliant job. I am very pleased that i have picked up ME London for my proposal.
I do recommend the hotel for any special occasions as they are very good in organizing everything for you.  
      ",5,2015,12,03
148,An experience to have,"Brilliant.From the time we arrived the staff were attentive, polite and helpful. A very relaxing atmosphere and time flew by!  In room catering was exceptional.However if you book at STK just make sure of your reservation! 
      
      ",5,2015,12,02
148,Sublime Perfection,"This slightly unassuming building is hiding a BIG secret...a Magnificent Hotel is hiding behind the walls. The staff are attentive and friendly without ever over-steeping the mark.  The rooms are spotless, packed with amenities and the location makes you feel like the center on the universe.  Best hotel I have ever stayed at in London...and I will be returning regularly...even if it IS a bit on the pricey side..because, for once, it is worth the money.",5,2015,12,02
148,One of the best hotel suites around,"I went to meet some friends of mine after an awards ceremony who were staying in the hotel. Well after far to much food at the great STK and lots more cocktails at Radio Bar, I just resist and having checked out my friends suite I decided to check in - A bit a lost weekend if you like in London. I stayed in 611 an amazing suite, it was huge, the design is amazing and the suite is well laid out, the bed was so comfy I didnt want to get up, the little extras at the hotel i love, like help yourself to bubbles when you check in. Considering I had nothing but the clothes I was wearing, the drawer in the bathroom had everything i needed for my over night stay. The breakfast is really yummy and the service was great, as usual I wanted my ¬£700's worth so i stuffed myself, breakfast is served semi buffet with all the main dishes cooked fresh to order. My only niggle was i needed to charge my phone and they gave me a phone charger, but I had to leave my credit card to get it, bit silly as i was a guest in the hotel, but all in all 10 out of 10",5,2015,12,01
148,Like stepping into a sexy future,"The hotel has a great position on the Strand, perfect for the West End theatre or the night-life of central London. It doesn't have a particularly imposing presence from outside but the cool modern look of the lobby impresses, the best it yet to come however.
To get to check in you travel up the elevator into a sci-fi room with a glass pyramid roof. Looking up at the awesome architecture whilst sipping some free prosecco I was very happy with my last minute booking!
The rooms themselves are also ultramodern and make the most of the available space with sleek sliding doors and lighting from the future with a 'sexy' setting. The bed was brilliantly comfortable and the bathroom had a good shower. I was also very impressed with the minibar; it was rather expensive as usual but they'd gone to the effort to curate an interesting selection of snacks and drinks.
It's worth noting that the rooftop bar is well worth a visit, the cocktails and bar snacks were good and the staff were great about finding a table for me as a hotel guest.
I'd recommend ME London as good option for a weekend break or business trip, especially if you're a fan of interesting design or cocktails al fresco.",5,2015,12,01
148,Superb and modern chic.,"Perfect central London location I believe this to be a modern classic. 

The lobby is not actually check in, but a cool bar and meeting point. Also hosts the efficient concierge services. Light Tapas dishes available too which are exceptional.

The check in is on the first floor which might be a little onerous to some, but it is peaceful and also efficient. Everywhere is all a little dimly lit, but you get used to it and adds to the ambience of quiet and private.

The rooms are large by London standards and are superb on all fronts. Cannot be faulted. Clean, airy, fully stocked. Just get used to the touch pad on the wall to organise your lighting.

The other facilities used include the bar on the 8th floor called Radio. A single elevator means you have to access it via the ground floor, but this adds a secure feel to the environment. The bar itself boasts great views, outdoor cabanas, heating, and a very cool and busy feel. Certainly a place to be seen.

Breakfast is at STK the restaurant adjacent to the elevators. Great service and a good breakfast if a little pricey. Nothing exceptional.

Overall, whilst on the pricey side, if you like modern, cool, and uber chic then look no further than the ME on Strand.",4,2015,11,30
148,Perfect Location,"Check in experience was good, polite and helpful staff. Perfect location, less than 5 minutes walk to the london bridge, convent garden, london eye, shopping lanes, pub and bar. Breakfast was great, lots of choices between cold and hot, some staff was friendly, some was cold. Dont be surprise. its london. Rooftop Bar luncheon was great, able to catch up sunnies with rooftop river view and great food. Evening time the rooftop bar turns become a nite club, which is entertaining enough. Overall; location, room, food and the style is fancy enough to get the thumbs up.",4,2015,11,30
148,"Modern, great food, service and location","I have visited London between 1-3 times annually since 1995, stayed in many hotels across the city and this would be one of the best experiences. I was there for 9 days and everything was perfect: rooms, restaurant, great staff - when my shoe lace broke running out the door for work the concierge took one of his off for me!",5,2015,11,30
148,Amazing Experience...,"We booked this hotel for our anniversery back in August and were taken back by the service and environment from the minute we arrived. We were given complimentary drink tickets for the bars at the restaurants and offered a drink while we checked in. The customer service manager Nikki was very friendly and added a personal touch to our checking in experience. We stayed in the Mode room which was very spacious and had a stunning floor to ceiling view. The location was very convenient, litteraly 7-10 mins walk from most major attractions. We have booked again and will continue to do so... highly recommended!",5,2015,11,29
148,A luxury experience that was worth the money,"This was my first time staying in London and boy was I amazed! The staff was exceedingly helpful, from the concierge to the check-in, and even the rooftop bar. Our room was small but very comfortable with all the amenities one could want. We had a view of the city and our own balcony. This is a great location if you want to head out on the town later, as so much is within walking distance. I would *surely* stay here again!",5,2015,11,29
148,Weekend break,"A very different style hotel compared to most in London, the theme is a black minimalist look. 
The reception is fantastic, with all members of staff very helpful. 
Facilities are second to none within the rooms and hotel, no complaints. 
A must during your visit is have a or two drink at the radio bar on the top floor reservations are required, fantastic views with a lively vibe. 
Strongly recommend the hotel. ",5,2015,11,29
148,Trendiest hotel ever,"This is one of the trendiest hotels i've ever been to, it's just overall excellent and I couldn't think of anything negative. The rooms were fantastic with great views and were very clean. The lobby is breathtaking with the visuals. This hotel is just fantastic.",5,2015,11,29
148,Construction at 2 am inside the hotel ,"Believe it or not there were people sawing in the room next to me 
Guess they though it was OK to do construction and if they didn't use power tools that was OK. It's not OK to wake a guest who just flew in and had a big meeting the next day. I couldn't get back to sleep and my day was shot. I called down and they stooped but never said a word to me about it. 
Bush league management . very amateur. Don't stay here. There are lots of hotels in the immediate area.

148,Dark corridors with bright rooms,"Stayed here for a company event,
Lunch was mixed with half of the food good and the rest a bit odd!
Corridors very dark but he rooms were large bright and well presented.
Nice amenities supplied and turn down service appreciated.
Not sure the cost per room equals value but overall it's a good experience.",4,2015,11,28

148,Fantastic hotel,"Stunning hotel with fantastic staff. Stayed in the Chic suite and loved it! Service went beyond expectations. Unlike a previous reviewer we loved the ME scent! Only disappointment was the cost of parking, given the hotel costs I wouldn't necessarily expect it to be so high. We will definitely return.",5,2015,11,27
148,Amazing Hotel,"Definitely worth a stay! Brilliant customer service and fantastic restaurants and bars. A trip to STK is a must. Good location and excellent amenities in the rooms. We would definitely return and recommend to anyone looking to stay in London.

148,"Too many staff, terrible service on rooftop bar","Hotel is a great location, room was just fabulous, great shower!!!
However... Our stay was marred by the constant approach of staff to check all is ok. Walking from the entrance to the reception you have to get past 3 members of staff all asking if everything is ok???!!!
Perhaps they should move some of the staff upstairs X to the rooftop bar, as there setts inly isn't good service up there. Waited over 30 minutes for someone to take our drinks order... Not impressed. 
So if you're going to stay in you're room all night... Highly recommended. Room is great... It's only when you step outside it goes wrong!",3,2015,11,24
148,Fantastic Staff Amazing Stay,"I have never known such highly trained and caring staff, the Hotel is Stunning and the Radio Roof Top Bar is fabulous, all perfect but the very best memory was the Staff all made the stay perfect.I would make sure all of my friends  shouls share this HOTEL",5,2015,11,24
148,Birthday Getaway in Convent Garden,"I am a regular at Melia hotels, however this hotel is on another level. From start to finish the services was amazing - the staff could not do enough for you.
As it was my wife's birthday they made our experience extra special. The view from the bar upstairs was amazing - you can see for miles!
All in all - Highly Recommended and I will be returning again soon.
      
      ",5,2015,11,24
148,Couldn't fault it,Went for drinks one night in the Grey Goose bar on the rooftop of the hotel. The service was prompt and the drinks which we had were incredible with the view of London. Definitely going to return to here.,5,2015,11,22
148,"ME Hotel London, always amazing!","I've been fortunate enough to stay at the ME hotel, London on numerous occasions and every time I stay, I don't want to leave. 

The location is great, on the strand, just off of Trafalgar Square, the staff are amazing and the design and finish of the hotel is outstanding! It's the finishing touches too, a glass of complimentary prosecco at check in, amazing monsoon showers and a multi functional, digital, ambient lighting panel in the room (it even has a ""sexy"" setting that turns the room purple!?!), what more could you ask for?

There are several types of room, all to a similar standard, but going up in size. Some even have balconies over looking the strand! The rooms are stylish and immaculately kept, you won't be disappointed. The complimentary toiletries are as you'd expect from a hotel of this calibre and you are also provided with razors, tooth brushes and slippers. 

If you get a chance you must check out the Radio, roof top bar, this can get very busy, but that's because it has a great atmosphere and some of the best views across London. The only down side is there is no direct access for residents. To access the Radio bar you have to go to the ground floor and get the private lift which takes you directly to the roof. 

STK is a great place to eat, the steaks are amazing and if you fancy something different try the crab sliders!

You really can't fault the ME London, I will always choose ME as my base whenever I'm staying in town.

148,Fantastic stay,"My boyfriend surprised me for my birthday and it was just extraordinary from the start to the end,we were welcomed by the lovely lady Kenya.once we entered the room, I saw a birthday msg from the aura team which made me feel very special. Then to top it up we had a chance to enjoy our night in radio bar with the great view, thanks to security Karim who went extra mile and escorted us the bar. The rest of the night went smoothly and the service that we received from the staff was just perfect. We will definitely return.",5,2015,11,16
148,Room 901,"Very impressive hotel - amazing corridors and reception area with a glass of bubbly on arrival - room 901 was lovely, we managed to catch the sunset for the amazing view - comfortable bed with all the amenities you could possibly want - didn't feel the drinks were expensive we ordered a bottle of pink Moet in the room only ¬£65 - definitely recommend - can't wait to go to the ME Ibiza next year now. ",5,2015,11,16
148,Stinks,"This hotel from the moment you arrive has a real thick pungent perfume smell, air quality in London is pretty poor to start with without getting gassed in your hotel, the smell is really bad in every bedroom , non of the windows open so you have to continual breath in this commercial air freshener carcinogenic smell. I am checking out today. Shame they've spoilt a good hotel.   ",1,2015,11,14
148,Ultimate contemporary luxury,We stayed for one night and I cannot praise ME Hotel enough. I always have high expectations and on this occasion I wasn't disappointed. Every aspect is of the service was exceptional. Our room was perfect with blackout in the bedroom and padded walls for ultimate silence! We booked a table at radio rooftop for before and after dinner and on the latter we were running late but the Aura Manager ensured our table was held. If you are looking for a oasis of calm in a vibrant city this hotel is for you - they have thought of everything. Plus it smells amazingly... Like a spa.,5,2015,11,13
148,Fantastic hotel - Noise at night & Radio rooftop bar could improve,"We visited on the first evening of our honeymoon. The hotel (staff) went out of their way to ensure that we had a memorable visit and provided extra touches to make it feel even more special. All the staff went out of their way to help (Reception, valet parking & concierge especially helpful) and are a credit to the the group. The hotel is visually stunning and the rooms extremely well presented and comfy. 
The one issue we did encounter is being woken twice through the night when someone set of the fire alarm ( twice between 3.30 & 4am) which i guess can't be helped, however left us both tired the next day due to the people in the rooms next to us talking and making a noise until 5.

The Radio Rooftop Bar - Being guests we obviously had no issue getting in, however was informed that all the outside tables were taken (we noticed several that weren't).  We were assured that we would be next to have one when anyone left. This unfortunately didn't happen (we did ask again). Several other groups /couples came into the bar and walked out and sat without being challenged - they merrily went about taking pictures as the hostess looked on. Being guests who were spending good money on Champagne etc to celebrate, I was disappointed with the service as this is not something I've experienced in other bars similar at the Sandserson, St Martins Lane or The Mayfair. The drinks were good though so no complaints there and the views are superb.",4,2015,11,12
148,Good location for Theatres,"Great place to stay and very central for theatre land.
Hotel experience good for a very modern hotel.

When you first enter the lobby, the architecture is really impressive and the rooms come fully equipped with an entertainment & light system.
You have to go there at least once :-)",5,2015,11,10

148,"Snobbish staff, average hotel but GREAT, GREAT location","Stayed here for business for 4 nights, and very unlikely to come back

Pros:
- GREAT, GREAT location

Cons:
- Snobbish staff
- Untruthful staff. When I asked for a late check-out, was told they are 100% booked BUT can give me an extension @GBP20 per hour - does that make sense? No rooms, but available at a price? 5 star hotel with a 1 star attitude
- Corridors are really dark
- Rooms are too modern - took me (and a number of other colleagues quite a while to figure out how things worked)",2,2015,11,09

148,cool and hip hotel and worth the money,"This is a fantastic hotel - location, decor and service are excellent.  We upgraded to the Passion Suite and it was worth every penny - big, great decor and tons of amenities.  The only downside which we shared is the giant tub is really slippery and hard to relax in, so ask for a mat or something to sit on.  Also, make sure the WIFI works in all the rooms because we had connectivity problems.  Overall, though--WILL STAY AGAIN - great service and wonderful room.",4,2015,11,06
148,Superb,"This is a very high end hotel in a city with tough competition. I have stayed at many hotels and this was the 1st time I had to call down to ask how to get into the mini bar. The wood panelling effect completely threw me and I found myself walking around the room tapping walls looking for the mysterious hidden gems. There was absolutely nothing missing from the bathroom, you could literally rock up with no bag, stay the night and still have everything you need. The only negative I could possibly find would be the crazy wood panelling (again) around the TV prevented the general use of the remote control apart from one (again crazy) angle, whilst stood on tiptoes.....I actually did not manage this at all over the weekend, my husband did manage but really quite unnecessary!",5,2015,11,04
148,Birthday weekend,"We had a lovely stay at the hotel but the restaurant was disappointing.

After seeing a show, my boyfriend and I went there for dinner (Cucina Asellina), we booked a table for 10.30pm and were instantly shown our seats on arrival. 

Once seated we were offered some water and then were told that the waiter would come back to take our drink and food order. The water never came back. We asked several staff a total of three times if we could order some wine and food and were told that someone else will come to our table. We finally got our wine after a wait of 45 minutes. The restaurant was emptying at this point so the staff couldn't blame the restaurant being super busy. Considering the wait we had for the food and the prices, we didn't find the food very satisfactory, we were hoping for something a little more special. 

None of the restaurant staff apologised for the lack of service. We didn't make a complaint whilst we were there as at that point it was midnight, we were tired and just wanted to go to our room. I paid the full price and left. 

It was my boyfriend's birthday I just wanted our meal to be a nice experience, unfortunately it was just a let down. I would 100% recommend the hotel but not the restaurant! ",4,2015,11,04
148,Best venue ,"3 restaurants and awesome hotel , what more do you want. No need to leave location . Dark passages need some getting used to ? Great service . Can't find fault .

148,The Jewel on the Strand,"The VIP service commenced from the moment I stepped into the lobby. Everyone was so warm and helpful and I got an upgrade to the VIBE room which was no easy feat as I was in London during Fashion week. I loved the structure of the floor to ceiling windows and that you could control lighting and room temperature from a wall pad right by your bed. It truly was a smart room! I even got my own personalized welcome message from the Hotel team scrawled on the mirror by the mini-bar. In addition to that, they sent up some goodie bags with products from Alter∆égo and Dior to commemorate fashion week. The hotel offers room service around the clock and though I am not one for Bars, I made an exception for the Radio Bar and it was amazing. The views are Panoramic!!  I want to thank Caroline Rambert for her amazing generosity and hospitality.

The vibe at the hotel is super stylish and has such a lovely feel to it,
the room was fabulous and had everything you could ever want, super comfy bed and the shower was just out of this world.
After we returned from dinner as it had been mentioned was my birthday, birthday message written on mirror, two roses and chocolate dipped strawberries.. What a fantastic surprise..I am cabin crew and have stayed in hundreds of hotels but this experience has totally blown me away. The staff are so lovely and can't do enough..

Me London exceeded our wildest expectations on all levels. 
Attention to detail here is second to none, this is the place where the client comes first and foremost.

148,ME London Hotel,"Our first time staying at the ME.  The staff at the hotel were amazing.  They were  professional, efficient, kind, and stepped out of their way to help with anything that was needed. 
The concierge Emiliano booked private tours, dining reservations, drivers, shows, and found everything and anything that we needed during our stay. Prior to our arrival Emiliano corresponded with us on every detail of our trip.
Our room with a balcony facing Big Ben was perfect since the rooms were a little small.  Drawer space is limited in the rooms which could be a problem for some people.
The nightclub and restaurants were the place to be in London.  Young, vibrant, and nonstop fun with great people!
Our family met the COB and his wife during our stay.  Both could not have been nicer and more gracious.  We will definitely continue staying at the ME while in London and use the MELIA chain around world.  ",5,2015,10,19

148,Prison cell window,"""The Vibe rooms provide natural light thanks to the floor to ceiling windows""

Not ours, it was more akin to a prison cell, i.e. one could not even see out of the window due to it being so high up the wall.  WTH?  Luckily I'm pretty acrobatic so I could (literally) climb up to sit on the window ledge to see outside.

Average due to that and:
1. We were on our way out one night, went back to the room to find the turn down service being done.  Great, however the maid had the duvet ... on the floor.

2. Auto-tip bills (you know, an x% will be added to your bill etc..).  I don't usually mind paying that when outstanding service, but not when I go to the bar myself to get a couple of glasses of wine.  What I also don't like is when asking for this to be removed (and asking that this is understood), it appears on the final checkout bill.

Of course there are many good points.  Great location if you are going to a local theatre, close to some good attractions.  The reception area is beyond compare, loved the design of that place and how it led up to the roof top bar.

Please though, don't try to sell couple hundred $ room upgrade, try to get the room as stated.",3,2015,10,18
148,Gorgeous !!!,"What can I say? This is my favorite hotel in all of London. 
It has style like none other, the service is always up top and the restaurants and roof top bar are awesome, with great food and a nice view of the themes (rooftop bar).

Rooms are great (suites are stunning) and special requests are always taken care of.

The coolest lobby and a super stylish architecture finish up the 5 star rating that this hotel deserves every time I am visiting.",5,2015,10,17

148,Anniversary celebration.,"Stunning interior, particularly the reception. Nice glass of Prosecco on arrival. The black marble corridors are a bit too dark. The room was very good but the bed was too hard, the loo positioned very low and the toilet screen should have been cleaner.
The staff were very pleasant and breakfast and was excellent.
We ventured to Radio the rooftop bar on the evening but the noise from the music the DJ was playing was deafening so we left. We returned the following afternoon and had a much more pleasant experience, the view from there is great.
The hotel is in a great position on The Strand, ideal for Theatreland, Covent Garden, Leicester Square and the South Bank.

148,Conference,"I ran an event at ME London for the first time this month and was truly blown away by the product and service!  I have stayed in no other hotel like it, it really is an experience...each F&B outlet offers something completely different.  The bedrooms, oh the bedrooms...the only problem here was that I couldn't spend more time in it!  Big bedrooms compared to others in central London, very simple in its design but luxurious - loved the I.t. Panel on the wall and given that I'm non-technical I found it extremely easy to use. Loved the ""sexy"" lighting that you come back to at night which is part of turn-down. 

Dinner in STK was delicious with vibrant service - can't wait for it to open in Edinburgh! Radio offered our delegates a great informal alternative for drinks and dinner. Cucina - love Italian tapas, why has no one else thought if it?! 

Event space again unique, very well appointed with great service - food within DDR, excellent - never had tuna nicoise like it anywhere else for a conference. 

Reception team, can't remember her name but she was Italian, very friendly but professional - nice balance. Particular mention to Concierge, wow - the whole team were fab, nothing too big or small was a problem. 

Would highly recommend this hotel - I can't wait to go back... üòÉüòÉüòÉ

148,"All front, no substance","Very nice, well presented hotel with excellent linen and towels. However, let down by too many staff who are polite but ineffective and back office systems that don't work. Still waiting for my bill. And the price? Don't ask!",3,2015,10,10
148,"Too much style, not enough substance","This hotel is well located, is quiet, with spacious rooms and good quality restaurants and bars.

However, in my opinion many of the rooms, particularly the hotel corridors, are far too dark - to the point that you cannot see other people clearly - and the rooms have been made pointlessly difficult to operate. (There is a central control panel which controls lighting, air conditioning to, but it is so awkward to use that there are paper instructions in the room to show you how.   Why the can't have simple light switches and air conditioning controls I simplydo not know.) 

Added to that, the lifts are impossibly slow.

All in all, a good hotel ruined by stylists.

148,Centrally located luxury,"Centrally located luxurious hotel.... You can walk to any central location and relax in the luxurious hotel! Every detail is taken care of by the hotel including traditional nightly turn down service!
      ",5,2015,10,08
148,Great service and attention to detail,"I have stayed twice at the ME hotel, Strand Street London and will be returning next week.

The staff at the ME hotel have gone well above and beyond the call of duty to create a fantastic experience.

They always greet guests, nothing is too much trouble for them. They are friendly, efficient and professional.

The hotel itself is modern, chic and exclusive.

I look forward to my return visit.",5,2015,10,07
148,Great response,"Really enjoyed staying here. The staff was great.  A special thank you to Kwesi, one of the engineers, who was able to quickly diagnose and resolve the audio problem in our room.  The location is also ideal.",5,2015,10,07
148,Special Birthday,"Fabulous and contemporary hotel-with plenty to admire in terms of breathtaking modern architecture and glamour. Service was on point-friendly and personal.  This stay was for a special birthday and they added some lovely special touches to our Chic suite on arrival.  It has a very different feel than other hotels in the area-so fantastic if you want to experience something a bit different. We dined in STK-fantastic food, good value and excellent service-apart from having to wait a little bit for our booked table but great people watching opportunity in fab atmosphere added to by the live DJ playing a really great set. Overall a fantastic hotel in a great central location with lots of options inside and out.  Would definitely visit again.",5,2015,10,07
148,"Great location & bar, poor room & breakfast","The title says it all really; this hotel's location and super-cool rooftop bar are worthy of its price bracket, however its rooms and breakfast let it down.  The room design was probably the poorest I've experienced in a five star hotel, with virtually no storage space (there was a very small hanging area but no drawers or shelves at all.)  This meant that we were tripping over almost all our belongings, which had to be stored on the case stand and floor (and we were only there for two nights - any more and we would have had to complain about this as the room was so small that it was a significant irritation.)  I would say this was a triumph of form over function, however the 'form' wasn't to my taste either!  The decor choice, predominantly white and glass, meant that the room looked pretty grubby - despite being hygienically clean.  The bed was very comfortable and our room was quiet, helping to pull this review up from a ""poor"" rating.  The breakfast offering was very limited and the cooked food totally unappetising.  I beleive we should have been offered freshly cooked food from a menu but we were instead directed to a very poor buffet.  Despite having paid for it, I skipped breakfast on our second morning and ate out - something I have never, ever done before!  So far, my least favourite London hotel in this price range (see other reviews!)",3,2015,10,06
148,great trendy hotel in terrific location. excellent staff,"staff were great from the moment we walked in- slight problem with TV which wasn't sorted but didn't spoil the stay. Roof top bar is great addition but a lot of non residents getting priority re seating, service  ",5,2015,10,06
148,Fantastic Place,Stayed at the ME a few times and never had any issues. A group of 17 of us stayed there for the Rugby and had the most brilliant time. All rooms were ready for early check in. Radio Rooftop Bar was great with fantastic service. Everyone had such a great time we will definitely be using them for corporate/business events as well as personal events. All staff were fantastic and looked after us very well.,5,2015,10,06
148,Self-consciously hip,"The design of the hotel is amazing...from the black marble sloping corridors and internal ""pyramid"" reception that stretches to the roof, through to the rooms and roof top radio bar.  The location is also perfect if you are exploring Covent Garden.

The staff here are friendly and helpful.  I initially booked one night online and then decided to extend it to two nights and although my first choice room was not available for the second night they gave me a complimentary upgrade.

Rooms are great and I enjoyed playing with the lighting panel that enabled me to change the mood lighting from blue to pink and any shade in between.  Other features include a well stocked mini bar and Nespresso machine.

There are a few negatives, but none that major.  Wardrobe space in my room was pretty limited and some aspects of the bathroom needed attention (e.g. shower door needed to be slammed shut to close properly).  Radio Bar is very popular and the outside tables seemed to be permanently reserved - and from 6pm the music volume is turned right up so forget about chatting over a drink.

It's a stylish place so if I'm in Covent Garden again I would certainly consider staying here again.  But it attracts a young crowd so if you are looking for a quiet place to stay this may not be your thing.",4,2015,10,05
148,Best in London,Stayed in the penthouse here and was treated like royalty. Staff were friendly and effecient! Room was beautiful and the facilities are amazing! I had guests over and all were speechless! Id definitely tell you to stay here!!! ,5,2015,10,03
148,Would definitely return! ,"Stayed at ME for my birthday with my boyfriend. We received champagne on arrival and the experience remained at that level for the rest of the stay. The rooms are small but being in London you are hardly in the room. Despite being small, all rooms are clean, fresh and modern. Of course we visited Radio Bar, one of our favourite bars in London. Yes the drinks are expensive but what else would you expect in London! Such a lovely stay and made for a memorable birthday. Would definitely return. Now looking to book ME Cancun for next summer and hoping it will be as trendy and stylish as the London branch! ",5,2015,09,30
148,Very unique,"Great hotel, very different when you arrive and corridors rather dark due to the seductive lighting however the room so bright and the beds. One of,the comfiest I have had in a hotel. All staff polite, smart and very professional, will always look at a ME hotel in the future here and abroad!
      ",4,2015,09,30
148,Birthday drinks,"Enjoyed lovely birthday cocktails in the Marconi Lounge recently!  This bar is bright, modern and the service was excellent.  Didn't stay in the hotel but looks like one to remember for any future overnighters in London.",5,2015,09,30
148,Great Place To Stay!,"I've stayed in a few areas already in London, but this one has been the best so far. The vibe, the food and the overall comfort this hotel gives you surpasses most places. The rooms are quite comfortable and you are greeted by the staff everywhere you go. The rooftop terrace is beautiful at night and is a great place for drinks. STK is always good as well and I would opt for the included breakfast in the Melia branded restaurant. The staff at breakfast was fantastic and I felt like it was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a hotel in a long time. I'm definitely coming back. Oh and WIFI was very good! Room has different shades of lighting and is very easy to relax and work in.",5,2015,09,29
148,Back again.......and shall return,"Everything was perfect as per usual. My first stay in the Suite ME, which must be by my reckoning the best room in London. I would encourage anybody to give it a go. Mr Perez the night manager was particularly helpful!",5,2015,09,29
148,Funky but,"Amazing rooms and staff really friendly, great location for theatre in London. However the bars as great as they are attract a much younger slightly rougher crowd. That said once back in the main hotel all is forgotten.",4,2015,09,28
148,Another amazing stay!,"Visited the hotel for two nights for my birthday at the start of this month. It was our third stay at the hotel and it gets better every time thanks to Kenya who helps us organise our stay. 
The staff are so helpful and friendly and the concierge go above and beyond to help guests. 
I highly recommend this hotel, the location is perfect, the rooms are very clean and a great size, it is pure luxury.
I also love that it is connected to my favourite steak restaurant! Can't wait to book our next stay. We will be visiting this hotel for years to come!",5,2015,09,27
148,Wow,"Stayed 5 days and was amazing. Rory and Ronen at the concierge desk were wonderful fromakkng reservations to just chatting about London. Great location near to everything. And staff always we're welcoming and polite. Stayed in a room with balcony and view of the city was wonderful. Will definitely be back on our next trip to London. 
      ",5,2015,09,27
148,Amazing hotel! Brilliant staff! Can't wait to stay again!,"We had the most amazing time at the ME hotel!
The room was stunning, very spacious and luxurious. This has to be one of the best hotel rooms I have stayed in. This is a true example of a 5* hotel!

Drinks at Radio bar at the very top of the hotel delivered a gorgeous skyline view of London and incredible cocktails!
Then to STK for a delicious meal!

This hotel has so much to offer and the beautiful architecture and art work really makes it above the rest! 

The staff were so friendly and helpful, we can't wait to come back!

Thank you so much ME London!",5,2015,09,26
148,Best weekend/hip place!,"Visited the hotel for the Aviva Tour of Britain,nice room with modern white leather all round,filled with tech,restaurants with great design and big variety of choices,loved the roof bar,staff members are great and helpful mentioning above all Cosmin for his extra help upon departure carrying our bags trough the crowd till our parking,well done!",5,2015,09,23
148,Event held at The ME Suite,"We recently held a press launch event at The ME Suite at the top of the ME Hotel. The room worked incredibly well for the event with journalists very impressed with the stunning views over London! We had access out onto the Radio Bar on the roof via a door in the suite with an area roped off for guests. 
The food, drink and service were excellent. The team went above and beyond to cater for all of our needs to ensure the event was a success. I would highly recommend this room for similar events or to stay.",5,2015,09,23
148,ME London,"This hotel is a flag ship of the Melia brand and is an example of a true 5* star experience without the false pomp and snobbery you can experience at other 5* London hotels. The style of the hotel, it's facilities in particular the STK and Cucina restaurants are first class ! The Radio roof top bar is a signature experience and the whole experience is supported and executed by the Aura team ( customer service / guest experience ) who's attention to detail should be enviable to other London hotels. They just get the correct balance of attention to detail , the experience but it's delivered by individuals who you can tell love their job and what they do each day. That's a real and rare experience today !  The Aura team have two people I would like to thank for their attention to detail and professionalism. Kenya Santiago and Leon O'Leary. They are visible , attentive and deliver.  Thank-you ME London.",5,2015,09,19
148,Beautiful but cold.,"Trendy, new, beautiful. Everything was black marble, sterile, cold but the staff were extremely friendly. Prosecco (even at 5am)? Could not shake the impression that it was trying to be a nightclub. Quite loud in our room on the first floor at 11pm. Fantastic location albeit not suitcase distance from the tube but presumably if you stay here youre not taking public transport. I'd like to say it's expensive but it's London so it's probably relative. I'd stay here if you're cool, beautiful or want to be.",4,2015,09,19
148,"Very ""cool"" vibe","We only stayed one night in this ultra hip hotel. The reception is stunning and all the staff are welcoming and cool.
Our River Energy Terrace room was great and reaching it through dimly lit corridors of marble added to the atmosphere.
The breakfast was delicious and the cappuccino particularly welcome.
This is not a cheap option, on a par with iconic names within the locality, but well worth a visit and I should point out, seeing previous reviews, that we are (considerably!) over 30 but still made to feel most welcome and relaxed.
I intend to visit again and hopefully make it to Radio next time.",4,2015,09,19
148,Great stay,"I stayed just for one night. Great enterence with nice music at the background. Overall very good hotel. Breakfast was good but too expensive. Room is modern, clean and large bed. Didn't make use of all facilities of the hotel.",4,2015,09,19
148,First TIme in London,"My wife and I went for a quick trip to celebrate our Anniversary. The hotel is perfectly located in the middle of London with easy access everywhere, mostly walking. The d√©cor of the hotel, restaurants and rooms are chic and comfortable. The BEST part is the Staff. Roberto is a true master bartender. The concierge staff arranged the best dining and scheduled our whole trip!!! RADIO offers breath taking views of London. The only hotel I will go back too. Thank You!!",5,2015,09,18
148,Amazing event space,"Held a press event in the Personality Suite to launch Fashion Week. The staff were incredibly helpful throughout, and made everything easy and run perfectly smoothly if there was a problem it was sorted within minutes. The hotel itself is in a fabulous location, easy to get to from all areas of London and with Covent Garden on the doorstep. To top it all off the views are unbeatable - you can see for miles across London. A perfect place to hold an intimate press event.",5,2015,09,18
148,Unforgettable,"First of all, thank you all for a weekend, never to forget. ME London fully met our expectations. Your personnel were kind, professional and helpful to us. We would love to come back, bout as individuals and as a group.

We can also recommend the restaurant, both for its breakfast and dinner.",5,2015,09,17
148,Funky Lux,"I booked the ME London as a surprise for my fianc√©s birthday. We actually arrived a little bit late, but the Nicky and the staff made it a quick check in for us to get ready for dinner. The staff were professional, yet personal and made our stay a very special one.
The hotel itself is exactly what we look for.. Trendy, funky but with a lot of lux thrown in for good measure. The main reception area is just beautiful! 

I arranged for a top floor room, with a rooftop view of London and it did not disappoint. The room again was fresh and funky, with a very comfortable bed. I loved all the little extras in the bar and Nespresso machine. 

I arranged for dinner locally, so didn't try the restaurants (but will next time!!), but I did book into the Radio Rooftop bar, which as a resident you don't have a minimum spend, which I'm sure we spent over anyway, as the cocktails were very moreish! Again the staff at Radio were great and very friendly, which I find it sometimes refreshing in London. I think it was a dress code, but I loved the matching dresses, which I think were from Ted Baker.

Overall, we had a fab stay and will most likely book again if we're in that part of London.",5,2015,09,17
148,Outstanding stay,"Everything in this hotel had the wow factor from start to finish.
Have stayed in lots of hotels in London and never had an experience like this.
All the staff in th hotel were professional, polite and would do anything for you
Can't wait to return.",5,2015,09,16
148,Great Rooms,"Really enjoyed our stay. Room upgraded to one with balcony. Also roof top bar is excellent.

Staff very friendly & efficient.

Breakfast included was also 1st rate.

Great location & was very convienient to get to our theatre in west end.",5,2015,09,16
148,Great Stay,"I traveled with my 23 year old daughter and had a great 10 day stay.  When booking a hotel for Europe it can sometimes be hit or miss.  A lot of the hotel buildings are old and have a musty smell, odd layouts, weird bathrooms etc.  Not this hotel-it looked new and modern with great amenities.  I was a little concerned about road noise when I found out that we were on the second floor but the rooms were pretty sound proof with just a little noise during the day but it was quiet at night.  The room was clean and bright, bathroom was modern and open, great air conditioning, free wifi, all toiletries were furnished in the room-shaving cream, razors, lotions, shampoos, cleanser, toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs, shower caps, q-tips, make up remover pads etc-it was one of the most stocked hotel rooms I have ever been in.  There was also a Nespresso machine with coffee and tea and bottles of water and chocolates were delivered every night.  My daughter commented that it was bit like a Vegas hotel. I agree with a previous review that the halls are quite dark and it is a bit of a young person's hotel but it was still great and I would definitely stay here again.  The location was also good-easy to walk to Trafalgar Square, Southbank, Westminster, Leicester Square, Covent Garden, the theaters,  Charing Cross, Bloomsbury and Waterloo station.  We had wonderful service also, from the concierges (especially Arman), to the restaurant servers, check in staff, bellman etc.  Highly recommend!",5,2015,09,16
148,Unique and Modern Hotel,"I booked this hotel for my husband and i for a weekend getaway.  It didn't disappoint.  The design and furnishings is really stunning, modern and very different for anywhere else i have stayed. Check-in was easy and the staff were great, we had a complimentary glass of champagne at check-in.

I booked a standard room, but we were upgraded to a larger room...which was great.  It was very modern and a large room from the normal london hotel rooms.  The bathroom was open plan and modern.  The shower was very large.

While there we visited the Radio rooftop bar which has amazing views across London.  It's again really modern, its partially heated in the outdoor sections, with lots of seating.  There was also a DJ.  I would highly recommend this hotel, it is modern, luxurious and in a great location.",5,2015,09,15
148,Just love this hotel,"The ME definitely has the wow factor ! Stayed previously for a work launch event and loved it enough to return with my husband. Staff are without exception friendly and eager to help. Booked an Urban terrace room which has great views over London
 ( quite magical at night with the lights ). Breakfast in La Cucina was delicious with great hot options as well as the varied buffet. Definitely our first choice for a stay in London though not always within our budget.",5,2015,09,14
148,Organised an event at the ME Hotel...,"Just a massive thank you to your team for last week.  Your staff were amazing and the hospitality was spot on, I couldn‚Äôt of faulted it.
 
Barna and Lajos both went above and beyond to help our team.   Please send a huge thanks to everyone.  Customer service in this industry is huge and it helps a lot when an event is stressful to have great venue staff behind you to lend an extra helping hand.
 
All the waiting staff and cloakroom staff were also very friendly and helpful.

Thanks again Michelle for your help also ‚Äì it was a great event and the client was very happy.",4,2015,09,14
148,ME London,"I wish it was a bit lighter in the hallways. Also, I wish there were more closet place. Otherwise, my stay was perfect. The staff was courteous and helpful. The location is very good and I'd probably come back.

148,Avant-Garde,"I frequently travel to London on business and decided to try a cutting edge avant-garde hotel.  This is a great spot, it's a block from the River Thames and a short walk to  Covent Garden and Temple tube stations. Lots of goodies await you in your room.",5,2015,09,11
148,What an awesome hotel with staff to match.,"Having travelled extensively both for business and pleasure I have stayed in '5 star' hotels all over the world. I often find hotels are overrated and do not live up to their star rating. The ME hotel is certainly not one of these. Infact in my opinion it is the definition of a five star hotel. Modern throughout it maintains a constant and consistant feel of luxury and an atmosphere that is above anything else I‚Äôve experienced. From the staff to the music to the d√©cor. 

I found it utterly refreshing that there was a separate area away from the main lobby/reception to check in. With a structure something like the interior of a pyramid it feels/looks impressive. We were offered a cold drink as soon as we walked in, which after a long day travelling was perfect.  The female staff member that checked us in was so polite and helpful.

Our room really was something to behold, well appointed with huge comfy bed, a wonderful bathroom, fast WIFI, plug sockets exactly where you need them for phone/iPad charging at night. something simple but so many hotels get this wrong. My girlfriend enjoyed the high tech control panel for the lights and AC, which has a fun 'sexy' setting for dimming.

On our second night we had a drink and some food in the Radio Bar, this is an impressive place to enjoy a drink, with views right across London, its hard to think of a land mark you can‚Äôt see. The staff were helpful and service fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the Padron peppers. We ate breakfast both days and this was delicious with very good and prompt service. Full marks for the English breakfast.

All the staff we encountered during our stay were just wonderful but in particular the concierge Ronan, who I cant thank enough. He assisted us at least a couple of times during our stay and was genuinely fantastic.

A faultless hotel I will most certainly stay at again.",5,2015,09,10
148,Wow,"From the moment you are greeted by the concierge kerb side everything about this place oozes sophistication, expense and an eye for detail.
Perfectly located just off the strand an ideal base whether for business or pleasure ME London gets my vote!! ",4,2015,09,10
148,Cool,"Nice hotel, in an excellent location, walking distance from most of amazing restaurants, bar and theaters. Nice staff, special the concierge and the Cucina Asellina staff at breakfast. At the hotel we also find the excellent STK and Radio Bar rooftop. Really a good choice.",5,2015,09,09
148,Impressive hotel,"Great weekend away to this hotel which ticked all the customer service boxes.
Arriving to a glass of fizz and a smooth check in it started off well. The hotel bar downstairs was quiet and the opposite to the roof top bar. Unfortunately it was too full and every seat was reserved so we went for the quieter option. I would recommend reserving a table if you wanted to spend time in the rooftop bar which was very impressive. 
The staff throughout the hotel were pleasant and would help with anything you needed. 
ME is situated in the west end which is 2 minutes walk to Covent Garden and several theatres. There's lots of places to eat and drink around the hotel so we preferred to go out rather than dine at either restaurant in the hotel. 
We would definitely go back here for another top class weekend away!",5,2015,09,08
148,Contemporary ,"For a West End trip you can't beat the location of this wow factor hotel. Reception on the first floor a bit bizarre and not that we'll sign posted. Glass of bubbles on arrival nice touch. Rooms nice modern feel, TV hard to navigate, sliding blinds on the windows not the best design as too are the glazed doors to the bathroom which had come of the runners. ",4,2015,09,07
148,Amazing modern hotel with fantastic staff ,"This hotel is beautifully modern and in a great location near to Covent Garden 
We stayed on our wedding night and the staff could not have done more to make it so special;- prosecco upon arrival, cakes and messages in the room.  The room itself was sleek and stylish. 
The staff were so polite and nothing was to much trouble they really treat you like royalty 
Breakfast was really delicious and we will definitely be back to try the other restaurant
Me has now become our favourite hotel in London 
",5,2015,09,07
148,"Fantastic location, great rooms, a little too dark all black decor","The hotel is uber trendy
in a fantastic location
the rooms are great, although a little strange set out the bedroom on the small size but where the bathroom is massive, I would of preferred the other was round more room near the bed slightly smaller bathroom, great balcony overlooking Covent Garden
The reception area and check in area fantastic, but the corridors to the rooms no lighting very dark, you cant see anything
the roof top bar I thought we would use a lot, but it was terrible, all reserved seating, and its not for hotel guests only, people can come in from outside, we didn't use it after the first nights experience, a really let down",4,2015,09,07
148,Long Weekend in London,"Arrived Thursday through Sunday , Central location from everything. walking distance from Covent Garden. A true 5 star hotel , lovely modern decoration with top of the art room automation . Room service and personal are excellent , Dimitri in reception for anything you need , although all of them would help you no matter what. Room cleaning is 7/10 in my perspective but i am too picky so dunno about you. Roof top bar is one hell of a night to enjoy with great music . 
Breakfast is good , except on Saturdays since a lot people tend to come and waiters cant keep up , worth the extra 24 pounds ? yes !!! if you love eggs which they prepare in different masterful way . Finally price wise is a bit expensive but yet again this is London and that's normally what you pay for a 5 star hotel . Highly recommended and will definitely stay again .",5,2015,09,06
148,Great stay in the center of London,"I have stayed at the ME London for two nights in July.  I had a nice experience at this hotel.

The hotel itself and the rooms were modern and spacious. The bed was also comfortable. I did like the fact that I had a balcony in my room.

The vibe of this hotel is not the most relaxing and I think it might not please everyone. There is a few restaurants and bars in the hotel therefore there is constantly partygoers in the lobby in the evening.  There is a nice terrasse/ bar on the rooftop that gets pretty busy on the weekends.

The location was perfect and it was easy to walk to nearby restaurants / shopping. 

The only negative point I would bring is the concierge recommendations were not the best. Plus, one night they gave us directions to get to a restaurant, and it was so unclear that we ended up walking for 40 minutes and never did end up finding the restaurant. 

I would go back to this hotel, but I would probably choose an hotel with a different vibe during my next stay in London.",4,2015,09,06
148,Out of this world birthday treat,"As a treat for a 22nd and 21st Birthday we indulged in staying at the ME London. From the moment of checking in we were treated like royalty, a complimentary glass of prosecco as we checked in early. Our room was prepared quickly and our bags were taken to our room by concierge. We were over the moon to be upgraded to a MODE room which was a real highlight to our stay.
The room was modern, spacious and everything you might possibly need inside. We enjoyed the mood lighting, floor to ceiling window and bathroom amenities. One disappointment was the television, after 2 calls to reception and 2 visits from the maintenance we could still not listen to a full song without it turning off. Although the hotel were very apologetic, I would hope this technical issue is not present on my next visit. Unfortunately we were not asked upon checkout if everything was satisfactory, otherwise I would have passed comment.
However, the AURA team certainly outdid themselves for our turndown service, celebratory messages left on the bathroom mirror was a personalised touch, as well as nibbles and water. We also received a complimentary cocktail voucher for that evening that we enjoyed in the STK bar.

If you are looking for an experience for someone special or a special occasion, you will be mind blown by this hotel. They go out of their way to ensure you have a fabulous stay, and we certainly will never forget our experience there! I hope to return in the very near future.",5,2015,09,05
148,Very modern hotel in great location,"Stayed for 2 nights last weekend for the bank holiday. The interior of the hotel is stunning although I found the very dark corridors and bright white rooms played havoc with my migraine! The glass of bubbly on check in is a lovely touch but didn't welcome the hard sell to upgrade our room. We had booked a Vibe room which was on the sixth floor, primarily as the description stated it had a lounge. This was not the case - it had 2 chairs in front of the window! Lovely big bathroom and very comfy bed. We went out for the day on Sunday, leaving at 11am and returning at 6pm to find the room hadn't been serviced. We had put the green clean room sign in the door as we left. Called reception to ask for some fresh towels so we could get ready to go out for the night. 2 ladies from housekeeping came and knocked on the door and basically argued with me about why they hadn't cleaned the room. They were adamant we hadn't put the green sign on the door and basically called me a liar!! Not at all impressed with this level of service from a 5 star hotel!! It's a shame as this spoiled our opinion of the hotel. Wasnt wowed by the radio roof bar. Pictures make it look fantastic but it wasn't anything special but STK on the other hand was fantastic. Overall a very good hotel , in a great location.",4,2015,09,05
148,Modern hotel with great rooms,"The decor of the hotel is really different but I was very impressed by it! Very modern and trendy. We were treated to a glass of prosecco on arrival. Check in staff were very friendly. My room was on the first floor which I was a bit nervous about at first as next to reception and near the roads but I couldn't heard a single sound for my entire stayed, actually one of the quietest rooms I've ever stayed in. The room itself was fab with everything you need. Great toiletries, lovely big bathroom and the most amazing pillows! The rooftop bar has fantastic views. I also made use of the gym which had a good range of equipment (all with TVs) as well as towels, fruit and bottled water.",5,2015,09,04
148,AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,"No doubt a beautiful hotel to look at with very luxurious interior, however the service was appalling. Took me an hour to get my bag to my room, they told me they'd bring it I ended up literally having to go down and get it myself from a closet? Room service took 40 minutes and was cold when it came. Really wouldn't recommend. 

On a lighter note, thank you to the amazing Sergio, who was one of the only helpful members of staff we encountered, amazing.",1,2015,09,04
148,Terrific hotel with one word of caution,"Our stay of four days was mostly very, very good. Unfortunately, there were a few negative items (one which, with a little effort, could be remedied. More on that later).

On the positive side, we loved the contemporary styling and unique architecture inside the hotel. Not your traditional London hotel. Every single member of the staff that we met could not have been more helpful. From the doorman to the concierge to the reception personnel, they were all very attentive and polite to a fault. Our room, which we ended up in after having to relocate (more later) was great. Two sinks, shower for two, adequate closet and very comfortable bed.

We visited the roof top bar on two occasions. It has great view, cocktails, good service and casual food. If you want a quiet, relaxed time up there, be sure to check with the concierge beforehand with the concierge for because it can get VERY LOUD at times if there is a special event.

The negative that could be remedied was the housekeeping service. On two occasions, there was no turn down service. On another occasion, turn down was provided for just one person. On another occasion, we returned for our day out and about at 16:30 to find that our room had not been cleaned. These things, I'm certain, could be improved with a little effort.

The one negative that could be problematic is the issue of noise from the roof top club vibrating down to the rooms. On our first night, we were awaked by the thumping bass from the VERY LOUD music at the roof top club even though were on the 8th floor, 2 floors below the club. We requested a room change and, to the managment's credit, they quickly relocated us down 2 more floors and provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne for our troubles, which was very thoughtful. After that, there were no noise issues. If not for the noise, hotel would have received 5 stars.

I would highly recommend this hotel but would forewarn you to make sure you are not above the 6th or 7th floor.",4,2015,09,04
148,superb hotel,"I have stayed in a lot of hotels over recent years but this is by far the best, the room was amazing and the staff were very friendly and always ready to help.I would recommend this hotel for anyone trying to make their partner feel special.
      ",5,2015,09,02
148,Luxurious perfection!,"This was our second stay at this hotel and we weren't disappointed.  It is pricey but for a special occasion I'd say it's worth it.  The rooms are gorgeous, as are the public areas.  I love the dark ambience of the corridors.  It just gives the whole place an opulent feel about it.  Some probably wouldn't appreciate it but we love it!
      ",5,2015,09,01
148,"cool rooms, great location","Stayed at the ME on the last night of a 10 night trip to England and Scotland with my family (wife, 3 teenaged kids).  I booked it because my 13 year old likes modern hotels and after a week in the very remote Highlands I figured we should have a bit of a different experience.  This is not a hotel for everyone, it's very contemporary, which is evident on entry.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  We arrived on the night train from Inverness at around 9am and they were able to get us into one of our rooms, which was very welcome.  The hallways are dark, which takes a bit of getting used to, but it's a neat effect.  The rooms are good sized for London, we had an aura and vibe room, big beds, up to date electronics.  The bathrooms are large and have nice amenities including a big shower and nice toiletries.  Our only complaint was the noise from the next room(they were having a party late into the night).  We called and complained and they sent up security, which stopped the problem for a while, but I think as they drank more, they got louder again.  The doors to the rooms are really thick and the party goers kept knocking which woke us up, maybe doorbells on the next renovation would help.  Certainly not the hotels fault.  The staff apologized at check out, which was a nice acknowledgement.   Overall we had a very pleasant stay.",5,2015,08,31
148,Amazing soon as you walk in.,This hotel was amazing. Service was second to none. A special mention needs to go to Roberto in the radio bar. His service was excellent. He always made sure we were ok and kept our glasses topped up. In fact ever member of staff were polite and helpful. We had an amazing time and would like to thank Me hotel for our gift it was much appreciated. Would definitely stay here again. We had room 808 and the views were great from the balcony,5,2015,08,31
148,"Very modern, upscale hotel","We could equate this room to one offered at the SLS Las Vegas; very modern and sexy. Also the crowd at the Radio Bar are beautiful! I was shocked. This is a very good pick for a young, hip couple in the 25-45 age range.",5,2015,08,30
148,Dreadful!,"I'm not a negative reviewer but in this occasion I'm very upset.....Arrogant staff that believe they're in the ""matrix"" movies. I had 3 foreign customers visiting. 1 German with Parkinson's disease and we were bullied out of the bar as the concierge believed he was drunk. Tried to explain and security were called. Corridors so dark you can't see where your room is. Coded keys only work once hence every time you leave the room you have to have new keys coded. Do yourself a favour and stay at the Taj on Buckingham Gate. I will never return to this hotel. Hope the place closes soon.",1,2015,08,28
148,"Lovely stay,lovely room!","Excellent experience at the Me London,stayed just for one night with my college in a short business trip and we were very impressed with the excellence in service provided by all staff,we will definitely return to experience some more of the hotel and room details and incomparable standards,remembered one concierge associate Cosmin that did his best to accommodate us,thank you!",5,2015,08,28
148,Excellent Facilities & Excellent Staff,"A special occasion deserves a special hotel to spend the night in & this is exactly what we got ! 
The quality of both the facilities & the staff are second to none !
This was our second visit & it definitely wont be our last !
      
      ",5,2015,08,27
148,Stylish stay,"We stayed four nights in the ME Hotel London and liked it a lot. We were looking for something modern and cool and the hotel fits the bill perfectly. The room was confortable with a large king-size bed. Although situed on the 2nd floor and close to the busy street, the room was very quiet thanks to the soundproof windows. The bathroom is very modern with a nice rainbow shower. The only downside was the a/c which seemed to work at random. There's a hip rooftop bar which serves great drinks and tapas. We didn't use the restaurants, though, since there a nice places in the neighborhood. The hotel is very centrally and conventiently located in the middle of the theatre district and only about 10 walking minutes away from Leicester Sq and Picadilly. In short, if you favor a stylish, out of the common place, look no further",4,2015,08,26
148,AMAZING!! Best hotel we've stayed in!,My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. ME did not disappoint. The hotel is classy and modern and the staff are beyond helpful. There is nothing we can fault about our stay. I recommeneded the hotel to a friend before we even checked out. The restaurant STK is a must as well as the Radio rooftop bar. It has to be said that our stay was made extra special by Nicky! From the moment I made contact she was so so helpful! Nicky helped with extra treats for our room which included a personal note from herself which was a lovely touch. Thank you for everything Nicky it was all much appreciated! We will see you all again soon! Great hotel!,5,2015,08,26
148,40th Birthday celebration,"Fab hotel for special ocasions, Radio Bar has amazing views but make sure you book it gets vey busy and you can only stay for a couple of hours.. Hotel is very dark inside so make sure you take advantage of the very helpful staff otherwise you will get lost.. You need room key to operate the lifts and there is seperate lift to the Radio Bar.. Drinks pricy but that is expected as it is London.. Rooms are very nice with wonderful comfortable beds",5,2015,08,26
148,ME London,"Very good hotel, great location and great service too. From the moment you check in you are made to feel special and not just another guest. The restaurant STK is fab and funky and reasonably priced. The radio bar is really cool and chic and the views are fabulous.",4,2015,08,26
148,Stunning modern hotel..,"This hotel is amazing, we have been here 3 times and just love it. It is now our go to hotel if we visit London. From the moment you walk in you are greeted with amazing sights and smells (it smells amazing in there I wish I knew what it was!) where you check in is an amazing high slanted roof with a projection on it. Staff were very welcoming. Each time we have gone we have had a gorgeous room. We even bought our dogs a present as there was a great mini bar where you can buy all sorts of things!",5,2015,08,25
148,AMAZING! ,"Stayed for one night Saturday 22nd August as a surprise for my girlfriends 30th. Booked an Energy Urban Room as the balcony sounded appealing. 

On arrival the excellent concierge took our bags and escorted us to the 1st floor reception where we were greeted with a complementary glass of prosecco and a free room upgrade to the Energy River Room with a balcony overlooking the Thames, amazing views of Tower Bridge by night, the Shard, London Eye and Trafalgar Square!  Room itself was out of this world and had the comfiest bed I have slept in for a long while. Too many other treats and facilities to list. 

Special mention to the concierge team who I spoke with prior to our visit and asked them to arrange a picnic and hamper for me to collect on check out. What they came up with was far beyond what I expected and just goes to show the high levels of customer service at the hotel. 

I have no hesitation recommending and we will be staying here again! ",5,2015,08,25
148,Always my first choice of Hotel in London,"This review is overdue as I have stayed at ME London numerous times and have just booked another stay in September. I have always stayed on the 8th floor in an Energy River Terrace room (816 I believe) and everything about this hotel outshines all others in its price bracket.
The location on the Strand is ideal for access to all areas of London, taxi's are easy to come by, and if like me you drive to the Hotel you can simply leave your car at the entrance and it is parked securely until you leave.
Every member of staff I have come across are more than approachable, and explained the layout of the Hotel and all it has to offer. Reservations for the fantastic STK restaurant and Radio bar are quickly made and we use both on each stay (separate reviews).
The two main reasons I stay at the ME are the deco of the hotel which is modern and exciting, and the view from the balcony provided when you stay in an Energy River Terrace room. The black marble and sharp lines are a theme throughout the hotel from the entrance, to the lifts and throughout the corridors. It really does have a much slicker and more impressive feel (not to mention smell) than other London hotels. Perhaps if you are looking for an old fashioned ""typical english"" hotel it will not suit your needs..
You are greeted with a glass of prosecco in the ultra modern Reception whilst you check in which is a great way to start.
Housekeeping are fantastic, during a four day stay in July the room was always spotless, minibar full and bathroom gleaming. The bathrooms by the way are great, a sliding door separates it from the bedroom in my experience with a powerful shower and good quality amenities.
The views from the private balcony overlook the Thames, London Eye, the City and many more sights and even though the air con is more than sufficient it provides a great way to cool down in the summer months.
We have used room service on each stay and whether it was for breakfast, a dinner from the STK menu or champagne, the service has been quick, great food and everything that we requested was there.
Overall it is a fantastic hotel, more enjoyable each time you stay!",5,2015,08,25
148,Amazing hotel - Amazing service,"Having just spent one night at ME London - I have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. The service and friendliness of staff was just amazing, check in was the easiest I have ever experienced - within 5 minute we were in the room.

Now to the room - Stunning, everything about the room wanted us to stay inside, the attention to detail was on top form.

We are already planning our next trip to London and without a doubt we will be visiting ME again.",5,2015,08,25
148,Favourite hotel in the world! ,"ME London has to be one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. From the modern interior to the helpful staff it is brilliant. You are welcomed with open arms and a glass of champagne whilst you wait to check in. We have stayed here a couple of times and we keep going back for more. They always remember us and leave little sweets and notes for when we enter our room. 
The room is modern and spacious and just generally gorgeous, the room has different lighting and a large TV on the wall. We have a Melia rewards membership so we have been to a few Melia hotels but this is by far our favourite. 
The hotel also has a beautiful roof top bar which overlooks the London skyline and is enjoyable to go for a drink. Whilst you are staying at the hotel you have free access to the rooftop and you also have free access to wifi. 
I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel as it ticks all of the boxes! We can't wait to get back.",5,2015,08,24
148,Stunning hotel,"The hotel is absolutely stunning, the attention to detail was amazing.

We stayed in room 909 and had a huge balcony.

The rooftop bar is the place to be seen, but I would suggest booking a table even just for drinks.

The location is great.

Would definitely recommend ME London - very stylish!",5,2015,08,24
148,Highly recommended ,"Beautiful hotel and friendly staff 
Great drinks menu 
Radio rooftop bar is cool and very good at night , great cocktail menu
Food is really good , had the hake , was a little over cooked , other than that highly recommend a stay here especially with friends and leisure trip ",4,2015,08,24
148,"Great venue, convenient location and super staff","My wife and I stayed for 1 night to celebrate our wedding anniversary with a night out in the city. We were met by the Assistant Front of House Manager, Kenya Santiago. Kenya made sure our stay was extra special and we can't thank her enough! :-)",5,2015,08,23
148,Wonderful Hotel,Have previously visited the rooftop bar and was so impressed stayed here for my birthday and was blown away. Welcomed with a glass of bubbles lovely touch of birthday card and chocs in room and a free drink in the restaurant which looked amazing and will definitely eat there next time we stay. Wonderful experience thank you,5,2015,08,23
148,"Stunning hotel, excellent staff for a wonderful experience.","Me and my girlfriend went to London for not the first time in our lives, but I would definitely consider it the best one. 
At first we were trying to book a room, as we used to do, in one of the Hilton's, but then a very friend of mine suggested us to book at ME LONDON.
It was a great suggestion as we spent the best time in London ever.
Located just next to the center (tube zone 1), near by Covent Garden.
In a very modern set, the Hotel itself is amazing, the rooms are higly furnited with luxury elements, as the loungebar at the rooftop is.
But, what made our experience unforgettable were the recommendations of the concierge Emiliano Del Pizzo, about tours, places and restaurants we've never experienced before.

Definitely the best Hotel and service in London.",5,2015,08,20
148,Winter Break,"We booked the ME hotel on line, for 2 nights as a birthday celebration.
Check in was efficient, although our room was not ready, despite a request for an early check in.  In any event, we left our luggage and went our sightseeing.  The room on our return was ready, but it was quite disappointing - very small, and our neighbours were quite noisy both early afternoon and later in the night! 
We dined in the Cucina restaurant that evening, and whilst pleasant, was probably a little bit pricey for what you got.
The big plus point was the staff - particularly Charlotte in front bar.  They were all exceptionally professional.
The only down side of the weekend was the room!",5,2015,08,20
148,1 night stay @ ME,"Staff very attentive to our needs and impressed by the service we received! Location was ideal, did not get time to use any of the Bars or Restaurants has only stayed the 1 night but would defiantly visit again.

148,I have extremely high expectations and you exceeded them....,"I wanted to write to thank you both for your OUTSTANDING service in helping me to arrange my husbands birthday weekend at Me London.

We both had the most memorable of weekends and you truly made sure my husband's birthday was extra special. 

You both went above and beyond the call of duty and exceeded my expectations, right from the very moment Nicole welcomed me on my initial planning visit and then Catherine greeted us on the day of our stay.

 I will be delighted to return to Me London and recommend your work.",5,2015,08,18

148,Welcome to the Future!,"Stayed over past weekend with my wife celebrating our wedding engagement being one of our target hotels to visit specially after our visit at the Most Wanted and Hard to Be There(in a challenging way,good clientele selection which made us feel very comfortable),high standards services and highly technology equipped hotel with an amazing design,see below:
-to start with proper 5*quality service we were driving @ to find the parking,hard as the hotel entrance has a taxi rank in front and we asked the doorman where to live our car,as simple as on the taxi rank we were told as for drop off or pick up is it ok,fast communicating with the hotel valet he showed up while we introduce ourselves and took over our car to the parking(big thanks to Cosmin - The Doorman for sorting us out).
-our bags were taken over at the hotel's concierge and then we were escorted to The Recepion on the first floor-WoW,I felt unbalanced by the height,dark/dimmed lights all @
in a black marble pyramid with a glass of fizz upon checking in,which was very smooth as they new We're arriving.
-few minutes after,we arrived to our room(the trip to the room...like an journey to the unknown...again cool dimmed lights corridor/labyrinth)of course not by our self but with an great young man,Ignacio witch offer us a room show round,hidden doors opened from the White leather walls nice minibar selection,great 90 degrees window with astonishing views of London,
-best of is the light control panel,like an small ipad,giving you control over the AC and lights,another WoW-Sexy Light?.. seriously...I will install this at home cause my misses was so happy...getting back to earth we were invited back to see the concierge for best restaurant suggestions.
-@ the concierge we meet Emiliano and Rury,and asked for a nice stake house they suggest us to try the one in house STK...no words...unbeatable....promise to be back and review....need to go!
Enjoyed 100%,Tks to all,housekeeping specially!",5,2015,08,18

Thank you all for making this one of the most memorable days of our lives: special thanks to Guacimara, Maria Marco, Catherine from Aura and every single staff member of Me London, we were truly spoilt in one of the most modern 5 stars hotels in London, attention to detail best rate too ! Couldn't be more impressed by our whole experience , thank you.",5,2015,08,17
148,We were made to feel very special,"It was our first time at this hotel, I stayed in a Mode room with my 2 daughters on Saturday night, it was a surprise treat for them, we could have chosen any London Hotel and if I could choose again I would choose ME London again, it was superb. The staff were amazing, we were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The hotel itself is quite beautiful, very modern, the room was incredible, my kids loved the changing light colours and the lovely d√©cor. We ate in the Radio Bar at lunchtime and had a drink in the STK bar in the evening and we had  breakfast in cucina asellina. The food, drink and service were fantastic.",5,2015,08,17

148,Exceptional ,"If you are looking for a hotel with contemporary luxury in London, then look no further. From the minute you arrive, you are shrouded in stunning Norman Foster architecture. The staff are impeccable, the facilities are superb, the bars and restaurants offer different atmospheres and choices throughout the day. This hotel is a real modern masterpiece. ",5,2015,08,16
148,A surprise for my girls!,"My daughter had just spent 19nights touring Europe on a Contiki tour...after staying in ""hovels"" her words not mine, I decided to surprise her and her friend with 3nights at ME, in London, I had read all the reviews and thought our usual hotel in Mayfair was a little boring, so this checked the trendy boxes..do they use that word anymore? Anyway the girls liked it..they didn't gush over it..although I did receive a snapchat of the lighting console that had a setting for ""Sexy Lighting"" or something like that...they were amused..on probing more, oh it has dark corridors, and they won't let you see the up-stairs bar view as it has a strict dress code, and a private lift..I wish I had of known that, much is made on the website of the view, and I thought that view would be something to just love, the girls were on the second floor overlooking the road, the room was just ok, and they weren't impressed that on checkin they had their credit card blocked for 400pounds even though it was pre-paid, yes its happened to me at other hotels but I never thought of it before as a problem, but if your credit card limit is low then its a problem...oh if you like flashy then maybe this is your hotel, but hardly charming.",4,2015,08,14
148,Moderen British Royalty ,This place is as Moderen as it comes and if you call the front desk for anything it is done immediately which I was really impressed. The location is in the Heart of London. The bathroom products they supply you with is British Luxury. And the Shower is the real deal this Hotel is definitely 5 star & is worth the price they ask for. ,5,2015,08,14
148,I don¬¥t get it but some of my friends did,My friends raved about this place. The coolest lobby etc. My upgrade was not worth it compared to my other room. The food was at best average in the restaurant. My best memory from this hotel is having fun with my friends.,3,2015,08,13
148,Five Stars for both business and pleasure,"Stayed at the ME for 13 nights on business. Went in with high expectations which were all met. It's a very unique property with an amazing, welcoming staff and there is a digital mapping/projection show in the lobby each day (with complementary champagne) that should not be missed. With a surprise around every corner, in my opinion it's a better experience/value than the Savoy.

Location/General Upkeep: 5/5 - Great central location. Brand new, frequently polished in all ways. The location is within walking distance to Covent Garden shops and a 10 minute walk to Waterloo station for any countryside daytrips you have in mind. Plenty of pubs and diverse restraunts (albeit mostly touristy) within a few blocks. 

Staff Attentiveness: 5/5. It's as if there's an internal daily contest of who can be the most helpful. Concierge, bellhops, check-in agents - everyone inquires as to your day's plan and tries to make a helpful suggestion to improve your London Experience. 

Room Appointments:5/5 - Nice firm beds, tight carpet, huge bathrooms (even in the smallest rooms) with amazing rain showers. Sound proofing was good though on the lower floors I did hear of some complaints from the 1st (ground) floor nightclub. Excellent toiletries that were replaced often.

Ancillary Services: 5/5 - Enjoyable experiences with room service, laundry service, concierge (for dinner and tea reservations) and made the most of the rooftop bar, which has an amazing unobstructed view of London and large outdoor patio for when the bar itself fills up. Drinks were expertly made. STK restaurant on the ground floor was also excellent. I look forward to the daily breakfast which was included in my room rate, again with excellent servers/restaurant staff.

Elevators: 5/5 - Although the check in desk is not on the ground floor, and the hotel seemed to be quite full during my stay, I never found myself waiting more than 30 seconds for a carriage. Well done!",5,2015,08,12
148,Funky Hotel in Superb Central London location,"Recently stayed at this property for a 2 night break. Very impressed with the modern look and feel of the hotel and the service was great.
The reception area was a sight to behold. VERY cool!

Vibe Room was spacious and bright with mood lighting and modern amenities.
Free WiFi was provided.

Rooftop bar provided exceptional views over the City set to a buzzing atmosphere.

Location is perfect for business or pleasure.

148,Amazing Luxury Hotel,"We spent one night at this super cool and contempory hotel . Cutting edge design greets you at every turn , a must for those seeking an ultra modern hotel . We booked a Chic Suite and pre arranged through special events manager Nikki to have a special mirror message for my husband , bottle of snort and chocolate dipped stawberries Check in was quick and smooth , a welcoming glass of Bubbly and we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a large suite with amazing views and bath big enough for a party !! I have to make a special mention to Nikki who went the extra mile for us both pre arrival and at departure and the customer service  she displayed was second to none . We had a table booked in Radio , what a fantastic night we had with friends in there . My only small teeny weeny complaint was that our room service breakfast and coffees were cold when they arrived but this was rectified with a phone call We shall definately return to this hotel and highly recommend it !! ",5,2015,08,11
148,Nice hotel!,I booked this hotel for my girlfriends birthday and it didn't disappoint. Room was large and unique. It had a balcony which offered great views of London. Our room was directly blow the bar on the rooftop and despite being so near we did not hear a thing. We had very little interaction with the staff. We were checked in shown to our room straight away and checked out easily. They seemed very polite.,4,2015,08,10
148,Still my favourite hotel,"We have stayed in numerous hotels in London but this is still my favourite.  There are a couple of things I could say that would put off some fussy people but this place is so beautiful and the staff are lovely that the small things don't matter at all.  The rooms are modern, clean and have all the amenities you could want (although we requested an iron from reception and it wasn't great quality but it really is minimal).  Previously we had a suite when we stayed but this time we had a standard room with a balcony.  The weather was perfect so being on the balcony felt like we were abroad with amazing views of London.  Thanks very much for yet another lovely stay :)",5,2015,08,10
148,Fantastic place,"Our stay here was amazing, we only spent one night which is a shame as it was such a great experience. When you arrive and you check in in the spectacular lobby you are handed a glass of prosecco by the extremely friendly and helpful staff. The room is perfect, well decorated and I can't think of a single criticism in that regard.  The only minor thing we had a problem was with the rooftop bar, as spectacular as it is, it was very busy and we couldn't find a seat. It was a hot day in June so that's to be expected anywhere in London though so I won't hold it against an otherwise perfect stay.",5,2015,08,09
148,A-freaking-mazing!,"As soon as you walk into the hotel, oh my gosh the lobby / check in area! It's super cool and mesmerizing! 

The man who checked us in was very polite, explained the details about the hotel and surrounding areas. 

The room was incredible! I think I spend a good 25 minutes playing with the different light settings! 

Spotless, very well thought out, bed very comfortable. 

The balcony was amazing to sit out on and just enjoy the view. 

Super place! Hope to stay here again when I adventure back to England! :)

Strongly recommend!",5,2015,08,08
148,Perfect Valentine's getaway,"My boyfriend booked this amazing hotel through the Secret Escapes website for one night as a Valentine's weekend away in London. As we are only young travellers (he is 18 and I was 16 at the time) and it is a very classy establishment frequented by businessmen, socialites etc. I was subconsciously expecting maybe slightly patronising or inattentive service but we did not experience this at all, the staff really helped to make our short stay wonderful and relaxing. Prosecco on arrival and little heart shaped chocolates left out for us on the bed were just little touches that really made the experience so special. Our room was perfect, could not fault it and we especially liked the 'sexy' lighting feature. The architecture and design of the whole hotel is incredible, and the building itself is well situated on the strand, not far from Covent Garden. We had breakfast in their Cucina Asellina and it was of a very high standard (so delicious!) and very nicely decorated. Would happily return and would love to visit ME hotels elsewhere on the globe!",5,2015,08,07
148,Incredible stay,"After returning from our honeymoon at ME Ibiza, we booked an overnight stay to treat our parents at ME London. 

Although ME Ibiza was pretty impressive, ME London smashes it in every way possible; service, staff, room size & facilities, d√©cor, price - everything.

We were greeted by glass's of Prosecco in a stunning reception area and check in was very friendly and quick. The whole building is decorated to perfection and is incredibly modern and chic. We had a table at Radio Bar at the top of the building which had a brilliant atmosphere early evening and fantastic views over the city.

The rooms were spacious and again so smart, the in ceiling speakers and other facilities really topped it off.

A massive thank you to all the staff, mentioning Catherine and especially Mr Marley that we missed during our stay in Ibiza, we had the best weekend and cannot recommend this place enough, we hope to be returning soon!",5,2015,08,07
148,ME - London,"A most enjoyable stay - great location, excellent staff.  Some little things need ironing out, wanted to have breakfast in hotel but was not told where and when this was possible and didnt find out till day we were leaving - still plenty of cafes etc outside of hotel.  Big room with plenty of space and bed is extremely comfortable. Receptionist a bit heavy handed trying to get us to upgrade our room when checking in - overall very enjoyable - we have just discovered the Melia Group of hotels this year and its the first chain we now look at when we are travelling.",4,2015,08,07
148,ME hotel,"Stayed here on 6th July for my boyfriends 40th birthday. Could not fault it, stunning hotel and really friendly staff.

Great experience all round and lovely meal at the stk restaurant with lovely staff! ",5,2015,08,06
148,Very Very Good,"Loved the place and the interior design is out of this world. Fantastic Location within easy access of many of the great London attractions. It is a high end hotel that it deserves that tag, we would definitely go again  
      ",5,2015,08,06
148,Loving our posh hotel,"Our first time to stay at this hotel & we will definitely go back and choose ME anywhere in the world! Great service, nice ambiance, very cozy and lovely people. I miss this place already. I could stay here all day and night, relaxing and listening to music if only I don't need to go on tours. I have chosen the best modern, luxury hotel in London! We're planning to take our kids already in the next 2 years. See you again soon! üëçüèº",5,2015,08,06
148,Service with a smile,"We toyed and toyed with where to stay for our night in London and eventually settled on Me. A great location, easy access to everything one needs. Check in was a breeze and the reception staff were exceptionally welcoming. The glass of bubbles was a nice added extra. Room was a great size, excellent shower and one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in. Radio bar great, outside tables are at a premium but after speaking to yo staff they found us a table for the 90 mins we were there and it was great. A great stay, and we will be back!",5,2015,08,05
148,Wow!  Just Wow!,"We had the most incredible stay at the ME!  From the moment we walked in the door, to the time we left, we were treated like platinum members.  The room was super clean and was prepared with a lovely bucket of champagne and fresh flowers for our celebration.   The concierge was so helpful and everything he recommended was spot on delish!   I would recommend anyone to stay at this incredible hotel if you want to be in the heart of the town and be treated like a Hollywood star!",5,2015,08,05
148,Excellent!,"Such a great hotel, the staff are brilliant, especially Caroline in sales who went above and beyond to ensure my group had a fantastic stay! Rooms & the facilities are great. Nothing is too much trouble and I would definitely recommend for leisure and business stays. 10/10",5,2015,08,05
148,Great stay totally worth it,"Stayed at the Me hotel London with 2 kids. Room wasn't too big but we had a king bed plus a sofa bed which worked out perfect ...bathrooms awesome actually loved the shower sperate cubicle awesome rain shower unit ... 
Staff very friendly and polite concierge ready to help at all times even when we walked in at like midnight getting Warm milk for the kids no issues ..

Most of all clean and brand new hotel am definitely impressed and will probably book with them again... Oh the breakfast menu was delicious limited stuff on the buffet so we ordered from the menu French toast and poached eggs on avacado delicious..has air conditioning as well for when its hot ... 
So if ur looking to book in London I definitely recommend this place ..",5,2015,08,04
148,50th birthday,"Massive thanks to all at this fabulous  hotel,  from the minute  we stepped foot in there they made us feel special,  our children had arranged for us to stay here and go to the theatre. The rooms are lovely bed was massive view amazing, they even left a birthday message, chocolates   and card for my  husband which made him smile. Hotel is so central to everything would definitely  recommend  this hotel. Our thanks to Nicki who made our stay a memorable one.",5,2015,08,04
148,Lovely hotel but service lacking,"The hotel was lovely and in a great location. Rooms were clean and beautiful. HOWEVER we only stayed there so we could use the beautiful roof top bar which on the 3 nights we stayed was completely packed due to the beautiful weather. On the first night we were just told the bar was ""full"" and that was it so we went else where (the staff were very snotty). We were not told we could actually reserve  a table for the next night! On the next night we were again told the bar was full but this time insisted we go and have a look. After taking a look we decided to tell staff we were actually staying at the hotel as it was obvious most of the current customers were not. This made no difference what so ever and to be honest the staff were extremely rude about it. Choosing to seat non hotel guests (or their own friends) over a number of hotel guests stood in the queue. At this time we were told we could reserve a table for the next night which we did. When we got there the next night we were given the worst table possible which was inside with no view. It wasn't even a 'reserved table' just an empty table that no one wanted to it sit at. This was very frustrating as a lot of tables outside were empty the entire 30 mins we were there; obviously waiting for more important non hotel customers. 
Very disappointing service and experience.",3,2015,08,04
148,ME London,"Fantastic and very cool hotel.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The roof top bar is definately worth a visit.  We were given a lovely glass of fizz on arrival and the staff were always around and on hand when required.

148,"ME London, perfect","We stayed here for my girlfriends birthday, we had champagne,roses and a mirror message, it was perfect, the best hotel ive stayed in in London. Christelle and her team did an amazing job! The best hotel in London!!!",5,2015,08,03
148,Amazing Views,Superb hotel on the Strand.  From the moment you arrive the attention to detail is amazing.  Staff were extremely welcoming and helpful particularly reception staff.  We stayed on the 9th floor and had a river view together with views of the Shard and the London Eye.  The room was spotless and the bed has to be the most comfortable I've found in a hotel.  The bathroom was spacious and had a waterfall shower and the lighting etc was controlled by a touch screen next to the bed - really easy to use.  We had an amazing stay and I can't wait to return.,5,2015,08,03
148,Unbelievable Service!!!,"I have just returned home from staying a night here. The hotel itself was incredible, so clean, modern and everything I could have dreamed of.

However I have to highlight the service that we received. After proposing on Saturday morning I wanted the hotel to be perfect, and it was. We were looked after by Elena and Nicky who booked everything for me and the effort that they made to make my fianc√© feel special was invaluable.

They made the weekend really special and I can not recommend the hotel and staff highly enough. They were amazing!!

Thanks you.
Mr and Future Mrs Shardlow",5,2015,08,03
148,This is a cool hotel in a fantastic London location,"The hotel is very modern hotel with a very cool trendy exterior and interior. The rooms are funky.
The bar is brilliant, as being quirky, open and great place for people watching.
Located in Leicester square you are in the middle of a very busy London location with china town round the corner.",5,2015,08,02
148,Another Great Stay,"This was my third stay at the ME all for business.  I love the location.  Being on the Strand and all the hustle and bustle of the area is great.  Being near Covent Garden is a plus.  Only a 15 minute taxi ride to the business district makes for an easy trip to take care of business meetings. 
The rooms are top notch.  Beds are super comfortable.  The bathrooms are spacious with double sinks and a walk in shower with a waterfall shower head.  
Mini bar and all the snacks are well stocked.  
The touch screen next to the bed that controls the lights and air conditioner is awesome.   Easy to use and son convenient.   
Only annoyance on all three trips is the TV interface.  It always frustrates me.  It's slow and unresponsive sometimes.  I did email with the manager and they said they are going to be updated the system that controls the interface.  I'm looking forward to my next trip to check it out.  
",5,2015,08,02
148,Disappointing,"Had been really looking forward to this holiday to celebrate our wedding anniversary but came away disappointed that it wasn't quite the amazing experience we expected it to be. It got off to a bad start when I emailed the Hotel before arrival concerning reserving a table at Radio and didn't receive an answer.

The property seems to get mixed up as to whether it's a hotel with a rooftop bar or whether the hotel is a by-product of the rooftop bar.  Everything about Radio seems to take priority, right down to us being ordered out of a lift by a very rude male member of staff.  The lift we were in was one of the hotel lifts but the staff obviously decided Radio was taking preference and that two lifts should be running to Radio to accommodate the TOWIE and Made in Chelsea wannabes. This left one lift for the entire hotel.

The room we stayed in had a balcony which faced towards the general direction of the Thames, however you couldn't actually see the river.  Great views of the side of the London Eye and the Shard.  The room was very nice, however cleanliness wasn't great.  We had used two cocktail glasses and these weren't replaced with clean glasses.  It was obvious they had been wiped with cloths as you could see the smear marks on the glass.

As a five star hotel which prides itself on customer service we didn't witness any staff going the extra mile.  We asked for a Hibiki 17 year old whiskey in Marconi Lounge and they wouldn't bring it from STK restaurant to us yet we ordered a Hennesey Paradis which was on the Marconi menu and the barman had to go elsewhere to get it.  

We dined in STK which is reviewed separately.

We did love the Essence of Me throughout the Hotel and the beds were really comfortable. The location was great for Covent Garden and Somerset House which has a lovely terrace on the Thames side which was great for relaxing with a glass of champagne. 

We probably wouldn't stay at the ME again as we just feel that style rules over substance.",3,2015,08,02
148,"Super hotel, great rooms and perfect location","Very nice stay at ME London for my daughter's 16th birthday. Aura team (Sidania, Nicky and others) really made it a unique experience!

148,Fanastic FA Cup weekend,We travelled with friends for the FA Cup final and from start to finish we were treated amazingly....  upgraded rooms and special treats for our friends who were celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary!  Cocktails and food at the Radio Bar amazing....  the only place to stay in London!,5,2015,08,01
148,Proposal,"Fabulous place to stay. The hotel is in a wonderful location and the interior is nothing like i have seen before. Truly unique. I booked a night stay and a reservation for the rooftop bar. I had booked the Aura romantic package which includes some roses, champagne, hand written card and a message on the mirror. All very very romantic. The staff cannot be recommended enough. Very friendly and willing to go the extra mile. Lorena helped me set up the  everything via email before hand and Nicky was most welcoming on our arrival. All in all great place to stay...friendly staff and if you want to go that extra mile for your other half this is the place for you!",5,2015,07,31
148,"Modern, comfortable and a touch of indulgence!","The ME London has a little bit of something for everyone, it's great for couples who fancy being close enough to the sites, shopping and eateries without feeling too claustrophobic.

The check-in was quick and efficient, the door staff were amazing and always at hand with an umbrella and to pull out a hand for a taxi. The room (309) is modern, clean and spacious with a nice array of drinks, in room bar snacks and gadgetry (mood lighting, hdtv, audio inputs and touchscreen control pad the size of your hand). 

Unfortunately we didn't get to try any of the extra facilities but maybe next time. It's definitely worth a second visit and a room upgrade to a view of the Thames as the view from our room wasn't worth writing home about.  The rooftop bar is exactly like The Cube bar in Birmingham (The Mailbox) and definitely a nice place for a romantic drink before the evening festivities. ",4,2015,07,30
148,Great,"This hotel is beautiful, everything about it was great and I would recommend it to any one. The interior is very modern, and very stylish, everyone who worked in the hotel was great. We also visited STK and Radio roof bar during our stay as these are in the hotel, they were both just as great!!",5,2015,07,30
148,"Fantastic service, modern facilities.","We were on a business trip to London, and they've recommend us the ME hotel as one of the best choices to stay in the city centre. Right next to Covent Garden, the hotel has very modern facilities with spacious rooms. Also it offers a very nice terrace bar in the 10th floor called Radio with spectacular views of London city.
There's no doubt we will be back if we have the chance.",5,2015,07,30
148,Excellent stay,"Stayed in this hotel in order to attend the Anniversary Games at the Olympic Park. We had a wonderful time. The staff were very professional but friendly and approachable. They were eager to give you a memorable time but not in an intrusive way. We stayed in an Urban room with a view of the Thames. It had a balcony which enabled us to have spectacular views of many landmarks. I would certainly recommend staying here.

148,Fantastic London Weekend,"Great hotel, reasonable price given the central position. Fabulous bar for late night cocktails. Went on a girls weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Standard room is small but perfectly adequate, bathroom was nice and amenities were good. My friend was upgraded and the room was considerably bigger and if there are two of you I would definitely say go at least one up form the standard Aura if you can afford it. All in all a great trip and will definitely go back. Staff were friendly and helpful, running out to the taxi with a brolly when needed.",5,2015,07,29
148,Stylish hotel in central london,"My wife booked this for a birthday celebration, so I'm not sure how much it cost, but I'm guessing it wasn't cheap!
Having said that, the hotel really is top quality. We had a river terrace room - an outside balcony in central London, with views over the London Eye, Shard, Canary Wharf.
The room itself was very well appointed, with various lighting options, and stylish, minimalist decor. The TV remote was not very responsive, so we weren't able to enjoy all the interactive features on the TV, but then we weren't there for TV so it didn't really matter.
We had dinner at STK: very stylish, very loud, with attentive, efficient and very good looking staff. The steak was excellent, too.
We had booked an outside table at the Radio Rooftop bar, and it's just as well because it was packed on a Saturday night. There is only one lift dedicated to the bar, so entry and exit could have been more efficient, but the bar itself, like the rest of the hotel, was stylish and funky, and the cocktails were good.
Breakfast was in the Cucina Italian restaurant - excellent cooked breakfast served at the table, with a good traditional breakfast buffet. 
Throughout the hotel the staff were friendly (but not overfamiliar), knowledgeable and highly efficient. There are nice touches, like a glass of prosecco as you check in.
With great facilities and top class quality of service in a central location, this newcomer should force some of the older traditional hotels to up their game. And also, other hotels, please note: The ME has FREE wi-fi!",5,2015,07,29
148,Modern 5* in a great location!,We stayed 1 night at the weekend for a birthday celebration on a recommendation and were not disappointed. All staff were very professional and the room (vibe) was perfect. The roof top bar is a big attraction but book a table a good time ahead of your arrival. They do look after guests of the hotel but it does get really busy at peak times. Highly recommend and will definitely return soon.,5,2015,07,29
148,Amazing!! Treated like VIPs ,"From the moment we arrived at the ME hotel we were treated with a smile, our bags were taken off us and we were introduced to another lady who took us up to reception and gave us glasses of champagne!! The reception area is beautiful!! So trendy and modern!
Our room was gorgeous and quiet spacious which was good as there was 3 of us there. There was a ""sexy button"" on the room control which made us all laugh and when pressed the lighting changed colour to a colour of choice ;-) 
We had made a reservation is STK which was outstanding!! Being residents of the hotel we were also able to get a table in Radio roof top bar with no minimum spend which was good, great music and amazing views!! So good we went there again on Sunday for the White party which wad fantastic!! All in all I would definitely recommend and will definitely stay there again!! ",5,2015,07,29
148,Parking charges,"Great hotel, staff friendly, lovely room. Only downside was that I wasn't informed that valet parking was ¬£49 for one night! Just be upfront about charges in future
Cuccina restaurant food was excellent and reasonable prices for the quality, atmosphere and being in the centre of London's West End      ",4,2015,07,29
148,Worth it's price!,"We booked to stay at the ME for 4 nights in July 2015 and had quite high expectations after seeing the hotels website and online reviews - we were not disappointed! Having said that, this is not the place for ones who like traditional hotels as it's ultra modern. All staff at the hotel are very friendly, especially the concierge. They were very helpful with any request we had. Our room (401) was a good size with extremely comfortable twin beds, coffee table and chairs by the window, Nespresso machine and a large bathroom with a walk in shower (no bath) and seperate toilet. We very much enjoyed the room and all the features it offered (flat screen TV, music channels, lighting options etc.). Breakfast was included in the package we had booked and we were amazed at the selection. There is a continental buffet and a menu offering all the warm dishes one could ask for. It is serverd in the hotels Italian restautant which means that you are guaranteed a good coffee every morning. Aside from the two different retaurants (Italian and steakhouse) there is a roof top bar with beautiful views of London. Make sure you book a table. The bar is open to the public and gets very busy. We weren't aware of this and ended up not being able to get a table outside. If you do not like loud music it might be better to visit the bar in the morning or early afternoon. We went late afternoon when there was a DJ. 

The hotels location is great for sight seeing, shopping and theatre visits. Covent Garden, many theatres and sights are just a short walk away. There are a few bus stations in front of the hotel. Holborn, Covent Garden and Charing Cross tube stations and numerous restautrants are also within easy wakling distance. 

We would stay at the ME again any time!",5,2015,07,28
148,Love 'Me London,"Hotel is excellent. Make sure you try the rooms with a balcony. Well worth it. 
Staff are so friendly and always ready to help. 
Vallet parking was fine. 
Saves you so much hassle. 
The view from the room was amazing.

148,An amazing stay,"We really enjoyed our time spent at ME. All the staff were very friendly and helpful - especially since this was our first visit to London and we wanted to see and do a lot!! Everyone was very generous with their time to help with tips and directions! It was also beneficial to stay in such a great location that seemed to be in the middle of everything we wanted to see!
Our room was a good size (Mode Room), even though there were three of us, we still had enough room to feel comfortable!
We were looked after with great care from stepping out of the car when we arrived right through to our last breakfast on the morning we left! We enjoyed all aspects of the added detail in service including the glass of prosecco at check-in to the chocolates and famous quote provided for the turndown service. Everything from the food, amenities, rooms and d√©cor was of the highest standard - but the ME's greatest asset is it's staff!! They are a terrific team that excel in their attention to detail in anticipating your needs and nothing seemed to be of any trouble! They really enhanced our experience in London and we are grateful for our exciting stay at the ME!",5,2015,07,27

148,Excellent,"Stayed at the ME hotel for a few days whilst my mum and I enjoyed a trip to London for The Brits and London Fashion Week earlier this year. What a fabulous hotel. Champagne on arrival, stunning sleek rooms and the staff very efficient and friendly. Don't miss the rooftop bar, yes it is full of posers (like all the best places) but the music is very cool and the cocktails divine (not forgetting those breath taking views also). Would highly recommend, only negative - (and its not even a negative really, was quite funny) the staff member who showed us to our room insisted on showing us the light preference setting in order to adopt 'sexy' (red) lighting for our bedroom. Also drawers packed with 'pleasure' toys and the like even though it was quite obvious it was a mother and daughter trip. We are not prudes so found it quite humorous, but perhaps know your audience. Like I said, not even a complaint really. Fantastic hotel, will definitely stay again.",5,2015,07,24
148,Wonderful stay,"We were visiting for a couple of days from Scotland for the Ed Sheeran concert.  When we arrived the receptionist took our cases and asked us to check in on first floor.  We used the lift then checked in. Start member very nice and friendly and offered us a glass of prosecco which was greatfullyvappreciated.  Hotel was stunning, very dark in corridors very atmospheric.  Room was on 2nd floor and was lovely not huge but very well appointment with a large very comfortable bed with comfy pillows.  Quire sweet when they put wee chocolates on pillow at nite.  Even though hotel situated on The Strand there was no noise at all from the street.  Met Andrew one of the ME managers in the Radio which is the rooftop bar and he offered to take pictures of us with the view.  We had a chat and told him about our plans.  He was very attentive, friendly and offered any support we required.  It was during the day when we visited bar so not overly busy but stunning inside and out though think maybe different story at nite.  Staff all very pleasant and friendly.  Later that nite we received a hand written card from the manager Andrew extending best wishes for our trip to Portugal and a wee box of truffles.  How sweet was that?  When checking out receptionist was lovely also.  Customer service excellent.  Right in the heart of london easy walking to lots of attractions, fab.  Beautiful hotel, will definitely book again when revisiting London...this",5,2015,07,24
148,"Wow, what a place","We recently stayed at the hotel, during July for one night, will definitely come back, the design and d√©cor of the hotel is outstanding, the staff very friendly and a great location also. Our room was very clean and tidy, modern but with character. A definite place to stay.",5,2015,07,24
148,Great original experience (I don't won't to call it a hotel) in London,"When I had to go to London in the middle of summer, I had two criteria. Must have air conditioning and must have a decent size shower. (Yes, I'd staying in London before in summer, it was hot and I suffered). Needless to say Me London exceeded on both these fronts. Had my own thermostat and at times, I had to turn it down ! London was hot too. Shower was a double and I could have had a party in there. AWESOME.
This was just the start.
Staff are friendly, look you in the eye and helpful. Andrew, the lifestyle manager organised a prime table on the roof top bar on a busy Friday night at late notice. My London friends and business acquaintances were impressed (and that was what I wanted - thanks so much Andrew).
The hotel is funky and hip. I liked that. If you want old school stuffy - don't go here. 
Oh, location is awesome too. Middle of London, on The Strand.",5,2015,07,23
148,Read the instructions or ask for help (everyone is lovely),"I was blown away by how lovely the staff were at this hotel - accommodating, friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The location is great for the theatre/tourist areas but also was perfect for my meetings in central London plus the wifi was great to let me catch up on everything at the office (great work space in the room). 

After my conference I met a college in the rooftop bar which is amazing with fab views of London and a lovely vibe.

My advice however is either read the instructions in the room Asap or let the staff show you round! The rooms are almost too clever with computer controlled lighting and air con so unobtrusive that I didn't find until I turned everything off individually. Plus the lift to the roof bar only goes from the ground floor - I was in a room on the 9th floor but didn't realise until a porter helped me that I needed to go to the ground floor to get to the 10th floor. 

I definitely recommend this hotel for a special theatre trip or a few days business if you want to be really looked after

148,Amazing stay!,"We stayed for one night in July 2015 in an energy river view room. The hotel was fantastic, with friendly and welcoming staff. The room was excellent with an amazing balcony with a view of London. The room had all amenities and an ironing board with iron was provided upon request. Breakfast was delicious. Rooftop bar was also good fun! Definitely would recommend and would revisit again! Good location near to theatres, restaurants and shops! Very happy!",5,2015,07,23
148,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here after watching a concert at SomerSet house so is a very convenient hotel for that. The hotel is very well kept and the front of house staff are very welcoming and always eager to help. There is a clean, fresh smell around the hotel which I wonder if they pump through the air conditioning but it was very pleasant. 
The rooms were very clean and with a Energy River room we had a great view over London and the Thames.

I would definitely come back here to stay again.",5,2015,07,23
148,"Spectacular hotel, beautiful rooms","I stayed in this hotel with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago and it really is a fantastic hotel.

The design of the hotel is very modern with marble and monochrome styling everywhere. Excellent location right on the Strand allows you to get almost anywhere in London within a very short space of time, even better as walking from this destination takes you to most main attractions in London. The service was quick and friendly, exactly what you want in a hotel like this.

The reception is beautiful with an enormous skylight that draws light down into the other wise windowless reception, everything about this reception area is modern, sleek and clean, beautiful start to the stay.

The room was very well sized with an enormous bed, again everything in here was beautifully designed and in keeping with he overall modern feel of the hotel. 

The bathroom was magnificent with a huge bath and an amazing rainfall shower, perfect for relaxing in.

This is a great hotel, I would highly recommend to anyone wanting a central location and a stunning modern hotel. You will not regret staying here.",5,2015,07,23

148,Hotel Proposal,"Where do i start? What an amazing stay. 

I knew my girlfriend (now fiance) would not want to be proposed to in public. And I didnt want to wait til the end of the night for it, as i wanted to go out for the day and celebrate the engagement. 

So I called the hotel and asked what they could do for me. They suggested their most romantic package, which added around ¬£100 on to the final room bill. What i got for the money was fantastic. Bouquet of white roses, bottle of Moet, Petals EVERYWHERE, roses on the bed, starwberries and chocolates, a romantically written card and a lovely message written on the bathroom mirror. 

Not only did we receive all of the above, all the staff were made aware of the proposal and gave us a little extra warm welcome and they all seemed for excited, which made me feel better about the proposal. 

We entered the room and straight away, my girlfriend sort of new what was coming (as the room looked so beautiful)... The staff had even set the lighting in the room to 'sexy' (yes, the lighting on the touch pad was called sexy), which made all the lights go off, but a strip light around the room stay on, in a colour of your choice. 

Straight away she started crying (with happiness, of course). 

The room is laid out beautifully, the shower room is massive and great for any shower activity you wish to take part in ;). 

We had the Energy Urban room, which comes with a balcony. While the view of London from our balcony wasnt what i hoped, as London is not that pretty from above, it was a great place to pop open the champagne and start our celebration to our engagement. 

When we popped back in the evening, once again we was given more champagne to celebrate and once again the staff couldnt have been more excited and enthusiastic towards us. 

We then headed to the Roof Top Bar, where again we were given more free champagne and more congratulations from all staff.    

All in all, it was worth every penny spent on this magical day and i must say, while the room and the decor was stunning, it was all down to the staff. Everyone seemed to know us personally, all seemed to know about the proposal, and ALL seemed to want to make it that extra bit special for us.

In short, it was a priceless experience and we would go back there without any doubt to celebrate anything again in the future.",5,2015,07,21
148,"Excellent staff, top hotel and great service",The staff at the Me London made our special occasion very memorable and an incredible time. Catherine from the Aura team took care of us as exceptionally as well as the manager Julie. The entire staff was very friendly and welcoming. The hotel was gorgeous and exactly what we hoped for. I would recommend the Me London for any special occasion.,5,2015,07,21
148,Great stay,"I recently stayed at ME with my mom for my graduation trip. The hotel was awesome. It reminds me of a W hotel. Very modern and hip. The rooms are a typical room that you get when you are in a city. Not very big, but it was perfect for my mom and me. The only complaint I have for the room is the shower. When you take a shower the water gets everywhere and the bathroom floor gets all wet. It was a pain because we had to lay out a lot of towels so there would not be a mini flood. The rooftop bar was great, its a very happening spot in London. WARNING: if you are planning to go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared for a lot of people and no tables to sit at unless you reserve a table. Its a very happening spot on Friday and Saturday's. The best people that work at the radio bar are Marco and Lizette. They are the best! The concierge is very helpful at ME as well. They were spot on with making our dinner reservations, canceling them when we changed our mind and wanted to go somewhere else and recommending places to go as well, and finally helping us with directions when we wanted to walk somewhere we didn't know how to get to! Rory at the concierge was so great with us! We had a great time at ME and would definitely stay again.",4,2015,07,19

With the excellent support of my Aura Host, Nicky, everything came together perfectly. Our super rooms with balconies, the present delivery, 21st birthday message on bathroom mirror, flowers, chocolates, champagne,  birthday cake all delivered to the room. 
It was a beautiful hot sunny day and despite my stress getting to the hotel, due to the tube strike, the hotel team (who had had the same experience getting to work themselves) were calm, reassuring and friendly.  From the moment I walked through the door. My daughter was 'bowled over' being greeted personally on arrival by name.
The evening was rounded off perfectly with a few drinks in the amazing rooftop bar, Radio.
This place is so good we have decided to stay at the ME when we visit Cancun later this year....thank you everyone for making sure it was a perfect memory for my daughters 21st..and especially to Nicky, our host.",5,2015,07,19
148,50 th birthday celebrations ,"Just recently stayed  at the wonderful ME hotel on the strand in London . Amazing from the moment we walked in to the moment we left . Wonderful helpful attentive staff , room was fab  with balcony overlooking the London skyline . Dinner downstairs at STK was wonderful , and the following afternoon upstairs in the rooftop Radio Bar  in the glorious sunshine , overlooking the sights of London , all in all made the perfect setting to celebrate my birthday . Would highly recommend this place , very chic , very funky most enjoyable . ",5,2015,07,19
148,"Excellent hotel, service and location","I choose this hotel due to its great location and roof top bar over looking the Thames as I wanted somewhere extra special to get engaged. I booked the passion suite which was amazing and had my own Aura team member contact me prior to my arrival to arrange everything I wanted for the weekend (Radio bar table booked with champagne & roses waiting upon arrival in the evening, followed by the room being decorated with candle, roses, chocolates and personnel message on the mirror). 
I had Catherine from the Aura team help me arrange everything but unfortunaility she was away on holiday the weekend I was staying, however, she passed everything over to Nicky who did a great job to make sure everything went to plan for an amazing weekend and the perfect surprise proposal for my girlfriend. The nicest touch of all was that Catherine emailed me on the day of doing the proposal from her holiday in Italy to make sure I was ok and had everything I needed.
I cannot fault this hotel and have never received such high quality personalised service we received throughout.
I will definitely be staying here again, specially seeing that even the standard rooms are done to the same high standard and have plenty of room.",5,2015,07,19
148,The trendiest hotel,"The ME hotel is located in a great pave and is The trendiest hotel I have been to. The service is impeccable, the rooms are very comfy, look great, is equipped with great hi tech lighting system, has cool glass doors and is very pampering. ",5,2015,07,18
148,"Great location, great view, great staff","All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, couldn't fault anything.  We started early afternoon with some great cocktails and beautiful views of London.  Even though Radio Bar got quiet packed over the course of the evening, the staff were still attentive, friendly and helpful.  Definitely recommend to anyone",5,2015,07,17
148,Hip and Groovy in the West End. ,"Located in the heart of the theatre district of the West End of London, literally steps away from all the wonderful restaurants, nightlife and people watching of Covent Garden. This hotel is ultra modern, and absolutely beautiful. The staff were very accommodating and they really give you the luxury treatment. Euro techno music is constantly playing throughout the hotel giving it a very young hip modern vibe. we would come home in the evenings from the theater, and there would be  lines of beautifully dressed young people waiting to go up to the very sophisticated radio bar on the rooftop. Although we did not eat at STK restaurant, it seemed like every night there was a huge party going on in the bar until the late hours. We spent our 10 days in London sightseeing all day long, going to plays at night and then late night dinners in wonderful restaurants in Soho, Leicester Square, Covent Garden  and various other locations around the West End that were all in walking distance from our hotel . We absolutely loved this hotel, loved the location, loved the staff, and loved our room. Need i say more. It was a 10 out of 10 for us.",5,2015,07,16
148,Memorable Experience,"An excellent hotel
Unique experience 
Friendly staff professional and exceptionally natural
Would have loved to stay longer 
Will come back again and would recommend to friends to experience the same
Experience exceeded my expectations 
      
      ",5,2015,07,15
148,"High Tech, High Fashion, High Style in the heart of London","ME London kept popping up in my search for London hotels in my American Express hotel search.  I have stayed at Melia properties before and at the ME Cancun when it opened many years ago.  

The ME collection is their high end, high style brand sort of like the W is for Westin but in my opinion far better.  

The building, architecture and interior design of the hotel is stunning. Not to mention the location. Drop a pin in the center of London and you'll hit the hotel.  

I was hesitant to book here because we traveled without two small children. We may have been the only party with kids during our stay.  In spite of this the hotel treated us perfectly and welcomed my children and treated them like royalty

We were very mindful to keep the kids in hushed tones as we walked the corridors and public spaces of the hotel

The rooms just like the rest of the hotel are immaculately designed and styled. The rooms we had were all done in black and white. Felt like we were aboard a space ship. If you are looking for a traditional European or English design to your hotel this isn't necessarily the place. For us it was a nice change of pace and scenery as we were in Europe traveling for nearly three weeks.  The restaurants and the rooftop bar attached to the hotel are equally as beautiful and well designed. 

The greatest asset the hotel has is its location. Very central to all of London but also many choices in walking distance for restaurants. Pubs. Shops. And of course he theatre district is literally across the street from the hotel.  

They do need to focus in on some of the finer points of service delivery.  We asked for a rollaway bed to be set up in the adjoining kids room. It took several tries to make that happen. The telephone in our room wasn't clearly marked and there weren't instructions on how to call the front desk or room service.  The hotel is so impossibly chic and stylish that sometimes they seem to forget it is a hotel and basic service points must be met to make sure guests are happy.  We were happy and there is nothing bad to say. These are minor bits and points of improvement that if management focuses on service delivery they can elevate this property to the next level.  We typically stay at Four Seasons.  This place is on par with FS once they iron out those minor service points.  

The check in lobby of this place is stunning. It is a 9 story pyramidal atrium. I promise you've never seen anything like it.  If you visit the rooftop bar you will see the apex of the pyramid and can peek down to the lobby nine stories below.  Great job ME London. Thank you for making our stay a pleasant one with our two children in tow.",4,2015,07,15
148,Wonerful weekend,"We had a wonderful stay - difficult to single any one member of staff - all were excellent from Concierge to Reception to serving staff .... .  We felt like VIPs for the weekend.  Will definitely be back.
      ",5,2015,07,15
148,Pricey but Incredibly helpful concierge team,"Ruairi McDowell went above and beyond his duties in helping my girlfriend and I with everything from scheduling events, where to shop - he circled areas on a map we should see, he provided directions, made calls on our behalf. But most importantly he learned about why we are there and that's what's most important in creating a relationship. He asked when we first arrived why we were visiting and what we were interested in. It was my girlfriends birthday 3 days later. Not only did he say Happy Birthday to her first thing in the morning when we passed but when we returned he wrote a note with a bottle of champagne and chocolates! - He's currently the Assistant Head Concierge - I'd highly advise Melia do what they can to keep him because he deserves to be a head concierge! Not sure if turnover is as high as it is in the UK as it is in the States but employees like this are ones you don't want to lose. 

PS- I also stayed at the ME Madrid and was disappointed in the quality of service. Exponentially in comparison to the MELondon. ",5,2015,07,14
148,Excellent overall,"From the moment we arrived we were well looked after. Check-in was personal and not rushed. The room was beautiful and had a large balcony with a great view. There were a few minor issues with the room but nothing that was disastrous (loose tap on bath, complimentary cosmetics were empty, bed had a gap in the middle). Staff were more than helpful and polite throughout the stay. 
Cucina Asellina Italian restaurant serves great tapas-style food and again staff were very helpful here too. 
Check-out was not as personal as check-in and was slightly rushed (although there was a queue of customers but this does not justify it). More staff may have been the solution.
The Radio Rooftop Bar is obviously a great venue for drinks and perhaps lunch - with amazing views. Once you get into the bar the staff are extremely helpful, however the welcome hosts that allow you in may not always be so welcoming.",5,2015,07,14
148,Absolutely awesome hotel,"From the minute you walk in you are treated wonderfully!  There is nothing to big or too small where the staff won't help you.  When checking in they give you a nice cold glass of Prosecco.  The rooms are large, clean and very comfortable.  The bedding is awesome and the pillows are so thick and comfortable I wanted to take one home.  The view from the 8th floor riverside room balcony was magnificent!  The best part is the rooms are soundproof and the doors shut so quietly you feel as if you are the only one there!  Breakfast in the morning is delicious and you can choose from the menu so it's not the standard English breakfast everyday.
The staff attends to your every need, with a smile, and it is done right away, such as when we couldn't get our safe open someone was there 5 minutes after we reported it.  
The location is perfect for the theater or just walking around.  There are some great restaurants nearby as well as a Tescos metro.  
We just loved this hotel and will stay in one in London, or wherever else they are, as it is that good!",5,2015,07,13
148,First impressions....,"My first impression of ME London impression wasn't the most positive.  Upon entering the lobby around 7:30pm I was welcomed by a loud bar and pulsating music.   Not the way I like to start.   I was directed to the elevators to go to the second floor reception.   At the elevators, I found throngs of people (more on that below).  Again, I was not impressed.   I managed to see an open elevator and nobody seemed to be going in, so I made my move.   At the second floor reception, what I found completely erased the prior 5 minutes.  I found myself in a nine story white marble pyramid of zen and tranquility with projected images of jelly fish floating up the walls.   As a design junkie, I was in awe and enjoyed the unexpected moment - only to be made better when a glass of Proseco arrived in my hands.  Ina was managing reception that night and was a delight.  

Within minutes, I was on my way to my room on the seventh floor.   The floors with the rooms have a zen feeling equal to that of the reception - black marble lines the walls and strategically placed lights highlight each of the rooms.    Upon entering my room, I quickly noticed that It was a 'connector' and could hear my neighbors having a get together - not good for a jet lagged traveler wanting to sleep. One call to Ina and she had another room on the second floor -  voila!

The Aura room is on the small side, but thanks to clever design, it functions well and has everything you need.   No doors on hinges or clunky furniture in the main space.  Think sliding doors and integrated furniture.  Beds are comfortable with great down pillows and a down duvet.   Room temps were cool - perfect to dive under the covers.   I should also highlight how quiet the room is.   I was in a second floor room overlooking the Strand and could barely hear the traffic below - trust me that I would be first to complain.  

Breakfast at Cucina Asellina is a delight.   The buffet is limited, but the made to order hot dishes make up for that.    I liked the toast with avocado and poached eggs.  A friend and I tried to get into the rooftop bar one evening and learned where the throngs of people that I referenced previously were trying to go.  While being a hotel guest did score us a seat at a reserved table, it was next to the DJ and his speakers - we departed immediately.  I won't hold this against the hotel, but recommend to anyone interested that they should make a reservation for a seat outside - the views are wonderful.  

My critiques of ME London would include: (1) lower the sound level of the music on the ground level - at 7:30 am on my way to breakfast, I don't need a disco.  (2) make sure the elevator attendants for the rooftop bar pay close attention for newly arriving guests who may not yet know the drill.  (3) while I liked the rainhead shower, I wish the hand held was mounted higher on the wall.",5,2015,07,12
148,Average - stupidly overpriced!,"Me and my boyfriend have stayed here twice one in November then again in February .. 

For around ¬£400 I expected a lot better to what I got, the room is nice but the service was terrible we waited over half an hour to get our room key and we felt very belittled as we was younger.

The roof top bar is really nice and posh but you feel very intimated as soon as you walk in, no one welcomes you and the person at the lift when you are going up said to me I can't go up because I was wearing 'BLACK BOOTS'. 

It is definitely not worth the money I spent and I think there's better and more reasonable places to stay in London",4,2015,07,12
148,Expected abit more,"Amazing place but very expensive. Over Priced Drinks, Food. Dont get me wrong its a beautiful place and central but Ive stayed in better Hotels in London and had suite rooms and paid less. Breakfast was lovely which was included in our booking.",4,2015,07,11
148,One of the nicest hotels we've stay at,"We booked for two nights as a surprise for my wife's birthday.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service was top notch, stall always smiling, friendly and couldn't do enough.  We upgraded to a room with a balcony and I'd paid extra to have champagne/rose petals/card and a message written on the mirror (you choose your own message).  This was all done to perfect and my wife was blown away.

We've stayed at the Savoy on twice before for special occasions but won't be for a while as we want to come back here.

The radio roof top bar is the cherry on the cake.  Great to grab an amazing cocktail and some tapas (which were really nice) whilst sat in the sun.",5,2015,07,10
148,Will never stay here again,"Let me begin by saying this is my fourth stay at this hotel - having previously hosted a major event here. 

This stay has been an absolute disaster. 

Poor service, lifts not working, noise from the guests at the bar and the topper was discretionary maintenance work (hammer and saw to fix a sofa in the lounge) at 1:30am. 

With so many better options in the area I will not be back and would strongly recommend that others consider alternate accommodation.",1,2015,07,08
148,Fantastic hotel!,"I've stayed at a few ME hotels, and this one did not disappoint. It's brand new, and they did an amazing job. The architecture of the this building is super cool. The Check in area, that is contained inside of a giant pyramid like structure in center of the hotel, is incredible. The room was excellent. Ours had a balcony, which was nice. Loved the bed, and the bathroom had everything you'd expect from a high end hotel. The breakfast was really good. STK restaurant was also fantastic. The service was flawless. The roof top lounge was super popular and trendy, with fantastic views of the city. The only disappointment was that wifi was not nearly fast enough. No excuse for a brand new hotel. Otherwise, this place is close to perfect!",5,2015,07,08
148,London ME,"Absolutely the best experience I have had in the UK!  Not only is the staff outstanding but the property itself is totally unique and relaxing.  The proximity within the city is fabulous - easy to get to all of the main attractions!
      ",5,2015,07,08
148,"Superb hotel, great cocktails, lovely staff, one of the best in London","Any hotel that greets me with a glass of Prosecco at check-in has started on the right footing in my eyes.  If I then say that it just got better and better from there (except for breakfast - more later) then you will realise what a good hotel this is.  It is a very stylish hotel, with a pyramid going through the centre (you have to see it to understand), looks fabulous.  Staff are all very friendly and remembered that we were attending a concert and even asked if we'd had a good time.  Andrew, the Aura Manager, is lovely, friendly and helpful, an asset to the hotel.  We were in a Passion Suite, which was amazing with fantastic views, guest loo, separate wet room and the biggest bath I've ever seen, more like a swimming pool.  The suite was very well equipped with absolutely everything you can think of, a lovely big comfy bed and it was extremely quiet too, especially considering the location.

We went to the Radio bar where they serve really good cocktails.  This is up on the roof so has amazing views, but also has heaters so you can sit outside whatever the weather.  Lots of staff around so you don't wait long to be served and, again, very friendly.

The only slight disappointment was the breakfast.  This was ¬£25 per head which I don't ever mind paying if it's good value but I didn't really think that it was here.  The buffet was rather limited and we ordered Eggs Benedict but there was so little Hollandaise sauce on the eggs we could hardly taste it so it was more like poached eggs on toast.  But the server was lovely and friendly.

I loved this hotel and can't wait to return!",5,2015,07,08
148,Surprise Birthday Trip,"I bought my boyfriend an overnight stay in this hotel as a birthday present. He loves London and I wanted to pick a really special hotel for him. I chose well! This hotel was outstanding! A really prominent position in London, with all the glitz and glamour, and then the hotel itself is stunning and the service is exemplary. The staff were friendly and helpful, and we had a glass of champagne whilst we waited to check in! The interior is stunning and the rooms are wonderful; I've never experienced anything like it before. Lovely big bathrooms, a huge minibar (if you are willing to pay for it), mood lighting in the room and music. It was a wonderful stay. I'd also recommend the restaurants.",5,2015,07,07
148,Perfect proposal in the very best hotel!!,"Where to start...
I was planning a proposal for my now fianc√©e after looking everywhere I stumbled across ME London and I'm so happy I did.
I spoke to someone on the phone and they recommended the 'energy river suite' as I asked for a view over looking london for the moment I propose.
As we arrive we had our bags taken off us and took upstairs for us. Then we headed towards check in on the first floor...the reception was unreal and so modern. Whe checking in we recieved a glass of chilled prosecco each while greeted by the our host Nicky who was lovely. 
We arrived in the room and went straight to the balcony where the view was second to none. You could see the london eye, the Thames,  Shard and the London bridge etc. It was a nice sunny day so spent the first few hours having a drink on the balcony also ordered room service which was fast and great food. The bed was huge, the bathroom was amazing with a double bali shower. The room features include multicolored lighting and temperatures, mini bar, big screen which was really impressive.
So after going out and eating at the amazing restaurant next door (which I'm doing a separate review for) we went back to the room where I had set up the balcony overlooking London all lit up which looked amazing. I did the proposal and then we went to celebrate upstairs in the radio roof top bar which again had amazing views and great music.
The next morning I ordered a full breakfast as room service, it was fast and absolutely beautiful. On check out Nicky came over to ask how our stay had been and how the suprise proposal had gone which was a lovely touch. Check out was fast and held our bags for us all day.

All in all the best service and staff you could dream of.
The perfect stay for this occasion and will definitely definitely definitely be coming back.
",5,2015,07,07
148,Customer Service is spot on,"After a bad start to a stay with this hotel in February, Management excelled themselves this time and got everything right. 
Check in went smoothly (aided by a glass of prosecco), the room was ready on time and exceptionally clean and breakfast was as good as I remembered. 
",5,2015,07,06
148,A gem of a hotel.,"Boutique but on a grander scale.

This Spanish chain never fails to mesmerize me with it's always beautiful design. 

You walk into the hotel's main door and are greeted with a warm smile and are escorted to the second floor where you are walked into a tall pyramid room with stunning marble walls reaching up towards the sky. The gorgeous projections on the wall...just stunning. 

You are offered a glass of bubbly while you wait. Once you check in, you are escorted to the room where you are greeted with a very modern and sleek design. Ambient lighting which you can adjust to match your mood. 

This hotel is designed with younger couples in mind. People who like to have fun. So I wouldn't recommend this place to travelers with kids.

The bathrooms are clean and the kind where they have the toilet, shower and sinks in different rooms. The beds are extremely comfortable and clean. The tech in the room is great; connect your PC or phone.

When you stay at this hotel you shouldn't expect a view. Because the hotel is nestled between two streets with not much of a sight. The surrounding area isn't busy but you are a walk away from Trafalgar, and you're extremely close to the Covent Garden markets. There are a couple of pubs out the hotel door. 

Make sure you book a table on the rooftop lounge. Hands-down, the best lounge in London in my opinion.",5,2015,07,06
148,Nicely done,"This hotel is slick, modern and has a spectacular design throughout with a reception lobby that has to be seen. The rooms are spacious, fresh, and hi-tech including a ""sexy"" button that creates a perfect ambience! There's also a superb rooftop bar with great views of London, however the most impressive feature of the hotel is the super friendly and attentive staff. They made our stay a real delight. This hotel gets a 100% from me.",5,2015,07,05
148,A once off experience.,"This was a special occasion trip for my husband and I, we would not often splurge this amount of money for just one night.
The hotel was amazing, the Concierge staff could not have been more helpful, allowing us to leave our bag with them from early in the morning giving us freedom to sight see in the Capitol until our check in time was available, (although we did find it strange being offered a complimentary glass of sparkling wine at 09.30 ) .
We were suitably amazed with the decor and design of the building, and when we did check in, the reception staff could not have been more helpful, especially when we had difficulty working the  lift with the room key card!
There were so many nice little touches, such as the bedroom door being opened for us (presumably by the reception staff,) on our first sorte to our room, and our bag already placed in the wardrobe.
The room, (one of their 'basic' rooms,) was immaculate, and the choice on the mini bar was amazing (although we didn't actually use any of it), and some of it really did make us smile! My husband read me the room service menu which I thought sounded amazing, and  which was very reasonably priced for this standard of hotel, he then divulged that this was actually the Pets  Menu! 
After studying all the toiletries, mini bar and coffee machine, trying on the slippers and dressing gowns ( did I say this was not the usual grade of hotel we would stay in?) we ventured out to eat, first looking at STK (one of the two restaurants in the hotel), we decided against it, as my husband has a somewhat discerning palette, and we did not want to risk wasting so much money on food he may not have liked, and headed over the road into Covent Garden. (The location of this hotel is second to none,) and had a great meal, we thought we would end a brilliant day by having a night cap in the Radio Bar. 
This was not to be unfortunately, as you were expected to have a minimum spend per person, which would have been a total waste for us, and a shame as part of the appeal of going there was to experience having a drink over looking the night time city. We did however finish the night in the lobby bar which was in itself is a beautiful setting, although very noisy at times, the noise coming from STK which made us realise we had made the right choice by not going there. It also gave us the opportunity to people watch, and seeing all the young, glamorous, attractive people heading off to the exclusive Radio Bar lift, made me realise that again it was not the type of place where my husband or I would have felt comfortable.
After having a good nights sleep in the huge bed, we were both sad to have to check out in the morning, and it will make any subsequent hotel bookings very difficult, as my husband will now expect them all to be the same standard as the ME.",5,2015,07,04
148,"Wonderful design, great location!","The overall design of the hotel is very impressive, especially the reception area (based on the first floor) is very special/futuristic (the entrance is oke, but no so spectacular). The Urban Energy Terrace room we had was very nice and the terrace gives you a stunning view over the City of London. The room is not very large, but well designed. Lighting is controlled by a very simple designed touch-screen (home-automation), although an extra touch-pad would be helpful. The hallways have an extravagant design as well. The staff is extremely kind, but sadly the (night) staff of the rooftop bar still got a bit of a ""posh-club-attitude"" (especially the lady at the elevator). Last, the location is one of the best in London. So, if you are into trendy design, you feel young and you are not looking for a traditional classic 5-star hotel, ME London is definitely the place to go.",5,2015,07,02
148,Amazing Stay and Service,"My boyfriend and I stayed with ME London and were truly impressed. Its so swanky! The rooms are gorgeous, the reception area is phenomenal. The hotel plays music in the hallways and releases a scent that reminds me of a yoga studio- I loved it! 

ME also has the STK restaurant in its lobby and we had a great experience. The food is so good, filling without leaving you overstuffed. 

We also checked out Radio Bar - the view was beautiful. Unfortunately they blocked off the section that had the best view that night, but we still had a blast. The drinks, the vibes and the style of the people and the music were all stellar. Our waitress, Karina, was the best. She was so friendly, so attentive and knew how to help us out when we were stuck with our drink order.

All in all we had a great experience with ME and I would definitely stay at ME London again. I would love to visit their hotels in other countries as well.",5,2015,07,02
148,"Edgy, but functionally lacking.","Checked in at 8pm. Booking was initially not found. When it was finally found, the balcony room I had booked was not available. Upgraded but room looked exactly the same minus the balcony. Very disappointing. Rooms are very narrow and somewhat claustrophobic. Radio bar was great; excellent outlook, well trained staff, delicious food/cocktails and good music.",3,2015,07,02
148,chic hotel,"awesome decor in the hotel and rooms. Very chic and unique. Staff in the hotel were extremely polite and attentive and even greeted me with a glass of prosecco at check in. 

Skip the roof top unless you don't mind trading in the drama of a rude elevator hostess and slow bar service for a chance to be among the young ""pretty people"" focused more on being seen then anything else. ",4,2015,07,01
148,ME Hotel - STK Restaurant Great venue with impeccable service,"I booked into the restaurant to celebrate a 30th biirthday with 4 friends and this venue did not disappoint. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by well a  dressed young woman on the front desk who offered to take our bags - Our first impression of the venue was less traditional and more high end trendy/ boutique with a cool relaxed atmosphere, we only booked in for food so we headed to the bar and ordered cocktails - highly recommend the champagne cocktails! The restaurant was busy but the service was second to none, our waiter recommended the scallops , as well as the lobster mac n cheese, which was accopanied by a delicious fillet steak, and it did not disappoint... 'yummy!' The bill wasn't cheap but excellent value for money and the cost was reflective of the complexity and quality of flavours in the dishes! Our waiter gave the birthday girl a surprise customised desert with a alcoholic twist. I would highly recommend this venue based on our experience - the restaurant is a great way to start the evening before heading out or booking into the hotel's radio bar.  We will definitely be visiting again soon!...'fabulous!'",5,2015,06,30
148,ME London - Saturday 20th June 2015,"I booked a river view terrace room for my wife and I on Saturday 20th June 2015.  Literally everything about this hotel was first class.  From the moment we walked in the door to the moment we checked out.  The hotel staff were brilliant, every one was so helpful.  I was even able to get a very late reservation to STK restaurant which was a nice touch (even though it was pretty much fully booked up).  Our room was lovely and very comfortable.  We were situated on the 8th floor (room 814) and our balcony afforded us views of the London skyline, which at night time was spectacular.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  I have stayed at ME Madrid (Reina Victoria) which was awesome.  ME London is just as good.  We also had some fantastic cocktails up in the Radio Rooftop Bar.  I also paid for a late check-out which allowed us to keep our room until 6pm on Sunday evening.  This was really nice as it meant that we did not have to rush about the next day after a late night.   In all, our whole experience at this hotel was faultless.",5,2015,06,30
148,Great Stay at ME London,"What a pleasure to stay at the ME London. Fantastic modern rooms, wonderful friendly service and a delicious breakfast. The location is fantastic with most of Londons popular attractions within an easy walk or short tube ride. Rooms really are impressive both in size and the quality of the modern furnishings.",5,2015,06,30
148,Super stylish stay,"If you like clean lines, ultra modern decor and technology - this place is for you. The reception feels like a throne room for daenerys targareyn. Be sure to grab a complimentary prosecco as you check in.

148,"Great location, but!!!","First of all. The location is great. 

But

For a 5 star hotel the rooms are pretty small. The check in is somehow too complicated. The floors are just too hot, no change of air at all. What kind of architects do this?!?

And the biggest BUT at all. 

In a 5 star hotel I don't, I really don't wanna hear the noise of the rooftop bar until 1am.  This is not funny. ",3,2015,06,29
148,nice rooms but strange hotel,"As has been said by others this is a modern hotel which tries to be upbeat but I have just found confusing....  you enter in through the bar and look for the desk to check in but the desk is concierge ... reception is a floor up.   but there are 3 lifts and one will only take you to the rooftop .... and so you cant get off at reception ..... and so it goes on,   My room was behind reception but its not easy to find through a door that looks only like part of the wall - fire escape being the only clue its a door.
Having said all that the rooms are very well equipped, modern comfortable and have all amenities you could need including mood lighting.... although it toom me 15 mins to work out how to turn off the bedside lights (all the others work off a wall panel.. these have a hidden switch ... again chic taken to extremes ?",3,2015,06,27
148,"A very comfortable room and helpful staff, just not very warm and inviting.","Let me start by saying that the rooms at the Me London are extremely comfortable and that the staff at the hotel are all very helpful. The bed and pillows were perfect, the shower is heavenly. The wi-fi is the best I have ever used at a hotel. Our package through Costco travel included a full hot breakfast each morning, which was fantastic! I can not give this hotel a bad rating...but the atmosphere of the lobby and other common areas feel like they are trying to hard to be trendy. The furniture is over-the-top modern, the hallways are dark and hot. When we walked though the lobby in our average day clothes it was as if we didn't belong there. The comfort of the room made up for it, but if you are looking for a warm, inviting hotel then this is not the place for you.",5,2015,06,26
148,A MixEd Experience,"My first stay at ME was a while ago, which left a decent impression that did not quite compel me to write a review. Upon reflection, it was perhaps due to the fact that I have always had a mixed feeling about this particular establishment through my various stays. 

Most people would rate the hotel highly, for its distinctive design, prominent location, decent facilities (most notably the rooftop bar), reasonable price (when you take advantage of their regular promotions and loyalty program), as well as the overall satisfactory guest service; and rightly so. Yet for me, and based on my limited personal experience, ME can be slightly irritating when one expects a 5 star hotel experience. Followings are some of the things that give me second thoughts about the venue. 

I am one of those fussy people who dislike the whole idea of pre-authorization on a card, for that transactions often take an age to be settled/cleared and there is always the lingering annoyance of being charged for something you do not approve. Thus I try to use cash for my hotel security deposits whenever possible (for whatever the amount asked for); mind that most of the places allow me to do that. ME however decided it was necessary to remove the minibar which personally I thought signified the hotel management's rigidness in catering for their guests' preferences. 

On another occasion I paid for late check out (at 6pm) and went out for lunch. Upon my return the room had already been cleaned yet remarkably the few loose coins (around 10 pounds) and my earphone left on the table had also been taken. I enquired and soon had them returned by one of the cleaning staff who was apologetic. I did not blame anyone at the time and still am reluctant  to suggest any deliberate wrong doings. However you might just well get the impression that I strongly felt. 

Another incident involved a broken desk lamp: I was amused how the hotel thought they could just leave the thing (head of the lamp was gone leaving just a pathetic stick) be and present the room to their guests. My last stay saw me spotting a cig butt on my balcony table, it was not the brand I smoke. I could only suspect the cleaner had a relaxing moment which put me off a great deal.  

I could go on but you get the picture. Once again I would like to emphasize that ME IS a good hotel that you are most likely to be happy with. Unless you are expecting to enjoy in-room movie rentals along with many other 'insignificant' details.",4,2015,06,24
148,Manager lets this hotel down!,"This hotel is beautiful when you go inside. The lobby upstairs is impressive i kept looking round i was so impressed. I booked this on a sat night for me and my partner to celebrate his birthday. On arrival we received good service with a smile and also a glass of proseco. We were shown to our room with our bags and the man made sure we were happy with everything. 

We then went for dinner in the STK restaurant downstairs. Food and drinks was nice but it was very expensive for what it was. Anyway we were double charged for our dinner which was annoying as my partner gave them his card which had just enough to pay. His bank charge for going into an overdraft so we were pretty annoyed. If i knew this was going to happen i'd rather give them cash or another card. 

Anyway they refunded us but it was going to take a week to go back in. Out of principle we didn't want to pay a bank charge for their mistake. We didn't want this to ruin our night so we went to the radio bar on the rooftop. It is nice view but the service is bad unless you are famous or they think you have money. We asked for a table but they said there is a minimum spend of ¬£100 and u have to reserve but they would try find us somewhere asap. We waited and the waitress forgot about us. Finally we found a table and we let another couple sit with us as they had the same problem. 

So later i mentioned this to concierge as they asked us if we liked the hotel and i mentioned about double charging us and he got the hotel manager to speak to me. I was polite and said he should compensate us and his reply was "" you paid for the cheapest room and the restaurant is nothing to do with us"". 
That is not how you speak to customers. I still spent ¬£300 so it is not cheap at all plus drinks on the rooftop bar. I'm certainly not exactly poor at all but i'm not a toffee nose who is going to throw my money at a hotel just so i can receive good service. It's such a shame management at this hotel is so poor as everything else is good. Concierge actually told us that staff come and go all of the time at this hotel and i'm not suprised if that's the way management soeak to people. 

Breakfast buffet in the morn was lovely! Fruit, pastries, hot food, coffee. Amazing! 

The guys outside who park your car are very friendly. The young english man was very nice and smiles a lot. Would i stay here again? I don't want to give the hotel my money after the way we were spoken to! There is a polite way of saying things and just because i went for the ""cheapest room"" doesn't mean you should treat us any different! We don't spend a lot of time in our room as we like to go out and explore, so what's the point in choosing the suite?!",3,2015,06,24
148,A brothel look but a very comfortable one,"The hotel is very modern and comfortable though it's not recommended if you are claustrophobic. Very cold design with plenty of black barble and no natural light until you get to your room or to the bar on top - from there you command a wonderful view over London. Our room was a very good one on the top floor with a balcony overlooking the Thames with separ√©. From what they offer in the room it looks as if the hotel specializes in heavy drinkers and people with high sex drive... but's it's Ok and even fun!
Highly recommended for couples - Not to miss the branch on the top bar!",4,2015,06,23
148,Love love love ME London,"We have stayed here twice now and we absolutely love it 
We stayed in the chic suite first time which was lovely 
Second visit we stayed in the energy river, must say I preferred this room as it had a balcony and beautiful amazing view of London 
We would stay here again over and over great staff great food great everything

148,Awesome ME hotel London,"We were so well looked after by the aura team for our anniversary. Champagne, rose petals everywhere, delicious chocolates In our room. Fantastic priority service in radio as residents. Will return ASAP.",5,2015,06,23
148,Unusual Hotel,"We stayed at the ME London after we were stranded at Heathrow Airport. We stood in a lineup for almost three hours to rebook a missed connection and by the time we got to speak with an agent, the hotels around the airport were sold out. 

There is a hotel locating service at the airport and the next available hotel was ME in London. It was 450GBP a night, but we did not want to sleep on the floor of the airport. 

This hotel has a very funky vibe. It's decor is very dark and there is music with a heavy beat throughout the hotel. We were given a Chic Suite, which was huge. The decor was ultra modern with coloured lights and a nice sound system. The bathroom was huge and was equipped with almost every toiletry you would need. We were very grateful, as the airline ran out of emergency hotel packs and our luggage was still at the airport. The shower would have been wonderful, but we could not figure out how to adjust the water temperature. It would have nice if the shower taps had been marked with the hot and cold settings instead of nothing. The shower was extremely hot and we could not easily adjust the temperature. Funky and cool are fine, but clear directions would have been better. 

We had the buffet for breakfast, 33GBP for the two of us. It was not worth and if we hadn't been under a time constraint to get to the airport again, we would have eaten somewhere else.

This is the kind of hotel that would be great for a ""recreational visit"" or for a romantic getaway. We thought it was too expensive for what it offered.",3,2015,06,23
148,Just One Problem..,"The hotel is very swish, dark and moody with a sexy vibe throughout. Having looked at the site and read the reviews we didn't expect to 'fit in' but everyone that greeted us did so in a way that was more 'why are you here?' that 'how can I help?'. We got to check in behind another young couple who were greeted with a glass of (what I assume was) Prosecco but nobody gave us a second look. We were given our room key and directed to the lift with no other information.. knowing that you need to insert your key card in the lift for it to travel would have been useful.

It was a humid weeked and the entire hotel was uncomfortably warm so we were over the moon to get in to our air conditioned room with balcony. The bathroom is lovely, shower etc all great and lots of space. The bed was very comfortable and the room was equipped with pretty much everything you could want. We didn't venture up to the rooftop bar and all restaurants were fully booked by the time we reserved our room so I can't comment on the rest of the hotel but the room itself was great. 

The one problem we faced was the following morning, we woke up and stepped on to the balcony to take in the view and some fresh air only for the door to lock behind us. We were stuck for 2 hours before I managed to get the attention of our neighbour who called down to reception and it was another hour before we were rescued. Part of the reason for this delay was that we'd locked our room from the inside so they had to break in to free us but that's a fairly standard thing to do while you're sleeping and we obviously weren't expecting to be locked on our balcony. 

The hotel staff were very apologetic and offered us a late check out but by that time we'd wasted what was left of our time in the city stuck outside. When they initially came to question us (via our neighbours balcony) the hotel staff asked whether we had tried pushing the door.. we had to laugh, at that point we were just cold and a bit embarassed but it should never have happened and had the neighbour not been there I don't know how long it would have taken for someone to find us. 

Overall, the room was lovely but the hotel is a little too posh and stuffy for my liking and that's what you're paying a premium for. To add insult to injury I paid extra for that bl**dy balcony! ",3,2015,06,22
148,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at the me hotel in London or the weekend, the hotel is extremely dark throughout which is a bit strange but has a lovely scent.
Rooms clean, friendly staff and a quiet hotel.
Caters for all needs required.",5,2015,06,21
148,Perfection,"Stayed here for a couple of nights in February and it was perfect. Staff were lovely, so helpful and friendly. Room was absolutely gorgeous with huge bathroom and beautiful decor. The whole hotel feels really luxurious and chic and really couldn't be in a better location, so central. I can't recommend this place highly enough, I would go back here in a second and really hope to try out some of the other ME hotels around the world.",5,2015,06,21
148,Superb London hotel!!!!,"More than 10 years away from London, we went for the opera, shows and restaurants. We picked the ME from reviews and their web site. We were extremely happy.. A great hotel in the bustle of things, but very, very, quiet...soundproofing was incredible...finally a hotel which figured out how to eliminate the noise from room closing doors!
Not only quiet, but super clean; room service has to be commended.
Concierges were very helpful, Sandro and Cosmin...
We also ate at their Ansellina restaurant, when we were not at the great London restaurants. Service was incredible and prices very reasonable for London. Thank you Justyna, Roberta, Naomi and Olivia...the best crew in London!
I must say that their Radio bar at the top, was also great.

We can't wait to get back!",5,2015,06,20
148,Very sleek and hip,"The ME delivers what it promises. The hotel is modern, cool and very hip. Lively bar scene including a beautiful roof top setting is one reason to visit. My room was spacious with a lovely balcony. The shower was huge (no bath tub in my room so if that's important to you best to inquire). Temperature, lights...all controlled by a panel by the bed. If you like a contemporary setting, this very well might be the hotel for you.  ",4,2015,06,19
148,Highly Recommended for the Business or Leisure Traveler - Excellent Service & Impeccable,"I work for a Forbes 5 Star hotel in the US and am rarely impressed by other hotels when I travel. From the moment I stepped inside the London ME, I was immediately impressed with the attentiveness and graciousness of each staff member that I interacted with. Everyone was very warm, welcoming, genuine, in the moment, proactive, and impeccably groomed. It's rare to receive a room orientation upon arrival (something that is only practiced by 5 Star ranked hotels), but the moment that the concierge offered a full orientation of my guestroom I immediately knew that I was experiencing a hotel that highly emphasized service. 

The room product was beautiful, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and I absolutely loved the spacious bathrooms and overhead rain showers. The registration lobby was stunning, had a very contemporary unique look, and the entire hotel maintained a very clean appearance. I absolutely loved the location of this hotel on the Strand. It was very convenient to get around, was within easy walking distance from the theatre district and good restaurants. Transportation was very accessible from the hotel's location. 

On the evening of day 4, I realized that my iPod Nano was missing from my guestroom. I'm still convinced that the small item was mistakenly stripped with the bed linens during makeup service (an honest mistake which sometimes happens in hotels). I notified the manager on duty right away and appreciated that my concern was taken seriously by her and the hotel staff. During a break between my appointments the next day, I stopped by hotel reception to inquire if the missing item had resurfaced. I was very impressed that my missing item had been pre-shifted to the hotel staff because the Front Desk Representative already knew of my concern without having to research the notes and comments on my reservation. The Security and Health & Safety Manager personally reached out to me and took over the investigation of my missing item. Ultimately, the iPod never resurfaced after my departure but the hotel did resolve the matter. I truly appreciated that the hotel staff was apologetic, genuinely cared, and showed concern. The security manager remained in touch with me afterwards with consistent follow-up and always remained highly professional. 

Overall, the hotel facility of the London ME is stunning and impeccable‚Ä¶but what really makes the London ME stand out as a leading hotel is the entire staff and the individuals handling the daily operation of that facility. A hotel is nothing without the staff that bring the place to life, brings warmth to the environment, and focuses on the guest experience. The London ME has definitely won my loyalty and I look forward to returning again and again during future business trips. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for the business or leisure traveler.",5,2015,06,17
148,'Perfection' is not enough word to describe my stay,"Having travelled most of the world and stayed at such masterpiece hotels as Burj Al Arab, Atlantis, One&Only and etc. I was pleasantly surprised with this gem right in the centre of London. It has instantly become one of my favourites, the minute I stepped into this hotel. Immaculate rooms with an extraordinary design. Everything is just balanced perfectly in this hotel, from the atmosphere and chilled vibes to great staff, cleanness and fantastic food. 
I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel to all family and friends, and planning to stay there again in a few weeks time for my birthday weekend, as i am sure the hotel staff will go out of their way to make it special. 
Also, I would like to say a very special thank you to all of the concierge lads, you have been more than helpful, lovely and attentive. Thank you for your patience and support(seeing as during our stay we probably called them over 50 times) You are the best!",5,2015,06,16
148,Contemporary and Central,"If you're looking for something centrally located but a bit different the ME is definitely worth a visit. It reminded me more of a luxurious spaceship than a hotel! High tech lifts, mood lit corridors, projections on walls and that's before you get to the room! My room (an Energy River Terrace on 8th floor) was sold 'with views of the River Thames' but all I could see were buildings - still a great view though and didn't spoil too much. Room was small-ish but very high-tech with mood lighting and decent media. A nice touch was the hangover cure in the Minibar! Overall very comfortable; although a little cool which, despite managing to change the temperature on the control, didn't seem to get warmer and I couldn't find instructions to see if I was doing anything wrong! Bathroom was pleasant with a good, hot shower and generally all staff I experienced were friendly and helpful. Only other criticism was that my breakfast, which otherwise would have been quite good was served luke warm and was stone cold before I'd finished. However, it would be unfair to finish the review on a negative note though as I would happily stay at the ME again.",4,2015,06,16
148,A mixed bag!,"Firstly the designed and decor of the hotel is very impressive. It offers a very modern, chic setting compared to other nearby hotels.

We received a very warm welcome and check in was efficient. When walking to our room however we were somewhat surprised by just how little lighting there was in the corridors. We appreciate the hotels efforts to create a mood however we felt it a little too dark.

We must admit for the cost of the room we expected a slight larger space with the space between the end of the bed and wall about a metre if that. The bed was incredibly comfortable, it was just a shame our schedule was so hectic... we would have gladly stayed in bed for our entire 2 day stay!

The bathroom was very well presented with his and hers sinks etc and the shower was fantastic, although we would have liked the option of a bath.

We drank 1 evening at the Radio Rooftop Bar and whilst it certainly offers a WOW factor, with it's excellent views of London, we felt it was just too overcrowded with people almost on top of one another. I appreciate it is a very sort after venue and the management want to maximise revenue but for us there were simply too many people in the small area our table was based.

Our stay included breakfast and this was superb, so many options, great quality and fantastic service. Due to our schedule we didn't eat any other meals at the hotel but if the breakfast is anything to go by I don't think you will go far wrong.

In terms of location it is excellent as an hours walk would allow you to take in the London Eye, Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, St James Park, the Mall, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar square and Picaddily Circus to name a few.

Our only really negative experience was the check out where it took 20 minutes to be served. We checked out right on the time and predictably there were 3 others checking out, but only 1 member of staff to serve the 4 people.

Overall a visually very impressive hotel however given the cost of the stay some aspects could have been better.",4,2015,06,16
148,"Great looking hotel, Disappointing service","We have been to this hotel a few times now but our first time staying over night. At reception the check in Staff acknowledged a couple behind us offering them champagne but did not off any to us (also checking in). At check in we requested an iron and ironing board which arrived after us also ringing down to reception a further X2 times. Which is fine but you would not expect this from a 5* Hotel. The toilet in the room also does not flush properly and splashing water all over the floor. 

We paid an additional amount to get a higher room with a balcony which I would recommend. 

We went to the Rooftop bar to meet some friends before dinner. The lady on the door was very rude on our two trips up to the bar. I think this was what really stood out on our visit. There is a strict dress code which we followed but it seems this is only enforced on a per guest basis.

Overall we enjoyed our visit and the d√©cor and the views from the rooftop bar are amazing. The attitude of some of the Staff let this hotel down.",3,2015,06,15
148,Total Ultra Service & Location + Security/Privacy,"Unexpected surprise. Very trendy modern, but super comfort & loads of extra smart gizmos incorporated into the decor. For example, safe disguised as a drawer large enough for standard size laptop with plug charger built IN the safe. So you can charge up all your devices whilst out sightseeing, dining, etc.

Security is tight, but not annoying. Service is one of the best experienced by far - anywhere, anytime, anyplace.

Would I return? Probably not. All the black marble & chrome/steel left me cold. Just not one-time. But it was definitely worth the awesome experience.",5,2015,06,14
148,Excellent,"Couldn't fault anything! Stayed in the energy river terrace. Everything was tailored to ensure myself and my friend had a lovely experience for his birthday. Staff were very helpful and it's a great location too. 

The interior is very contemporary and the rooms are perfect. The terrace overlooked the city of London. I will definitely be staying here again.",5,2015,06,12
148,"Trendy, Luxe, great location, unreal service","Had a great stay here on a Saturday night - hotel is super cool, modern design but very functional also.

148,Outstanding,"In short, ultra-modern and plush.  Very atmospheric and well-decorated, mostly in black and white.  Large, comfortable accommodations, especially for London.

The bar at the top of the hotel provides a lovely nighttime vantage point to look out over the city, complete with an interesting (if pricey) drink menu.

Staff members were both polite and professional.

A wonderful way to close out a week in England.",5,2015,06,09

148,Birthday Weekend,"Stayed here for one night for my birthday - car was taken off us promptly, was greeted with proseccom checked in easily. WOW! the hotel itself is a masterpiece inside, the rooms and reception area are beautiful. We spent most of our time on the rooftop bar, so classy, amazing views of London and cocktails are delicious. In the evening we got dressed up and spent a good few hours eating amazing food and drinking champagne in STK, one of the hotel's restaurants. The waiter was so attentive, service was quick and food was great (a little expensive). We then carried on the rest of the evening at the rooftop bar, it was a fab atmosphere!! The next day we walked into Covent Garden for breakfast and shopping, all so easy to get to from the hotel, they kept our car until we were ready to leave at 18:00. Overall, my new favourite hotel. Thank you :)",5,2015,06,09
148,Disapointing,"I booked an Energy River Suite for my girlfriend and I 5 year anniversary. The hotel itself has great decor and quite spectacular. Door men are polite and helpful as are the check in team. We checked in and proceeded to our room. Room was nice although we had been given a disabled suite, on further inspection it had a broken bathroom door, a toilet which everytime you flushed splashed loads of water out of the bowl and onto the floor, the telephone did not work and the terrace had no chairs available. We reported to the concierge who offered us an Energy city view suite which had just become available. The team where quick to help and our stay improved, we where offered a complimentary bottle of champagne and breakfast in our room in the morning. Check out was quick and easy and we where told that there was no other charges on our bill seeing as we didnt use the mini bar. 2 days later i recieve an invoice charging ¬£25.00 for mini bar. This was then taken off my bill when i disputed. The hotel decor and bars around reception are great, i paid a lot of money to stay there and to be greeted with the first room we where given shouldnt of happened. Hotels like this need to make sure the hotel is in great condition all over. Due to this experience i wouldnt stay here again and wouldnt reccomend it overall. There are better hotels in london for better prices.

148,Fabulous,"A wonderful 24 hours - exceptional customer service (outstanding, in fact) - in a very well thought out hotel.

She also gave us a courtesy  call to see  if everything  was fine. 
I totally  recommend  this hotel ",5,2015,06,06
148,"Too trendy,","Obviously catering for the beer 35s.   Black hallways, super trendy lighting and electronics.   More attention to the standard of finish and maintenance of doors, windows and plumbing wouldn't go astray.   Don't ask for your coffee after breakfast instead of as soon as you sit down, that doesn't fit with the waitress's idea of his you should have breakfast so you Ghan don't get your coffee unless you go chasing it.",3,2015,06,06
148,Outstanding service fulfilling all expectations by a great hotel Team!,"The Annual Convention of GM Chevrolet Dealers from Colombia 2015 took place in UK, London. We were so fortunate of having chosen ME hotel on this occasion. Ketchum Conexiones, PR Agency of GM in Colombia organises this annual event and brought a group of 60+ people, all of them used to top service. As result, our whole experience went beyond all expectations, making of this annual convention a great success. We cannot recommend it enough, thanks to the best team - Dipika (Events) and Emiliano (Concierge) their high dedication to every individual and eye for detail made for all of us a lovely and remarkable experience, Thank you!",5,2015,06,05
148,Best Position and Service,"Well have not been to London before, so picked the newest Hotel with best position. This place is very modern, stark in places, especially the crazy concrete reception atrium?

The Me is just SUPERBE",5,2015,06,03
148,luxury in heart of London,"As it was our wedding anniversary we decided to treat ourselves to a night in London in a top hotel.  ME London is very stylish and worth the extra cost.  I suspect we got a free upgrade as our room came with a balcony.  The room was lovely and bed super comfy.  Lovely toiletries although no hair conditioner which seemed a bit strange.  The roof top bar is stunning although very expensive at ¬£14 a cocktail but staff were very efficient and fast and did not bat an eyelid when I requested a cocktail not on their list - good sign of expert bar staff.
The location was superb - just on the edge of covent garden and theatreland.  Even if you don't stay at the hotel its worth splashing out for a drink on the rooftop but pick your time as its gets very busy especially at weekends.",5,2015,06,03
148,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic service, fantastic rooms all in a great location.","Stayed here for 1 night on a Saturday and loved everything about it; even the smell of the hotel!

Bags taken off us at arrival, reception and check in was just smooth and relaxing and we were made to feel very special and welcome.  All the staff are well trained and excellent in customer service.

Went for lunch at Radio the roof top bar and had a lovely tapas style lunch enjoying the views and occasional rays of sun.

Our room was a chic suite which we loved.  It has an amazing bathroom with double bath, double shower, triple sinks, dressing table.  Bedroom and lounge area were also beautiful with great views down the strand.

It's location is just perfect being 5 minute walk to Covent Garden etc.

When I made the reservation I told them it was for our wedding anniversary and they left a half bottle of champagne on ice in our room.  Nice touch!  

Breakfast was just a pleasure and we enjoyed the whole experience.

Overall this was just a great experience and can only highly recommend this hotel.  
My only travel advice would be try this hotel!",5,2015,06,03
148,Good & not so good,"The main lobby and lower bar is stunning and the reception area is probably the best I have visited. Main areas by rooms dark but I quite liked that shame dark didn't extend to the rooms in the morning.

Staff throughout stay excellent, friendly and helpful.

We stayed in Passion suite for weekend 3 girls and had great expectations as cost about ¬£2.5k.

Room initially was impressive with huge bath, tastefully decorated but lacked what you would expect from 5 star, no movie channels or movie or demand. Night 2 we just wanted to chill so was disappointing.

Curtains in the room had a safety pin so one wouldn't pull across and soon as it gets light the suite is bright which means waking up early. I haven't stayed at any hotels that don't have black out blinds. Main bed not very comfy in fact the 3rd z bed in the lounge area was more comfortable.

Our room had interconnecting doors to 2 other rooms and at 5am new neighbours checked in which included ladies of the night lol and the had music playing and let's say we could hear everything! This disturbed sleep. We did complain and reception said they would ask them to keep the noise down but it continued other than the music. And by that time we wide awake. I don't think thy should rent the rooms with interconnecting doors as you can hear through doors and in the suite.

When we checked out I asked to speak to manager who was very apologetic and he gave us free valet parking - now I think about it the night should have been reimbursed as hardly a 5 star experience being woken up at 5am!! I also think the receptionist should have been proactive and contacted us rather than us having to complain.

Radio roof terrace was great on Saturday with sun shining but busy and took a while to be served, Saturday evening music good but gets busy so arrive early. Stunning views, had some food here which was good.

We had table at STK but cancelled as seemed more like a noisy TGI Friday and much younger crowd.

Breakfast on Sunday was yum, ordered at table & good service, breakfast on Monday was buffet, not the same when it's been sat there & not as fresh. 

We enjoyed ourselves due to the company - did I come away feeling like we had a fantastic experience at the hotel? No due to the lack of sleep & disgruntled paying so much and not living up to our expectations. Was it value for money? No! Would I go back? Only if I was assured of a good nights sleep in a comfy bed, noise free and with black out blinds and free stay!",3,2015,06,01
148,"Modern, contemporary hotel of a very high standard","My daughter and I stayed for one night in May 2015.  The hotel is in a super location, ideally situated for exploring London.  The moment we arrived we were greeted by extremely courteous and helpful staff who could not do enough for us.  The Reception area on the first floor is stunning and the offer of a glass of prosecco is very welcome!  The black decor in the hotel is very modern and the rooms are large, bright and extremely comfortable.  We had dinner in STK which was delicious.  The steaks were amazing and the dessert of fairground favourites was beautifully presented and great fun, including candy floss and mini toffee apples!  We would definitely stay in this hotel again and I would look at staying at other Melia hotels when travelling as I was very impressed with the high quality of this hotel.  We were delighted on arrival to be given a room on the sixth floor and were looking forward to the beautiful view over London.  Our only disappointment  was that the windows in the room were dirty and one of them was covered in condensation outside which significantly restricted the view unfortunately. I have travelled quite extensively and this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  Highly recommended.",5,2015,06,01
148,Exceptional Customer Service,"I went to London as a solo traveler. The customer service was exceptional. The concierge staff welcomed me with open arms, helped me plan trips, made reservations for me, literally were at my beck and call. The concierge staff greeted me by my surname every time I entered the hotel. Kudos to management for hiring exceptional staff. I want to acknowledge Ruairi McDowell and Emiliano Del Pizzo for being so kind to me while I stayed at Me London. I want to say thank you very much to the entire concierge staff for being so kind to me.

I would recommend to management that local calls should be free for guests staying at a five star hotel. Local calls are free at a Holiday Inn Express so I really found charging for local calls to be a major turn off. The rooms should always be refreshed prior to a guest checking in. Even though house keeping came to rectify some issues with my room on my first day, walking into a semi-clean room sets the tone for the duration of your vacation.

Lastly, I would recommend management being more empathetic to foreign travelers as it relates to the final bill. Converting your bill into your respective currency can be confusing. 

A five star hotel should give five star service across the board. I would recommend Me London to family and friends, but me personally might consider other hotels during my next trip to London.",4,2015,06,01
148,Perfection...........,"The overall experience was incredible from the moment we arrived & had valet parking, the checking in & being offered a glass of prosecco, the reception was stunning, the room was uber cool, just perfect!!! ",5,2015,05,30
148,All style - no substance!,"Stayed for a weekend break to celebrate a special birthday - was initially attracted to the hotel due to its fantastic location and stylish design.

Pros
- Impressive lobby area - very chic and modern. Reception area is very unique, modern and stylish.

- Roof top Radio Bar offers beautiful views of London. Very chic feel and decent DJ.

- Prime location in London.

- Spacious and clean.

Cons
- Upon arrival we were shown to our room but our luggage did not appear until an hour later. I had to call reception to ask for my luggage and it still took a while to arrive.

- The corridors are ridiculously dark. Black walls, black carpet, black doors and the dimmest lighting is not practical in a hotel corridor. I understand it is part of the hotels chic feel but when you are unable to find your room with ease and have to squint to read door numbers it is a problem.

- Having been wow'ed by the lobby area, reception and bar I was disappointed to enter a very basic hotel room. The Aura room was plain, minimal and boring. Not impressive in the slightest. There were markings on the leather upholstered walls - not what i expect to find in a premium priced 5* hotel. Basic facilities in the room. Not even an iron or ironing board available in the room.

- The TV was positioned very low - below waist level!?. It was difficult to watch TV from anywhere in the room including the low bed without getting neck strain.

- There was one very small window in the room and unless you are over 5ft 6in tall you cannot see out of the window at all to appreciate the limited view available of the city. 

- A basic chair and table was positioned facing underneath the absurdly high window so that you can enjoy the view of a plain white wall!? This is the most ridiculous room design I have ever seen!

- Some staff were inexperienced. I requested a iron and an ironing board (a basic requirement which should be provided in the room as standard) and did not receive it. I had to ask for basic things more than once before I received them.

- Staff at the Radio Bar lift were dressed in casual clothing with no name badge. It was difficult to tell if they were staff or guests at the hotel.

- Upon booking I specified this was a special birthday weekend but there was nothing or no mention of this at check in. Not even a personal note or complementary chocolates in the room. After requesting a booking at STK we were simply told it is fully booked and no suggestions were given as to where else we could dine in the area. Do not expect staff to go the extra mile for you here.

This hotel has the 5* look but lacks the service, facilities and hospitality you would expect from a 5* hotel.

The look and style of the hotel is the only selling point - a few impressive photos in the lobby and of the views from the rooftop bar but that is all you will get. Definitely not a 5* experience in my opinion. They need to improve the quality of their staff and service.",3,2015,05,30
148,Best of London,"This hotel is centrally located only steps from Trafalgar square, with out a dough a 5 Star property, the staff at the reception, Elena & Francisco are incredible very people oriented and ready to please, Sasha the waiter at the steak house is also there to please, best service ever. Only draw back is the top roof Disco/Bar
Congratulations",5,2015,05,29
148,Weekend City Break,"Stayed for the weekend with my wife.  Superb Hotel in a perfect location.  Stunning modern d√©cor, helpful friendly staff.  Well equipped comfortable rooms with great views from their balconies across the city.   'Radio' roof bar is a must if you have a pulse ! Too much to see and do close by, you will not be disappointed !  Recommend a room with a balcony with a River view, which gave a great view of Fleet Street/The Strand, The city to the left, Somerset House, Waterloo Bridge, the River the Southbank.  Lights up like a movie set at night time.  Great Hotel in the best City on the planet IMHO.",5,2015,05,29
148,Great experience,"Was a bit sceptical about the service as some reviews hadn't been very complimentary but I have to say everyone was extremely friendly and helpful especially check in, the concierge the team serving in the Italian restaurant and those serving breakfast. Lovely hotel quite a different experience to anything I have ever stayed at before. Great location too. ",5,2015,05,28
148,"fantastic place, perfect location","Don't mess around, this place is a great value and is extremely beautiful.  Rooms are hip and techno, Radio--the rooftop bar-- is a must, STK itself it a fantastic restaurant, I could go on.  If you are a stuffy elderly couple you probably do not want to go here because the place radiates a youthful, happening vibe.  
      
      ",5,2015,05,28
148,Anniversary weekend,"We stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary last weekend and had the best experience ever.the staff literally cannot do enough for you, from the moment you walk through the door and hand over your luggage, offered a glass of Prosecco during check in everything is seamless. The Vibe room we booked was outstanding,  complete with large stocked mini bar and accessories offering everything you could think of.
We had a table at the roof top bar late afternoon and the service was second to none along with the views of the London skyline, food was delicious! We will definately be goong back here for another weekend.",5,2015,05,27
148,Breathtaking design,"It was beyond expectation. We were greeted at the entrance and directed to reception on the first floor which was designed like a pyramid. Coming inside from a bustling street, and on that particular day a very warm temperature, it was like escaping into another world. We had chosen an executive room on the 9th floor which gave us an amazing view of The Thames and several London landmarks which were magical when lit up at night.  The Radio Bar on the top floor was extremely popular and bustling even at 6.30 pm with many well dressed people enjoying their pre-dinner cocktails. We stayed for 2 nights and felt the whole stay had been a very enjoyable and memorable experience.",5,2015,05,26
148,Visit for Birthday,"We left one item in the room vacated.  When I called to report this item I experienced awful customer service and my complaint was apparently 'alleged'. This surprised me considering that the hotel was completely empty when we stayed; I would expect that the hotel would be extremely accommodating and apologetic of any complaints, however they were accusative and rude.",2,2015,05,26
148,A beautiful hotel with great attention to detail,"Stayed for a long weekend and I could hardly fault the room or staff. Very sleek design, functionalities in the room that show attention to detail, helpful check-in/out and a great experience overall.
The only let down was the pre-arrival communication from the AURA team that contacted me twice with the same email greeting, ten days and then five days before arrival, but all they tried to do is bookings to the hotel facilities rather than showing interest in my early check-in and car park request. This however did not take away anything from my holiday experience which was just great
Few details for the room: I had booked the room type with a balcony, on the 8th floor which was still adequately spacious. The balcony wall was quite high so the city view was not present in the room, but the room was very bright nevertheless.
Comfortable bed, good linen, easy to operate lighting, amazingly well stocked mini-bar, good coffee for the morning.
The bathroom was nice, the glass bathroom door was not running properly so be aware of this minor detail, also the rain shower was slightly clogged with lime scale (hard London water) so one didn't quite get the ""rain"" feeling expected.",5,2015,05,26
148,Absolutely breathtaking,"I loved this hotel. Not all our party did, some prefer more traditional, like One Aldwich is it, over the road? Never been but they have. Anyway, I liked this one. 

Great location, right by the river, Somerset House, Covent Garden, theatres. The atmosphere is kind of like a 24 hour super club. Everywhere is dark and smells amazing. Staff are very discreet, you almost don't see them, til they give a deep, sexy greeting from the shadows. There is funky house music playing in the lobby. It sounds a bit naff but its really cool. 

So the reception area, on level 3 perhaps, can't remember, is impressive. There is this amazing pyramid shaped atrium which looms above you about 10 storeys. We arrived at night so it was dimly lit with ultraviolet, and our friend was waiting to greet us with champagne, that just sits there on ice. I was in heaven. Our suites were fabulous, everything I needed and more. My friends had a river view & balcony and the skyline and views from the 9th floor were spectacular.

After our evening out we went back to the hotel to check out the rooftop bar and weren't disappointed. A very cool bar, great music, amazing cocktails, fantastic for people watching (and not at all cold).

I would go back in a heartbeat. Top place",5,2015,05,25
148,Brilliant Birthday Stay,"Cannot fault this hotel - great location, luxurious room and facilities and staff that are friendly, approachable and go the extra mile.  We will definitely be going back.  On arrival when booking in a welcoming glass of Prosecco awaits.    We stayed in one of their Energy rooms which has  a balcony with table and chairs with a view of the rooftops and Big Ben.  Apparently the riverside views are something else.  Special mention to the concierge team who really are the most helpful and friendly I have ever experienced.",5,2015,05,25
148,Luxury at its best,Just returned from a 2 night stay at ME London for my birthday. This hotel is luxury at its best. The hotel is beautiful - it is literally breathtaking from the moment you walk in and smell the hotel's beautiful signature scent. The reception area on the first floor is most impressive and is only out shone by the hotel's staff who are all very helpful. We were greeted by Nicky on arrival who went out of her way to make my stay special for my birthday - arranging chocolates and a card in my room. It is this attention to detail from the hotel's staff that make this hotel so special. We did not want to leave but we also can't wait to go back! Thanks Nicky and everyone at ME London!,5,2015,05,24
148,5 Star state of mind,"Spent 2 nites at this very modern hotel in one of the best locations centre London....in fact it's so refreshingly different to nearly every other hotel I've stayed in that it's worth popping in just to check out the reception area, which brings me nicely to my check-in experience....it was seamless and helped along by a complimentary glass of prosecco...I was then personally escorted to my room via dark most un-hotel like corridors i.e. 007 cool. The bed, bathroom, etc were perfect...in fact, the layout/d√©cor of the room has the wow factor for anyone looking for a romantic layover. Breakfast was comprehensive and well priced compared to other London hotels....all in all this hotel is right up there with the best.",5,2015,05,22
148,Had a great stay!,"Very modern Hotel with a pub on the top of the roof. The ceiling of the Reception very high and pointing to the pub. 

I stayed in room 903 which has a super king bed, very specious bath room and Balcony. 

Only downside of this hotel is the lighting system is too complicated and i wasn't able to switch off all the lights with the one on table staying on all the night.... 

Service is excellent, they even have feminine pack - which contains sanitary pad! Very thorough indeed!",4,2015,05,21
148,stay here for our honeymoon,"We decided to have a short break in London for our honeymoon, we wanted a bit of luxury and the ME London doesn't disappoint. The room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean and the decor is modern. The staff were very friendly and eager to help with any problems you may have, the food was excellent and the view from the rooftop bar was amazing.",5,2015,05,20
148,"Fab music, aroma and cocktails","Disappointed with STK, but loved all other areas of the hotel. 
The toiletries were lovely to use, the bed was amazing to sleep in and the Radio bar was wonderful. It would have been really super of the hotel room cupboard door was clean.
      ",4,2015,05,20
148,Walk in and up the lift to Radio Bar.,"The walk in and down the corridor is simply amazing, the black and steel bar corridor is like stepping into some time tunnel and actually requires you to adjust your thoughts.
The roof top bar offers awesome views over London, the decor is fabulous with contoured seating, gazebos and wind breaking structures. Cocktails are top class and the service is top notch. 
A must visit.",5,2015,05,20
148,Amazing weekend,"Spent ages looking through reviews before booking was the best night in a hotel ever, and was made to feel special on our anniversary.

148,bit OTT but very beautiful,"We spent a night here last week in one of the 'vibe' rooms on the 7th floor. Check in was a bit slow, but the glass of Prosecco on arrival did smooth the way. The room was lovely and spotlessly clean. The whole hotel was very clean and minimal and the staff were helpful in a snooty kind of way. The rooftop terrace was lovely, definitely worth a visit although we would have been better going there at lunchtime because Saturday night was quite busy and not very friendly. Beautiful hotel, lovely flowers at every corner. We didn't appreciate the sex bag in the room which contained items ...... which cheapened the whole experience ....well anyway, we wont stay here again, its not for us, but can appreciate why others might go back. FANTASTIC location though, right near all the theatres and Covent Garden.",4,2015,05,19
148,Luxurious hotel in The Strand,"Had a wonderful 2 night stay in a superior room. The hotel is exquisite with fabulous service from the main hotel staff, bar staff in Radio were not quite 5 star but the overall experience was amazing. Had diner is STk and the rooftop Radio bar, both were fantastic. Would definitely stay here again. Loved the rooftop bar although there is a minimum spend for 2 hours to get a private table but understand able as its such a desirable location. Highly recommend! ",5,2015,05,18
148,Amazing experience,"stayed one night for my birthday. The staff was fantastic and welcoming on arrival with a complimentary glass of fizz. We booked an urban energy room which was outstanding. We were on the 9th floor and the views on the balcony were outstanding. We booked a table in the radio bar, again amazing. The staff could not do enough and the service was great.  Tapas was fantastic and cocktails to die for. An expensive treat but it was worth every penny.",5,2015,05,17
148,Pure Elegance,"This hotel is very elegant and upscale.  The staff is very professional and courteous.  The rooms are beautiful and trendy.  All of your needs are met.  If you like to be pampered, the ME London does that.",5,2015,05,17
148,Wow,"Gorgeous hotel, comfortable rooms, staff was A1. Highly recommended. Everything about this hotel was perfect. Roof top bar overlooking London is stylish. The only issue was the weather! Location is prime as well. If you're going to London this is the place to stay! ",5,2015,05,17
148,"Great location, friendly, helpful staff, amazing rooftop terrace","This hotel is in a great location for Convent Garden and Soho. The staff are friendly and attentive.  Rooms are comfortable. Ate in STK and was a great dinner, waiter was helpful, attentive and gave us some great advice for other local places to visit. Rooftop terrace bar is a great space with fantastic views towards South Bank.",4,2015,05,16
148,Birthday stay,"Stayed at Me London last night for my birthday, this is the second year in a row we've stayed for my birthday and it was even better than the first. Would just like to say a great big thank you to Nicky who was amazing, once we'd checked in we popped up to radio bar for a drink on the terrace, Nicky had been to our room by the time we got back and put a bottle of champagne, chocolates, sweets and nibbles in our room, she also wrote a birthday wish on our bathroom mirror, all in all couldn't have asked for more. Service at Me is second to none, Nicky is a credit to you Me London. Look forward to seeing you all again soon. Big hugs Zoe & Nik xx",5,2015,05,16
148,Beautiful hotel,The outside of this hotel is very deceiving although upon walking into the venue you are greeted by very polite staff in a wonderfully presented concierge and bar area. Very modern! the rooftop bar was very busy (Saturday night) but was a fabulous end to our evening. Although out rooms were in the floor below the bar we heard nothing! ,4,2015,05,14
148,All about YOU! Customer service at its finest - amazing experience.,"Well what can I say - amazing experience and definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in. 

I originally booked a weekend away to treat myself and my boyfriend for our 3 year anniversary on the 4th April weekend for 2 nights. Unfortunately due to the Holborn fire this caused the hotel to be out of use due to no electricity - we phoned on the morning of departure to check if the electricity was back on, it wasn't. As we live in Devon which is around 4-5 hours away from London we felt that it would be a massive risk spending the money on fuel and time to arrive at the hotel and have our experience ruined. I spoke to Andrew Minnucci who is part of the fantastic Aura team he was beyond helpful and really made me feel at ease with rearranging our booking to another weekend suitable for us. He very kindly gave us a complimentary night free for all the hassle - now that is 5* customer service! All staff at ME London are willing to help you with anything and are always smiling. 

When we arrived at ME London the car was taken straight away on arrival no hassle for a charge of ¬£50.00 per night, we felt that was rather expensive but the benefit is its valet parking and saves worrying. The team greeted us with a massive smile and guided us up to the gorgeous reception room which we were then greeted by a glass of prosecco and wished a very happy anniversary - FAB! 

Our room was beautiful and they even wrote a message on the mirror for us (make sure you ask for the in-room spa which includes a stunning bali double shower, his and her basins and giant bath - you won't regret it!). 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone especially couples for a special occasion, the bar downstairs is stunning and serves the best mojito! When we return to ME London we plan on visiting the STK restaurant as that looks so much fun. Can safely say it was very hard for us to leave this hotel.. Thank you ME London for an amazing long weekend which we won't forget.",5,2015,05,14
148,Super Stay in the ME Hotel,"Had a great stay in the ME London.

Really fabulous service and a really great vibe in the hotel.

We stayed in the River View balcony room and the view was spectacular.

We also really enjoyed the breakfast. Again great service and delicious food.",5,2015,05,13
148,Best London hotel stay ever,"Fantastic hotel. Modern; sleek; clean; helpful and kind staff; brilliant rooftop bar; light show in the reception hall (which is stunning); and all within stumbling distance of Covent garden, Soho and the City. For its location and quality it is also excellently priced. At present, I recommend booking directly on the Melia website - when I did so I got a better room at a considerably cheaper price than I could find on any comparison website.",5,2015,05,11
148,Mr S,"This Hotel was very disappointing , staff very unfriendly and tried to put me into an very expensive mini cab when I asked for a London Black Taxi , I certainly won't be going here again , very overated rooms , staff very moody , made you feel like they were looking down their noses at you , overall a 1/10 , avoid at all costs .",1,2015,05,11
148,"Wanted a taxi, got a Prius !!!!","The stay at the hotel was fine, reception staff knowledgeable and the rooms are good but..... When I ask for a Taxi I want a Taxi, not some idiot in a Prius that does not have a clue where he's going, twice we nearly went the wrong way up one way streets, his excuse was he had only lived in London a month.
Avoid !!!!",1,2015,05,10
148,"Sexy, Relaxing, and Centrally Located hotel","I rave about this place.  The hallways and decor are all minimalistic, dark (cozy), and beautiful.  If you have ever been to STK or Ganesevoort or Dream Hotel - it has that kind of setting.  We live in a Philippe Starck building which has a similar theme.  The rooms are large and the bathrooms are huge!  Yet the closets are super tiny (go figure - its the same as my apartment so that must be the trend).  Our room had a sexy kit and other non-free amenities which were cute but we didn't use.  The mini-bar selection was suited to our tastes (scotch! bourbon!).  We love the mood lighting but found it more entertaining then necessary.  The windows jut out (think of it as a balcony that doesn't open) which is pretty ingenious.  Lastly, the service couldn't have been better.  We got to know Charlotte in the lobby bar.  Everyone was really friendly but low-key.  There was always a taxi available but also found everything within walking distance (convenience stores to shopping).  And of course we ate at the two restaurants there and found them to be excellent.",5,2015,05,08
148,Terrible front of house staff,"I ask for a taxi for my journey but when It arrived it was a saloon type car and not a black taxi.
When I asked why I was told that black taxis were to expensive. 
As a regular user of taxis I am in a better position to judge than your staff whether a taxi is expensive , which for your information they are not.
It is not the duty of your staff to decide that when asked for a taxi a minicab is appropriate. 
Your staff should make sure the wishes of visitors are met in full.
This is not what I expect from a central London hotel.",1,2015,05,06
148,Bank holiday week end,"Superb. From the moment we walked in, this was 5 star all the way.
Excellent views across London from the rooftop Radio bar, and superb food in the Italian restaurant.
Didn't get a chance to try STK, as it was so busy.",5,2015,05,05
148,Great Venue and fantastic staff!,"I think this is a great venue for any business to hold dinner meetings. All the staff are extremely friendly! The rooms are fabulous and spacious.

The hotel has to be one of the best hotels we at Parfums Christian Dior work with. This is a venue that we all really enjoy and will continue to work with in the future.

Has an amazing if not the best view of London also!",5,2015,05,05

Amazing views from the rooftop, the staff was very attentive and polite. Champagne rose was excellent ! The room was very ""chic"", clean and bed comfortable. We were very impressed about the STK restaurant, good service, nice food and a good DJ. We highly recommend this hotel. PERFECT !",5,2015,05,05
148,Excellent,"I stayed for a night with my partner and our stay can be summed up in one word. Perfect. The staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming and professional. The building was beautiful and the small touches in the room just made our experience perfect. I am so grateful to ALL of the staff with a special mention to Catherine. I'll be coming back and I 100% recommend this hotel",5,2015,05,03
148,Strangest hotel ever,"We spent 4 days here over April.
To start with we where impressed with the location and the entrance. The reception on the first floor is very impressive and the service was attentive and good. but once you get in the lift to go up to the room it all gets a bit strange, from the black everywhere to the lack of lights down the corridors. If you have ever seen the film 'Blade' then it all makes sense and feels like a vampire safe house.
I think they where going for modern, elegant or chic and ended up with strange, gloomy and scary.
The room on the other hand was nice and the bed was comfortable. Even though we where in the heart of London the sound of traffic was never an issue. The central location was great to walk almost anywhere easily.
The security staff on the door are a bit intense and appear out of nowhere and look like Russian body guards.
We went up to the roof terrace on one occasion and instantly regretted it. It's very chic but it's full of people who would throw you out of a life raft to save them selves. Awful people!!!!
If you love it here and think it's the kind of place for you, then you are one of those people I'm afraid to say. Oh and the services is terrible unless you are a six foot leggy blonde woman.

Overal, A great room at the heart of the city but you will only feel comfortable here if you need a vampire safe house.",4,2015,05,03
148,"Very Professional, Stunning Views","As a Melia fan, I was delighted to discover that the ME London business conference facilities were surprisingly within budget for a business summit that I was arranging.

The rooms were huge, well laid out and the refreshments and lunch were excellent.  Everything ran like clockwork, no ask was too much and fantastic feedback was received from the delegates. And those staying in the hotel were hugely impressed.

Beautiful, modern hotel, great reception and bar area but the piece de resistance was finishing the day with drinks on the rooftop - stunning views, trendy crowd and great atmosphere.",5,2015,05,01

148,Perfect,This hotel is fantastic. The service is faultless and the room size for a London hotel is generous. The little extra touches made a huge difference (they had left a special birthday message on the bathroom mirror for me). The location is great and the radio roof top bar has incredible views across London. I would definitely stay again.,5,2015,04,30
148,Class,"Booked in for one night and totally blown away, nothing is too much trouble for the staff, very courteous, but not over the top. Best reception area I have ever been in, so unique! Room fantastic, especially the bathroom area.  Didn't eat there as we had made plans, but took a drink on the roof top terrace which was fabulous.  I was surprised that the hotel corridor lighting is quite dark, which may be a problem for older guest or poor sighted guest.",5,2015,04,29

148,Simply divine,We visited for my boyfriends birthday - the room overlooked somerset house and had amazing views across the city. The room was modern and sumptuous. We visited the roof top bar for drinks with friends in the evening and it was busy (even on a Tuesday night). Loved this hotel and hope to go back soon,5,2015,04,28
148,"Hotel in great location, a few issues","Hotel is in a great location and we paid for a superior room with an amazing view over London. Staff were helpful and polite. Did have a few issues including not being able to get out of the shower, the TV not working correctly and having our champagne removed from the room (although it was half full). These issues were resolved quickly and staff were very apologetic.
Hotel in lobby areas is very dark however some great places for food and drink.",4,2015,04,28
148,A Wonderful Place To Stay!,"We found this hotel quite by accident whilst searching for a last minute deal online. When looking on the booking agent site, it was showing up slightly more expensive than the hotels main website so we decided to call and book over the phone. We managed to join their loyalty programme absolutely free and received 10% off the room rate. Over ¬£150 cheaper than the booking agent site so we were ecstatic! 
We chose to stay in the River Energy room which had a balcony. As soon as we stepped out of our taxi, we were greeted by concierge and they took all our luggage and showed us to reception which is on the first floor of this truly exceptional building. Upon checking in we were handed a glass of champagne and asked if an upgrade was possible. We were shown a suite and offered another huge discount on that suite if we decided to take it. It was a wonderful room but it was on the 1st floor so we decided to stick to our original booking, however they upgraded us to a room which was slightly bigger absolutely free of charge. Check in was delightful. 
Our room was superb, our luggage was delivered to our room within minutes of arriving which was a great start to our stay.
The room itself was number 806 and had a small but perfectly formed balcony with table and 2 chairs. The view wasn't spectacular but it was nice enough. If you are short (like me) don't expect too see much over the wall of the balcony.
The room was immaculate, every single fixture and fitting was high end and the gadgets were great! We had a media hub, smart TV and interactive mood lighting.
The mini bar was well stocked, including drinks, alcohol, snacks and sweets. We had access to wine, whiskey and cocktails glasses. The Nespresso machine was a nice touch but we did wish we had a kettle to make a nice cup of tea.
The bed was comfortable and linen was Egyptian cotton. Simply lovely!
the staff at the hotel are all friendly, approachable and courteous. Nothing was too much trouble. This has been one of THE BEST hotels we have stayed in to date! Highly recommend to all! In fact we have already booked again.
We had drinks up in their rooftop bar which was a great place but not really for couples wanting to enjoy the views with a few drinks. It was quite rowdy and full to capacity.  Was shoved a bit by a few drunk young ladies so we move to the bar downstairs. We were given a free bottle of wine for the trouble. 
If I could give some tips I would say bring bottled water as its very expensive from the mini bar. Always leave your 'Do Not Disturb' card on the front of the door as housekeeping has a tendency to walk in with very little announcement (management dealt with that situation impeccably well) 
Overall I would recommend this hotel to people who are on a night out and enjoy the nightlife. I wouldn't say it was for people looking for rest and relaxation as the walls are very thin and the balconies are all interlocking so no privacy there (especially if you are a non smoker and the person next door smokes, your room fills with the smell very quickly!
Having said that, we had a wonderful stay and were sad to leave.",5,2015,04,26
148,ME London is just too cool for the likes of us,"Looking at the other reviewers who were celebrating 21st and 30th birthdays we realise now that this hotel isn't catering for our age group perhaps.
We thought it was stunning - the room was amazing (especially the mood lighting), the view incredible and the reception is out of this world.  We enjoyed marveling at the contents of the mini bar and the generally had a great time.
Our biggest problem was when I emailed to ask if we needed to prebook a table at the rooftop bar for a cocktail and whether they could book us a table for dinner at one of the restaurants.  I was met with a lengthy and officious email about minimum spends, dress code (no ripped jeans) and no under 21's.  As we were celebrating quite a mature birthday none of these applied!  When my husband arrived he was faced with a twin bedded room but they did manage to get this sorted.
So a lovely hotel but probably for a younger audience.",3,2015,04,26
148,21st Birthday Celebration! ,"This Hotel is simply perfect!! My partner arranged the hotel for my 21st birthday and I am so impressed! I felt like the luckiest girl in the world from the moment we were greeted, the whole hotel is so beautiful and contemporary! The initial lobby area was gorgeous, then we were shown to the lift to go to the reception area to check in, (our room was ready an hour early) and this was the only thing on the 1st floor! So so beautiful and we were greeted with a glass of prosecco. We were then told where our room was and made our way up there, room 905 with the balcony overlooking the city, absolutely stunning views! When entering the room we were overwhelmed with how beautiful it was! My partner has organised for a rose, chocolates and champagne all of which were a lovely treat! All the staff were polite and very attentive! We will definitely be staying here again for our anniversary in November and we look forward to visiting the Radio Bar this time! Thank you so much to ME London, you made my birthday one to remember! ",5,2015,04,25
148,Amazing....,"Faultless. Stunning hotel, friendly, professional staff. Gorgeous room...amazing location. Would 100% recommend and will definitely return. Visited for business, but can't wait to return and experience everything this fabulous hotel has to offer.

148,30th Birthday Treat!!,"I stayed at this hotel booked as a surprise by my partner for my birthday. Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly guys on the door who took our luggage and handed us a glass of bubbles! We were upgraded and showed around our room. Room was perfect. Lovely size, very clean and everything you would want in a London stay. Great location to the strand and a very very short walk into Covent garden. Victoria is a 10 min taxi ride. So overall location wise is fantastic. Radio bar is a must at the top of the hotel - great atmosphere and views. I would defiantly return to this hotel. and its perfect if your looking for a London Hotel with a Modern trendy Twist !!!!",5,2015,04,24
148,Fantastic Staff,"The staff at the hotel are super helpful and very friendly.

The hotel smells amazing - sounds strange but there was something very comforting about the smell. Every time you walk in to the hotel, you are greeted by the same familiar scent. 

There wasn't an iron the room but I called to reception and they had one sent to my room straight away. On request, the hotel will make a note and ensure that you have an iron in the room for all future visits. 

There wasn't a plug socket by a mirror so I found it difficult to style my hair. The hotel were able to supply a mirror on request. 

The hotel was very comfortable and I had a great stay.

148,Second visit and just as good,"Initially visited in June 2014 with my husband and loved it.  Booked it for my sister and I in Feb 2015 and was not disappointed.

My flight was delayed but the barman at the Marconi Lounge bar made my sister feel very comfortable as she waited for me.

From checkin (at the fabulous reception with glass of Prosecco), the design-led rooms and great location - we had a superb stay.

We had late night drinks in the rooftop bar and breakfast was good.

I truly love this hotel and cant wait to go back again.",5,2015,04,23
148,London long weekend,"Stayed at the ME Hotel London last weekend and had a terrific stay with girlfriends visiting London for the weekend. Love that hotel! Want to go back again as soon as possible.
Service, facilities, staff, food, bar etc. were all amazing!!",5,2015,04,22
148,5 Star Plus with unrivaled service. World Class...,"My better half and I were originally supposed to stay on Wed April 1st but sadly due to the fire at Holborn, we checked in and two hours later had to move as we had our 16 month old daughter with us and needed electricity which the fire had managed to get cut off from the hotel...! It was at this point we realised just what a superb hotel the ME London was in terms of service. The moment you step through the door you understand in a split second why it is a 5* hotel, the decor and design are stunning and contemporary and you feel like a celebrity. You are greeting informally with no pressure by the staff at the door who put you at ease in a milli-second escorting you to the front desk then reception. You then feel you have been beamed up to the Starship Enterprize with the magnificent foyer. Just check the hotel pictures out, words are hard to describe it. You are also offered a glass of Italy's favourite Prosecco to wet your whistle. So, after having been shown to our room on April 1st which was incredible, on the 9th floor with a balcony! This I might ad was not our original booking, we were offered an upgrade as we had our daughter with us and with the lack of electricity, therefore no air conditioning, we were able to open the door to keep baby Annabelle cool. How lovely was that. It was then a shame we had to call reception after a couple of hours and sadly arrange to be moved to another hotel as there was no sign of the power returning and we needed light and heat for the bambino! We must have been one of hundreds of guests wanting to arrange something similar. When at reception I explained the situation and met the General Manager, a absolute gentleman, Guillaume Marley. He could not have been more helpful and understanding of our situation and immediately helped us himself along with other members of the team, get our luggage from the 9th floor down to ground level by foot as by this time, the lifts were not working either. We were offered an apology (although it was not their fault at all) and offered to opportunity to come back to the hotel AS A GUEST, to experience the ME Experience in its entirety. This has never happened before. We swapped emails and went on our way. True to his word, we received an email a few days later when the power had been returned informing us that we had been refunded and asking us for dates to return. By chance we had a free weekend/Saturday night on April 18th as we had family down who could look after the children, all three of them! We checked with the hotel and true enough, they confirmed we had a room booked on Saturday 18th on the hotel. This was to be our first night in over two years on our own without any children... Anxious but excited all the same, we arrived at the ME Saturday early afternoon only to be greeted at reception by Valentina (who had been copied in to all the booking emails and was constantly in touch with us making sure the reservation and our stay went to plan). What an asset to the hotel she is. We were made to feel VIP from the moment we stepped through the lobby. We were taken up to the Radio Roof Top bar by Valentina herself and given a tour and also had our names on the guest list so we could go and have a drink later that evening which was great and then escorted to our room. On arrival, we realised we had not been given the normal room, but again, an upgrade to a Mode room which was just beautiful and we felt like we were on honey moon. Not only that, Guillaume the General Manager who was not working that day, had pre-arranged a bottle of Champagne for us! It made Jade (my partner) get emotional as it was just another special touch from the hotel to make out stay perfect. We were then left to shop and mosey around. We had a pre-booked meal in STK restaurant and on arrival to the table, guess who greeted us? Valentina had gone out of her way to meet us at the restaurant entrance to make sure we were looked after and sat at the table etc and to our surprise, another glass of Prosecco was brought to the table. The meal was first class and 5 Star as was the service by a young man called Leo I believe. Top man.  After a few drinks at Radio after the meal, we retired about 1am and woke up at 8am and cant even remember going to bed! What we can remember is the fantastic night before. We had breakfast and checked out and said our thanks to the team and Valentine herself once again and was on our way... What a first class weekend. Yes, we were extremely stressed on the power failure day, April 1st with our baby and all that came with that but were made to feel at ease by the hotel and all their staff. Every single person we met who worked at the hotel from the lift attendant to the management made us feel like real VIP. Everybody made the effort to know our name and they were made away of how special this night away was. I have to personally thanks you all ME Hotel London with special thanks again to Guillaume and Valentine, you have no idea what it meant to Jade and I. We are already planning to be back in July/August, we have already recommended the hotel and restaurant to friends and family and we are coming to eat at STK again before we stay over as it was so superb. We cant wait to be back and as they say, memories last forever and you guys helped our memories to be some of the best we have. THANK YOU. Alan and Jade x",5,2015,04,22
148,Initially Impressed but then dissapointed,"Arranged parking here through Just Park last Saturday and we were very impressed with the staff at the ME, very courteous and polite, when returned to collect vehicle we went inside with a view to seeing what the hotel was like with a view to booking for a weekend but the clientele seemed very immature and when we visited the toilets in both the ladies and gents there were people openly taking drugs and behaving very badly, the toilets were in poor condition as well. So we have decided not to book this hotel.",2,2015,04,21
148,Funky Stay...,"If your looking for a funky fun hotel then look no further, reasonably priced good value. warm welcome with a glass of prosseco upon arrival as we entered the impressive prism reception area. Little tip when booking just check your room has a bath and shower as some rooms are quite small and only have a shower..!!! room was clean fresh and equipped with lots of little goodies, including an interesting sex kit...!!!!! the roof top bar was really good and well worth exploring..!!! all in all would totally recommend this hotel and its loctaion works for shopping and theater, good central location..!!",5,2015,04,21
148,Review,"As mentioned above, I was highly irritated by the 15 minute wait to check in which I think coloured my stay. Perhaps this isn't meant to be a business hotel but if you are trying to attract business customers, the basics have to be there. Quick and convenient check in, irons in the room, less cryptic lighting system, etc

148,Fantastic 1st Visit,"An amazing looking trendy hotel.  First impressions are important and this hotel certainly pulls out all the stops.  The decor is very on trend and once greeted and your bags are taken away you are told to go to reception to check in.  On reaching reception you are greeted by a host who offers you a glass of bubbly ! You can then enjoy this at your leisure whilst taking in the amazing pyramid type structure. The rooms are very good, bright & airy & ours was very quiet. It was  a decent size (we had a standard Aura) with a very good range of products in the bathroom and a  wide range of mini bar items are available.  Strangely the toilet door doesn't seem to lock but also the door swings open.  Just really needs a magnet to hold it shut. The rooftop radio bar is very impressive but do book a table as we hadn't and couldn't get a table outside for lunch (the hostess told us to sit inside and she would move us once table outdoors became available). We reminded her many times about moving us but she never did. Exactly the same thing happened in the evening but after complaining she did eventually find us a table. I recommend this hotel & I will Definitely stay here again ",5,2015,04,21

148,Recent corporate event at ME London,"I recently used ME London for the second time for a corporate event which included guests from within and outside of the UK. The entire event was seemless from start to finish, including the planning stages, and the level of attention to detail was superb. The events team were great as always. The staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful, including the concierge team who were constantly on hand to assist. Bedrooms were modern, well equipped and spacious, meeting space was private, spacious and came with dedicated AV technicians. Catering was superb in both the public and private areas; would go as far as saying one of the best hotel breakfasts in London certainly. Great location and looking forward to using it again already. Feedback from guests in attendance (who are frequent travellers) is that they want to return for holiday, always a good sign of a great event!",5,2015,04,16
148,"Nice Room, Nice Staff, Nice Location","A wonderful new hotel with service to match. I had a balcony room with great views of the city. Wonderful check-in and check-out. Very clean and super comfortable beds and pillows. I have nothing bad to say... worth checking it out. Also, try the rooftop bar... Nice scene. ",5,2015,04,16
148,Recent business meeting at the ME London,"Firstly I‚Äôd like to say what a fantastic venue the ME hotel was for our meeting and a great location!

All of the feedback I have received from those that attended the meeting was extremely positive, the meeting room, food and drink during the day, STK and of course the roof terrace were all faultless!

The staff that looked after us throughout the whole stay were exceptional, nothing was too much effort. The food was fantastic and the meeting rooms were great (although there is no natural daylight, the rooms were still light and airy).

I dealt with Dipika in events management to organize the meeting, who was always at the end of the phone or email to assist. The whole process of arranging the meeting was a breeze.

I have hosted many meetings at venues across London, and the UK and this was by far the best!

Overall I cannot fault the ME London, thank you!",5,2015,04,15
148,Very nice & a bit different,"I wanted something a little bit special for my partners birthday, I considered places like the Savoy etc. but these come across as a bit stuffy and the ME London was a similar price but looked much more modern.

It's rather unassuming from the outside but as soon as the polite staff usher you in it's quite impressive, particularly the huge pyramid in reception.

Staff were all polite and attentive without fussing, the room service provided the best club sandwich I've ever eaten, there are bar offerings but these are open to the public and a bit trendy for my liking (we went to the rooftop bar and came straight back down again as it was full of people showing off).

All in all a very positive experience that I'd happily repeat.",5,2015,04,15
148,Loud and flashy..but great rooms and staff,"We arrived a couple of days after a fire that had wiped out much of the power to the area, and the day of our arrival was the first on which the hotel was 're-opened'.  The power problems were not completely sorted - no TV, no room Wi-Fi - and it took nearly 45 minutes to allocate us to a room of the grade we had booked.
The good things about the hotel are very, very good.  The location is unbeatable, whether for business or leisure.  The staff is efficient and friendly (in a formal/trained way, rather than with heartfelt familiarity, it must be said).  We were evacuated at 5am on our last morning by a fire alarm (someone horsing around with the sprinklers, it transpired), and the quality of the staff showed very much then.  We climbed down from the 6th floor, were shown immediately how most quickly to exit, shepherded across to the Waldorf and made as comfortable as evacuation at such an hour with a 2 year old can allow.  Once you get to work out the space station lighting, aircon, etc., etc., and ignoring the rainbow lighting effects evidently designed for a brothel, the rooms are clean and pretty exceptionally laid out, with fabulous bathrooms. The hotel also provided a foldaway bed for our toddler.  When the Wi-Fi worked, it was excellent.  We were a little disappointed that there were several dozen foreign language TV channels, pay-to-view sites, etc., etc., but apparently only CBBC for the little one. The eateries throughout are excellent, with breakfast at a level one would expect for the price charged.
The bad points are that: the parking in front of the hotel is very restricted; the lifts for residents are restricted when the top-floor bar is open; the music as you get out of the lifts at ground floor is deafening; largely because of the roof-top bar, the public areas attract a pretty high ratio of what can really best be described as flash trash with cash.  
The topfloor bar has great views but is eye-wateringly expensive.  
Despite its location, this is a hotel more for those who want to wallow in luxury than for a family in need of somewhere to treat as a home-base for a London visit.  Luxury it certainly is: homely it certainly isn't.

148,Space Station 'ME',"We booked a weekend at The ME in February, not realising this would be during London Fashion Week. The hotel, being directly opposite Somerset House, was hosting several Fashion Week events, which made for a very interesting stay with some benefits but many annoying restrictions for guests. We were stopped and questioned at every door and lift area, to check that we were in fact guests and not Fashion Show gatecrashers! This became very tiresome by the end of our stay. We were also kept awake until the early hours on the first night due to very loud music in the ground floor lounge bar.
On arrival our car was quickly valet parked and our luggage was removed to our 'Chic Suite'.
We travelled up to the first floor for check in and stepped out of the lift into what can only be described as something out of futuristic movie set. 
The reception desk was found on the triangular base of a huge marble lined prism. The glazed pinnacle of this huge space towered 10 floors above us. A long undulating sofa, snaked its way across one side, with the desk on the other and a bar in one of the 3 corners. Check in was swift and efficient and after enjoying a glass of complimentary Prosecco, we headed to our suite.
The 'Chic' suites are found on the same floor as reception, through a door that takes you around the outside base of the prism. Very darkly lit, it felt more like a basement area than a first floor room.
The suite had dark wooden floors with separate lounge and bedroom areas, the walls were lined with white leather, padded sections and were lit with adjustable, coloured lighting.
The televisions and bar area were set behind large dark glass wall panels and the furniture was modern and comfortable, apart from the large bed which was one of the hardest and most uncomfortable I have slept on. My ribs and hip bones ached in the morning!
The bathroom was impressively large with a double sized shower, although you had to run around to get wet under the dual 'rain' heads. At least it was big enough to do so.
The bath was huge but annoyingly slow filling, although we were unable to use the shower or bath during the first day due to the lack of any hot water!
 Complimentary toiletries and an impressively stocked fridge and snack cupboard added to the 'Chic' Suite experience.
The narrow windows were set very high up with frosted glass, sliding blinds. These gave the room, along with the padded walls, a kind of unnerving 'cell' like quality which took until our second night there to get used to.
The public areas were very expensively designed and styled, giving the Hotel a kind of space age, other worldly feel.
The 'Radio' rooftop bar is a must for an evening cocktail with its own, Italian inspired, menu and spectacular views over the Thames and Strand areas of the city from its glass lined terraces.
The ground floor 'STK' restaurant is also highly recommended with succulent steaks and luscious desserts, such as 'Fairground Attraction' which is served on a tabletop ferris wheel containing miniature favourites such as candy floss and toffee apples.
Breakfast was served in the adjoining restaurant 'Cucina Asellina' with a very good self serve buffet and traditional hot breakfast menu. 
The Strand area theatres are right on the doorstep with Covent Garden and Chinatown within easy walking distance making the hotel a great base for shows and shopping.
I found the ME experience to be enjoyable but not entirely comfortable due to its over styled, space like design. I found myself strangely relieved to get back to my own relaxing space at home and my much more comfortable bed for a good nights sleep.",3,2015,04,12

148,Very good - bits could be improved,"Stayed one night on a business trip and was initially very impressed. It's a very modern and exclusive looking hotel. 

Good points - very friendly staff, spacious rooms, and a good atmosphere

Bad points - the music on arrival was very loud and off putting. The guest lifts are shared by the public using the rooftop bar, this lead to a long wait.

On the night of my stay the fire alarm went off during the middle of the night staff did not communicate with guests or explain what was happening. On checkout there was no apology or explanation.",4,2015,04,11

148,Style and luxury but missing something special,"We stayed here for a friends birthday in January. While I can't actually fault the hotel itself, the rooms are very small, and therefore expensive for the price paid. My friend was given an upgrade, and even this had  very little room to manoeuvre. However the surroundings and decor of the hotel are very impressive, so is perfect for a special occasion.

148,Wow wow wow,"Well what can I say about ME hotel London..... Arrived Friday 3rd april for Easter weekend. There had been a fire 2 days previous underground which meant parts of london had no electric. Me hotel included. They offered to move me to another hotel for free or I could stay in the hotel with no electric for free. I decided to stay as they upgraded me to a suite with complimentary access to the bar.
The electric came back on Saturday but they still refunded me the money for both nights.
Matias the hotel manager and guillaume the general manager could not do enough for you. In fact the whole team were unbelievable. This hotel really is a credit to our capital. This is by far the best hotel I have visited in England and I stay in nice hotels on a weekly basis. If you like to be treated special and enjoy the modern fine things in life then this hotel is really a must for you.
I would advise anyone of thinking of visiting London to book this hotel immediately.
5 star is not a good enough rating. This should be England's 1st 6 star hotel.

We are a family of four, and were celebrating our son's 21st birthday along with our youngest son, aged 12 years, on a 2 night stay.

We were met by the concierge, who was very welcoming, and arranged for our car to be moved and luggage to be taken, all superbly dealt with.  The Lobby is beautifully modern and staff super friendly.  We were escorted to reception on the first floor, all I can say is, WOW, this reception I can guarantee, you would never have experienced before, it is stunning and beautiful AND you are greeted immediately by the amazing Aura Team, who are there to ensure your stay at ME is the best experience for you.  You are given a very welcome glass of Prosecco and your incredible stay at ME begins.  You must experience the Radio Rooftop Bar. As we had our 12 year old son with us, the regulation is, that no one under the age of 21 after 5pm can enter, so we made sure we could visit before this time.  Another WOW!  In March, the sun shone and we felt like we were in some classy bar/lounge abroad!  You can admire the surrounding area from up high in luxury soft seating area and sip away on cocktails etc, and chill out completely and utterly.  The rooms were modern too, and super clean, lovely crisp, cotton bedding, comfortable bed and pillows.  I mentioned to Andrew from the Aura Team that I wanted to do something special for my son's 21st, and could the team help with this.  Andrew was totally on it! He is possibly the nicest, friendliest guy you will ever get to meet.  I was more than happy to chose the Velvet Package, which included half a bottle of Mo√´t on ice, a box of chocolates, a beautiful white rose, in his room and to have a message written on the bathroom mirror!  My youngest son chose the message.  If you want that extra special touch for your stay, you must use The Aura Team, they will deliver and more.  We ate at STK as our pre-theatre dinner.  The steaks are to die for, very pricey, but it was a special weekend and the food and service did not disappoint.  Breakfast, we've had better at equally priced hotels, I would re-consider adding this to our next stay with them, or maybe chose room service.  The staff were lovely, it was the quantity and quality, timing issues with toast and coffee arriving after you've eaten, and not being offered more than once, but it didn't ruin our stay at all.",5,2015,04,04
148,Management should be very proud of their staff!,"I have just returned from two nights at this hotel with my partner. First impressions were excellent, the concierge are very helpful with finding reception (it's quite a confusing hotel!) and we were greeted with prosecco whilst checking in. Check in was quick and easy and the room was spacious, comfortable and stylish. 
Unfortunately the next day there was a huge fire in the area and this part of London was completely shut off from electricity. The hotel ran on emergency generators for 24 hours, there was no electricity in the room but this did not spoil our stay. It made us realise how fantastic the staff are which can be a rarity in London (especially the Grange City and Grange St Paul's who are all miserable!!) candles were brought to rooms and staff were on hand at all times to assist. Everyone was so cool, calm and collected and they are an asset to the hotel. Everyone was smiling even though they had major issues, it just shows how brilliant the stay would have been if everything was up and running. I will definitely return. ",5,2015,04,02
148,"Nice place, poor management",A number of cigarets were thrown from the nightclub above onto the balcony making it unsafe to use. Complaint to management did not resolve the problem which continued. Poor handling of the complaint the next day; the manager declined to see us twice on our departure. Will not be using again.,1,2015,04,01
148,Great party hotel - not so good for business travellers,"Stayed for 1 night on a business trip.

The hotel lobby is very modern and impressive looking.  Check in was fast and included a welcome glass of champagne/prosecco. However it was quite dark and the music was quite loud, so I felt more like I was entering a nightclub than a hotel.

The room itself was clean and very minimal but the whole ambience of the hotel is that of a party hotel - it would be a great place to stay for a holiday but wan't very relaxing or suitable for me as a business traveller.

The room is well equipt with drinks and snacks (including martini glasses) on open shelves but the lack of a proper minibar/fridge means this is quite impractical.

Good shower and high quality tolietries.

Bed was big and comfy and there are loads of mirrors everywhere if that is your thing!",3,2015,04,01
148,Amazing Engagement Weekend !!!,I stayed at this hotel on Saturday 28th March as a surprise for my Girlfriend on our one year anniversary. I also planned to propose at the hotel in the evening. I can not fault Catherine the Aura host who made it perfect by helping me create a surprise in our room when we returned from dinner. I can not fault this hotel all staff are so helpful and professional. We will definitely be returning in the future!!!!!!,5,2015,04,01
148,posh travel lodge,"Interesting design but wasn't expecting a night club on top floor so expect to share the lift areas with lots of drunk revellers  after your night out. Not sure what market they are aiming for, modern stunning interior  but doses it attract the same style of person in the public areas that have paid to stay.  The bar/night club on the top floor would be nice for lunch, good views but you don't need to be a resident.  The bed could only be described as  a wooden board with feather topper.  Bedrooms are very technical touch panels, big TV, mood lighting, good bathroom.  Sex toys in the mini bar area and sexy lighting switch fills the room with red led if you are in to all that, maybe they are aiming for the person that got lucky on the 10th floor!   Plenty of hotels around that offer a  better overall experience,   but if you only want a room,  it's a posh travel lodge with finesse.",2,2015,04,01
148,"High quality, great service, stellar location","Everything about this hotel was great for our first trip to London. Our goals were being able to walk to restaurants and shops in our neighborhood, sightseeing, eating, and relaxing.

The employee at the check-in desk was so friendly and gave us a great pub recommendation nearby for lunch since we arrived too early for check-in (The Wellington across the street). She also offered us a larger room than we had booked, invited us back to check in 30 minutes early, and to a unique light show in their lobby with complimentary champagne that evening.

Our king room was spacious, modern and beautiful and the bed/pillows were comfortable. The bathroom was spacious compared to other bathrooms we've had in Europe, and the shower passed my 6'4"" husband's size test. It had a rain shower head and a wand. The amenities were luxurious and I loved the quality and scent of the bath products.

The location is close to tons of shops and restaurants in Covent Garden. Starbucks is only a 2 minute walk. We walked to Covent Garden Market, the Cambridge Theatre and to dinner in Covent Garden almost every night. (Cichetti, Giovanni's and Sophie's Steakhouse were our favorites, Jamie's Italian was disappointing). It's also a direct walk down the Strand through Trafalger Square to Buckingham Palace and the Westminster sights. There is a Big Bus stop (#15) across the street in front of the One Aldwych Hotel's door which was very convenient, and we bought our tickets from the concierge desk in the lobby. We took taxis to the City and Kensington/Notting Hill areas, but I believe the Tube is convenient enough from here.

The concierge set up in-room massages for us which were great.

The lobby bar, Penfold's, was a great place for a nightcap or to start the evening with a drink before going to dinner. We didn't try any of the in-hotel restaurants during our stay.

I would definitely stay at another ME or Melia property, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to be in London for pleasure/sightseeing/shopping/eating.",5,2015,03,31

148,"Great value, high quality, exemplary service","Booked into hotel for single night with family having searched exhaustively for a quality centrally-located hotel at a reasonable price. Having stayed in significantly more expensive hotels in London, I have become acutely aware that high cost does not equate to high quality. However, having booked the ME hotel, I couldn't fault any aspect.
The hotel is suberbly located minutes walk from the heart of Covent Garden. The lobby, reception and public areas are uber-modern, clean and impressive. The style does not end at the public spaces. The rooms are reasonably spacious, clean and ultra high-tech with stylish finishing in the bedrooms and bathrooms complemented by computer controlled mood-lighting. The hotel accomadated our 9 year old daughter with a comfy rollaway bed which was in place as promised following the evening turndown service.
The staff were highly welcoming and charming to a man. The reception and concierge staff were impeccable and engaging.
I would highly recommend this hotel. Suberb quality at highly competitive rates.",5,2015,03,30

148,"5 star hotel, excellent","Great hotel, luxury at its finest. If you can afford it well worth the stay. Room fantastic and staff were great !. Location great for the west end shows would stay again, Birthday present from my wife",5,2015,03,29
148,"5 star in deed, Marvelous!","Service was fabulous, clean rooms and a very high priority hotel! Superb members of staff, especially Ahmed the night manager. Worth the money! Was for a birthday and would definitely return back again. 10/10",5,2015,03,28
148,Stylish and luxurious let down by minor mistakes,"My partner and I stayed at ME on a Friday evening in March. We often take ourselves away for the evening in London for some quality 'couple' time. On first impressions ME didn't fail to impress! The friendliness and professionalism of the front of house staff followed by the spectacular reception area with a light inspired atrium, possibly the best reception area in any hotel we've seen so far. 

The room didn't fail to impress either with one of the most detailed (and expensive) mini bars and finishes. Literally supplying everything you could possibly need for a intimate couples evening (!) we particularly lived the enormous bath :) 

Was a little disappointed to find no mirror in the bedroom to blow dry my hair and the bathroom mirror not having the appropriate electrical sockets, after blow drying and straightening my hair on my hand held mirror we left for the evening....

We had planned to visit the famous restaurant STK but on visiting found it way to busy with large groups of men and women with the music very loud, felt as though we were in an Essex night club unfortunately so decided to eat out of the hotel. 

On returning we had a good nights sleep (despite the enormous king bed actually being two beds pushed together and having to fight over who gets the crack down the centre) this was quickly dampened by an incredibly rude room service attendant, his phone manner was abrupt and unhelpful and didn't appreciate being asked to rectify the 3 mistakes on our order.

This hotel is 5* and the price reflects as such but unfortunately was let down by the  crowd in STK and manner of some of the staff. 

We will however be returning for the pure trendy design of the building and fantastic views from the Radio Roof top bar :)",3,2015,03,28
148,Trendy hotel in great location,"I recently spent five nights in this hotel while on a business trip. The room was very spacious for central London. Amenities in the room were lovely, including fresh bottles of water every evening. The location is fantastic, although it seems that they're currently doing some work at the Covent Garden tube station which means that it is closed for outbound travelers. 

The only complaints I have are around the shower, which did not have great water pressure and the lighting in the hallways. As a woman traveling alone, I was not comfortable with the darkness in the corridors although I understand what they were trying to do from a design perspective. ",4,2015,03,28
148,black is the colour,Stayed for one night as visiting the theatre and wanted central location. Location excellent for The Strand and Covent Garden. Modern d√©cor - black and white if you like that look! Couldn't quite see the river from the balcony so not really worth the extra. Roof top bar a bonus and on a nice evening a good outdoor space. Bed large and comfy. Staff friendly and helpful.,3,2015,03,27
148,Coolest hotel in London,"Spent 2 nights at ME London on my honeymoon and loved every minute.

The hotel is very trendy and modern in a perfect location on the Strand with Covent Garden and the Theatres on its door step and South Bank just over the Thames.

All the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

We had a 'Mode' room which was great and to be honest even bigger than we expected from looking at photos online! Great bathroom and cool in room features.

I personally loved 'Radio' the roof top bar which had amazing views of London day and night. It also serves great cocktails and tapas!

I've stayed in a couple of 5 star hotels in London and this is my favourite, I would highly recommend. ",5,2015,03,26
148,We picked a bad week-end to visit!,"We visited during London Fashion Week and the Check-In area was in complete chaos.  Our room wasn't ready and the staff were stressed and unable to cope.  When we finally made it to our room it was obvious that it had been prepared in a hurry and the bathroom was dirty with water splashes and marks down the glass doors and dirty floor.  We tried to call reception to report the problem but the phone just rang and rang, so we gave up and cleaned the bathroom ourselves!  The Rooftop Bar was absolutely packed and we were unable to buy a drink in the evening and finally Check-Out was as difficult and Check-In had been.  The lift was full and we had to wait for about 30 mins to make it down to Reception, only to discover that the Check-out had temporarily been moved to a different floor due to London Fashion Week..... We hadn't been told.....  On a positive the bed was lovely and comfy and we did sleep well.  Difficult to say if this was just a 'one-off' and if on a normal weekend we would have been looked after better ??  We paid top price for poor service and not the standard we'd hoped for.",1,2015,03,26
148,Amazing Hotel,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to feel like royalty, the staff are so attentive and make you feel very special.  This was a trip to treat my husband for his birthday and from the time we arrived they made up both feel very special,  they greeted us with a glass of prosecco, checked us in early and organised a bottle of prosecco in our room and chocolates.  Plus a very personable touch on the bathroom mirror.  They made us both feel very special and I can not wait to return.

148,problems free,"First visit to an ME hotel having tried Melia and Gran Melia previously. Everything was as expected except aircon which did not function on arrival, but had been fixed following a call to reception when we returned after dinner, everything else was as to be expected from a hotel of this price in this class. A few nice extras such as chocolates, water and a hangover kit in the room were appreciated",4,2015,03,25
148,rooms are too small,"Not value for money, staff not well trained, overall desigh was too high tech, over enginnered, not very relax for family stay. Stayed during london fasion week, it was too busy and loud. When u have young kids, it was very stressful. We were not told before booking.

100% recommend this to anyone especially couples","The room was amazing and the bathroom so luxurious!

148,Excellent Experience from start to finish,"From the moment we checked in we were greeted by a very charming and helpful gentleman, we mentioned we were staying for our anniversary and the next moment we were presented with a glass of prosecco each. We stayed in one of the suites which was simply beautiful, spotless and lots of little treats litered throughout the rooms. 
We then had dinner in STK - once again, by far the best restaurant in London, and finally we went to the Radio Rooftop Bar for stunning views of London.
There is nothing about this hotel and our stay that wasn't perfect and I would highly recommend to anyone - thank you so much.",5,2015,03,24

148,Corporate Stay-> Great hospotality,"Stayed here April 2014 for business and came back again in March 2015 for a business hosting program. The concierge is by far the most attentive, precise, and generous I have ever experienced (and I host at a lot of different hotels globally). Any request we had for our program was done without hesitation and they would go above and beyond our asks. They truly are genuine men that love their jobs!
The hotel is always clean and location is prime, being right next to the strand.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and co-workers for either leisure or business hosting.",5,2015,03,23
148,ME HOTEL - London's secret escape,"Out of all the current hot spots available to luxuriate in on a Friday night, ME London has your evening down to a 'T'.

Nestled in Central London, round the corner to Somerset House - the glorious home to London Fashion Week, ME is the sexy little number with a beguiling atmosphere filled with the promise of a spectacular evening.

We went to Radio Rooftop, met by a room filled with hot London bright young things and ordered a few delicious cocktails. As the night continued on the DJ spun the perfect soundtrack to our evening, with the cherry on top being the spectacular views from the balcony.

All in all, the drinks, incredible staff and DJ made our night and will no doubt be seeing us again soon.",5,2015,03,23

Great place to stay if you want a bit of modern class. But there are better rooftop bars in London to go to.",4,2015,03,21

148,Spectacular Pyramid Lobby!,"Being inside the giant white marble pyramid lobby is unique and the wonderful light show displayed on the walls is quite mesmerizing...they offer you a chilled prosecco while you're checking in (or even sometimes if you're passing thru the reception!) and the very laid back sofa is ideal for watching the show.  Very friendly staff and management.  Rooms are sound proofed and modern,  beds are very big and very comfortable, sexy lighting.  The Twin Rain Showers are great.  TV system is over complicated and often malfunctions and there is no CNN! Telephone answering can take ages...even when calling the hotel from outside. The heated rooftop bar has fab views of London but can get very busy at weekends as does the STK franchise. The Marconi bar is modern but can get drafty at weekends with the influx of restaurant and party goers...the simple modern Italian restaurant serves simple breakfasts and light meals...room service food is limited...but there are plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby.",4,2015,03,18

148,Glamorous hotel perfect location!,"Smart hotel, full of beautiful people but all very friendly. For such a glamorous hotel we were made to feel very welcome. All the staff we encountered we very friendly and helpful. Nice touch with a glass of Prosecco on arrival. Expensive room rate for the size of room but I guess that's what you pay for with the location (5 mins walk from Covent Garden).",4,2015,03,16
148,Can I go back...now please!?,"My boyfriend and I just came back from a weekend in this hotel and it was amazing! As soon as you walk through the door you notice the striking design and are greeted by wonderful staff. Reception is breathtaking, we were offered Prosecco/water upon arrival. I couldn't stop looking up at the ceiling and displays. We were served by a wonderful lady on reception, sadly I don't remember her name (we checked in 14th march 3pm) who was ever so friendly and helpful. Our bags were taken up to our room for us which was a help. The bed was ever so comfortable and the mood lights were fabulous! I want one in my home!! We decided to go to the bar on the roof but quickly left after one very expensive cocktail each (I wasn't made aware of the ¬£4 service charge), sadly we couldn't see much of the view as it was cut off for VIP but then we did go late on a Saturday night. We left our bags there after we checked out so that we didn't have to carry them around with us, staff were happy to help. The hotel and most of the staff were great, only bad thing was probably other guests as we were looked down upon by many, maybe because we're a young couple in early 20's or just didn't fit their expectations of 'proper guests'. All in all, an absolutely brilliant hotel.",5,2015,03,16
148,Generally very good but with some flaws,"I was really excited to stay at this hotel having read so many great reviews. Arrival was great, very helpful door staff and the reception area was stunning. I was offered a complimentary glass of prosecco on arrival - nice touch but it was flat, a shame. I booked a suite on the 9th floor with a balcony which was spacious and had many cool features. The balcony was quite small but had great views over the City. My main gripes with the hotel  - the attitude of the staff maning the three elevators. First impressions are everything and when my partner and I asked why the lifts were not working. The lady just shrugged and said she only mans one of the three lifts, the one to the Rooftop bar. We just stood there and she did nothing. We asked if there were stairs, and she said 'yes'..we just stood there some more, 'er where are they then?' was our follow up. We then had to walk up the emergency exist stairwell to the check in desk. Not a great start, especially for a 5 star hotel. Also, guests cannot travel from their room floor to the rooftop restaurant, instead, like a yo yo, you have to take the elevator from the 9th floor to the lobby, back up to the rooftop bar, and then to get back to the room, back to the ground, then back up to the 9th. Its very annoying.  The other gripe was the characters that were around the hotel on Saturday night, many very drunk people hanging around outside, hoping to get admission to the rooftop bar. A few were even sitting in the entry lobby. Not as classy as I had hoped.",4,2015,03,16
148,Perfect stay!,"The top class service started the moment we entered this hotel.  I hadn't even stepped fully out of the cab and the concierge and porters were there to help.  Perfectly efficient and polite.  The reception staff couldn't do enough for us and we enjoyed a glass of Prosecco while we waited the few minutes it took us to check in.  We were here for two nights.  The hotel itself is stylish, spotlessly clean and very calming.  Room 909 was perfect!  The room was immaculate, spacious and provided a large balcony which overlooked the city.  It took us a while to work out the lighting, but then we're not technically minded..... but we got there in the end!  The bathroom suite again was immaculate and spacious.  Especially the Bali shower.... that was Fun!  We didn't use the restaurants except for breakfast (which offered a good variety), so I can't really comment, but the afternoon tea in the lobby bar was just lovely.   I would highly recommend this Hotel, and if there was an option to rate the staff separately, they would get 5 stars without a doubt.",5,2015,03,16

The upper level has a VIP entrance to the roof top bar and remote curtains plus lots of add on extras and advantages usual when staying in the best room in such an iconic hotel.

148,Excelent modern hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for our 25th Wedding anniversary. The staff are very helpful and polite and we were very well looked after. This is a great modern hotel.

148,Fantastic from start to finish,"Great hotel just off Covent garden. Loved from the moment we walked into the hotel to sipping champagne on
The rooftop terrace. Only downside was the service at breakfast was slow. But apart from
That loved it and can't wait to go back. ",5,2015,03,08
148,Great Location/If you like trendy,"First of all, this is a very trendy hotel. If you like trendy, give it a try.  The bellman was excellent, the concierge team was great.  Beyond the front door though, there are some issues that we could not look past. As a previous review noted, housekeeping is truly annoying!  They would knock on the door several times a day at random times, once we came back to the room in late afternoon and room was not serviced.  They were intrusive and truly annoying.  On top of that, they only stocked us with Decaf coffee on a couple of nights, and left a clearly dirty, empty martini glass for the entire duration of our stay (5 nights).  It became a joke to us...""let's see if they finally take that glass today"".  
They constantly badgered us to get in and check the mini bar.  GO AWAY.

The bathroom had mold on the floor near the shower, and the shower door would not shut, allowing water to splash out.  we actually called maintenance to repair it along with a broken light next to the bed.  They fixed the bed light but never did anything to the shower door so we just endured it.

The Radio rooftop bar was again...trendy.  Great view but the service was harried, annoyed and no fun at all.  The lobby bar staff have zero (and I do mean zero) personality.  The hotel tries SO HARD to be hip, but they don't try very hard to make sure it is well maintained and that service is up to speed.

Lobby looks really cool, but front desk staff is not helpful at all.  We had to ask them to point out how to get to our room.  

Location is terrific.  I would not stay here again, but I would drop by to say high to the nice bellman and concierge, though.",3,2015,03,08
148,Lovely hotel,"Stayed at the ME London for my husbands surprise 50th bday celebrations. Hotel def has the wow factor and is in a very good location for Covent Garden. Very clean and staff are all very pleasant and helpful. The rooms have everything you would need for a couple of nights stay. The mini bar and coffee machine were very nice and the chocolates left on bed with the turn down service was a nice touch.

148,Small room with a great view,The room is on the small side but has a great balcony and bathroom which compensates. I did offer feedback to them as was surprised for a 5* hotel that the sheets were stained dusty edges and walls need a repaint. We did enjoy our stay but it does lack atmosphere and is very dark everywhere. ,3,2015,03,07

Our particular suite was of a ""Sanderson"" feel with real wow factor, full of plenty of luxury extras and gadgets for us to enjoy. Hotel appeared to be family friendly (but not in any way noisy). For a weekend away of romantic venue I would highly recommend.  A really memorable experience and I would love to return.",5,2015,03,07
148,Modern.  quirky.  ...but Annoying staff.,"Loved this hotel.  Loved.  The area is second to none, the lobby is amazing, rooms were very modern, bed was comfortable.. BUT the staff was pretty annoying.  No real welcome to the hotel..  they take your bags when you enter the door and you don't see them again until after you check in.  

Check is was clumsy as the clerk struggled with the computer.  She also spent lots of time helping a coworker with another guess who arrived after I did..  I felt like this was a huge waste of my time. 

Cleaning staff is also annoying.  They kept banging on the door asking to clean the room right after check in.  Then they wanted to look at the mini bar..  I eventually told them to ""go away"".

I ate at STK, was pretty nice.  Radio bar is very cool.  great views.  

I would recommend this hotel and stay there again.. but be prepped for some annoying staff.",4,2015,03,07

148,Enter into another dimension...,"We arrived at night, and it was hard to believe this place was a hotel. If the entrance is discrete from the outside, the music in the entrance hall was very present, and the overall atmosphere made us feel we entered a trendy night club. Once you reach the reception, you are wondering if you have entered another dimension. The lighting show and the grand decor are quite amazing. Once you get to the room, you are definitely not in this world anymore. 

We had a great time in this hotel. The staff was nice and competent, the room (small suite) was very comfortable and also entertaining (remember, your on a spaceship...). Something very different.",5,2015,03,04
148,Wow! Simply wonderful!,"I booked a couple of nights for my husband's birthday.  We spend a lot of time in London for days away and usually just stay in one of the budget hotels in Covent Garden.  As this was a special occasion and a surprise I wanted great location and modern luxury, especially since my husband works in the hotel refurbishment industry and is very particular about good workmanship!  We got exactly that - excellent location and this hotel is superb.  Extremely modern in decor and just oozes sophistication from the moment you walk in and see the Marconi bar in the hotel lobby.  Absolutely amazing reception area on the first floor, luxurious rooms (we booked an Aura room), extremely comfy bed and breakfast was superb.

148,Credit card problems,"Stayed here for one night. Bit of a maze to find reception but impressive once I found it. The hotel was fine, room was clean, good mini bar selection, little balcony was an added bonus (although you have to pay for this).
Didn't try any of the other hotel facilities so can't comment on those.
However, several months after I had stayed here I was (luckily) checking my credit card statement and noticed that the hotel had charged a sneaky bit of money onto my card for no reason.  Shame on them.  Reported to my credit card company and had to go through the hassle of getting a new credit card etc.  Not happy.",2,2015,02,25
148,ME London,ME London is one of the best Hotel in London centrally located at Strand Street. Its just 10 mins from Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace. The rooms are very luxurious and with great lighting and Music in rooms. I occupied the Aura Rooms. The Hotel offers you a complimentary drink everyday. The reception of the Hotel is the highlight of the Hotel. Great helpful staff and hospitality. The rooms are very spacious. The only downside would be its pricing starting from Pound 199 (+ taxes) excluding breakfast. It is close to Covent Garden makes it a most happening place to stay. its a worth a stay at ME London.,5,2015,02,25

the reception area light show is a knockout..go and sit there for 10 minutes after you have checked in..The rooftop Radio bar has exceptional views
down the Thames across the city...but the management clearly allow nonresidents in to the detriment of the whole vibe..on a week night one it was
not very sophisticated given the prices and location..spoilt the whole hotel experience!",4,2015,02,24
148,Unexpected positive experience.,"One of the coolest hotels I've stayed in. Excellent service! I wish we had more time to make use of all facilities. We arrived in the afternoon, got a glass of prosecco at check-in. Our room (with a view of the river) was not ready yet so we took our drinks to the radio bar on the roof and relaxed in the sun. When the room was ready I got a call and a text and our luggage had already been delivered to the room. The room was small but very clean and nice. Enjoyed a nice afternoon tea in the ground floor bar. We missed out on the light show in the reception and we didn't eat in the hotel. At return from our night out we had a look into the restaurant on the ground floor and the atmosphere was boiling - like being in Brazil. Finished the evening in the roof top bar which had turned into a cool club. Check out was very smooth and we definitely are keen on going to other ME hotels, and also to return to this one!",5,2015,02,24
148,Excellent staff,"Funky hotel with excellent staff.  Rooms are spotless, although I did find the glass doors into the bathroom a little uncomfortable at first.  Our son found it hard to find the bathroom in the night, due to the sliding glass doors.  He said its the best (extra bed) he has slept in.
 I couldn't fault the staff, especially reception and the concierge service.  Breakfast is very good, if you want something hot it is cooked to order.  The rooftop bar has great views and a good ambience.

We were there during the London fashion week so the place was heaving just managed to get to the Radio once and was told off the second time when we sat for a few seconds by the table with reserved on it - it was ashame because she could have been nicer because all the staffs are very friendly and welcoming not very common for a 5 star hotel. We met the Aura manager (I lost his card), he took his time to our take some photos of us, chat with us without rushing, offered anything despite his busy day ahead (fashion events), it holds the same with Lara Mariani the Asst. Aura manager. Breakfast is very good at the Cucina Asellina. Our bedroom not the biggest but it was clean, fresh linens and towels, and turn down service with chocolates and a quote card. Can't ask for more!",5,2015,02,23

148,Must do Better,"I always try when reviewing to be fair and not complain for the sake of it and this is a hotel that I have loved & visited many times since it opened, I have stayed twice this year and noticed how the standards have slipped. This is bad enough for any hotel, But completely unacceptable for a 5 star & the prices charged. First of all the maintenance of the rooms need an overhaul, to find that the wall hanging toilet is loose & the shower heads are so blocked with limescale that the water is shooting up to the ceiling. This is just to highlight two things that were wrong with the bathroom, there were more that I won't go into. I also had a issue with the Breakfast service, which I believe is franchised, running out of teapots so tea-bag in a cup, running out of white toast to name two.
But my biggest complaint is how the final bill is never correct, I had two rooms as it was a birthday  celebration and ordered champagne to be in the rooms on arrival. this was not ordered on line but at reception the last time I stayed. No champagne in the rooms on arrival, so I thought that maybe they would be there later when we returned from shopping, nothing ever arrived but when we checked out we were charged for 4 bottles of champagne.plus another overcharge. I stay at a lot of hotels in the year and I rarely find final bills correct. Needless to say all of these complaints I took up with reception. Its no good writing a review on a site like this if you have not already complained to the source. On the positive side The Hotel is beautifully designed in a great area of London. It is saved by its staff, who are fantastic and very helpful. So what can the problem be. It has to be management, which I am told keeps changing. None of this is good enough & that is why I say must do better.",3,2015,02,22
148,Excellent stay!,"Absolutely love this hotel; So modern with the decor, fixings and gadgets! Booking online was easy and I could add a late check-out during the booking process which is a very good option! Staff were well presented and always friendly, bit confusing with Reception being on the 1st floor, Concierge must get a lot of people approaching them on arrival to check-in! A lovely touch being offered a glass of Prosecco on arrival as well! Lift/key system was a little confusing at first but, once you understood it, was a nice little touch for privacy. Stayed in the Mode room and had requested a bath which was allocated thankfully, walk-in shower was also available but tended to spray in every direction so was a bit messy to use. Amenities provided are spot-on and the minibar selection is excellent. Electronics in the room are perfect for creating a variety of atmospheres and moods, and the chill-out music-mix set on turndown was a lovely touch! Room service was excellent, the food from STK is amazing! Just felt a little sorry for the room service girl trying to support a very heavy tray, then almost locked myself out struggling to get it out of the door when i'd finished. Overall really enjoyed my stay and will definitely be returning as soon as possible!",5,2015,02,20

Very good service and nicely sized rooms and high levels of comfort. a typical business hotel (where they DONT charge you to get WiFi) but also ideal for a theater weekend in London where you also want the higher end of hotel services. . . .the fitness center could use an larger and more well equipped room, but this is ambly compensated buy a truly friendly staff. . . .I will be back.",4,2015,02,19

However, when I got food poisoning from the food at the rooftop bar I alerted the staff that I would need to stay another night as I was deathly ill.  There was no discount for this upgraded suite that I had not planned on stating in and a casual apology over the phone seemed trite.  Aside from that one meal the room service was quick and quite delicious and the various bars in the hotel where delightful.  The rooms seemed very small though for the price.

Room was nice, good amenities but had to ring house keeping for an iron- thats a pet hate of mine! We had  two cocktails in the roof top bar before heading to the Shard for dinner- they were tasty. One small complaint-Every table outside on the balcony was reserved which was a bit annoying as the place was half empty.We asked could we sit outside and finish our drink before we headed and we were told we could have the table for ten minutes. Shame we couldn't sit there longer as the views over London were great! I'd stay in the Me London again & would recommend it to friends. Just make sure and book a table in the bar!!",4,2015,02,18
148,Weekend in London,"My boyfriend and I live in New York and decided to go to London for a long weekend for President's Day. We tried the ME hotel based on a recommendation from a friend.

The hotel is very centrally located (in the Strand) with Temple and Holborn stations within short walking distance. The decor is quite modern - slightly ""clubby"" in the sense that it's quite dark and the lobby plays relatively loud music throughout the day. When we checked in there were guests checking out who had been complaining about the noise from the restaurant so we were slightly wary but fortunately our room was either well sound-proofed or higher up so the noise was less noticeable.

The rooms are quite spacious with a big king size bed. Overall it is very modern and ""techy"", definitely focused more on decor than practicality - for example the lights and thermostat are controlled by a central control located next to the bed (it took us a while to figure it out). The closets are quite small - decent size for a long weekend but not for a week or longer. Also the window in our room was quite small so there was not a whole lot of natural light but on the positive side we couldn't hear any noise from the streets. 

Breakfast is served in the Italian restaurant (Cucina Asellina) and they have a choice of a buffet (for approx. ¬£25 per person) or a la carte. The restaurant is very bright and the food was well prepared. If breakfast is not included and you don't want a big breakfast, I would recommend ordering a la carte because the buffet choices were slightly limited unless you order from the hot buffet menu.

During our stay we had a drink at the downstairs bar (Marconi's) - it is relatively quiet and has some nice cocktails. I would recommend it for a pre-dinner drink. We also tried to go to their roof terrace club/bar called Radio on a Saturday but were told it was fully booked (even for hotel guests) - we ended up going for a quick drink on Monday and although it had nice views we didn't find it was spectacular. If you're planning to go there on a weekend I would recommend booking ahead of time to guarantee entry.

Staff in general were nice and polite. We definitely enjoyed our stay there but would probably not recommend it for families or couples seeking a cosy/romantic hotel - I think it would be enjoyable for groups of friends or young couples for a weekend getaway in London. ",4,2015,02,18

148,"Great location, great service, stunning rooms","I've stayed at ME in a few countries and the standard of the rooms/service/location is always superb. The bed incredibly comfortable and the room stylishly decorated. It's like your own sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of central London while being right in the centre of it. Tip: join the reward scheme (for free) and receive points during your stay which result in cheaper subsequent stays (and trust me, you'll want to stay at one of their hotels again) plus by joining the reward scheme you're already saving money on the normal room rate, you get a glass of prosecco on arrival and ¬£20 to spend at the hotel every day you're there.

I chose this place to propose to my girlfriend (she said yes thankfully) and the hotel staff made everything possible for me. I informed them of my idea to propose a week before my stay and from the off they couldn't of been more helpful. They gave me a free room upgrade, booked me a dinner reservation when everywhere I tried was fully booked, and treated us like royalty the entire time. I would also like to make a special mention to one of the concierge team. Emiliano Del Pizzo, He was an absolute gentlemen, nothing was too much trouble for him and I can't thank him enough for everything he did for me and my new fianc√©e. He really put a personal touch on everything and made it feel like he was there to solely help us.

148,Birthday weekend ,"We visited The ME is a lovely hotel in the old BBC headquarters building near Covent Garden that was internally redesigned by Norman Foster to celebrate my birthday. The building was stunning to say the least which made our stay an utter delight. 

When we checked in we were offered a glass of fizz while we enjoyed the fascinating pyramid shaped marble entrance hall with beautiful light show. 

Our room was one of the loveliest rooms I have had the pleasure to stay in, it was a fusion of hi tec and luxury. Every whim was catered for from tablet controlled lighting in various colours to a Nespresso machine, cocktail glasses & shaker, full bar and a large variety of delightful snacks. There were even quirky products like the Koibito ""Hangover kit"" & ""love Kit"" the later including a feather and much much more. 

The bed was very comfortable but my favourite was the power shower with large shower head whice was delight. 

We were given 2 free cocktails of our choice which we had in the cocktail bar  and our server was a delightful young lady from Latvia who who couldn't do enough for us. 

Later on we went to the rooftop bar that has beautiful views of the skyline. My advice is to make a reservation because it is very popular. 

Overall this is a fine hotel with quick access to Covent Garden as well a beautiful design, sophistication and friendly staff.

148,There is better available at this price,"I stayed for one night on the basis of a friend's recommendation. Whilst the hotel is stylish in it's architecture there were just too many small faults for a price of about ¬£300 excluding breakfast.

We were meant to get vouchers worth ¬£20 each - hopefully my friend who booked got the value deducted when he checked out because they certainly didn't actively issue anything. The room was stylish, but there were water marks/stains on taps and surfaces in the bathroom. Given how new this place is, it should still sparkle.

The coffee machines in the rooms are not simple to use.
I had ordered a Daily Telegraph for the morning, and received The Times.
The complementary toiletries in the bathroom were distinctly mundane.
After going out for a coffee in the morning I returned to find my room key had been deactivated before I had checked out.
The STK restaurant was excellent for our evening meal - great atmosphere and the staff very welcoming. This contrasts with the RADIO bar, where although we were residents clearly having a good time but not behaving inappropriately we were given the third degree before being allowed in, and not made to feel at all welcome.

Another good point was the politeness of reception staff, who were welcoming and helpful.

If you like the style of this place try South Place Hotel. It is similar but is far better in every aspect with the exception of the view from RADIO. 

I won't be returning to the ME",2,2015,02,13

I like gadgets, so the room was right up my street with fab tech on each wall. I wouldn't book my mum in however as I doubt she'd be able to turn the lights on/off!

Our conference was in the ME room. This was an underground location with no windows(this is normal tbh). The aircon didn't seem too effective as many colleagues commented on it being stuffy and uncomfortable. Couldn't work out if the carpet was dirty or just unfortunately patterned. The presenters were all given microphones and these worked a treat, the video display was the right size for the room and visible to everyone. Free wifi has a strong signal, was fast and did not drop out once. 

We had a drinks reception in the Marconi bar. This was a visually strange setting and the decor gave the impression you were in a high tech prison or perhaps trapped in a futuristic pipe organ. The waiting staff were attentive and very helpful. They did not close the area and it was very apparent other hotel guests were enjoying our corporate bar tab - thankfully not mine :) I could not say that I wouldn't have taken advantage as a guest in the same situation!!

There seemed to be a lot of security staff milling about at reception - it must really kick off here at times! This was more overbearing than reassuring. 

We finished the evening in the radio bar on the roof. The comfortable outdoor seating that gave the best views was closed all night and we were penned into a small patio area around the heaters. This was such a disappointment as it was the main selling point for the bar!? Thankfully great company made up for this - however I wouldn't bother to visit again. Sushisamaba, Vista and Aqua offer a better experience. Again lots of security milling around with no apparent purpose they were polite - but left me on edge waiting for a fight to break out somewhere. 

I'd stay at the hotel again if I needed to be in this part of town and was with someone who hadn't stayed before, but I wouldn't bother with the bars or food.",3,2015,02,13
148,Great place,"Wow as hotels go this place is great, the room was clean, well presented and enjoyable, the service was first class and reception was great.
Size was out of this world and crisp sheets & quality services.
Will recommend this to all a little pricey but worth it for a special evening or weekend away.
Friendly staff and atmosphere!",5,2015,02,12
148,Hip But Not Functional,"The ME, which is the site of the old BBC headquarters, is in a wonderful location and easy walking distance to theaters, Convent Garden and other great attractions. The morning breakfast buffet is fantastic and is included in the room rate. This is what they call a ""lifestyle hotel,"" which means the atmosphere is better than the functionality. I stayed there for a week and the rooms, while fine, are small and the technology in them are virtually impossible to figure out. The simple task of turning on a light is a huge challenge due to some complex system involving a mini IPAD next to the bed. Good luck even turning on the lights in the bathroom in the morning. Either they need an improved ""training"" system when you check in or someone needs to revamp electrical system. I'm technology proficient and I couldn't figure out how to turn my bedroom lights off in less than 15 minutes each night. As to to evening turndown, each room has ambient pink neon lighting so when you return to your room each evening, you find it lit up like a bordello with soft music playing. I was afraid of who might be in my bed waiting for me. This hotel is the classic style over substance. The people look great but expect average service at best because they were hired for looks and not hospitality. If you would like to know what it is to sleep in a nightclub environment, this is it. I like a modern contemporary hotel, but someone didn't think this through. They need to get the basics right. Having a ""sexy light"" next to the bed (really, this is an option on the IPAD next to the bed) is not enough for a great stay.",3,2015,02,11
148,Mixed feelings,"Booked and prepaid room for ¬£270/night. Greeted warmly on arrival and concierge took care of luggage (more later) and directed us to reception on first floor. Certainly the wow factor here with huge atrium, projections on the wall and welcome glass of fizz on arrival. Given room key and advised there were 'handles' on the shower. 

Got to room and it was a disabled modified room. At the price paid, would have expected a non-disabled room, upgrade to next level room, or full disclosure at check in. A full hour after check in, luggage was still nowhere to be seen so a call to reception was made and a promise of a call back to confirm their whereabouts was not forthcoming. Went to concierge to collect them myself to receive an apology but they were short staffed and would be with us ASAP. 15 minutes later, they turned up. 

This made us late for our plans so had to rush to quickly get ready to go out, hence no chance to complain about the room as feared doing so before our baggage arrived, would delay things further.

an expensive night's stay and would have expected a bit better though I'm sure location is enough of a draw to stay.  Room itself was clean and functional with plenty of modern twists, I just think more attention to overall customer experience should be considered. 

Admittedly, didn't make comment at check-out as again, had plans and needed to leave quickly and saw no point in making a complaint after the event so am happy to generally recommend the hotel, just the initial experiences tainted the stay.

148,Real WOW Factor In A Prime Location In London,Working in the travel Industry I am lucky enough to stay in some of the leading hotels of the world.Having just stayed at The Me London I can not praise this fantastic hotel enough .From the moment you walk through the door it is 5 star service all the way.If you are looking for a fantastic WOW factor hotel in an amazing location this is the hotel for you.The service is second to none as are the rooms with the added benefit of having one of the top restaurants in London STK on tap.I really can not recommend this beautiful hotel enough.,5,2015,02,11
148,Great Hotel!,"Great service and great atmosphere! Rooms are very clean, Staff is very friendly and the hotel is decently priced. Overall a very high quality hotel in one of the nicest areas of London. Will certainly come back and definitely recommend it! ",5,2015,02,10
148,"Great stay, location, atmosphere, rooms... total package","Really enjoyed staying here right in the middle of Fashion week and the place was alive with the buzz of it all. The rooms were fantastic, the staff were very helpful. The bar downstairs is a little low key but that is made up for in bucket loads by how amazing the Radio Bar is on the rooftop. Even if you arent staying here go and sample a drink up there...... amazing",5,2015,02,10
148,02 visit,"My partner and i came to london for a special event at the o2 and wanted a hotel to make the trip even more special - this hotel lived up to expectation and more. 
We did not use the restaurants so can't comment on these but the rooftop bar is to die for - the lit-up night time view is amazing and extends from Big Ben to Canary Wharf.
Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice - the eggs benidict are great.
Definitely stay here again.
              ",5,2015,02,10
148,ME & STK,"I stay at the ME fairly frequently, it is priced very well and has a great atmosphere. The attitude of the staff is excellent. In addition STK is a great restaurant, the food is always good and again the staff enhance the experience",5,2015,02,09
148,Ultra modern hotel in a great location,"We stayed for one night here as we had theatre tickets for a show in nearby Covent Garden.  First impressions were great.  We were given complimentary prosecco while checking in.  Their reception which is on the first floor is styled like the inside of a pyramid with very modern seating, marble lined walls and floor and lots of candles and a large floral arrangement.  Our room was similarly modern with a balcony with views to the Shard.  Unfortunately, the weather was awful so we couldn't really take advantage of this.  The room was stylish but quite small considering the price but the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom serviceable.  Lots of nice touches like the lighting controls, coffee selection and full range of toiletries.  There are no windows in the corridors so it is quite dark but there is a calming ambiance with interesting aromas and clever lighting.  We sampled the Radio rooftop bar before heading out and had an enjoyable drink inside and then ventured out onto the heated wraparound balcony to take in the spectacular views.  On our return we tried the ground floor bar which also had a lovely atmosphere.
Breakfast the following morning was great - freshly cooked to order and everything very tasty.
Our one complaint would be the lifts which seemed to be very slow especially in the evening, when one of the lifts becomes dedicated to taking guests up to the Radio Bar.
Overall, a great stay with impeccable service and in a fantastic central location.",4,2015,02,09
148,Excellent all round,"I stayed for one night in Feburary '15. Hotel is located on The Strand, no more than five minutes from Covent Garden and even less from the Thames, a great city centre base.

Check in was on the first floor, the ground houses a small lounge and bar. The reception was impressive a vertical open space to the top of the building.

Rooms for London were of a very good size, the bathroom well fitted out. As ever for me it's the small touches make an average stay good or great, this hotel exceeded in everyway.

Great in room snack, coffee and drink selection, good bathroom toiletries and very quick house keeping service when asked for,

A lovely hotel, great room, great service in the heart of London",5,2015,02,07
148,Fantastic!,"WOW!  Our company booked us in overnight this past Saturday as we had a night out in London.  We stepped into this modern and very clean albeit a bit dark hotel.  The service was amazing from the moment you stepped in.  The rooms were impeccably clean and all the amenities you would wish for are present.  Bed was HUGE!  Breakfast was fantastic.  All interactions with the staff were great.  The rooftop bar has a fab view out across the Thames towards London Eye on one side and St Pauls on the other. 
I would certainly recommend.",5,2015,02,03
148,Brilliant Hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights in this excellent, ultra modern hotel.  The staff were friendly, efficient and professional.   The amenities were first class.   I should have asked for a room with a bath as not all rooms have baths.   But, I would definitely go back.   Top Secret:  The roof top bar and terrace have the most wonderful views of London, but don't tell everybody as you will never get in!",5,2015,02,02
148,Amazing hotel in the heart of London.,"We celebrated our wedding anniversary at the ME and what an experience! Upon our arrival, we were given a warm welcome by the staff in reception with a glass of bubbly. In our stylish and contemporary hotel room, we found a personal message of congratulations from Valentina and the Aura team beautifully presented on the chic bathroom mirror. The d√©cor is stunning particularly the reception area with atmospheric lights artwork on the walls and its atrium reaching up ten storeys to the roof terrace. The latter is truly breath-taking with its views over London's skyline. Breakfast was superb; the quality and range of food on offer was first class. Throughout our stay, every single member of the hotel staff we had dealings with was highly professional and efficient yet exuded a wonderfully warm friendliness that made you feel very special indeed. Thank you ME!",5,2015,01,30
148,Okay.....,"We stayed one evening as part of a Birthday surprise for my husband.  We were initially very impressed with the Hotel decor and attentiveness of the Staff. Unsurprisingly for a Monday in January, the Hotel was very quiet, so to find we had been given a Room on the same Level as the Reception overlooking the Alwych was rather disappointing. Before heading out to dinner, we visited the RadioBar which is fantastic. We only stayed for one drink as we had a reservation elsewhere and enquired as to when the Bar closed. We were told that it was 1am. However, when we returned at 12am the Hotel was a ghost town and we were informed that the Bar had closed early as it was so quiet. We then had to pay for Room Service to get a night cap. Overall, the Hotel  is very impressive with prices to match as you would expect. Breakfast was delish, but at ¬£22.50 each - rather overpriced. Would definitely recommend a short stay here as it is in a fantastic location - just don't stay out too late, lol!",3,2015,01,27
148,"""Fabulous hotel""",We stayed for one night over the weekend and this is one of best hotels we have stayed in. The reception was amazing and so different to sit back and enjoy a glass of prosecco. The bar was also very good for early evening cocktails and it was nice to receive complimentary cocktails. All of the staff were so friendly and polite during our stay and went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay. We stayed in a mode room which was a good size and overlooked the Waldoff hotel at the side of the hotel. The location of the hotel is perfect for getting to Covent garden and the shops in Regent street and Bond street. There is not a negative thing I could say about the hotel and we can't wait to return.,5,2015,01,27
148,"Brilliant hotel, rooms could do with a bath tub","Really contemporary hotel, the reception/lifts/corridors are all really cool and minimalistic with funky artwork. The receptionist was exceptionally friendly and also offered us a glass of prosecco. We had a luxury high up room which was nice but could have done with a little bit more space and a bath tub. Breakfast was very nice. The bar on the roof is really cool too. 

Brilliant location for Covent Garden!",4,2015,01,26
148,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed one night over the weekend after attending a dinner at Australia House close by. From the moment we arrived at the hotel until the time we left, the staff were wonderful. Every member of staff that we came in contact with especially Catherine Precilla at front of house and Muhuba on the first floor reception were charming, very friendly, extremely helpful and welcoming. The reception on the first floor is absolutely stunning and so calming. We were offered a glass of prosecco whilst checking in, also getting an upgrade! Our room was fabulous, the bed was huge and the bed linen was superb - really excellent quality. The hotel is very stylish, very comfortable and in a great location - minutes from Covent Garden. We would certainly recommend this hotel to friends and business colleagues and would definitely stay here again.  Many thanks again to all the staff at reception, the car valet service, room service and the staff at the radio roof bar and at breakfast.",5,2015,01,26
148,Amazing all round Hotel,Check in was fantastic - glass of fizz on arrival - room was big for a London hotel - bed was amazing - hotel bar great - my only negative is that the toilet door is see-through and none sealing so no privacy whilst in the throne!! ,5,2015,01,26
148,Amazing! ,I was organising an anniversary dinner for my parents and got in touch with Ms Kenya Santiago. She was extremely  helpful in organising every aspect of it and advising me about the menu. She even showed them the Hotel and arranged a surprise for the dinner!! After the restaurant they wanted to thank her for everything and she even took them to the Bar in the rooftop . I've already been back with my husband since then as well! Thank you so much for Kenya for her hospitality! ,5,2015,01,25
148,Faultless,"Stayed one night over the weekend and I must say that the service was faultless ---efficient, warm, friendly and welcoming. The check in reception area wAs simply stunning and while there was a bit of a wait, the sparkling wine and the amiable staff as well the the cool ambience made it all worth waiting for. Room was hip, cool and very stylish and the view was great. Loved the toiletries and the shower room was fabulous. Would love to be back.",5,2015,01,24
148,Can't praise highly enough ,"From the welcome glass of prosecco to the map waiting in my room with directions to the restaurant I had mentioned at check in,  the customer care experience was excellent. Very trendy hotel, lovely room and turn down service included subtle lighting, candles, cool music and the obligatory chocolate. Nothing was too much trouble and when I had a problem with my key card the attention I received was second to none. 
I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,01,24
148,Everything is perfect! ,"We stayed at Me London hotel from  15th till 18th of January for our wedding anniversary. The hotel is located very conveniently, just a 5 minute walk from the Trafalgar Square. The property itself is very cool, modern and stylish. The reception is located on the last floor and has a form of pyramid with a crystal ceiling. There is also a very nice rooftop disco bar with a stunning city view. We had a great spacious room on the 8th floor with a balcony. The service was impeccable. Special thanks for Lara, the guest relations manager, who made our anniversary a real memory.  We will definitely always stay at this hotel every time we come to London. ",5,2015,01,24
148,Modern & trendy hotel,"This hotel has got a great location right next to Covent Garden and a very modern and stylish design. I stayed in a Vibe room, which I really enjoyed. 
The rooftop bar has got a great view, but the music is very loud - I could even here it in my room on Saturday night even though I was on the third floor!
A special thank you to Kenya, who both checked me in and out. She is really the right women in the right place!",4,2015,01,24
148,"One night stay, but memorable","A hotel that looks like something straight from Las Vegas in its interior design - modern & trendy. Amazingly friendly staff on check-in and check-out, The rooms were quite well-appointed, clean, and spacious given the location and the tendency for some UK hotel rooms to be on the smaller side by American standards.

The only disappointment was the rooftop bar (it's a loud, thumping nightclub that was jammed on the Friday night we walked in - definitely not our scene, but it looked nice) and the STK restaurant (which was almost as loud).  Fortunately, a very helpful staff member at STK saw our dismay and led us through some ""employees only"" spaces to the other restaurant onsite, Cucina Asellina. This was especially thoughtful since it was around freezing outside and we hadn't dressed to walk outside which is apparently the normal way to access the restaurant.

Cucina Asellina was exactly what we were looking for that evening. Ilaria, our waitress, was great and the service excellent. I've reviewed Cucina Asellina separately.",4,2015,01,23
148,"Trendy, Friendly and well situated","Great hotel with the most amazing reception area. Staff are incredibly helpful, especially the concierge, who helped us navigate our way around London with their good advise and direction. Rooms are modern, clean and spacious -  bathroom is well equipped with double basins, double shower and great amenities. 
Breakfast is served in the restaurant and was more than adequate.
The position of the hotel is fantastic - walking distance to Covent Gardens, theatre and many subway stations.
The rooftop bar is fantastic - the cocktails are incredible!!! and great view too.",5,2015,01,22
148,"Beautiful hotel, with such class and total wow factor!","We're just back from a fantastic couple of days in London and two nights at the amazing Me Hotel. I arranged the trip as a birthday treat for my boyfriend's 30th birthday and it was perfect from start to finish. The hotel is very central, next to Covent Garden, Somerset House etc with stunning views over London's skyline and the smell that hits you when you walk in is so delightful, if you could bottle it, it would be perfect and make any home smell divine! Everything about our stay was classy and thoughtful, we were treated to a glass of Prosecco at check-in and we also very kindly upgraded which was a wonderful surprise. The room was stunning, very stylish and we loved the cool lighting, a lovely big shower, great areas for dressing and putting make-up on etc. We had drinks on the rooftop bar, breakfast in bed, and dinner at STK and I can't fault anything, the hotel were also kind enough to put a bottle of champagne in our room on my boyfriend's birthday and a message on the mirror which was such a lovely touch. We felt very special and are now thinking about when to go back, it is absolutely our favorite place to stay in London now and we are both dreaming of the delicious steaks we had at STK - the best we have ever tasted! Keep up the amazing work and thanks to the Aura team for treating us so well and making our stay truly memorable!",5,2015,01,22
148,Just as expected...,"I've stayed at a different ME and Melia properties before and I've always had a great experience. ME London is not an exception. It's modern, classy and stylish. I was upgraded to a suite, and customer service was beyond my expectations. Location was also wonderful, the hotel is walking distance from covent garden. Would highly recommend and will definitely stay here again when I return to London",5,2015,01,21
148,This hotel has wow factor,"I loved this hotel! It certainly has wow factor on entering with it's cool, slick design. The room itself was a good size and I loved the decor, colour scheme and clever lighting. The bathroom was a great size also and was very clean. I can't stand dis-coloured tiles or grouting and you certainly won't find that in this hotel with it's clever design. 
The beds did let it down slightly as they were not very comfortable but everything else was great. Staff that we encountered were all very friendly and helpful. I would most definately stay here again.",5,2015,01,21
148,A Stunning and Perfect Stay <3,"Without spoiling the experience and leaving a little excitement for future guest... From the moment we arrived at the reception we were completely amazed. Every sense was engaged and welcomed from sight to smell the reception area was a delight. The staff were very kind and attentive and we were made to feel very welcome and at home. 

They invited us to our room with refreshments for the journey and an interesting explanation of the hotel and how to use all of the room's facilities accordingly was given by our own personal host. The room was extremely clean and both the bathroom and bedroom were very generous and comfortable. 

I genuinely would recommend this hotel is worth a stay, it is a little secret glamorous gem and has well become our favourite hotel in London at present - and the rooftop bar is beautiful little drinking spot too! Thank you ME London :-)",5,2015,01,20
148,Fantastic hotel - cool and modern but still with excellent service,"Stayed two nights for a birthday weekend trip to London in January.

We were immediately greeted as we got out of the cab and offered help with our bags and then directed to the lifts to take us up to the 1st floor for check-in.

Friendly and efficient check-in, where we were offered a complimentary room upgrade ‚Äì nice.  Incredible design of the reception area, which is basically a marble pyramid for the whole height of the hotel - amazing.  Then off to the 6th floor to check out our room ‚Äì glasses of prosecco from reception in hand ‚Äì a very good touch.  Common areas are very dark, but you get used to it and gives the hotel a warm, cosy and comfortable feeling, whilst still being incredibly modern.  It put me in mind of some of the newer contemporary Vegas hotels (minus the noise, smoke and casino of course).

Fantastic room (‚ÄòMode‚Äô I think) ‚Äì generously sized room, huge comfortable bed, interesting window design with great ‚Äòshutters‚Äô rather than blinds or curtains.  Large flat screen TV with much better than average channel choice including premium Sky Sports channels.  Decent coffee making facilities - Krups/Nespresso type machine.

The bathroom area was on the right as you walked into the room and could be left open to feel part of the room, or closed off with a pair of large frosted glass sliding doors.  Double sink with all the usual and amenities.  Separate shower room and toilet room on either side ‚Äì again separated by large frosted glass doors.  Shower was particularly good and impressive ‚Äì room for 2 (or more!!!!) with two large ‚Äòrain‚Äô shower heads.

Housekeeping/turn-down service were both excellent ‚Äì bottled water, chocolates, amenities replenished etc‚Ä¶

We‚Äôd received two vouchers for complimentary cocktails in either of the bars of the ground floor restaurants when we checked in ‚Äì yet another very nice touch.  Oh and a hand written welcome/birthday note from the ‚ÄòMode‚Äô host with a jar of champagne gummie bears

The rooftop radio bar was excellent ‚Äì incredible views that take in most of the major London landmarks.  It was certainly worth a visit for that, but the service there was a bit hit and miss.  We visited three times and encountered some excellent staff, but unfortunately we also got the ‚Äútoo cool for school‚Äù attitude from some others ‚Äì irks slightly that we racked up a bar bill of over ¬£200 over our three visits but were not made to feel particularly welcome by three separate staff members up there ‚Äì slightly sneering, looking down on us, chatting to colleagues rather than serving or completing our drinks order (clearly hearing it was a non-work related conversation).  Also, we found the cocktails/drinks we had at the bar in STK were better than those we had at Radio.  I wasn't surprised, these rooftop bars seem to be the same around the world, I've had mixed experiences with staff in this sort of place in San Francisco, New York, London, Manchester, Miami, Washington DC.  There usually seems to be some difficulty managing the hotel guests and the fact that non-guests also want to visit.

Breakfast was excellent ‚Äì great choice of fresh juices, teas, coffees, pastries, cereals, cold meats, cheeses and breads.  Hot food is cooked to order (so much nicer than the usual hot buffet selection you get in most other places ‚Äì it‚Äôs that extra star!) ‚Äì usual choice of eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, mushrooms etc‚Ä¶ great scrambled eggs on the first morning and perfectly cooked poached eggs on the second morning.

Check out was quick and easy and friendly.

Overall excellent and the negative experience at Radio didn't spoil our stay ‚Äì we‚Äôd certainly come back ‚Äì non Radio staff were, without exception, excellent.",5,2015,01,19
148,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed overnight at this 5 star hotel. What a great experience. Our room had a terrace and overlooked London with a view to die for. The room was amazing. Our host , Valentina was excellent and showed such care and attention to us. We had the best cooked breakfast I have ever had (and I've had a few !!). All of the staff are amazing and friendly. We loved this hotel.",5,2015,01,19
148,Fantastic Hotel,"Fantastic hotel and staff!
Rooms were lovely and clean and comfortable. All of the staff were very pleasant and helpful. 
Would recommend this hotel without any hesitation you will not be disappointed.

148,Consistently Excellent,"Consistently Excellent  

Just back from a one night stay at the ME London - excellent again, from the fast check in to the welcome glass of ""fizz"" and then to the amazing room. 
Also it is very difficult not to say WOW as you look up at the light show in the main reception.  
One of the main things that we like about the ME is that the team treat us like VIP‚Äôs ‚Äì they are always professional but not in a ‚Äústuffy 5 star way‚Äù they are approachable have nice personalities and above all they just want to make sure that you have a great stay.
Location is just so good for everything we want to do and a great tip is to use the car parking service ‚Äì this is great ‚Äì you just drive your car to the hotel door, pass your keys to the great concierge team who look after it until you are ready to leave ‚Äì this is one of the best drive through services aroundÔÅä.
Breakfast was fantastic, well cooked and a great choice and again exceptional staff. 
Well done again to the Aura team great attention to detail.
See you soon",5,2015,01,19
148,Lovely,"Had a wonderful stay at ME London , love this hotel , very nice location , room are big and clean Roof top bar excellent ..  Beautiful night view of London from roof top bar.. enjoyed my stay in this hotel ...",5,2015,01,16
148,"Central, Sytlish and Fabulous","I stayed for an overnight at the ME hotel last weekend and what can I say what an amazing hotel! Slightly deceiving from the outside quite how cool this hotel is. Build around a pyramid lined with marble that runs right through the building - you wont find a design like it anywhere else in London. - Nice touch includes the glass of champagne when you check in. I stayed on the 5th floor in a Vibe room, beautifuly spacious and modern. Lovely bathroom amenities and the twin rain shower I had was indulgent. Free wifi and you can logo on, no passwords to slow things down. Great for business and leisure and central as you can walk to all the main tourist spots easily. 10 out of 10.",5,2015,01,16
148,Superb experience !,"We stayed two nights at this fabulous hotel. The location couldn't be better we never used public transport as we could walk  everywhere, such a bonus!  We arrived at the hotel on a cold wintery evening and on entering the hotel we had such a warm welcome from a very 
professional team of staff .Great first impression and it only got better.. The check in was handled very efficiently  and we were invited to a glass of sparkling wine, very nice touch ! The hotel is very stylish and modern and the reception area is stunning. The room was wonderful ,the bed was huge and very comfortable. The bathroom was very impressive and we had everything we needed. We did venture up to the roof top bar and the views were amazing as was the service . We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at  the ME London and would like to thank all the staff for a truly amazing experience. We would like to say a special thanks to Ronan, Catherine & Muhuba ",5,2015,01,15
148,Lovely,Had a wonderful stay at ME last week. Location was wonderful and the roof top bar is beautiful. The hotel has nice touches throughout and is very modern and clean. The only negative was that there are no mirrors for styling your hair (woman thing). It would be beneficial for the rooms to have a mirror in them with plugs near by for those straightening or curling hair. The bathroom has huge mirrors and a small portable one but this is no use. The lights in the room are also very stylish. Over all a great stay.,4,2015,01,14
148,Best birthday ever,"I celebrated my 40th at this amazing hotel, everyone was so friendly and helpful couldn't of asked for me. I would like to say a big thank you to Monica she was so helpful and really made my special night more amazing with all her hard work thank you... The rooms were so nice and clean and the views were out of this world. I can't wait to go back there to stay again.....",5,2015,01,12
148,Cool and Stylish,We stayed here one night. The hotel is well located close to Covent Garden. The rooms are large and comfortable. Hallways were too dim and reception area quite spectacular with the vaulted ceiling. A glass of wine was offered to us at check in and served. We had a comfortable night and the TV surround system amazing. The bathroom facilities were luxurious. This is a cool hotel for that special getaway. It would suit anyone but probably more so for a younger urban crowd.  The only thing I did not like would be the division of reception area and immediate entrance. Also the lift to go to reception and then a lift to go to your rooms and then a lift to access the roof top bar. All too hard. However the hotel had an uber cool vibe and the various levels added to that  effect. We did not see the rooftop bar but it would have great views due to it's location.,4,2015,01,11
148,2-night short stay at end of honeymoon,"We stayed at ME for a couple of nights just before Christmas after flying back in to LHR following our honeymoon. What a great hotel! Location is excellent for sightseeing, many of London's top attractions are only a short walk away (Trafalgar Square, St Paul's Cathedral, London Eye, Covant Garden, Picadilly Circus etc.) and the hotel and rooms are very stylish and contemporary. Reception and Concierge staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble and they were very knowledgeable about what to do, where to go and how to get to places.
Room was a comfortable size, the beds were massive and very nice indeed. I loved the mood lighting and the bathroom with rain shower!
Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a convenient location to stay in London. Prepare for the wow factor when you are taken up to Reception on the first floor, just look up when you get there!",5,2015,01,10
148,my favourite hotel in London,"The ME Hotel is my choice for central London. I stayed there few times in the last 2 years and last visit for business was just few days ago
Four main reasons I lik it..
-	Location: it‚Äôs on The Strand close to Covent Garden, Piccadilly, River Thames etc etc
-	Style: contemporary and unique. Reception is beautiful.
-	Restaurants and Bars: on the ground floor you have STK, great steak house in a trendy atmosphere. On the TOP floor you have to vist the Radio Bar, sophisticated terrace with outstanding view over the city

Last but not least:

-	Service: from Reception to Concierge‚Ä¶all very professional and smiling. Let me mention, in my last visit, Stefano at the Radio Bar and Lara Mariani as Guest manager that was very helpful, professional and collaborative since the check in.

148,Great Hotel!!!!,"This Hotel is located in one of the best area in London, Its very well designed and It is a very modern and stylish hotel that makes you feel very welcome. Excellent service, Great and comfortable rooms, unique Location and fantastic cleaning makes you feel better than home!
We tried out the STK restaurant for dinner one night as well as a drink on the rooftop bar, both were excellent choices. I can describe this hotel with one word, AMAZING!!!! In deed the best hotel in London.",5,2015,01,03
148,Perfect,"I have been to this hotel several times, me and my family only ever stay at this hotel whenever we visit London. We have been to previous hotels around the city but nothing really compares. It is a very modern and stylish hotel that makes you feel very welcome. All the staff are lovely and attend to your every need. The rooms are cleaned daily and there is not a speck of dust anywhere. It is a rather expensive hotel but definitely worth the money. It is close to all the attractions throughout London aswell ",5,2014,12,31
148,Splash The Cash,"Used the parking service at the hotel for convenience, but booked independently via a 3rd party due to cost. We arrived early so after check in took drinks on rooftop bar terrace, the views were stunning, all of Londons best landmarks on show, the reception took my mobile number and phoned once room was ready, the luggage was in room waiting, the room itself was stunning with all luxury toiletries, robes and slippers, in room media excellent. Yes ME London is not the cheapest and drinks are quite pricey, but spoil yourself and enjoy it. The location is excellent for theatre, Covent Garden , Trafalger square, will definitely use again",5,2014,12,30
148,Excellent !,"Very nice hotel! Very good service from all staff, upgraded to a fantastic room. Felt very welcome. 

Very stylish hotel from entrance to rooftop. Expensive but a great experience. Excellent location. Highly recommended 

Thanks to manager and Staff!

148,Very cool,"The design is very special, very cool but, in my opionion very cold (depending on ones taste, but I like it just a little more cozy). 
Loved the marble bathroom and its layout, though the room is pretty small and mine was close to the street, I could see the people riding the bus from my bed. Anyway ‚Äì the service is great, the location is perfect, the bar is very nice and everything is on a high standard. It's just a matter of taste if you like this kind of clean, dark design.",4,2014,12,30
148,ME London,"My wife & I stayed for 3 nights in early December. The location was very convenient, we walked almost everywhere we went around London.

Positives: The room amenities were excellent, spacious with modern upgrades galore. The maid service was excellent. The breakfast included with the room each day was to die for, you could order off the menu or they had several dozen different things on an excellent buffet spread. 

Negatives: I was charged app. $15 U.S. for a COLLECT call to my credit card company after they thought my London charges were potentially fraudulent. The credit card company paid for the call, a pound a minute for using the phone was ridiculous, I truly felt ripped off. 

The other negative was the rooftop bar. As part of our booking, we had a coupon for complementary drinks that we tried to redeem. It was presented to a bartender, then a waitress, then a hostess and finally to the manager... the whole process took app. 30 minutes. None acted like they knew about the voucher program. The manager read the fine print and said it was now past 5:30 and he would only honor the coupon if we came back the next day. I have 2 issues with that. 1), We were leaving for Paris the next morning, and 2), had we not have waited for three of his staff to refer us to him, we WERE there before 5:30 when we started the process. Even after he became aware of this, he still refused to honor the coupon. HORRIBLE customer service.",4,2014,12,29
148,Perfect!!!!!!!,"We stayed at the me hotel during christmas, and what was a great stay.
Starting from the checkin at the wonderful reception area which was unexpected. It has a pyramids  shape from foor 1 all the way to the 10th floor with an open top. Never seen something like that in the uk before.

Staff are very helpful, and very charming specailly with my little  baby. Any place you go you feel recognized and always offer help or little chat if you wanted to talk to any of them.

We have been offered a tour of the hotel. we have been taken to the best hotel suites, STK restaurant, and the wondurful radio bar on the tenth floor!!!! View from there is the best. you get the view of the river and all the top attraction along the river Amazing!!!!!
Hotel was quite not many guests were there because of the Christmas period so we spent 90% of our time inside the hotel, seriously you don't need to go anywhere out of the hotel.
What an amazing stay definitely come back.",5,2014,12,28
148,"If you have the budget, stay here","We booked the ME London using Avios (AirMiles) but generally this hotel will be very expensive, but well worth it. We live in London so staying at the ME London was a special occasion to enjoy Central London Christmas lights and shopping and the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. ME London is super stylish. We thought we had walked into one of the upscale Las Vegas hotels, yet here we were on the Strand in London.. Great location for exploring all around London, nice bar area as you walk in and very discrete. Even living in London and passing this location frequently I did not know that the hotel was even there. ME (Melia Groups flagship range) reminded us of Westin's W range, and I understand that there may have been some similar design background. The ME London is located at the old BBC Radio building, artfully re-designed. Our room was on the 9th floor and had a balcony overlooking some great London views. Across the road from Somerset House, a stone's throw from Waterloo, the Strand, Theatreland, Covent Garden, Fleet Street - this location in Central London cannot be beaten . Despite the central location virtually in the middle of a road island, the ME London was quiet inside and beautifully appointed if you like the ultra modern, stylistic, look. Forget about any traditional London quaintness, the ME London could be in an key city in the world, it has the international chic of to be in any supercity in the world. I could not figure out where the STK restaurant was that we had booked for dinner. The ground floor? Where could a bustling busy restaurant be on the ground floor? Behind the door of course, walk into a fashionable, club style restaurant. Good food and service, very upscale and worth coming toi STK again in future. All in all, we really enjoyed ME, we took advantage of many of the features of the hotel including the rooftop Radio nightclub with yet more stunning views of London and the obligatory hipster crowd. Breakfast was included in our tariff, but after all that night before, we were dining at Pret the next morning across the road as we did not get up early at all. In any case, everything was close at hand. I will recommend the ME Hotel to clients staying in London who either have the budget or who want a special occasion idea",5,2014,12,28
148,Terrible,"After having travelled widely and stayed all over the world in 5 star establishments I must say I am very disappointed with my current stay in this so called modern luxury hotel.
I usually stick to the Ritz Carlton brand(rewards card holder) but wanted to give the Me brand a chance but I am disappointed to say will not be coming back to this hotel or its sister concerns anywhere in the world or recommend it for that matter.
There are plenty of problems but the main concern has been the attitude of the staff which is very condescending and bordering on rude and a very poor comprehension of English. There is no luxury in the service and defeintely not value for money. 
I have highlighted the issues to the duty manager during the stay but unfortunately no concrete action was taken other than the usual lip service.
Very disappointed with the stay, happy there is only one more night to stay and will not be coming back.
Mr. Anand
",1,2014,12,27
148,Disappointing,"As a great ME-fan, I visited the other ME-hotels as well, I was excited to go to ME London. The hotel is beautiful, staff is perfect, you have everything you wish for, and if you miss something, it will be arranged.
However, the room is awful. Very bad isolated, as it comes to outside cold/wind, and to noise as well. On Friday evening I encountered heavy noise due to a party taking place. I could not sleep until 2:30 am ! My complaint was recognised, they offered me a discount and an upgrade for a future stay, but until now, I still have not received my confirmation of this (although they promised to send it right away). 
Poor price-quality. They should really chose if they want to be a night club or a hotel. Because in this case, these things do not match !",2,2014,12,23
148,"Could not ask for more, PERFECT for young couples","Clean room?  Very clean, big area, private balcony, AMAZING SHOWER
Good service? Very helpful, fast, and accommodating 
Good atmosphere? GREAT for traveling young people
Worth the price? 100%
Will we go back? Please

First of all, I have to say how amazing the room was.  Upon check in, I did my normal joke about wanting an upgrade if the penthouse is available for no extra charge.  The guy laughed and said he would make sure we are on a high floor and that we would love our room.  He was right.  The room had a private balcony, awesome views, the best shower room of my life, and awesome mood lighting.

The service was wonderful, not only did the guy assure us that we would love our room, but we were pampered with doormen who took our suitcases, and served us complimentary champagne from our first step inside.  The front door guy got to know us, and he was full of tips for things to do and of course suggested the roof top happy hour.  I wish we would have stayed in London longer to stay at this hotel.

The location was also perfect.  We walked to the British Museum (and plenty of pubs on the way), went out in Convent Garden, took the subway to the airport, and had the big bus tour stop right outside the door.

100% recommended",5,2014,12,21
148,2nd fabulous trip to ME London,"We returned to the ME London for our annual December excursion to London.  We stayed here last year and the location, staff and amenities made it an easy decision to return.  Upon arrival, you are escorted up one floor and are greeted with a glass of champagne.  As we arrived in the morning, before check-in time, our room wasn't ready yet.  The staff was very gracious, especially Emma & Muhuba, who found the perfect room for us. The rooms are terrific & the beds are super comfortable.  The hotel is perfectly situated on The Strand, making it a great location.  We walked everywhere!  The gentlemen at the Concierge Desk are wonderful, even offering to print out VAT Forms for us. They couldn't have been more helpful. A visit to the Radio Bar is a must for the amazing views, and the impressive bartender in the Marconi Bar even remembered us from last year! We highly recommend the ME London for anyone visiting the city, and can't wait to return next year!",5,2014,12,20
148,Wonderful,"A very special hotel in the heart of London. Couldn't if asked for a better welcome and even was given a glass of champagne on arrival. We were then told we had been upgraded to a suite, the suite was perfect in every way. Very nice ",5,2014,12,19
148,"Stunning, modern and quirky hotel.","I've stayed on many 5 star hotels but few are as individual and stunning as this one. As soon as you step into the entrance and are escorted up a floor to reception you know you're in for a treat. The reception area with projected jelly fish moving up the marble walls is stunning and the free champagne on arrival was an expected treat. 

The rooms itself is very modern and high tech, not to everyone's taste I suspect but clean and well laid out. The in room,not so, mini bar area is well stocked with a few surprises for the broad minded amongst us. 

Add to that the roof top bar with great views and all around a great hotel.  A bit pricey but you have to have a test sometimes.",5,2014,12,19
148,"Great experience, beautiful hotel!","I stayed at the ME last week (mid-December) and thought the hotel was great ! The location is perfect, very central, the rooms are very specious and the beds are fantastic, the bathrooms are very luxurious, with many nice amenities, including a number of unexpected ones (including useful if you don't end up spending the night alone! Which was of no use to me, but worth mentioning!). Towels are plentiful and extremely fluffy, a great treat after a nice shower. My room also had a small balcony, not necessarily useful at this time of the year, but worth mentioning. 

The reception area is pretty unique and quite stunning... And the bar on the top floor is a great place for a drink, especially the terrace - weather permitting - maybe worth mentioning though: they close part of it after a certain hour officially because of the noise (which seemed pretty surprising to me considering you're on the top floor, with no vis a vis - the view is quite stunning from that part actually, so that was a pity). Be prepared to have a number of drunk bankers/ traders hanging around if you go quite late.

Check-out not exactly super fast, but overall an excellent experience!",5,2014,12,18
148,ME London is a WOW,"The ME London is a fantastic urban hotel. With Architecture by Norman Foster the ME London by Melia has hit the sweet spot for many contemporary travers needs. The design is striking and the attention to detail is second to none. But the star of the ME brand has to be the staff, they were very attentive and happy to assist in any capacity. My wife and kids wanted to see a play, the concierge and aura manager were happy to arrange the tickets and bring them up to the room. The STK restaurant on the ground floor is a must and roof top bar was also a big hit, with good snacks, good drinks and a great view overlooking London.",5,2014,12,18
148,Great service,"The staff Went out of their way to assist us with every request, the design of the building is something to behold. ...........................................................................................................",4,2014,12,17
148,Outstanding,"Just spent 2 nights.  Really refreshing to see a hotel where there's a perfect marriage of modernism, class and outstanding service paired with great food.

Accommodation is top notch.  Warms welcome i've received for a long time.  Well done.

This is by no means cheap, however not many in London are and when so, clearly a sign of being sub standard.

I would thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone....",5,2014,12,13
148,Wow,"What an impression this hotel makes from check in to the roof top bar. It's pure luxury meets modern in a wonderful part of London. The rooms are fantastic, even the turn down service was great. Wonderful vibe in this hotel, was really impressed and will certainly be back when I'm next n London. Loved it!",5,2014,12,12
148,Modern luxury on the Strand,"Recently stayed at the ME hotel on the Strand in London and wow what a wonderful hotel
Bags are taken from you on entry into the modern building and then up in the lift with a member of staff to check in with a glass of prosecco.
The room was amazing, uber-modern, plasma tv, spacious bathroom and huge double shower with a brilliant sound system which was easy to use
Room service was efficient and the food lovely

You also HAVE to go to the radio bar upstairs with incredible views across London and a great atmosphere.

Its pricey but you are getting exactly what you pay for...excellence",5,2014,12,11
148,What a weekend !,"Just spent a weekend at the Me London. What can I say about the Me. From the welcome at the reception to the final check out, it was an amazing experience. The room we booked was perfect for our needs with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. The staff could not have been more attentive with every request catered for. The hotel is located in the perfect place, right in the middle of Covent Garden perfect for the theatres. The hotel's restaurant STK offers superb steaks with great American service and is a credit to the hotel while the Radio rooftop bar is the' in place ' to be in London. Luckily, if you stay in the hotel you can get in. Altogether an amazing stay from start to finish. ",5,2014,12,10
148,ME - OK ish,"A friend and myself went to ME London for a weekend. Everything was nearly perfect from the time we checked in until the moment we checked out, I would actually expect the reception to provide us with newspapers of our choice delivered to the room, something that a 5 stars like ME should bear in mind!

The check in was quick and convenient We was then shown to the rooms and given a little tour of the hotel :-) Our room was in a very good size! The room was clean and was kept that way throughout our stay. 

I would recommend paying the radio bar a visit, lovely atmosphere, try to avoid the gold diggers though! LOL .. The gorgeous lady in the radio me bar reception was friendly and professional.

Since I am from the middle east I wanted to place an order for halal chicken or meat while dining in which the restaurant neither dining in hotel provide therefor I was very limited within food option and have to place an order from takeaways! Even sea food options was very limited indeed., I would recommend that you bear this in mind as for middle eastern guest would be interested in dining in with halal options available!

The concierge staff was helpful and would do anything you may request them to do and they‚Äôre to help you!",3,2014,12,09
148,"Beautiful hotel, but lacking","stayed the weekend for first wedding anniversary. I had been so excited to stay here.
The hotel is stunning and the interior is breathtaking, but sadly lacking in service and five star touches. 
Had our bags basically wrestled off us on arrival, even after saying no. It took nearly two hours to have the bags delivered to the room. Even after my husband went down to get them. Couldn't relax or get ready for evening as no bags and just sat waiting. Though my husband did return with two glasses of prosecco. This brings me to check-in, the gentleman checking us in made no eye contact, not sure we were even greeted. Definitely no welcome drink, which was a shame as the couples around us enjoyed there drinks. 
The room on the fourth floor was lovely, the bed was massive  and really comfortable. The light and air conditioning system was very easy to use. 
The television was something else. After returning on the Friday night the television had frozen, tried to call down but the phone was all sticky and buttons stuck, yuck! Husband popped down to reception and yet again  returned with two glasses of prosecco, seems to be the answer to everything. The engineer came within in minutes, said the television freeze all the time. He was very friendly and helpful, and we did get to meet him again on the Saturday. This was after returning from a day out, we left at 10.00 and returned about 3.00. The room had not been
 cleaned, even though when we left they were cleaning the room one down from us. We spoke to the lady and said not to clean room, as we wanted to relax and get ready for the evening out. They agreed and said would freshen up room at turn-down. Three times they then tried to get in the room. In the mean time the television froze again, reported from the now non sticky phone. Had to wait nearly two hours for engineer this time. So a afternoon of relaxing before are evening out didn't happen. By this point I was so upset, I saved hard to stay here and felt let down by all the little details. I really wish I stayed at one of the Apex hotels where I usually stay. Maybe I expected to much from a five star hotel.
When we checked out, I did say that I was let down by the experience. Many apologies given, and did offer to get someone else, I declined this as it would of been more apologies and I didn't want to leave angry. 
So we left, there was a number of porters by the concierge desk, but nobody offered to get a taxi. It was raining after all. Luckily there was a taxi right outside. 

",3,2014,12,09
148,Great location,"Starting with the positives,great location for central London,very easy check in with a glass of proseco,good views of the city from the 8th floor.
Unless you can get a deal the hotel is expensive to stay in, great coffee maker in the room but no kettle.... room service for a pot of tea ¬£7.50 !",4,2014,12,08
148,Nice but not worth the price tag,Me & my girlfriend stayed here for our anivessery for 2 nights it was a lovely stay but i cant say it was worth the money i have stayed at places that are equal if not nicer than this hotel for a lot cheaper.,3,2014,12,08
148,For a treat....,"I booked the hotel as we had dinner reservations at the STK. Entrance staff were very welcoming on arrival, directed us to the reception (on the first floor, as there are no signs to find it!). Even though the reception was busy, we were offered a glass of champagne and checked in very quickly. 
The room was clean, fresh and very modern. A LARGE double bed, crisp white sheets, more than enough mirrors for 3 ladies to get ready with, plenty of towels, wardrobe space, hangers. All the little things that you usually forget (toothpaste, mouthwash!). Stayed on the 4th floor and couldn't hear a peep from the bar upstairs or the street below.
TIP - read the ""how to work the air con panel"" book before you go to sleep. You wake up in a warm stuff room where the floor-to-ceiling windows do not open!
The Rooftop bar is a great experience, yes the drinks are pricey, even by London standards, but it is worth the trip to the top floor for the great views of a beautiful city. Staff are friendly enough, I've had warmer encounters...
The hotel itself is spotless! I'd go again but for the price it will not be frequent visits!
Very close to Covent Garden (walking distance even in sky scraper heels)",4,2014,12,03
148,New Year Booking,We booked a suite for new year‚Äôs eve at 1700 GBP a night only to be told that we can‚Äôt ( as residents of hotel) access the roof bar on the night unless we buy a ticket for 200 GBP a head for Champagne and canap√©s! This is unacceptable and outrageous. Last year we stayed at the savoy and we had full access to all facilities as residents. I canceled our stay and won‚Äôt be returning to the hotel.,1,2014,12,01
148,Bumpin',"A fabulous architectural achievement by Norman Foster.  The interior design is also notable.  The hotel has high security which can be a good thing.  The most curious thing is that it is a ""hotspot"".  The roof top bar is definitely a place to be in London.",5,2014,11,30
148,Simply Awesome,"Simply Awesome, Great Hotel with the WOW factor, Service was amazing from beginning of my visit to the end.. Thank you for the great service.. A hotel from the next century...
the only negative comment was that the breakfast staff were slight disorganization.",5,2014,11,27
148,Very upbeat funky hotel,"This hotel is pretty cool, interesting set up and pretty fun. The staff are friendly and accommodating the rooms are a good size, clean and comfortable. The room I was in was quiet which is always something I look for in a hotel. 

At first when i got to my floor and it was all decorated in black and quite dark I found it a bit weird but I quickly got used to it. Once going inside the room it's really nicely done and the different colored lights were a nice touch 

The location is great for theaters and is easily accessible for any of the main attractions. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. ",4,2014,11,26
148,Funky luxury,I recently had two nights in this hotel and loved it. The design is interesting and kinda funky. The check in experience set the tone for the weekend as we were given complimentary prosecco at check in and then upgraded to an 8th floor room with a fabulous view. All staff seemed genuinely helpful. Location is great for Covent Garden and other tourist attractions. Room was amazingly quiet even though the hotel was fully booked. Hotel would be perfect for a romantic break apart from the little detail of having twin beds.,5,2014,11,26
148,Noisy if your room is below the Radio Rooftop bar,"Great looking hotel, modern & stylish and a great location within London. Requested a quiet room on check-in and was given room 908. It felt like it was directly under the Radio Rooftop Bar & we were not able to get to sleep until after 2.00 am. Sadly this ruined our next day in London. We received a very 'standard' and delayed response to our complaint. I would not recommend this hotel to people who need a good nights sleep.",2,2014,11,25
148,Brilliant birthday trip ,Stayed here for 2 nights this weekend. Loved it shame we couldn't spend more time at the hotel but we had so much we wanted to do and see. Would definitely go back and service was great as was the service in there Madrid hotel in august. We will definitely visit other ME hotels in other cities. Location was great handy for shopping and a show plus plenty of bars and places to eat. ,5,2014,11,24
148,An Hotel for the Younger Guest,"This is a very nice hotel very modern and stylish perhaps a little too modern for us 70 year olds.The staff appear to be geared for the younger client and although very nice tend to be a little too condescending to the more mature guest. There does not seem to be an understanding that the spending power of the pensioner is less than the city types they are aiming to attract. The whole atmosphere in the hotel from the concierge greeting onwards is that of a nightclub and a continual put down if you have difficulty understanding their rules,procedures,systems and complicated lighting switches etc. to say it is expensive is an under statement with drinks grossly overpriced and breakfast charged at ¬£25 per person when not included in the room rate. On top of a 15% service charge added to everything the staff annoyingly hang about for the extra gratuity. Next time staying in London will stay somewhere more traditional and substantially lower price.",2,2014,11,23
148,Very Stylish,"Stayed at the ME hotel for 2 nights while attending a conference. The hotel is in a great location, close to the London theatre area. Hotel is a short taxi or tube journey from the Heathrow Express terminal at Paddington.
Hotel rooms very comfortable and with great sound proofing. 
Overall hotel ambience is low level lighting with black mirrored panels in the corridors and lobby areas.
Although a city centre hotel, staff are really helpful and went out of their way to be of assistance and make guests feel at home.
I'd definitely stay there again.",5,2014,11,22
148,Modern hotel,"Great hotel, very modern and stylish. Staff really helpful and the rooftop bar is a must, wonderful views and a comprehensive drinks menu with tapas if required. Breakfast was included in my rate booked through 'preferred hotels' and was a good start to the day. Good location close to Covent Garden and not too far to the river. Recommended",4,2014,11,21
148,IT'S ALL ABOUT ME !!!!,"Stayed here last Friday , fab location,simply stunning entrance and bar, the piece de resistance is the reception , just blew us away, a fabulous pyramid of marble, warm welcome from the staff with  complimentary Prosecco.
We booked a table in the Radio rooftop bar from 9pm for the whole evening, fantastic views, our room was 104 which was very modern and comfortable, would request a higher floor next time purely for a better city vista.
Breakfast in Cucina Asellina was gorgeous, thank you to Veronica and Francesca for great service.
The staff at ME are lovely , special mention to Arina and Sara for making our  stay so special, we will be back.",5,2014,11,17
148,"Afternoon Tea at the Marconi Lounge, distinctly average","I booked this as a special treat for our 30th anniversary.  We were met and served very quickly and given a really lovely glass of Champaign. A cake stand each with the entire meal was then placed on the table.  This was a surprise, I thought each course would be delivered separately and I would have chance to choose - instead 5 small sandwich fingers, two tiny scones and 4 cakes.  The sandwiches were a little dry and there was not enough filling in them or garnish.  The salt beef was not at all nice, the rye bread completely drowned out the taste.  The scones were lovely and having filled up on scones and cream, I could not manage the cake.  I could not say there was not enough food, just not a good mix or choice - and just a couple of hours later I was hungry.  The staff were pleasant and helpful - packing up the uneaten cakes when asked.  But after asking them to add a tip, it was a surprise to find that we had also paid 15% service charge, frankly a bit steep for delivering a couple of pots of tea and a cake stand, I think they should tell you this when you ask to add a tip.  My husband and I had been so looking forward to this treat and frankly - it did not live up to expectations and we left very disappointed.",2,2014,11,17
148,"MODERN CONCEPT, ME COMFORT","This modern hotel has cleverly combined its company name into its philosophy for its clients. It is ultra modern in its geometrical defiance of conventional vertical from the moment of entry in the reception. If you suffer vertigo, it would be best to walk through the public areas with your eyes shut but then you would miss the magnificent gargantuan floral displays, shiny black marble and stainless steel artistry.  Reception by the multilingual hotel staff in all its guises is perfect from the moment of entry and we found our room with balcony on the 9th floor offered a vast panorama of central London. The hotel pre warns guests that the room may not be available until 15.00 but on our arrival at noon, Sara worked hard to find one ready for us to take. When taken to our room, the charming porter explained all the gadgetry but also warned us that our room was beneath the champagne bar and occasionally guests had  complained about noise in the past and if we found the same, then call reception. We had not one issue about noise and were there for a Friday and Saturday night. We felt this to be an exceptionally courteous gesture.

The reception area is a spectacular architectural creation and to take up the offer of a complimentary drink during the endless light projection on to the pyramidal shiny marble walls is a must. 

Our room on the 9th floor was very clean and in good condition with little sign of 2 years of wear and tear. To call reception, one has to work out that one hits the 'Me' button. It took me, a Luddite, 5 minutes to work that out! Only one small criticism of the bedroom do we feel it necessary to make. The touch pad controlling everything from the air conditioning to lighting is a great conception but is fixed to the wall with zero vision from the bed due to the angle. One needs to climb out of bed and kneel in front of it to read what to do, which for a presbyopic pensioner during darkness has its problems. Too clever by half.

The Italian restaurant on the ground floor Cucina Asselina is light and spacious and does a fine reasonably priced lunch. Once more the cosmopolitan staff are trained to a high standard of courtesy and service. There is no doubt in my mind that if immigration laws prevented the influx of these highly intelligent well educated young men and women into our British service work force, standards of care and attention in our city hotels and restaurants would plummet. Our lunch was served to us by Roberta, a pleasant and polite Sicilian graphic designer who explained everything on the menu in excellent detail.

For a long weekend away, we thoroughly recommend this superbly central London Hotel which sits at the centre of the capital's theatre land.",5,2014,11,16
148,Best place in london!,"Recently stayed at the Melia whilst on a business trip in london and have to say it was amazing! As soon as you walk in you are hit by a lovely melon scent which sounds strange but a great touch! Rooms are great, staff can't help you enough!

If your staying in london defiantly recommend Melia me! Beautiful place and central location ",5,2014,11,12
148,ME & more...,"We stayed here recently for one night.  A nice modern hotel a stone's throw from Covent Garden, the ME was perfect for a night on the town.  The lobby and communal areas are modern and clean, if not a little dark.  The check-in desk was located in a stunning pyramid-shaped marble area on the first floor.  Whilst we gratefully accepted a glass of prosecco on arrival, it then took an unreasonable amount of time to check-in: the staff appeared more focussed on taking calls, and were heads down in their computers.  

Our room was modern and faultless, however was not equipped with an iron and ironing board.  Breakfast was great; the staff was attentive and professional - far more so than the less than impressive performance at check-in.

My only real gripe pertains to the hotel's approach to guests wishing to visit the hotel's Radio rooftop bar.  We wanted to host a group of four friends in the bar and as guests we anticipated this would be relaxing and enjoyable.  As it turns out the lift is 'guarded' by up to two staff and they were less than welcoming: we were subjected to a series of questions and made to feel uncomfortable for simply daring to request that four friends accompany us to 'our' hotel bar.  I have never experienced this at any other hotel and was very disappointed by the staff's approach.  Neither we or our guests were made to feel welcome by the lobby lift staff, however when we were eventually allowed up to the bar, the staff was far more friendly and we spent several hundred pounds on cocktails as a result...",4,2014,11,11
148,Amazing,"From the outside the hotel looks like any other building you would find on the streets of London, but once you enter your in a world of cool and contempory styling 
As you walk past the bar area which is awesome tables with pit fires on the tables just a great place to chill loved it. You take the lift to the first floor to the reception which is uber cool I know it's only the reception but wow. We stayed on the 9th floor which had a balcony needless to say the views over the city especially in the evening are fantastic. Next floor above us is where the radio bar is located another stunning area where you can be inside or outside undercover, with outside heaters again with stunning views over the city, this is a very popular bar, so don't be late
The room itself wasn't huge but was big enough, you can control all your lighting AC from a touch pad next to your bed this place is so now with all the gadgets you know you want at home. 
Only one observation was in the bathroom at the shower area it looked like maybe they had moved the glass panel enclosure to the shower and not redecorated around that area so obviously looked a little scruffy, this minor detail did not affect my stay it just needed attending to, to make the room 100% perfect 
The staff are very professional as you would expect and all very polite and helpful
And the location of the ME is fantastic we actually walked everywhere 
We have found our new home from home when we visit London, 100% we will be returning to the ME we absolutely loved this very cool trendy hotel. 
This hotel is so 5 star if you like cool you Have to stay here",5,2014,11,11
148,Wish we stayed longer :),"The hotel is very clean and trendy. We stayed in room 905 for one night and loved it. The bed was really big and comfortable. I wish we had booked for longer. The staff were great, nothing was too much trouble. Its in a great location with amazing views from the roof top bar. Although I wish the music and the atmosphere was better and sadly the best seats outside where blocked off by security although it was empty!",5,2014,11,11
148,Excellent in every way!,My stay at Me Melia London was excellent from the moment I entered the magnificent reception/check-in area and was offered a glass of sparkling wine and a free upgrade until I left with a smile on my face!,5,2014,11,10
148,Lovely stay!,"Great location, really friendly staff (I didn't expect that for such a trendy, modern 5 star hotel - 'stereotypes and all') Clean and smart rooms and the most comfortable bed! Would have liked to have tried the restaurant and the rooftop bar but all in all, great experience.",5,2014,11,09
148,Trendy hotel. GREAT location. Very impersonal,"Located right on the Strand, next to all the theatres. Really top location.
Should not miss the roof bar! AMAZING view!
Decoration is really good, trendy, fun. Service is very impersonal. The atmosphere is pretty cold!
But rooms are nice. Do check the mini bar (very funny items in it).
But all in all, nothing that special!

148,Read this and decide for yourself!,"My Wife & I booked 3 nights at the ME. On arrival we were met by a very smart & courteous Concierge who escorted up to the 1st floor Reception.

The female Receptionist seemed to take ages fiddling about with my bank card and then advised me it had been declined which seemed strange as I had only just used it 20 minutes earlier without a problem, however I gave her another card which went through without incident. As a member of Melia.com we are entitled to ¬£20 credit on our bill per (DAY) so the girl asked for the reservation voucher and kept it.

Early the next morning I received a call from my Bank saying they suspected fraudulent activity on my account, it turned out that they had received 3 requests from the ME London the previous night for 3 different amounts so they put a stop on my card!!

We booked a Vibe room which although quite small was ok as we did not intend to spend any time in our room anyway. Everyone comments on how good the beds are and I would agree with their comments.

The breakfasts are definitely not good value at ¬£50 per couple as the service is quite slow and a lot of the food is cold by the time it is served. The staff in the breakfast restaurant to their credit were very pleasant. however remember you are surrounded by caf√© bars and coffee shops in this area.

The bars in the hotel are an unusual arrangement. The roof top bar has an amazing view from it however as someone said in an earlier comment it is more suited to Ibiza with it's prices and the loud music blasting away. However again most of the staff here were very nice and helpful. The Marconi bar on the ground floor is pleasing to the eye however like most of the hotel it is very dark and maybe explains why in our 3 days it was never really very busy plus it closes at 11pm, even to residents which means you have the choice of going to the roof top bar or the STK restaurant bar which closes at 12. The female bar tender in the Marconi was extremely nice and very good at her job and on our final night as she was closing at 11 directed us to the STK where we were met the door by an over officious young female member of staff who informed us that the bar was closed however on perusing the bar there were about 70 -80 people still in their so I pointed out that we were residents, she said it made no difference the bar was closed, again we could quite clearly see bar tenders serving drinks so we ignored her and made our way to the bar where we were served 3 rounds of drinks in the next 50 mins. I will also point out that on entry to the STK we had only had one drink before this as we had been at the Lion King so intoxication was not her reason!

The following morning there was no hot water in the hotel. I tried to call the reception however our room phone was not working and as ME supply an Nespresso but no kettle I decided it was a cold shower and a shave in cold water. In the lift going to breakfast we met the female receptionist that checked us in who apologised and confirmed no one in the hotel had hot water but they managed to get it working by 9.30am. Funny I had my shower n shave at 10am and there was still no hot water!!

We went to check out at 11.45 and were met by Francisco who asked 3 times if we were checking in to which I replied 3 times we were checking out however he continued to say he hoped we would enjoy our forthcoming stay in the ME & London! He seemed a bit out of his depth in trying to retrieve our bill and made 3 attempts to speak to his colleague at the next computer who basically just gestured for him to go away as he was in the process of checking out an extremely unhappy businessman ( maybe it was his cold shower experience etc ) 

He then asked me for our reservation voucher so he could credit us with our ¬£20 per STAY, when I tried to advise him it is ¬£20 per DAY not per STAY he insisted it is per STAY and that he needed our voucher. I then further informed him that the female receptionist that checked us in 3 days earlier kept the voucher to which he replied I am sorry for the delay by I am just learning.

The check out queue is getting longer and Francisco decides to call someone so the female receptionist that checked us in appears and our bill is produced in about 20 seconds now. I attach no blame to Fransico as we all have to learn however in a 5 star hotel one would expect any trainee member of staff that is customer facing to be completely supervised at all times.

Finally to rub salt into the wounds the female receptionist gave my Wife her card and told her the next time we stay at the ME to call her and she will sort us out. 

If you have read all of this may I suggest you log back in later to see the Hotel's reply.",3,2014,11,08
148,"A beautiful Hotel, with wonderful staff.","We stayed here as a family of 3, in a Chic Suite as part of my Husband's 40th Birthday celebrations. 
Firstly, you are taken, by one of the fantastic Concierge team, to an upper level of the Hotel to check in, and are poured ice cold Prosecco (or water) as you wait; lovely touch. 
Our Suite was wonderful- spacious, luxurious, on trend and spotlessly clean; the bathroom was beautiful and, although we didn't have time to watch them, the huge wall mounted televisions in the bedroom and living area were very impressive. We also loved the mood lighting options. Champagne on Ice and some delicious Chocolate Caramel Almonds had been left for us. 

After an evening at the Theatre, we paid a visit to the Radio bar situated within the Hotel (with views overlooking the London Eye, St Pauls etc.). Absolutely stunning- with a twenty/thirty something, attractive, high achieving clientele to match (we didn't feel too out of place though!)  The heaters outside do a wonderful job of keeping you warm! Again, the staff were fantastic-and the G & T was divine!! 

We will definitely stay at this Hotel next time we are in London. Whilst the Hotel itself is chic and beautiful, for me the staff are the star. Warm, friendly, not at all stuffy and an asset to the establishment,",5,2014,11,07

It was simply amazing and a most definitely the highlight of are night in London the view was stunning i wish we made it there for sunset. Luckily the weather was brilliant on a strangely mild november night perfect for cocktails and wine outside.

Brilliant place to come before dinner for drinks and reading the reviews below a brilliant place to stay.

148,Great building and helpful staff,"When I got to the hotel, it was a lovely surprise the hotel was in great location to see the show we were seeing ,staff were really helpful. The rooms were so tiny for what my partner paid and was astounded ,the plus side a nice balcony to see over London. We went to the STK based on reviews don't go, over priced pretentious food with 15% charge on your food bill as well for what ? This goes for room service as well as the tray charge to bring it too you. Saturday night the clubs music was playing right till the early hours wasn't impressed as you couldn't sleep, after long day in London just wanted to relax !!! I'd go to London put probably stay in a travel lodge with basics of tea and coffee provided decent amount of space and half the price.

148,"Great hotel, great location","This hotel has a great modern style to it, and as others have said, the atrium in the reception area is impressive. The rooms are nicely equipped with everything you could want, but the mini-bar is pricey! We ended up having two rooms, first one was on the first floor, but it was above the bar, which on a Friday night was pretty noisy. I asked about another room, and without any bother at all, we were upgraded to a nicer room, on the 5th floor overlooking the Strand. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. The location is great, right next door to Covent Garden.",4,2014,10,29
148,Great Hotel ,"Stayed for a few nights,  the reception area is stunning,  you should lie down flat on one of the big couches to really appreciate it.  All staff were very attentive,  rooms were comfortable and well designed.  the location is great for the theatre and  Covent Garden.  breakfast is great but possibly better value can be found nearby. The views from the radio bar are fantastic and the staff, DJ and cocktails are top class.    It's hard to find fault, but perhaps the corridors were a bit warm,  maybe they had switched to winter mode and was unseasonably mild outside. I must mention the beds are the biggest and most comfortable I have ever been in. Great spot, ",5,2014,10,28

The vibe throughout is just right, and the rooms are both comfortable and smartly decorated.
 I travel to London regularly, and the ME has become my hotel of choice.

Just like any hotel there are bad associates and there are exceptional ones.  Luckily for me during this buisness trip I encountered more positive ones than negative ones.  Even when I encountered a bad associate; it was somehow rectified by an amazing associate without me having to bring it to anyone's attention.  My actual room was was darling; not much of a view but the entire room was clean and crisp and it was all about the bed.  After a long trip to Paris and back it was truly a place to re energize!

The room itself was amazing, a really great space. Location perfect
however, 
for me there was something that didn't make me feel at home when outside of my room. The radio bar was just too flash and the bar downstairs in the foyer was a bit like a waiting room for something else. 
I truly had a lovely time and it was definitely one of the best rooms I have ever stayed in but maybe i just like something a little less flash!",4,2014,10,23

148,There was something missing.......,"Having seen the website and great reviews, I booked the ME with high hopes.  The staff on the Concierge desk were indeed welcoming and very helpful.  The reception area was extremely impressive and having a glass of bubbles on check-in was definitely a nice touch.  We booked an Energy Terrace room on the 9th floor.  The room had some nice features and a gorgeous bath but in our opinion was too small and didn't represent good value for money.  We felt it just wasn't special enough and a bit too much like a room at home.  The terrace was large but the balcony wall was too high.  Its a shame it wasn't glass because that would have given it the real wow factor.  After several frustrating lift journeys and a rather frosty reception from both the elevator staff and the  'Gate Keeper' of the Radio Bar, we got to our table. Again we felt something was missing.  The service was fine but we waited a long time for our third and fourth round of drinks to be served.  For supper we ate at STK and it was absolutely fabulous.  I highly recommend the oysters and shots to start, and feather steak with truffle chips and pepper sauce as a main.  I had the best Cosmopolitan cocktail I've ever had any where in the world so will definitely be going back to experience one again.",4,2014,10,19
148,Superb Hotel!,"My partner and I stayed here for a joint birthday celebration. We booked a river-view room with terrace which was superb. Although we were only one floor below the rooftop bar we heard no excess noise at all. I can say that the staff is 100% proficient, friendly and the whole team takes a great amount of pride in its workplace.
We arrived around 2pm - hoping that our room would be available early. It wasn't, but as check in is 3pm, we had no issues with this. 3pm prompt the room was ready........and what a fantastic room it was. Huge bathroom, balcony with a superb panoramic view from St Paul's to Nelson's Column - even better at night with The London Eye and South Bank Theatre Complex illuminated. Technology in the room (ie mood lighting) is a bit tricky to work out, but after a visit from a member of staff  all was clarified.
For people who dislike the narrow, or indeed wide, corridors - perhaps they should appreciate the interior architectural pyramid designed by Foster & Partners. It's a marvel of modern architecture.........a building built around a pyramid shape - amazing!! As for those who have compared it to The Luxor in Las Vegas........do some architectural research before making inane comments.
Congratulations to all!",5,2014,10,17
148,Nice Rooms but Missing Key Offerings of Two Hotels Across the Street,"With One Aldwych and Waldorf Hilton across the street, you would think ME would have made sure their offerings were a bit better. This is London not Ibiza or Cancun. Wifi access while complementary was woeful to non-existent on the 9th floor.  Rooms a bit small but had a nice terrace for better weather. Bed was comfortable but felt a bit weird not having a headboard. Tele had every international channel except US, not even CNBC, CNN or Bloomberg. I guess it is shaking off any business remnants of Citibank London, the building's former tenant. No entertainment system, no lounge floor.  NOT a business friendly hotel at all, despite being a short walk away from LSE and central for business in West and East end.  Rudely harassed for a key after 9pm when coming back to the room by rooftop employees guarding the elevator banks.",3,2014,10,17
148,Amazing doesn't cut it!!!,"Stayed recently for my 30th birthday celebration. Spent several months organising things with the concierge who were very helpful. 

We flew in from where we live in Dubai and had arranged for a group of friends to have a meal at STK, and then head up to the Radio roof bar afterwards. The help we received in organising this was great! 

We booked a Chic suite through the hotel website and informed them it was a 30th birthday celebration. 

When we checked in we were informed that we had been upgraded to none other than the Penthouse Suite! I cannot begin to tell you how amazing this room is. Two floors, 360 views of the skyline, sound systems everywhere, a huge balcony... The list goes on. 

The hotel had no reason to do this for us, we aren't travel writers, and we don't know the owners... They did it off their own back purely to make our stay amazing! And it was! 

We have been lucky enough to stay at some amazing hotels, and have received the occasional but of luck with the extra bits here and there, but this level of thought from a hotel is something I've never come across before! Surely that only happens in Vegas! 

My wife booked some other surprises such as an in room spa and champagne, again excellently  delivered by the ME team. 

Our group of friends had an amazing time, and I for one had an amazing 30th, all thanks to the ME's efforts. 

Special thanks goes to Stephan in the concierge team for making the whole thing possible. Truly amazing service!!! Be sure to drop him a line if you have a special event planned for your stay. 

We will be staying again at Christmas and we're looking forward to it already! 

Thanks again to the whole team!!

148,Least comfortable hotel I've ever experienced,"If the room had not been prepaid I would have left. It's designed like a black marbled W circa 2002 crossed with the Luxor in Vegas.  The room is filthy and beat up with white padded walls like an insane asylum and there is one tiny prison window for natural light.  There are no drawers for clothes and no place to put my luggage!  The ""desk"" has a chair with about 6 inches of space between it and the bed. What is the purpose? The bed is hard and short. The shower floor has weird creaky black plastic planks above the drain that pinched my feet and one of the heads is broken. The hallway smells rancid and there is a periodic high-pitched squealing sound coming from the walls. I'm starting to worry that I am actually in an asylum.

This hotel might be appropriate for cast members of the Jersey Shore, but adults should look elsewhere for lodging. I'm dreading the next two nights that we're stuck in this terrible room.

That being said, the doormen are very nice.",1,2014,10,10
148,"Great location, very hip.","Enjoyed my stay on business. Great location to walk to everything and anything. Staff was great. Place feels very much like the MGM or Palms in Vegas. I'd stay again. The bathroom was cool, though the floor was a bit dirty and the shower had a funky smell. Still I'd highly recommend. And don't miss the Radio Bar upstairs.",4,2014,10,08
148,"Big on super modern design, not so on function. Wow(Ibiza in London) factor for teenagers and  25yo crowd","This is very good hotel, excellent location, very cool design, you don't feel old here, that's for sure. It is not one of those ""old-fashioned"" hotels with intimidating doormen, It is very young , flirty and very fun.
We had smiles on our face all the time we got inside. Whoever designed it , probably had IBIZA in his ( her) heart. It is not London at all. It belongs somewhere in Ibiza or Sardinia or Cancun. So - from that perspective - it is completely transporting experience. And you won't be tempted to go to Claridge for high tea anymore. You are on Ibiza, so you should drink cool modern drink. Even high tea in the lobby bar - has very different ambiance and feeling. Design is 5 star, but function - is close to 2. One has to take a serous class to learn how to turn the lights on inside the room. The hotel designer was trying to save the energy with all those special features, but the effect is different - because all the switches are very confusing - people keep all their lights on- all the time... The bathroom door handles are very minuscular - if your hands are wet - good luck opening it. So, we kept it open all the time. Not ver romantic, if one does his business on the toilet and another person is trying to brush the teeth./ Shower has 2 cool shower heads - rainfall style. Looks like the designer had an idea about showering together during romantic adventures.. Not very practical, though, since the shower heads are too much apart from each other. It is more for strangers for that matter, then for lovers. The toiletries - nothing to write home about, as they say. Smell like Frankfurt airport bathrooms. Good touch - water in glass bottles provided upon demand. Turn down service is serious and professional. Plush serious  towels.The design of the area around TV - is very creative. LED lights changing colors. Cofffe machine in the room. Open are for the bar. (  they had stuffed it with ugly looking bags of chips in the open - very faux pas for high design. Once you put the chips inside the drawer- the concept becomes clear, and the room came  back to it's ""high"" life. The lobby area - is beyond description. It is piece of art, worthy of MoMA in NY. The bar upstairs has best  views, good food, which compensates for below average provincial type service. Waitresses are chatty, but not very classy, more like ""girl next door"". The guests of the hotel - mostly young women on shopping trips, spending their parents money, and looking for a cool date at night. Although they must be very happy with their London shopping - not much so with dating - majority of people in the bar and in the restaurants were women. ( which is very strange for London, where the ratio male-female  usually in girls favor). Overall - great hotel. Ask for a room size, and the view upon booking, they are not the same.",4,2014,10,05
148,Dissapointed,Interesting concept but let down by the staff and the overly complex electronics. TV didn't work when we got back in the evening and wasn't fixed until next day. No bathroom light switch need to use the electronic panel which means putting on reading glasses if you want to go the bathroom during the night,3,2014,10,05
148,Very cool and ...almost perfect hotel,"The hotel is in a great location location, fairly near Trafalgar Square.   The general outlook is very cool, trendy and modern, from the entrance to the rooms decor.   I found the the staff is friendly and quite helpful (the reception is on the first floor but there‚Äôs always somebody at the ground floor to greet your and direct you or escort you for your heck-in). 
The rooms are really quite nice, with great ambience, including different colored lights but done tastefully.  The ‚Äúcool‚Äù factor is clearly a driving principle but it doesn‚Äôt take away from the comfort of practicality of the room.
Where it lacks a bit is in the attention to some details.  For example the WiFi connection is really very slow (not an issue with my laptop, had great connection in other establishments).  It gets  quite frustrating, if you‚Äôre travelling for business (like me) and you need to work in the room.  
You would think that, since rates are not cheap you could have a better signal.  Also, in my room the handle of the safe was broken and, being one of those with the door lifting up vertically it becomes difficult to use.  So, the hotel is almost perfect, just needs more attention to these little details that often make the difference between a great and a frustrating experience and what makes it a five star hotel vs a four star one.",4,2014,10,05
148,Fabulously modern and cool,"Wow what an experience. I have been to the bar and the STK restaurant but never stayed there. The corner suites are absolutly wonderful, I love the wood flooring the lightning and the great bathrooms. Unfortunately they have no Nespresso machines in the room.

The service was excellent, with a smooth and friendly check-in. The hotel is beautifully stylish and super modern, in all the public areas and corridors etc. On arriving in our room we were disappointed that it did not have a full length window as expected. This was very quickly rectified after a call to reception and we were moved. The view was great and the full length window definitely made a difference and let more light in. The room was very well appointed. We loved the lighting system which was easy to control and created great mood effects with different colours. The bathroom was lovely with a fantastic shower and double sinks. The bed was super comfortable with high quality linens. We didn't eat in the hotel, choosing to have breakfast in one of the nearby restaurants. We also had booked other restaurants for the evenings. We did use the roof top bar which was stunning, with very comfortable seating and amazing views. It had a great vibe to it and we could have stayed all evening happily. We also used room service which was prompt and efficient. This is a high quality city hotel with excellent service and facilities. We highly recommend it.",5,2014,10,01
148,drinks in the bar,"good service . attentive staff. fabulous mojitos. lots of couples drinking champagne and pleasant atmosphere.
wanted to use the roof garden as it was a warm evening ..but private party up there  so remained in bar area ..which is also reception area. ....only views out onto strand from there",4,2014,09,30
148,"Modern, Friendly and Stylish...Right in the Center of Everything","Super friendly staff at a super modern hotel. Everything about the hotel was perfect, from the quality of the rooms to the location of the hotel. Located right next to Covent Garden we were able to walk just about everywhere in central London. The rooms are extremely modern and comfortable. We even got a room with a balcony. In a previous stay we got a great room with windows that go out into the city. It's pretty cool. Definitely recommend this hotel for anyone.",5,2014,09,30
148,Was ok but for the price I will stick with Claridges!,"We lived in London for many years and now we live in the Country we go to London once a month for a long weekend to catch up with friends and visit our favourite restaurants and shops. We usually stay in the more well known London hotels such as Claridges but my boyfriend had heard good things about the Me Hotel and we had stayed in one of the sister hotels overseas which we had enjoyed so we thought we would give it ago.
So I‚Äôm not saying its rubbish but for people expecting the service and experience of the larger London hotel you will feel disappointed as we did. It was impossible to get a table in the restaurant wich I was trying to book a good month before we arrived and was only given a table when I threatened to cancel my reservation (wich I would of done as I feel that as a hotel guest you should always be able to dine in house if you wish to) secondly the roof top bar is open to the public and to get there you have to queue for a lift on the ground floor and when you wish to leave again you have to queue for as we did 30 mins to get back down you also have to go right back down to the ground floor and take another lift back to your floor there are is no access for residents to get there from the floor of which they are staying. 
I feel the general service of the hotel was ok but as the restaurants and sky bar are open to the public a lot of them being rowdy hen parties, everytime we entered the hotel after 9pm we were accosted by security asking us quite rudely ‚Äúwhere we thought we were going‚Äù to which I replied ‚Äúnone of your business we are guests here‚Äù this happed on every occasion and I feel the hotel needs to give their security staff some training on the art of good manners and customer relations. A lot of finishing touches weren‚Äôt there no one took our luggage or showed us to our room the concierge never even acknowledged us as we were passing and trying to hail a taxi, I know this may all sound very petty but for the money they were asking I would of expected the same standard as the other hotels we frequent in London.
On the up side we had a lovely room with a balcony and a view over the Thames wich in London is quite hard to come by.",3,2014,09,29
148,Excellent choice for London stay,"I travel frequently for business and pleasure to London and chose ME London for a two night stay last week.
Having stayed once previously in a standard room (perfectly nice), as it was a special occasion I decided this time to book a Chic Suite. 
In no way was I disappointed - the Suite was an absolute treat.
Service was impeccable and room service in particular went the extra mile to be helpful.
Radio (the rooftop bar) is a must when staying here and I found the service there to be friendly and excellent.
Thanks to all at the hotel for a great and comfortable stay.
I shall definitely return ....",5,2014,09,29
148,Best hotel in London,"From a warm welcome at the door, a chilled glass of procesco in reception to a state of the art bedroom my wife and I cannot fault this hotel at all. From start to finish the level of hospitality was first class. Breakfast was nice, service throughout helpful. My wife particularly commented on the scent that is pumped througout the hotel.",5,2014,09,29
148,Interesting,"Excellent location, very good welcome, fascinating decorations, loved the layout and feeling of the public areas of the hotel, our room was spacious very comfortable bed, lighting was brilliant with the ability to Chang colour and brightness, the bathroom was extremely well appointed with just the most wonderful shower. However room service was slow and not the best quality, the roof top bar was very un welcoming, staff seemed to have a bit of a up themselves attitude.
Overall loved this hotel and its facilities but please management sort your staff in the roof top bar, they could  ruin your reputation for you.",4,2014,09,28
148,"Impressive design and gorgeous suite, wonderful skyline","The suite 811 was really gorgeous, and from the bed there was a remarkable view on London. Also the suite terrace offered a incredible panoramic view of London,  
The staff was very kind and the concierge was one of the most helpful concierges that I encountered on my traveling journeys. A standup ovation for the concierge.  
I can‚Äôt say anything about the food, because I only had the breakfast. 
I must say that breakfast was a little disappointment. It wasn‚Äôt bad, but still for me it wasn‚Äôt up to the standard that one would expect from contemporary high level hotel.  An hotel like this should reconsider what they offer for breakfast. 
The rooftop bar is very elegant and offers a spectacular panoramic view of the London skyline.

I will be back.",4,2014,09,28
148,"Customer Service, from bad to worse","I am currently holding a Gold Membership of Melia hotels, which one suppose to feel upon arrival or at least stay at the hotel. Despite the fact that the room was booked a week before my arrival and guaranteed check-in at 11:00 am (Gold Members privilege) the lady at the reception made me wait for 3 more hours until another guests will check out, which she cold do if not a privileged guest, but not in Gold members case. As well as that overall Melia rewards program stating ""Welcome gift in your room"" which was not there, but the bottle of still water. Speaking overall the hotel lacking professional personnel which will at least perform duties which clearly outlined on Melia`s web site. 

With regards to cleanliness of the room and bathroom facilities all was good and tidy.",3,2014,09,27
148,Flatters to deceive,"Well,what a disappointment.I am a huge fan of Melia in Madrid, with the Gran Fenix in Madrid being a wonderful hotel and one where I have stayed many, many times. Excited by ME London, I thought  would stay there.But at ME London there is much image and too little substance.I have delayed writing this review, as I wrote to the GM to express my concerns.....over 2 weeks later, still no response.So, what was good abut ME London? Location - absolutely; roof top terrace was great; spacious rooms for sure; some nice conceptual touches and ideas, a lovely Italian restaurant, very generous bottle of champagne as a welcome gift. What was disappointing? The website seriously misleading....I had booked a 'Passion Suite', one of the highest classes of rooms. The promise was of views of the Thames, London Eye etc. Placed initially on Floor 2, these views were simply impossible....transferred to Floor 5, these views were also impossible.Then, the walls were astonishingly thin - everything and anything could be heard from adjoining rooms, the TVs worked occasionally but were slow and clunky when they did, the PS3 never worked,the service was, at best modest.The feeling we felt was that we were customers rather than guests... and I am not sure that is quite correct at a 5 star hotel. The staff spoke the correct words, but without any real meaning or belief...going through the motions.The roof top terrace was awesome...potentially.I asked 3 times if I needed to book a table and on each occasion was told 'no'. Unfortunately, we did need to book and never were able to sit down and make the most of this lovely facility. There as an impression that the hotel was more set up for non residents - to use the terrace, the bar, the restaurants rather than the hotel guests. So disappointing given the quality of Melia elsewhere and so disappointing that there has been no communication from the hotel in response to my concerns. Plenty of other hotels in London, however, which is a relief.",2,2014,09,26
148,Disgusting treatment,"I booked a stay here over the bank holiday and had to cancel due to a family emergency. I cancelled with 3 days to go and was told by the reception team that would be fine. Nonetheless, I was charged for the room and, having tried to contact them several times by email and phone, nothing has been done and I haven't received any communication back. From my experience there is a significant disconnect between the booking centre (which is obviously a call centre outside the UK) and the actual hotel. 

Terrible service.",1,2014,09,26
148,Amazing Hotel,"One of the most gorgeous hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. 

I stayed here during my birthday weekend in March 2014.

Not only was the room exquisite, the breakfast was delicious. My best friend had his birthday dinner at STK a month later. Also a great experience",5,2014,09,25
148,Poorly handled fire evacuations,"Suffered 2 x fire evacuations in one night. Hotel staff handled extremely poorly.
Also, despite staying in the hotel it was not possible to dine at STK restaurant or to get a drink outside of room service late at night.",1,2014,09,23
148,Check in,"6.15pm..Again checking in, asking for a quiet room...same story low level and next door to elevator. The receptionist told me differently. ( went down later and of course they only had a suite) I'm not convinced this the place for me. Clearly need to step up for biz travellers. Good location and posh for others.",2,2014,09,23
148,Not for ME,Stayed in the hotel previously and had a good night but this time the Fire alarm went off twice on our stay. this in its self cannot be helped but the attitude and the way the staff spoke to guests forcing them to move into a alley way at the back of the hotel was disgusting. If this was for safety i could understand but it was not. If there had been a fire this would have put guests at a higher risk. We were put there so the hotel didn't look bad with people standing around. Disgusted. ,1,2014,09,23
148,Room for service and attitude improvements - But good !,We visited for several nights so got to see quiet and busy times. The hotel is in a great location that in itself helps in London. Hotel and room quality were good. Service on the other hand is what this hotel does not live up to expectations on. There are many supportive and helpful staff but this is blunted by some who are not welcoming or supportive in a positive way. This is expressed in a typical could not care less attitude and from the start of customer interaction to finish they have no intention of doing anything more than something which seems like a burden to them. Its a huge shame because it reflects badly on the good staff. So ME get your staff service in order and your product will be much improved.,4,2014,09,23
148,A great place to stay but a bit dark,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary on the 20/9. Fantastic modern hotel. In a superb location for the theatre. Restaurants were busy in the evening and the Radio bar far to busy. They need something similar just for guests. 

My only complaint the corridors in our floor, and others I believe, were far too dark and finding the lift was not easy as the sign was not illuminated. 

Would I stay again, yes but I will have to save up. 

Most unusual item in the room was the kit with handcuffs and a condom. Not quite what I expected. ",4,2014,09,21
148,Fabulous!,"We stayed for one night for my husband's birthday. From the moment we arrived to when we left the service was faultless.

The reasons I didn't give 5 stars: the communal areas were airless and our TV didn't work. 

Thanks for a great birthday treat for my husband - would definitely stay at ME London again. ",4,2014,09,21
148,Ultra modern hotel,"The Me is an ultra modern hotel on the Strand. The location is convenient to the City and many of London's tourist attractions. I usually stay at one of the more conventional hotels near Hyde Park, so this was a major change. The hotel is sleek and very cool.  The lighting is generally dim in the hallways which makes for a very modern feel.  The room was very nice, especially the modern shower.  Very cool.  The mood lighting in the room was an interesting twist, with various colors available. The radio bar was pretty good - younger crowd generally.   STK is attached to the hotel and we had a great dinner there. Overall, I liked it very much.  If you are looking for an old-line European look and feel, this is not for you, but if you want something sleek and modern, give it a try.",5,2014,09,19
148,Disappointing,"Stayed at the ME London on 6th September - 7th September as my cousin was getting married and the whole event was held at ME. the wedding itself from start to finish was amazing. The food which was prepared by STK was the best meal I had ever eaten and the whole thing was perfect. If I was rating on this alone it would be a 5 star review hands down.  The hotel exterior and interior also deserves a 5 star rating as it truly is spectacular. The drinks reception was held in the atrium which is the hotels reception on the first floor and all I can say is wow! 

Now on to the not so positive parts. On booking I was told that as part of the wedding party early check in would be applied for all rooms subject to availability. We arrived at the hotel at approx 11am and had been told by the hotel if the rooms weren't ready we could leave our bags with concierge which is what we did as the ceremony was not until 4:30pm. We asked if we would be able to have our suit/dress pressed as they had creased upon our long journey from Wales however were told this was not a service they offered which I found strange for a 5 star establishment. 
We decided then try our luck and see if our room was ready. We were told it was not but should be by 1 - 2pm. 
We went off for food and came back to the hotel close to 2pm and were told that our room was still not ready but they were happy to provide us with a lower standard room to get ready in for the wedding. Fantastic, had no issue and was happy that they helped as its every woman's worst nightmare not having enough time to get ready. We completed the check in process however no prosecco was offered to us which we had been expecting following previous reviews - minor thing though however when you have paid over ¬£300 for one nights stay its the little details that count. 
We went to the room and our luggage was bought to us along with an ironing board which I had requested to sort out our clothes. 
Room was nice enough and as we left we packed all our luggage ready as we were told these would be moved to our proper room when it was ready. They said we would need to go to the reception at some point to collect our new room keys. 
Roll on several hours later and after the speeches and the evening meal had finished we thought it would be a good opportunity to visit reception quickly to swap our keys. This was approx 9pm. They key was waiting for us and we were told our luggage was waiting in our room. I needed to change my shoes so we decided to go and check out the new room which was a 'mode' room. 
On opening the door we were hit with a strong strong smell of what was most definitely cannabis. Assuming that someone in nearby room was smoking it we decided that rather than miss first dance etc we would ignore the issue as we weren't going to be in our room until the wedding finished around 1-2 and assumed the smell would be gone by the time we returned.  
We returned to wedding party, letting a few people know about the weird smell in our room and carried on with the evening. 
Roll on 2am and we were ready to go to bed, 2 other guests wanted to have a look in our room as they were staying opposite at the Waldorf so invited them to come and look before we went to bed. Once again we were hit with the same awful smell that they also identified as being cannabis. They couldn't believe how strong it was and we decided to go to reception to alert them of the issue. 
I believe it was Nick on reception who we spoke to who was very helpful however as he was the only person there he said there was little he could do in terms of checking the room. He offered to move us to a suite as way of apologising and said he would leave a message for Kenya the assistant manager to speak with us in the morning. We pointed out this was kind but was of no real benefit to us as it was now 2am and we would simply be going to bed, waking up and checking out again however we accepted the room as we didn't want to sleep in the room that smelt disgusting. 
We were advised that the suite room was on the 1st floor, which we thought strange as assumed they would be higher up. We went and collected our bags from our room and moved them ourselves to our 1st floor suite. On entering the suite we realised why it was on the ground floor, because it was a room that had been specially adapted for disabled people. I don't have an issue with that except that unless you needed one of these rooms you wouldn't book it or pay for it and as we had been told it was an upgrade I found it particularly insulting. It also meant that as the room wasn't prepared for us we didn't get to experience any of the little touches that the aura team had left in our previous room. Another minor issue but once again the little things. 
In the morning we went to check out and spoke with Kenya who sympathised with us and was extremely apologetic.  We were told they believed it was down to a cleaning product however the two other rooms we stayed with didn't smell like that! She offered us a full refund including anything we had used from the mini bar which I believe we only had a couple of soft drinks from or a free nights stay with them in the future. As we rarely go to London we said we were happy to take the refund and were grateful for how helpful she was. We were told it could take up to a week for the refund to process. 

Roll on to 10 days later and no refund has been received. I have sent two e-mails to Kenya and she has not acknowledged either of them. 

Overall mixed feelings for the hotel as the wedding was so amazing and the staff were extremely helpful.  Maybe we were just really unlucky!",1,2014,09,17
148,Best Hotel in London,"I have been to London several times and, this is not only the best Hotel I have ever stayed but also the location is awesome.
The staff is very friendly, the restaurants and the bar at the lobby are also great.
",5,2014,09,17
148,Trendy but trying too hard..,"Stayed here recently during London Fashion week. The hotel is in a great location - opposite the theatres & the Savoy, right on the corner of Covent Garden, the Strand - all of London's wonderful tourist traps.
As you enter the hotel, you walk through lots of crazy statues & pieces of art, past the lobby bar & then to the lifts.
I hadn't stayed here before, but I had an overwhelming sense of deja vue...
All I could think of was how like W in Leceister Square it was. Reception on the first floor. Mic'd up Bouncers guarding the lifts, dark (pitch black) corridors with very low level lighting - making it very hard to find your room. We stayed in a Vibe room - overlooking the theatre where Mama Mia is playing. Great mood lighting. Great little touches in the drawers, or hidden in boxes - mouth wash, face cleansers, cotton buds, sewing kit. Everything you could think of but none of the cheeky touches that W offers (with its mini bar of drinks, chocolates & sex toys...).
Everything was controlled by a touch panel at the side of the bed. Dim the lights, sexy lights, lights in bathroom only, turn on the TV, check your bill, change the temperature. 
Yes all very lovely & gimmicky but the W were doing this 4 years ago!!!
I love a nice trendy hotel, but it would be nice for a bit of originality.",4,2014,09,17
148,Stunning and worth the money,This hotel is amazing and staff are really professional and helpful. We stayed here as a group and we were all very impressed. We finished the night on the roof bar terrace with views over London which finished of the night. Great night with friends or partners,5,2014,09,16
148,"Hip, great location & fabulous service","Hello. I stayed here in early Sept 2014. As an American w/ only 3 visits to London under my belt, I loved this location better than some of my other hotel choices.  Rooms were well appointed, comfortable beds and the shower & loo were modern & spacious.  Excellent roof top bar w/ great views of the city -- I did not go to STK, but my friends said it was great. The concierge was quite helpful, room service was fine too, but the key was the ability to walk or take the tube to the attractions, bars and restaurants was perfect.  Hotel is ideal for those hitting the theater. If you want to reserve a table at the roof bar, I would suggest calling a few days in advance and note the [$$] 50LBS minimum/per/each person for drinks there. Overall, I do wish the lighting was a bit brighter as it was rather dark in the hallways and in elevators. Yet, I would stay at the ME again and would recommend to others.",4,2014,09,16
148,Upscale and modern in very convenient theatre district location,"Fantastic and modern hotel that we will definitely be staying in on our next trip to London. Very convenient if you are attracted to a variety of locales including Covent Gardens, Piccadilly, Westminster and City. Good sized rooms compared to London on average. Staff were very pleasant and accommodating and hotel had a lot of modern amenities.",5,2014,09,16
148,Perfect anniversary get-a-way,"We booked the Me hotel and a table at the STK restaurant for our anniversary and wasn't disappointed.

As soon as we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us. They parked the car, took our luggage and escorted us to the main lobby where we were handed a glass of prosseco.

The lobby itself it possibly the most amazing room I've ever been in! Really hard to describe and I don't think my picture does it justice. We checked in super quick and upgraded for just ¬£50 to the next room up. We were also given complimentary late check out, which was really ice the next morning not to rush. The lady on reception couldn't have been more helpful.

Room was fab, we had an aura room, but the larger type with a bath. Very quiet (8th floor). Huge comfy bed, great entertainment system, mood lighting etc. Reminded me of the hotels we've stayed in in Miami.

We went to stk for dinner and then as a hotel guest got exclusive access to the roof top bar without having to queue. In the bar the hostess arranged us a table with no problems, no charge.

The whole experience from staff to standards really was 5* and we can't wait to book our next stay!",5,2014,09,13
148,Fantastic room with fantastic service!,"A great hotel which was more than welcoming with a great location for the tube, places to eat and things to do. They took our bags for us and delivered them to our room quickly and no problems asked! The hotel staff we're more than happy to go the extra step to make sure our stay was perfect! Rooms were clean with a modern twist. Would happily stay there again! Thank you!",5,2014,09,11
148,Wow factor!,"This hotel certainly has the wow factor with its contemporary decor throughout. Check in was wonderful, check out not as good. Roof top bar was excellent with great DJ & delicious cocktails. You have to book a table though with minimum spend of ¬£50 per head so we just had one drink at the bar before dinner then went back for a night cap. Security staff never made us feel welcome and we were always having to show our room card so that they knew we were guests. Great room with balcony & quality beds",4,2014,09,10
148,"Cool, at a price.","Loved it. Very trendy, good service at chick.in/out and in the bar. Super clean and good design content. Only downer was value for money for both accommodation and the bar, but that's more a London issue than a Melia issue. 

",4,2014,09,10
148,Modern hotel in a great location,"My other half and I booked this hotel for a weekend away for our anniversary. We both wanted a central location and liked the modern look of the hotel. We arrived at about 4pm and was greeted by a glass of champagne at reception which was a nice touch. 
We stayed in an Aura room on the second floor, which was a lovely and spacious room. The bed is a huge 6ft wide bed, which was very comfy. The bathroom was also pretty big, with a double sink, shower and toilet. No bath unfortunately. But other than that, the room was very impressive and very quiet at night considering the hotel's location. We didn't eat in the hotel or drink in the rooftop bar, although both were very busy on the Saturday night. 
Being right on The Strand, the location of this hotel is perfect for anyone looking to spend time in the West End of London. We made the most of it by spending the second day out and about seeing the sites. If you want a modern hotel that is in a central location, then I'd recommend booking this one.",4,2014,09,09
148,Sadly spoilt by the drunk customers,"Visited the bar here when it first happened and always wanted to come back at night.  Lovely hotel, great check in.  BUT not welcoming either during the day or when we returned after dinner. I regularly stay in nice hotels in London so can't think I don't look like a suitable guest but was challenged quite aggressively.  On showing our key to prove we were residents we were excorted through to the lifts.  I wanted to go to the bar, partner wasn't keen in view of the general rowdiness by the lift.  We did and stayed 30 seconds.  Loud, drunk and aggressive.  Such a shame.  We retreated to the foyer bar and had to then go find someone to serve us. I think if they let the bar get out of hand like that there should be a more chilled section for residents as for us that was the main draw of the hotel!  There are a lot nicer options around.",4,2014,09,08
148,Great hotel in a great location.,"My wife and I stayed at the ME over a weekend in September. We booked the hotel for its location close to theatre land, and also because we like modern contemporary style hotels.

Check in went smoothly, we arrived early as we were having an early (11.30) afternoon tea at the ritz. The concierge looked after our bags and parked our car, and we were directed to check in, strangely reception is on the first floor. After a welcome, very welcome, complimentary glass of presecco , we were advised that the room wasn't available, but they took our mobile number and promised to call when it was ready. They duly did around 1.15, (2 hours early from published check in time). 

The rooms as you would expect are stylish and modern, we even had a balcony overlooking (side view) the Thames and down to the London eye. The bathrooms were modern wet room styles, not to everyone's taste, as in keeping with many modern hotels, the doors to shower toilet etc are all glass and don't give a huge amount of privacy. We didn't mind this though. 

During the afternoon we walked to the theatre for a pre booked show, all very close to the hotel. In fact several theatres are within a 2 minute walk.

When we returned to the hotel, we decided we would check out the Radio bar to see what all the fuss is about. It is certainly a special place, on the 10th floor(roof) with an open verandah area with views all around London. We were lucky we had nice weather and the most wonderful views. As expected the drinks aren't cheap, but no more than any other 5* hotel. Beers around ¬£6.50 and cocktails ¬£12.50. The disappointment with the bar is the fact that everything is served in (other than champagne flutes or martini glasses) in plastic beakers! When we queried this we were told it was because it's an open top bar? That begs the question ,  What about the champagne glasses and the bottles of Wine and champagne readily handed out?

We tried to book a table for the evening up in the Radio bar so we could see London at night, and after some discussion they agreed to fit us in, apparently there are waiting lists each evening and they get booked up months ahead. However, once she had found us a table, we were advised that it was policy that we had to spend a minimum of ¬£100 per person, as 4 of us were meeting, that was a minimum ¬£400 spend. I know many people can, but i couldn't drink that much alcohol, even at their prices. We politely declined the table.  We did go up to the bar in the evening and stood, We had equally as good a time at a fraction of the cost.  There is a private express life up to the bar that hotel guests get priority in.

All in all this is a wonderful modern hotel, in a fantastic location, and taking full advantage of one of londons top night spots( radio bar) . We will return soon.",5,2014,09,07
148,"I was greeted by the Doorman/Security guy ""What's up""","I don't know whether I looked ""unsuitable"" guest/user of this hotel or some sort of discrimination or is it a new London 5 star hotel way to greet guest/user but, 

I was greeted by the Doorman/Security guy ""What's up"" almost blocking my way in. 

I showed my confirmation email to tell him that I am a genuine guest/user this hotel but his attitude seems didn't change that much.

If you dislike dark lightings, shiny tiles and metals and mirrored hotel I will not recommend this hotel.",2,2014,09,07
148,Great location and lovely rooms,"Very good location and our room was lovely (suggest the rooms on the top floor as they have spacious terraces which are great for ordering in room service). That said, given the price they charge the following things I found annoying:
1. our room's wifi didn't work for over a day (was there a gesture of an apology - no);
2. our room included breakfast but on the first morning there was some kind of mix up and they had us down as having a room only rate and so denied us breakfast until I returned to my room and retrieved my booking confirmation (same mix up with the same person even happened the next morning).
3. the inclusive breakfast includes a portion of two eggs made to your liking but when I asked for eggs benedict I was informed that this cost extra;
4. it would be nice if those staying at the hotel were given preference at the rooftop bar/restaurant, which gets very busy.",4,2014,09,07
148,What a hotel!,"Although we got off to a shake-y start (our room wasn't ready when we arrived), the free champagne on the rooftop bar certainly made the wait more enjoyable.
Our room was fantastic...very big, great balcony, cool, modern, clean...everything we wanted! (I particulary loved the fact you could play the music from the TV in the bathroom!)
Had an amazing dinner at STK (highly recommended!) and will definately be back to ME London.",5,2014,09,04
148,Hip Hotel,"We just stayed in the ME Hotel for 9 days and found it to be quite nice. The room was spacious & clean. The location was great-so many attractions within walking distance. The Radio Bar was fun to have a drink at and the view was amazing. STK was pricey but good. The staff were very helpful when we needed things. Overall, I would recommend the ME.",5,2014,09,02
148,The best hotel ever !!,"My boyfriend booked this hotel as a birthday present for me and I can honestly say its the best present I have ever had !! This hotel is amazing & smells gorgeous, from the minute you arrive you are looked after and made to feel welcome. The hotel staff are fantastic, friendly, helpful. The room was spotless and fresh, great mini-bar and snacks too ! Very comfy bed. The rooftop bar is expensive but as a treat I think it was worth every penny we spent, the view was amazing ! We also went to the 2 bars on the ground floor, the bar on the left was wicked - real party feel, and the other bar was available if you fancied a quiet drink. This is a hidden gem with a great location too. I will defiantly be going back to stay again.",5,2014,09,02
148,Amazing,"We stayed here for our 10 year wedding anniversary and would definitely go back. We were upgraded to a vibe room which was really impressive. Great view! Loved the funky lighting. Champagne and strawberries in our room which was a really nice touch. Views from the radio roof top bar were beautiful. Staff really friendly, can't wait to return....",5,2014,09,02
148,Beautiful Hotel but something lacking,"This was a stay to celebrate a 40th birthday - we were asked at check in if we were celebrating anything special so we had that conversation.  Our room we paid for was standard aura room as for our budget this was a real treat !  We have stayed in moderate hotels when celebrating special occasions and it was wonderful to receive a bottle of wine or ""something"" special in recognition of this - it just felt lacking that a hotel of this standard and cost did absolutely nothing in recognition of the special occaision.  Room was modern and sleek but no turn down service or special touches at all and public areas equally modern and sleek - rooftop bar was lovely and breakfast excellent.  Just because you pay top dollar doesn't mean you get top dollar service .",4,2014,09,01
148,¬£500 Stolen!,"Arrival was very easy and a lovely welcome. The hotel smells gorgeous and staff were helpful. We were given a glass of fizzy wine on arrival and it had a lovely air about the place with attentive staff. However, as we were checking in the person at the desk asked for a card to take ¬£50 off of in case we used the mini bar. This is of course pretty standard and I didn't think twice about handing my card over.
When we got to our room I checked my bank balance and was very concerned to see ¬£479 had been taken out of my account. I immediately rang the bank and found Melia had taken that money. Not only had they not informed me that they were doing that but also when I went to inquire at the desk I was told 'this happens all the time'. 
Quite frankly I think taking ¬£500 out of someone's account without their consent or even knowledge should not 'happen all the time'. I was even more shocked that they told me they could not reimburse me then and I had to wait a week until I received my own money back. 
It was a horrible experience and the staff were no where near as apologetic as they should have been considering the circumstance. I am a very passive person and was not angry at any member of staff and did not cause a scene however I am absolutely disgusted at how they dealt with the situation. I was offered nothing to make up for it or even to ensure I had enough money to stay in London for the rest of my trip.
In Radio, the roof top bar (which is absolutely gorgeous!!) I found bar staff much more interested in flirting with women than serving us our drinks. We were charged a shocking service charge which I would have been more than happy to pay if the bar man had even spoken to us and when I asked for this to be removed he sighed and printed out a receipt, which he then left on the bar whilst he went back to chatting up the women. It did clearly state in the drinks menu that a service charge is 'optional'. I would have paid this if I had been served by a member of staff who was smiling and polite yet I wasn't even given an option. He pressed 'yes' for me each time after me asking him not to.
The room was lovely - especially the showers!! Many members of staff were incredibly helpful and polite however I really felt let down by so many uninterested ones and I cannot and will not get over the shock of having ¬£500 taken out of my account without so much of a proper apology. I expected much much more from this hotel and will be looking to stay else where next time I visit London. It was a spectacular waste of money.",2,2014,09,01
148,Great hotel,"Luxury hotel, very impressed with the decor, facilities and staff
We will definitely stay here again when we visit London
Roof top bar is great and has a good vibe.
Restaurants are to high standard and good value for money
      
      ",5,2014,09,01
148,Fab!,"We had been wanting to stay here for a while, especially after eating at STK and on reading many articles about Radio the rooftop bar.  As soon as we arrived, we were greeted and immediately made to feel welcome (a rare experience in London!).  We were shown to the amazing reception area (I wont spoilt with the detail).  We were checked in swiftly and offered a glass of prosecco.  All in all a fabulous start to our weekend away without children.  We enquired about visiting the rooftop bar and were told there was a private function but it would be open from 7. We had a river room energy room which had a balcony with views across london and to the river with table and chairs which was very nice.In the evening we were given priority access to the rooftop bar as residents.  It was a beautiful evening and the views were amazing.  As were the cocktails.  We will definitely return here.",5,2014,08,31
148,A fantastic stay,"Stayed at the ME, and wasn't really sure what to expect however both myself an wife were pleasantly surprised. Once you realise that check-in is on the first floor and not the ground floor...as soon as we arrived we were greeted with a glass of prosecco ( opted for a glass of water ). The modern look of the building made some of the corridors confusing, but you get used to it pretty quickly. The rooms are really spacious with lots of modern features, the fully equipped mini bar and all the extras were comforting. The beds are extremely large and very comfortable, one of the best nights sleep outside of my own bed!
Visited the rooftop bar, very trendy and predominantly for the young and trendy with lots of disposable income!
We did have a few drinks in the bar downstairs which was much more my scene.
Breakfast was fantastic with a choice of pastries, cereals, fruits and of course the traditional English cooked Breakfast.
The service throughout was fantastic, with mainly Spanish staff, who were extremely courteous and pleasant.
A fantastic stay!",5,2014,08,31
148,A Hotel with Soul,"I stayed for just two nights, but it was an experience such as I have never had in a hotel. The friendly staff, the decor and the atmosphere is amazing and I left feeling like I had been on cloud seven.",5,2014,08,30
148,Appalling Experience,"Do not expect to feel in any way appreciated at this hotel. There is massive emphasis on attendance at the rooftop bar (Radio) at the expense of residential status. If you question this ethic with the security staff attending the elevators, expect an aggressive and contemptuous response. At one point after descending the elevator to visit the Marconi bar on the ground floor, we were refused access by the security attendant (and we were resident!!) and told to exit the hotel via a side door. The previous afternoon, we (and several other guests) were waiting over 10 minutes for an ascending elevator, whilst the dedicated elevator to the Radio bar was functioning normally. The manager who eventually appeared, was largely unconcerned and suggested we just waited until the problem was fixed or suggested we use the staircase.
A totally forgettable experience.",1,2014,08,29
148,Fabulous!,"Stayed here over the weekend and what a great stay!  Will be back!

Whilst a little hiccup occurred upon arrival, this was dealt with by the team in a quick and professional manner.   I would honestly say the best customer service! Could have done anything more to resolve the matter. 

The room was spacious, contemporary, light & bright.  Very we'll equipped!  

Radio bar has amazing views and well a fabulous atmosphere.  I had read reviews that the bedrooms below suffered issues with noise.  I can honestly say not once was there any noise or disturbance from the bar and we were on floor 9!

Will be back!",5,2014,08,26
148,Good experience,"All good and a fab hotel close to everything!
City location, trendy, different 
 The concept is very good, restaurant nice, staff friendly!!
Perfect for business or leisure or couple, romance etc etc 
Me london is a perfect city centre hotel with style and something more!
Rooms very nice, my one was with balcony with a view of Coven Garden! 
",5,2014,08,25
148,Fashionable room,"Good points:Room was very stylish and comfortable, we especially liked the audio service as well as the beds with very soft pillows and bed covers. 
Hotel staffs were friendly. Nice location to see the musicals.
Suggestions:A little nosy when the room cleaning comes since they push the door hardly. (because of no door bell) 
Hope the bar upstairs will be available for hotel customers with priority.",4,2014,08,25
148,Electrified ‚Äì for real,"Stayed at the ME for three nights during a business trip to London in February this year. Fantastic hotel with super friendly staff. The hotel is conveniently located within in Walking distance to many attractions. The hotel is typically modern-chic with some really cool features. The room was ""spacey"", i got an upgrade for free to a room with a small balcony. However, when you started to take a good look in the ""corners"" you quickly noticed that the constructors probably had a bit of a rush as the fitting quality was a bit on the low side for such an expansive hotel. But worst of all, the electricians had probably turned their wiring-scheme upside-down. The small desk where you sat to work had a metal-frame around it and for some reason it was carrying electricity so i was a bit surprised to get ""electrified"" when sitting down to do some work. I am healthy with a strong heart, but for someone else it could have been really bad.",4,2014,08,25
148,disappointment,"Althought the staff was very friendly, the location very good,  the accomodation was overpriced and lacks serious attention. TV not working, technician called in. Telephone device very bad. no decent armchair to sit in room.2 wastebins in bedroom, none in bathroom. Wifi extremely slow.minibar ridicoulsy overpriced ( 5GBP for on very small chocolate bar) Room not ready at 3 PM. Many employees standing idle near check in desk, but onloy one person on duty. Had to wait more then 10 minutes ot check in ( too late anyway). At almost 400 GBP per night tI will not come back.",3,2014,08,25
148,"Trendy, cool, fun.","We stayed 3 nights at the Me and though this is not the type of hotel we normally stay at we had a very pleasant stay. Very modern and hip (we are a little more traditional and conservative) this hotel caters to a younger crowd. You have to check out the rooftop bar with a great view of London. The rooms are average in size but very well appointed and the bathrooms are actually roomy. Modern and sleek, the rooms have everything you would expect including a electronic keypad to control everything from your bed. The staff was very nice, professional, and helpful. The concierge got us great seats for a play at the last minute. ",5,2014,08,24
148,Underwhelmed,"We often stay at the W in london and thought this time we would try the ME. It has all the elements you would expect of the hotel of this nature (design, location, fit out etc) but something is just missing (soul, service and quality mainly). We often judge hotels by the quality of a club sandwich, if they can't that right with room service we don't bother using the restaurants, and the ME was average (and messy) it left crumbs on the carpet, which over a 3 days period were not vacuumed from the carpet, not what you would expect. 
We tried the rooftop cocktail bar with friends, disappointing and don't get the hype, the furniture was low end and appeared to come from B&Q at the last minute, and adding 15% gratuity (average in London is 12.5%) was rude. There are many other places in London that do cocktails better. 
The hotel needs to lift its game, add the little extras, perhaps their executive should staying in the some W hotels, they would then understand what they are missing.",3,2014,08,24
148,Above my expectations for a central London Hotel,"We found out about this hotel through the entertainer in Dubai... hence we decided as we were going to be getting a night free.. and it is a five star hotel.... lets try it out...

I stayed there with my family about a month ago.. two adults and two young children 4 & 6 and was pleasantly surprised

Positives:
1. Large and beautiful rooms... ours also had a view towards the theatres
2. Breakfast was great... you basically got your basic cereal, cheeses and fruit from the buffet and order your eggs and toast
3. Location is perfect, especially if you want to walk around central London
4. Staff friendly and helpful
5. And finally they accept entertainer vouchers... so we got a night free!!!!
6. We heard there is a really cool roof bar... but could not visit at night due to the kids...

Negatives:
Not really any negatives that would impact me from staying there again, however they do have a policy only one child per room... which I think it's a bit too much, especially when we could all fit comfortably in one room... hence I had to pay for two rooms per night... and it is a bit pricey...  however for what you get... you can oversee it!!!",5,2014,08,23
148,Excellent Service and Location,"Simply an excellent hotel. - perfect location, near Covent Garden, Beautiful design, room specious and very clean, wifi free and worked little bit slow.. and service was very good.
Staff very welcoming and helpful.
Surely will stay here on my next visits to London",5,2014,08,23
148,True Upscale Contemporary Luxury,"This hotel exceeded all expectations. Best service of all my 3x to London. From the Champagne greeting us as we checked in, to the turn down service it was 5 star all the way. Was refreshing to experience a new and trendy hotel where service was king which is not always the case in Europe. Very impressed. Only challenge we had was slow wifi. Everything else was amazing!",5,2014,08,22
148,40th birthday surprise,Totally amazing and couldn't have asked for more.... Treated us brilliantly and organised our Urban Energy room and surprise birthday messages and champagne etc perfectly.... Been before to the Radio bar and had great treatment then and this time was even more exceptional.... Yes a pricey hotel but worth every penny... Go ahead and treat yourselves.... ,5,2014,08,22
148,London deserves the ME,"Hard to fault ME.  Very cool place, great location, spacious well thought out rooms (with black out shutters for all those who need darkness for a decent sleep), service is great and all staff welcoming.  The rooftop bar called Radio is probably one of the best in London.  Attracts a cool crowd with a long line for non residents to get in. Book a table if you can... Enjoy!",5,2014,08,22
148,Observe Central London from your Hotel Room in Luxury,"We stayed two nights at ME London and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The rooms are modern, stylish and have wonderful showers!  We did not spend much time in the hotel itself, but that is the beauty of ME London - it has a fantastic location.  The building is on the corner of Aldwich and The Strand.  You have all the theatres and Covent Garden in a ten minute walk.  Somerset House is just across the street and the number 11 Bus takes you to loads of tourist attractions.  We would love to stay here again and just enjoy the hotel.  ",5,2014,08,22
148,Excellent Service,"We stayed at ME London for 3 nights this August. The staff made our stay very enjoyable. Because we were only staying in London for 3 days we needed to pack everything in, and the staff, especially Emiliano Del Pizzo (concierge), was extremely helpful. They suggested all the spots to visit, and booked a private tour of London and a night at the theatre for us. We would stay at this hotel again for the service alone!",5,2014,08,22
148,A hotel better than the web says it is !,"From the moment you enter the hotel you are treated like it's only guest and surrounded by a pristine, modern, comfortable environment.  5 star at its best.  My only niggle is paying ¬£28.00 for 2 drinks",5,2014,08,22
148,ME Wedding,"ME London made me and my partners dreams come true with our wedding. From complimentary champagne in room, constant attention to detail, polite at all times, apologetic for waits but above all ME London is a hidden gem, from the moment you walk inside, you'll never want to leave. The service, design, food etc. is above normal standards. Every guest left with a smile on their face. ",5,2014,08,22
148,Impressive all round,"We stayed at the Me for 4 nights this month.  The staff were a credit to the organisation and were always friendly and willing to help.  The hotel is impressive all round, from the seven story reception with projections on the walls, the rooftop bar with views over the city and the ultra modern design of the bedrooms. 
Admittedly this all comes at a cost, however this hotel does compare well with other 5* hotels in the capital and I would definitely recommend this hotel over some of the more established premises nearby.",5,2014,08,20
148,We'll be back,"Great hotel, perfect location, very helpful and friendly staff. The rooms were very clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Nice view from our room. Interesting gadgets in our room.  Amazing view in the rooftop bar.We'll be back!!",5,2014,08,20
148,Absolutely Amazing!,"Located in the heart of the action and near the city‚Äôs main theatres, exclusive boutiques, fashionable hot spots and trendy night clubs. It‚Äôs true. A superb hotel. The staff is friendly, attentive and makes you feel warmly welcomed during your stay. Very modern minimalist design with high tech features. The room was spacious, clean, great views. We had a lovely balcony, small but useful. The public rooms and bar are luxurious. Everything was perfect. I would stay here next time when we visit London.",5,2014,08,20
148,Comfort in a perfect location,"Have stayed here twice in recent months. The location cannot be beaten if you want to spend your time around the sites. The Tower of London is 2 miles in one direction and The Tate is two miles in the opposite direction. And Covent Garden is literally just around the corner. The hotel is comfortable, the breakfast is awesome, the staff friendly and professional and the rooftop bar a wonderful spot go relax after all that walking. It has a cool chic vibe and if the budget can stretch to it it's worth the treat.
My only comment would be that housekeeping knocking on the door at 8.30am on a Saturday morning was really not ideal.",5,2014,08,19
148,This is ME,"Stayed here recently & loved it from arriving to leaving. The Hotel is Uber chic & the Team were extremely welcoming, friendly & happy to help. 
A glass of Prosecco on arrival is always a good start & the feel good factor carried on throughout. The room was luxurious & we loved all the little extras like the light settings including one for ""sexy"" 
We didn't bring our dog along but there was even a room menu for all the pampered pooches! The beds were extremely comfortable & we had a lovely stay here & we would highly recommend it to anyone visiting London. 
You must definitely have a drink in the rooftop bar with stunning views over London, simply sublime",4,2014,08,18
148,Wonderful experience,"Went to London for a few dates to relax and the ME hotel was just what I needed. Staff extremely friendly and helpful, very good restaurants and the rooms are fantastic. Also better location impossible. ",5,2014,08,18
148,Disappointed,I would not rate this as a 5 star On par with other 4star hotels public areas very impressive bedrooms not so much very dark with not a lot natural light no sockets for hair dryers etc near to mirrors so impossible for us girls to tend to our hair no tea making facilities (not everyone is a coffee drinker) and as breakfast was inclusive in the rate limited menu on offer .ME take note of London Cavendish Hilton Tower Bridge both 4stars and far better breakfast and no restrictions on menu.Having said all that an enjoyable weekend,3,2014,08,18
148,Simply amazing!,Stayed for one night it was simply amazing the staff were fantastic anything we requested was done in an instant! We stayed in room 903 on the 9th floor under the radio bar we couldn't here a single thing from our room! these people who complain about the noise need to assess the situation and remind your selfs your in london! The ME London is such a diffrent hotel and we really didn't want to leave! I would recommend this to anyone. Thanks again guys we will be back very soon! ,5,2014,08,17
148,"Great location, trendy trendy trendy!","This is certainly a fabulous location.  Opposite Somerset house (Tom's kitchen was great), 5 mins walk to covent garden.  A very trendy hotel, with very cool decor throughout and into the rooms.  Note that whilst the rooms are very trendy and modern, they aren't that big and there is limited natural light by way of a small window.  The roof top bar is certainly a wow factor but bear in mind it will be incredibly busy with seating all pretty much reserved well in advance so standing room only.  ",4,2014,08,16
148,Beautiful setting,"Prime central location yet silently relaxed & modern inside. High tech & spacious bedrooms with a gorgeous modern feel. Comfort all around. 

Staff were welcoming & a delight. 

Restaurant staff at breakfast seemed a bit ditsy at times, forgetting simple orders & so on. Bar this everything was spot on. 

Attended a company conference that was well organised & set up within one of the hotels meeting rooms. Lunch provided was lovely, perhaps needed a bit more substance to it though. 

Over all excellent hotel and experience.",5,2014,08,15
148,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Service","If staying in a beautiful hotel (all new contemporary design) and excellent service is important to you, ME London may be worth the price tag. The hotel and roofdeck, Radio, was beautiful and warm and cozy. We were there furring the week, there were plenty of lounge seats at Radio and the view was stunning. ",5,2014,08,15
148,"Understated, modern luxury","The ME London is stylish and modernistic in an understated way. Just off the Strand and close to Covent Garden and a 5 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus. The design goes from being spectacular with the cone shaped dome of the lobby (on the 1st floor) to stylish, spacious rooms with mood lightning. Service from all staff was impeccable, from check in to concierge service. The roof top bar is great during warmer days and the ambiance overall is on of understated, modern luxury.",5,2014,08,14
148,As modern as a hotel gets! Great staff and service!,"In the heart of the action in London's theater district. Very busy area but the hotel is like an oasis. Incredible design and loaded with high tech features. We had a lovely balcony, small but useful. Can't beat the location if you want all the theater and Covent Gardens activity. 
Clean, lovely beds and sheets. This hotel is new, new, new!",4,2014,08,12
148,J&C 'Style over substance!',"It looks great but unfortunately that's where the positives ended! We stayed only 1 night but  were left feeling very disappointed. We had requested an early check-in but were informed that the room would not be ready until 3 PM. The cynic in me would say that this was a canny ploy to make us spend money in the exorbitantly priced roof bar while we waited! 

Eventually we were allowed into our room at exactly 3 PM. The hotel was obviously very busy but I never got the impression that the staff made any effort to accommodate us any sooner. The  room did look great and the view was fantastic. However the blue-tooth connection with the media system did not work and then that evening the bathroom sink developed a leak. A maintenance man was quick to arrive and address this issue but is was hardly conducive to a romantic night! 

The next morning we did enjoy a fantastic breakfast on the balcony. However on departure we were informed that there was a supplement payable for breakfast- this was despite our booking with Secret Escapes clearly stating that a 'balcony breakfast' was included. We discussed our disappointing stay with the reception staff and were informed that a member of management would be contacting us. Two weeks later we are still waiting for this to occur! Overall very disappointing and very poor in comparison to other hotels in London!",1,2014,08,11
148,Me suited Us,"We booked this hotel through secret hotels and were delighted with what we got for the price. We were given a Passion Suite which was very luxurious and spacious. So good in fact that we abandoned plans to shop on arrival and just chilled in the suite before our trip to the ballet. Fantastic state of the art technology in the suite and huge flat screen TV's in the lounge and bedroom. Surround sound, various lighting options, a Nespresso coffee machine, fabulous mini bar, everything you could possibly need. There was a bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us in the suite and we were given a glass of Prosecco at check in. The staff were friendly and unobtrusive and I have a feeling we could have asked for anything and it would have been done. We had a late lunch in room which arrived promptly and was hot. We asked for decaffinated pods for the coffee machine at check in and they arrived in minutes. We were unable to get a seat outside in the roof top bar early afternoon but did manage to get a bar stool each and a table when we returned from the ballet and the view is lovely at night with all the lights across the City. The bed was enormous and without doubt the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The Hotel has a very cool vibe which we really enjoyed. If I was being (very) picky, I would have liked to get our suite a little cooler but it was a very hot 2 days and I guess everyone in every room was cranking up the air con to maximum, which probably didn't help. It certainly was not unbearable, we did have air con! I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. It is so central to everything, a short 5 minute walk into the centre of Covent Garden and Theatre land and just a ¬£10 taxi drive from St Pancras. I am always being asked to recommend hotels in London for clients and will definitely recommend this one.",5,2014,08,11
148,"Excellent, Modern Hotel in Prime Location!","I booked this hotel via HotWire, and got the room for around half the normal price that it would have been. I arrived at the hotel about 4pm. The room was ready by the time I arrived, and they took my bag up to my room for me. Whilst I was checking in, the very polite receptionist offered me a glass of Prosecco, which I enjoyed in the stunning Lobby. In fact, every inch of the hotel is a masterpiece of modern hotel design. The Lobby is as tall as the hotel itself, and is enclosed in the middle of the hotel. It is shaped like a cone, with a window at the top, which lets in a huge amount of natural light. 

After the smooth checking-in process, I was shown to my room. It was a twin (as I had specified), and was stunning. Although small, the hotel designers have made the room feel bigger than it actually is, by using built in wardrobe space, sliding bathroom doors, white leather walls etc. The centrepiece of the room has got to be the black 'slab' which is the size of on of the walls, and sticks out from the wall. It is backlit with a bright LED mood-light, which can be changed to 1001 different colours at the touch of a button, via the control panel by the bed. 

This control panel has controls for almost every light in the room, which are also dimmable, including the bathroom lights and the Mood-light I mentioned. It also controls the very efficient air-conditioning system. It is very simple and easy to use, and even has pre-set functions, with a 'sexy' mode!!! (the LED mood-light goes pink, and all the lights dim...)

The bathroom has two sinks, a separate toilet, and separate 'raindance' shower. The beds were extremely comfy, and I had no trouble getting to sleep, despite being in the centre of the strand (nightclubs, traffic, west-end shows); The sound-proofing is excellent. The location is also very good. It's close to many west-end shows, and is about a 10-15 minute cab/tube ride to Mayfair.

Whilst I was at the hotel, I took use of the roof-top bar, which was great. They were turning away people without reservations and I could have unlimited use, because I am a hotel guest. Also, the one of the perks of staying here is that you don't have to have a minimum spend added to your bill if you do decide to use the roof-top bar, like what happens when you have a reservation.

I also used the gym whilst I was there, which is small, but modern, with modern equipment. It was also very quiet (not many people seemed to be using it). The changing rooms in the gym were closed for 'renovation', but this wasn't too much of an issue.

I left my Apple iPhone charger plugged into the wall socket (easy to miss, because the walls are white, and so is the wall socket, and the charger!), but I emailed the hotel, and they sent it on for me, next-day delivery, for free, which was great!

All in all, a stunning, perfect, and very modern hotel. Maybe too modern for some people's taste's, but very good for me. Lovely designed rooms too. Would definitely recommend, and will probably be staying here in the future. Great customer service, too.",5,2014,08,10
148,Fantastic find,"Wanted air conditioned comfortable London Hotel found luxury service and comfort at Me.The wow factor of this hotel takes some beating foyer,check in lounge with 10 storey ceiling the fabulous Radio roof bar all great. The room although a bit tight was good by London standards and the outside balcony was an added attraction. Only draw back was the shower great bathroom but no water pressure in shower and incredibly complex tap system to control he water temperature didn't have a decent warm shower in 8 days. Everything else fantastic and great aircon. ",4,2014,08,10
148,Got treated like a Gem,"From start to finish, the staff where amazing, the hotel reception was suburb and the roof top terrace was beautiful cannot wait to go back, best hotel in London and we will be staying at there chains.",5,2014,08,10
148,Stunning,"This is a stunning hotel reflected in the price. It is luxurious and beautiful. The rooftop bar is amazing. The staff were attentive and pleasant. The reception is also out of this world and made better by a free glass of prosecco.

A flickering light outside of the window was a small irritant but the lighting in the room is top class. The bathroom is amazing, an excellent shower and large bath with curved ends. 

Brilliantly situated for Covent Garden and nightlife/restaurants.

Post check out I was charged for minibar use incorrectly but the customer service us excellent and the matter was cleared up without fuss. 

A superb hotel.",5,2014,08,08
148,Just perfect !,"The first contact with the hotel is a great surprise. A special atmosphere is around you, made by design, sounds, smells and lights ... simply spectacular. The staff is friendly, attentive and makes you feel warmly welcomed during your stay in a very natural way. And needless to say that the location is another key factor of this hotel. In short, is just perfect!",5,2014,08,08
148,What a place!,"Brilliant hotel, nice staff and comfy modern rooms, my girlfriend still talks about the bed, its huge and the comfiest place i can remember being...ever!

Breakfast was brilliant too, if you don't like stuffy stuck up 5star hotels then this is the place for you.",5,2014,08,06
148,Excellent Central London Location,"This is a top place.  Brill staff and facilities and the rooftop bar is one not to miss.

The overall experience was pleasantly surprisingly excellent from the moment we arrived to the moment we departed.  In fact, we did not want to leave, but hey, life goes on!  Thanks to everyone for making our stay so pleasant.  We will be back soon for sure.

148,Excellent room and location ,"Stayed twice at ME London. Strategically located at the Strand and within close walking distance to the popular West End theatres as well as the Covent Garden. 

Guest room and toilet are spacious and comfortable.  Very modern minimalist design with high tech lighting features. Mood lighting excellent for couples. 

Concierge is helpful but not to expect the same service as other top end 5 stars hotels in London. ",4,2014,08,03
148,Fantastic weekend break ,"Will be checking out at 4pm later today and will be very sorry to be going home. Arrived on Friday, friendly, efficient staff - champagne on checkin üòÑ . Fantastic room - with complimentary champagne and sweets waiting for us, along with a lovely hand written message welcoming us to the hotel. The room was spacious, clean, great views, air con that works and soundproofing which meant both nights we had a great sleep . We visited stk on Friday night - both agreed the best fillets we have ever tasted, again great friendly service - nice wine and no rush to get the table back.  Visited radio bar on Saturday night- having read previous reviews we wondered wether this would be the point we thought oh oh - shouldn't have worried , straight in, given a table outside ordered our bottle of wine and sat for a good couple of hours - enjoyed the views and again great service, friendly door staff.  Not much else I can add except we have already made plans to return this time bringing our teenage daughters who I know will love the whole experience. Well done to all the staff at ME London. ",5,2014,08,03
148,All round excellent ,"One night wasn't enough! Everything about this place is great. The check in was quick and smooth, room was probably the best I have stayed in London. Whilst here be sure to check out the Radio Bar on top of the hotel and STK Steak House in the hotel. ",5,2014,08,02
148,Great new addition but tiny rooms,All great new addition to London with STK & the Radio bar o the top floor. Unique entrance and modern check in area. The room we stayed in was tiny and the air conditioning not great. Ate at STK too which was fantastic as usual (compared to LA & Vegas that is).,4,2014,08,02
148,Love it!,"Had a fantastic stay last night at ME hotel London . Everything was perfect. From the start complementary bubbles, room upgrade to river energy terrace room 912 amazing views of London 
from Canary Wharf to Big Ben and every thing in between. The  radio Bar where we had a fantastic lunch was directly above our room please ignore previous comments about the noise as it was non existent despite party going on to the early hours!
Booked table well in advance for lunch at Radio roof top well worth it great cocktails and food you must try the octopus!
Dined in the Italian last night once again fantastic food recommend the lobster pasta. Staff in both restaurants  were extremely attentive and helpful. 
Summary.
This hotel is trendy beautiful and modern if you like W hotel on London you will like this even better enjoy!",5,2014,08,02
148,Gorgeous!,"Our stay at the ME London Hotel was perfect.  The hotel is very modern, well-located on the Strand just a 10-minute easy walk to Trafalgar Square or the theatre center, and near many nice restaurants and shops.  our room was delightful, looking out over a side street where we could see the theatre marquees for three popular plays.  The room itself was the largest I have ever encountered in Europe.  The walls were white leather, and the lighting was just pure fun. ",5,2014,08,01
148,Luxury with an unusual twist,"As a treat we stayed here, it is not cheap but compares favourably with other 4/5 star in the same location around Covent Garden.  All the staff are first rate although it is unusual that apart from the concierge and reception the staff wear relaxed dress so when they approach you (they are all friendly) it is not obvious who they are.  

The public rooms and bar are luxurious with quality furnishing throughout, a nice feature is the Marble Pyramid  that runs through the whole building and the interesting light show in the lobby, design fans will love it.  The bedroom we had was overlooking the Strand and is first rate with a really useful touch screen panel by the bed to control the tv, lights and air conditioning.

Room service is quick and if you do venture up to the Marconi bar on the roof (I urge you to do so) you will be well looked after but do be prepared to stand if you only want a drink, despite being a resident there are only so many bar stools to go round.  Food is very nice and the view over London is spectacular.",5,2014,07,31
148,Oh What A Night!,"I booked a table in the Radio Rooftop Bar a month in advance for my son's university graduation party.  There were 11 of us in the group - family, friends and a university lecturer - and we were given a wonderful table complete with our own (very attentive) waitress called Anna.  I was advised at the time of booking that there is a minimum charge of ¬£50 per head before 9pm and ¬£100 per head after 9pm for reserved tables.  Having shopped around, ¬£50 per head seemed quite reasonable for venue with such good views and great service.  We had a brilliant evening full of tapas washed down with cocktails and laughter and our only (minor) complaint would be that the tapas portions were rather small.  Nothing was too much trouble for Anna - she was happy to top up the (free) glasses of tap water (it was a very warm evening) and even take photos for us.  Would we go back again?  Absolutely!  I also booked 2 rooms for my husband and I and our 2 adult sons.  Next to each other on the 7th floor, they were quiet and cool (great air conditioning).  Best nights' sleep for ages.  A glass of Prosecco on arrival at check-in is a nice touch.  Thank you ME for taking such great care of us and me!",5,2014,07,31
148,very good but could be a bit better,"We stayed there twice recently and the hotel has some pros and cons (as any other property in the world ;).

Cons:
- room door seems not to be sound proofed well as you can hear the noises from the corridors, including other doors being closed. We could hear as well the noises from music played in the restaurant during the night
- breakfast: it's not a typical buffet breakfast as most of the items you would find in other hotels' buffets are available a la carte and at extra charge. What's even more interesting, there were no vegetables at all on display (unless we are blind :) Breakfast staff looked a bit lost at times and were not capable to clean the tables quickly
- room safe: in our room it was hidden in the drawer which meant the lid was at the top and it was really hard to pull it up to open it
- shower: the cord is hidden in the wall and you can easily pull it out but here comes a surprise - it will keep rolling back into the wall as there is no facility to stop it.

Pros:
+ location, location, location! steps away from Covent Garden, Thames and walking distance to the entire central London, this could not get any better
+ attentive reception and bell staff
+ good steak restaurant (although restaurants are not managed by Melia as I learnt)
+ views from the roof Radio Bar (but you need a reservation before in order to get there).

Design is a matter of personal taste - black walls, dimmed lights in the public spaces though the rooms are bright and quite spacious.

Overall, very good hotel with some minor (but irritating to us) drawbacks.

We will be back for sure!",5,2014,07,29
148,Ying Yang,"Inside is light, outside its dark.
This hotel confused me!
The Hotel it self is luscious and well decorated & the roof top bar is a MUST!!!! Stunning views, but do book.
The corridors, areas are very dark and made me a bit wobbly on my knees walking around, however the rooms are BRIGHT!! Fresh clean linens crisp white sheets, white surroundings & a comfy bed.
Staff are basic friendly, I feel they could do more. The hostess in the roof top bar was also very difficult even though the bar was relatively quiet, all in nice, but the could better.",4,2014,07,29
148,Perfect Location,We stayed at the ME London last december.  Loved the location.  We were able to walk to the various attractions and a whole lot of shows.  The room was clean and sufficiently big.  The hallways are a bit dark.  I would stay here next time when we visit London.,4,2014,07,28
148,Brilliant and special hotel stay ,"We stayed for 1 night for my husband's birthday on 26 th July. For a small amount we upgraded to a passion suite, room 211.  A bottle of champagne was in the room with chocolates. The next morning a light breakfast of pastries was brought to the room.
Our room was quite and spacious. 

The hotel made our stay very special. Thank you!

",5,2014,07,28
148,Would not recommend,"We booked in on the 8th floor, our hotel room was awful, the bath tiles on the floor were cracked and broken and very dangerous if you want to take a shower, we told staff about this and they asked if we wanted maintenance to come fix it, I'm only staying for one night you should of fixed this before customers who pay 400.00 a night book in, disgusting and too over rated, not even a pair of slippers in the room, one chair between two of us, it was not a good experience, we booked the river Thames view and all we got was cloud view, they mislead you. Do not stay here you won't enjoy it.",1,2014,07,26
148,Enjoyabale and geat location,"Visited ME hotel a week ago. We had a wonderful 5 days!
 The hotel is fun and unique. the staff is willing to serve  you any time with a big smile. especially the concierge's staff. the location is the best! breakfast was good in flexible hours.
the only thing i was disappointed about was: my husband was celebrating a signification birthday and i wrote them a mail-in advance through the mail in hotel's site asking for a note or any other small attention. they sent me a  laconic answer and ignore the occasion. It was a little disappointing for me. you leave great chocolate every evening anyway, why not adding a small personal attention.
other than that we had a great vacation here :-)",4,2014,07,26
148,All polish,"I wish this shiny new hotel made me feel like my reservation was of value to them.  Though I booked an American Express package, upon check in, they had me with an Orbitz reservation.  There were no upgrades available and the ""amenity gift"" was a jar of jellybeans and a single bottle of still water.
I needed two beds and they provided that, and they didn't charge extra for the flying bugs in the shower.  the rooftop bar was quite nice, however, they charged $50 per person in order to reserve a table.
The best part of the experience was the concierge and bell staff.  They were each beautiful, friendly and helpful.
The room was very modern with clean lines and comfortable beds. Great shower (except for the bugs - which fortunately didn't leave the shower area)  I Loved the nespresso machine for coffee.",4,2014,07,23
148,Refreshingly sophisticated,"Having read a few negative reviews I was expecting a rather turbulant experience however, overall, our time at the hotel was sublime.
From the moment we arrived, our luggage was collected by the door host and taken to our rooms whilst in the meantime we were escorted to Reception and given a run-down of the amenities and checked-in. My only criticism at this point is slight disorganisation. Ahead of our arrival I had been asked by the hotel to provide an estimated arrival time to ensure a smooth check-in however, initially, none of the three rooms I had booked were available and this being just after the official 3.00pm check-in time. Another hour later and we finally had all rooms.
Our host led us to our room(s) and explained how to work the lighting and facilities.
The room (Vibe) was larger (longer) than I'd expected with decent views. The rooms are wonderfully unclutered achieved by some simple devises; clear sightlines from entrance to window achieved by tucking the desk adjacent to the bed and out of view and sliding doors to the bathroom, in-built wardrobe and windows which help maximise the space. Considering the location, on a busy thoroughfare, we all agreed that it was the best nights sleep we'd had in a long while.
Unfortunately I come to a few negatives; no kettle for tea drinkers and no ironing board in the room. I do get annoyed, in particular with hotels of this calibre, to unashamedly entice you to spend more money after the amount spent on the room. The full-height,back-lit feature panel was fully comprised of items to purchase; drinks, sweets and snacks. Whilst I can appreciate the need to increase revenue I find purposefully lit merchandise distasteful. It's not a shop.
As a Melia Rewards Member I was also entitled to a limited monetary spend in the hotel per room, per day. After presenting the voucher to a member of the waiting staff in the Ground Floor Lounge Bar we were told that they were not valid in this hotel, only in the other Melia across the other side of town. So we left the bar. Upon check-out I informed Reception of this and they did apologise and explained that I could have used the vouchers within this hotel and that the charge would have been discounted upon check-out. Staff need to be informed of these offers.
Overall, the hotel has drama (fantastic dimly-lit corridors) and surprise (the soaring atrium) with a few issues but a very memorable (in a good way) experience.",4,2014,07,23
148,Great location,"I stayed here for 4 nights and found the hotel to be quite comfortable. Tried the Radio roof top bar which was OK but most of the tables were reserved leaving nowhere to sit. The room has all the amenities you would expect. It was a nice hotel, would I stay again? Probably due to the location I would.",4,2014,07,22
148,Wow! Will definitely return,"We booked this hotel for a two night romantic break.  The hotel was ideally situated on the strand, just 5 minute stroll for covent gardens, soho etc.  On arrival we were met by a fabulous concierge, who checked our bags and took us up to the first floor reception.  What a statement room!  We were standing inside a floor to ceiling marble pyramid with a huge skylight at the top.  In fact the whole hotel is marble and polished chrome, ultra modern with clean lines.  We were given champagne at check in and then shown to our room which was spacious by london standards and again immaculate.  The piece de resistance is the roof terrace bar, and though you have to book a table, you can stand at the bar or outside on the terrace for the fabulous views of the city.  We cannot recommend this highly enough, the staff were attentive but not intrusive and we will definitely return.",5,2014,07,22
148,classy vibrant  hotel,"an outstanding quality hotel. very modern, stylish and classy. our stay was amazing and was made to feel very welcome. was the perfect hotel for my girlfriends 21st thank you. not on the cheap side but you get what you pay for. ",5,2014,07,22
148,Just excellent,"Great London hotel - new interior, inventive concept, great atmosphere, great service, very clean and lean, greatest London roof top bar, cool and good food/drinks - just fantastic. My second home :-)

148,ME london,"Use this hotel as a special treat, rooms our fantastic and Radio bar was superb on the roof, overall worth paying the extra cost than usual hotels! We stayed one night as a special one off occasion and we felt it was worth it and we shall definitely return, we were upgraded free to a chic suite as the energy river room was double booked?
      ",5,2014,07,19
148,Blissful experience,I went to me London with my husband to celebrate my birthday.  We came to check in and were offered a glass if prosecco. Our room was not ready at this point & we were offered an upgrade to the chic suite but we decided to wait for our room as my husband wanted the balcony.  The room wad lovely & we throughly enjoyed our stay.  We loved the mood lighting and the surround sound. We were meeting some friends in the evening so we were unable to visit the radio roof top bar but I will on my next visit. ,5,2014,07,19
148,Bad for business traveller,"The wifi in this hotel is horrible. I have been trying to get online all night- and instead of doing what I was planning to get done I am going on to tripadvisor to write my first negative review ever. Where to start- My room gets one bar on their wifi. The network and password is written down for you on a little slip of paper- as opposed to entering room number and last name or similar like most hotels- and you don't stay logged in. So if you lose your little slip of paper you can't get back on. I asked for a stronger network and they (again on a piece of paper) gave me the 'secret' network. It really is secret as because as far as I can tell it doesn't exist. This plus the lack of ironing boards etc, a taxi rank (forgivable) makes it a pretty terrible business hotel. If they just spent a bit less money on fancy projectors in the lobby and more on a few routers they would be so much better off...",1,2014,07,16
148,5 stars are not even enough !!!,"I honestly can't believe some of these earlier reviews, I think I must have stayed in a different  place ! 

Initially I booked 2 rooms, but explained that we were coming to London to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday and would be meeting other family and wanted to reserve a space for 12 of us to meet for drinks. 

At this point Guacimara took over, and was e.mailing asking what sort of lighting we'd like in the rooms, what music, what message written on the mirror. She was so great that when she asked what our dinner plans were and when she recommended the in-house restaurant, I decided to cancel our other dinner reservation and book STK restaurant instead.

When we arrived, we were greeted by a very helpful, smiling doorman, escorted by another really lovely member of staff to reception, given Prosecco on check in and then the magic really started to happen ! Both rooms had been upgraded to the most stunning suites...the rooms were absolutely beautiful, with fresh flowers, lovely amenities, massive hallway, 2 bathrooms, bedroom, lounge and the furniture was just gorgeous.

The Radio bar on the rooftop had the best views of London and the staff made us all so welcome. It was busy and buzzy and we loved it.

STK was amazing too...when we arrived we had been given the private dining room, which was a lovely unexpected bonus. The food was superb, the staff were too.

I'm a fan of the Melia Group hotels anyway, but this surpassed all expectations. I cannot thank you all enough for making a special day super special...we will most certainly be back !",5,2014,07,16
148,Well worth the risk!,"I absolutely loved the look of this hotel and decided to take a risk despite some reviews on here being less than favourable and booked a 3 night stay for our 10th wedding anniversary trip to London. We stayed Wednesday through to Saturday and was immediately impressed with the building and location. We were met at the entrance by friendly staff and taken up to the first floor reception and offered a glass of Prosecco. Check in was straightforward and we were taken to our room on the 2nd floor and shown how to work the lighting, air-conditioning etc. The room was just as it looks in the promotional pictures - it was a really good size, clean and modern. I had advised that we were celebrating our anniversary beforehand and there was a lovely note and mirror message left for us, a nice personal touch. I actually liked the dark corridors and the overall ambience of the hotel. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed that I have ever slept in and I certainly never heard any outside noise. The turndown service each evening was also a very nice touch. Towels, toiletries, nespresso pods and milk, etc were replenished without having to ask. There are no tea making facilities but I'm sure that if we had asked the staff would have provided this for us. I have to agree that the bath robes had definitely seen better days and it would be a good idea for the hotel to replace them to give a more luxurious feel. I did notice that the ambience did change on Friday with the hotel and bars becoming busier, it lost the feel of an exclusive hotel just a bit. Yes drinks at the bars are expensive and there is a service charge but the cocktails are delicious and the Marconi lounge is very nice place to enjoy a cocktail or 2. Overall we had a very good experience and I'm so glad I took a risk, this is my kind of hotel! I would consider staying here again, maybe for a girls weekend next time as it definitely felt like a great place to party and it is in a fabulous location",4,2014,07,16
148,Style over substance - expensive but not special,"I thought long and hard about this rating because I wondered if I was being unduly harsh on this very fashionable hotel.  But, on reflection the devil is in the detail and this hotel is lacking. 

The room rate (even for the location) is pretty high.  For the price we paid I was excited to stay here and expecting to be wowed with a modern sleek hotel with all the best that London has to offer.  Instead I was left wanting as the cracks soon start to show in this style over substance environment.

Positives
- The employee that greeted us at the door was very welcoming and helpful
- The entrance and reception area are beautifully presented and have the wow factor
- The Radio rooftop bar has amazing views
- The food was good (if two hours late) 
- The location is perfect

Negatives
- The entire place is far too hot and it wasn't even a particularly hot day.  

- The corridors are moodily lit in a permanent semi darkness.  Moody is one thing, scrabbling around in the dark is quite another

- The rooms (even at ¬£450 a night) do not have a bath (you need to upgrade for that).  The detail in the rooms is not good.  No bin in the bathroom, mismatched robes/belts.  Tiny things I know, but I had just shelled out a LOT of money to stay here.  

- There are no tea making facilities - just coffee.  Come on Me London!  Even if you stay somewhere trendy you still want a flippin cuppa tea in the morning - this is Blighty for goodness sake!

- You have to pre-book an outside table at the Radio Bar, which is no big deal, but it would be nice if residents had priority.  The entrance to the bar is controlled by a separate lift and you are interrogated every time you go to use it.  The 'bouncer' approach is unnecessary and quite intimidating.

- The bar/restaurant are far from the 4/5 star you are hoping for.  I'm going to sound like a right snob now - but the clientele are young, beautiful and downright chavvy in some instances.  This hotel is not sophisticated.  It is party-central.  It is FINE if you are after a party atmosphere, but do not expect a relaxed, intimate or special environment.

Uber negatives
- The restaurant is not a restaurant.  It is a nightclub with food.  

- We booked a table for 8.30pm.  We were seated at 9.30pm (with no apology).  Our starter arrived at 10.30pm (with no apology).  Our main course arrived at 11.30pm.  Yes.  11.30pm.  Anyone under 30 does not eat at 11.30pm at night.  The food was good, luckily!

- Past 10pm the entire restaurant felt like a nightclub.  The music is so loud you have to shout at each other.  The other guests were dancing on the tables and chairs.  Again - all of this is okay if you are 20 years old and expecting a disco/dinner - but not if you are out with friends for a nice meal and a chat.  BE WARNED - this is not an intimate dinner venue.

So, in summary.  As long as you know what you are paying for, then the hotel is fine.  A 5 star location, a 3/4 star experience.  BUT, if you don't do your research then you will be disappointed.

This weekend (with room, drinks, dinner) cost me about the same as a week away in Europe.  I will not be using this hotel or any hotel in this chain again, it was in no way worth it.",3,2014,07,14
148,Loved every minute!,"I chose this hotel for a cheeky weekend away with my husband. We stayed for 2 nights, Friday & Saturday. Having read a few reviews on here after I'd booked, I was a little apprehensive about the noise we'd have to put up with from Radio bar from weekend revellers. However, although we had a room on the 8th floor, we were not disturbed by any noise except inconsiderate guests who can't seem to close a door quietly - we managed it!! I booked a 'velvet package' through the Aura team - champagne, sweets, roses & a 'mirror message'. It was all a surprise for my husband who was blown away. A romantic playlist was on the media hub when we walked in & the lighting was soft. It was just perfect. The room was clean, the toiletries were fantastic - far better than other hotels where the shower gel smells like toilet cleaner! The room was cleaned beautifully again the next day whilst we were out & our request for more decaf Nespresso pods to be left was also met. Admittedly, price wise, I did push the boat out a bit compared to our usual hotel stays in London, but it was absolutely worth every penny. We had an Urban Energy Terrace room & I'm so pleased to say that we both loved every minute of our stay. The location was great, right in the heart of everything you need. I can't comment on Radio bar, we didn't even attempt to get in there. Having checked reviews specifically for the Radio bar, they were mainly so appalling that we didn't waste our time. At 47, we'd have probably been too old to fit in anyway! This is a thoroughly modern hotel with some lovely little extra touches that make all the difference. Can't complain about anything ...",5,2014,07,13
148,Shocking Service,"What a wonderful building (well done Norman Foster & Co), it's a shame this is the only positive thing I can say about this 'five star' hotel.  When paying this sort of money I expect exceptional service. However, my experience was far f≈µrom this.  First issue arose within 2 minutes of arriving (after the published check-in time) when our room wasn't ready. 4hrs later I managed to get into the room (no apology or reason given).  There were 3 additional issues & numerous complaints which resulted in a full refund...  Hugely disappointing as was looking forward to staying here!",1,2014,07,13
148,Ultra Modern,"We stayed here for one night at the start of our Europe trip. It was booked through Priceline where you don't know what hotel you will get, just the general area. The hotel is located in a busy area on the Strand, close to Covent Gardens and a short walk to the Thames. The service was good, especially the young men who greeted and worked concierge. Reception is deep in the hotel and a little other worldly feeling. This place is ultra modern and a bit too hip for a family with teens. The rooms were nice- clean and quiet. Very comfortable beds and a nice bathroom. I appreciated the nespresso machine being in the room when I woke at 4 AM from jet lag.",4,2014,07,13
148,Great hotel appalling service,"Great building, staff and service have been a huge disappointment. Waited over 3 hours for our prepaid room to be available. Radio bar, staff do not adhere to the dress code. Even thought we have been offered a full refund and conplimentary breakfast, will never say here again because of extremely poor service.",1,2014,07,12
148,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"Where do I start?. First of all, the doors to all the rooms are so heavy that every time the people in the room next to you leave or enter there's a loud bang and shake that feels like a 8.1 earthquake, particularly annoying as this a ""party"" hotel, so guests are in and out at all times in the morning. Then there's the room service, we have now ordered twice, a dinner and a breakfast, both times the food was cold, not warm or hot, but...cold. When I called down to complain I received a rather arrogant chap with an Eastern European accent telling me he would ""discuss"" it with the chef. Which leads me to another observation, where are all the English people working in this hotel?...because there aren't any in this one. Came back tonight, no towels in the room, they removed the old ones but did not replace. Yesterday, the housekeeping left all dirty cups in the room....just goes on and on....don't want to bore you with anymore, just take my advice and stay in the hotel opposite, One Aldwych...its SO much better, and I don't think there is a big price difference. Most of the investment went on the decor in this hotel, but there was none left for training staff to attend the basic needs of customers who are paying a lot more than average for a night in a hotel. If the owners are reading this, please do something about it, your left hand does not know what the right is doing.",1,2014,07,12
148,Just go here,"Booked this as a 2 day business trip. This place is simply gorgeous, The lighting the design, the rooms, the service.

I have only one gripe. RADIO which is the rooftop bar diner is fabulous, but being a guest only gets you a seat at the bar inside, you need to reserve to get an outside edge table. I appreciate the popularity, but at this end of the market you need to rethink this. Even if you have to ask you guests if they will come up.

that said on both nights i managed thanks to really nice servers to gets tables outside for the hr that i needed for some light tapas and wine. Maybe thats what you do, give guests priority 5 til 7 say , then sell the seats .",5,2014,07,11
148,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed for one night only July 5 .....the pleasure started as we stepped out of the car greeted by two friendly and casually dressed guys who took our bags explained the check in procedure and showed us to the check in desk on the first floor ....stunning ceiling and furniture ...here he handed us a glass of proseco which was most welcome ...

We arrived before the 3 pm check in time but our room was ready....the room was modern as expected but not cold or sterile our bags arrived straight away and we were shown how to operate the funky lights etc...

We then took the lift up to the Radio rooftop bar....full of the pretty young people but we as a middle aged couple did not feel out of place and even on a rainy dull day the views of London are great ....the staff were all friendly and the drinks and food of good quality...

Later in the day we enjoyed drinks in the lobby bar where we were served by the very pleasant Charlotte .....

This hotel is modern and very on trend right now but overall the staff are really friendly and the service perfect",5,2014,07,11
148,Outstanding,"We stayed here 2 nights and loved every minute of it. The staff from the front door throughout the hotel are brilliant, fantastically helpful and nothing is a problem. The website photos do not do the rooms justice, they are quiet, well stocked and ultra modern - right down to being able to control the light colour!
The location is wonderful, on the Strand and just moments from the Thames. Temple is probably the closest tube station and just 10mins walk away.
The Radio bar on top of the building has terrific views over London and is a must even if you just go up for a quick drink and a look. You do need to reserve a table at busy times - most nights.
Will stay again and will recommend to friends.",5,2014,07,10

An absolutely gorgeous handsome charming helpful friendly young man who represents everything the ME is about and all the staff at the ME are as lovely as Claudio!!!  It was our first stay at the ME yet everybody made us feel like very special guests‚Ä¶..they really bent over backwards for us and with such pleasure......starting with a glass of chilled prosecco at check in!!!  The hotel is very modern‚Ä¶which we love but isn‚Äôt everybody‚Äôs cup of tea.  It‚Äôs cool‚Ä¶.literally its cool and calm except on the roof bar where its mega lively and great fun with the best views of London!  We reserved a table, dranks cocktails, ate tapas and watched the sunset‚Ä¶.pretty perfect!!  We had dinner at the Italian which was delicious and even though we got a late table when the staff were probably getting ready to close up yet they were all unbelievably happy to serve us for as long as we wanted‚Ä¶which was quite a while!!!  The corridors are very dark‚Ä¶..black floors walls ceilings with tiny floor lights to guide you through the darkness to your room‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt mind that but admit it can be tricky after a few mojitos!!  The rooms are pure!  They feel clean airy spacious with lots of white and glossy surfaces‚Ä¶mega minimalist but at the same time its homely with really lovely smellies, a great mini bar (check out the room service menu for dogs..seriously!!) and lots of mood lighting.  They provide absolutely everything you could need‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the rooms demonstrate their thoughtfulness about a guest‚Äôs needs!

I needed to access the internet but couldn‚Äôt use my phone and hadn‚Äôt got my ipad/laptop so I asked if they had a pc available to guests ‚Ä¶. No pc but they have laptops for guests to use in the lobby bar which is a great idea‚Ä¶.much nicer to do what you need to do with a coffee in a nice lounge bar.  

In the morning I felt a bit confused though in the lobby bar because they were obviously using it for a function but at the same time it was open to guests as well as being open to the public who clearly meet there for business‚Ä¶.so at one point nobody knew who was who and there were no waiting staff and I didn‚Äôt know where to go to order a coffee without gatecrashing the function.  Minor point!!

I would 100% recommend the ME for everything!! Location is No 1!!! So close to the river as well as covent garden Trafalgar sq and liecester sq‚Ä¶.all on the doorstep!  But most of all it was the way all the staff made you feel really special from the minute you step out of the taxi to when they put you back in one when you leave!!!",5,2014,07,07
148,Worth a visit,"Nice spot, lovely bar area where glass doors open out onto a patio area with great views. Strange entrance and lift area is hidden away, a bit dark and unwelcoming? Seemed a little pricy too. Probably other locations are better value, but its a well kept, fairly new hotel.",3,2014,07,07
148,One night at ME,"Had a night here in July 2014 for a tenth wedding anniversary treat. Used some avios miles to get the rate reduced as not sure the ¬£300 quoted for room only represents value.

Anyway the hotel is amazing and cutting edge design and fit out. Room small but to be expected in Central London.

Offered a ¬£25 upgrade at check in so went for it. They must have blown the budget on the design and have no funds for lighting......... Corridors practically a black out.

We booked into STK restaurant at the hotel, which was amazing and then went up to radio rooftop bar again superb and great vibe.

All in all we had a great time but the wallet knows all about it!!!!!!!",5,2014,07,06
148,"Ok, but not five stars","I stayed here for four nights on the eight floor, with a balcony and a nice view of London. The room was very modern, spacious and quiet and the bed was king size and very comfortable. Location is very good. 

This is no doubt a cool and stylish hotel. Most of the staff was friendly and nice as long as you didn't try to go to the rooftop bar. It was obvious that they didn't want hotel guests to go to the top floor. 

Bathroom was spacious and nice, except for the over designed shower that probably makes it impossible to clean. Tiles in the floor were broken, as well as the towel hangers, and old hair and other nasty stuff was on the floor. 

For a five star hotel the devil is in the details, and there are a lot of small things this hotel has to work on: Wifi was complimentary but could take hours to start working, curtains were hanging loose, razor sharp metal edges on the desk, broken details in the room, balcony was very dirty. Small but not unimportant things that together give an overall bad impression.

This is more of a four star hotel than a five star. I would not stay here again. There are better three and four star hotels in London.",3,2014,07,05
148,Not for the claustrophobic and don't get much for your money!,"As previous guests have mentioned...you go here to see the novel architecture. The centre of the hotel where the reception is based is a 10 storey black marble pyramid so staff work in semi darkness with no natural light....it's quite bizarre but impressive. The rooms are based in black corridors around the outside of the pyramid -again no natural lighting and the room we were in (aura) had a high sealed window so the hotel does feel quite tomb like!! Felt quite claustrophobic. The rack rate for the room is ¬£445 a night.......let me say that again.....¬£445!!!! And it is by far and away the smallest room I have ever had in a london hotel 5 star or 4star. The next surprise was ...no bath- just a shower!  Didn't think you could achieve 5 star rating by any accrediting agency without a bath?  When I queried this was told I had a 'cheaper' room (seriously?) and would need to upgrade for a bath.......and breakfast!!!! The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning best I have had in London-v quiet and v efficient. But really you don't get a lot for your money...an expensive but well stocked mini bar and would have liked a tea and coffee tray but got a poncy nespresso machine but no tea.  No spa and bizarrely-bath robes without belts every day  (did someone hang themselves in hotel?.)There were children in room next to ours and at one stage I thought they were actually in our room at night!  You could make out every word said and we had a very disturbed night so sound insulation v poor. Went to rooftop bar first afternoon- it was almost empty but after being seated-waited 20 mins and no one came to serve us so we left and went to covent garden instead.  The bar and other rooms are hired out for functions and open to public so guests cannot guarantee access. Staff were very polite and helpful although having 'only' booked the entry level aura room did feel somewhat of a second class citizen!  Overall- great location, tiny room, mad lighting system and not a lot for your money! Have paid less than half the rate for other 5 stars in London.",3,2014,07,04
148,Great service but room disappointing,"This is a perfect location, ideal for visiting Covent Garden. From the moment you arrive the staff are attentive and welcoming even a lovely glass of chilled Prosecco at check- in. Once you find your room as the corridors are so dark (which I personally didn't like but that's very much a subjective view) the contrast of a bright white room is startling and great. The room we stayed in was the standard Aura and I will be honest was a bit underwhelming. The room is fairly small and the technology tv and lighting is over complicated which if you are only staying for one night is frustrating and I would recommend getting a demo off housekeeping that really helped! The rooftop bar is the best feature of the hotel with fantastic views over London. It's a bit pricey but totally worth it. Breakfast good too although they miss a trick not serving freshly cooked stuff to order, the only thing the 2 chefs prepare is eggs which as they are they could do eggs benedict and other stuff, as elsewhere though the staff are lovely. We did see a suite which looked fab and I would suggest upgrading to a vibe or a suite if you can.",4,2014,07,03
148,Good but not good enough for the price.,"Lovely room, bed was perfect, excellent technology, shower was brilliant. However,  the TV signal was awful and kept freezing, was charged ¬£50 when we checked in for stuff we didn't use and wasn't informed beforehand. Got woken up at 6:00 by loud whining pipes.",3,2014,07,02
148,First Class,"Superb hotel, great location.Unable to offer a single criticism of this hotel. Service 5 star and staff are top class. We have stayed in more than 70 hotels in London including The Grosvenor and the Park Lane Hilton but the ME hotel sets the standard for how hotels should be in London.",5,2014,07,01
148,Absolutely Abysmal,"Firstly the Roof Top Bar was not open as hired out to a private function but at no time on booking, on the website or by anyone in person was this communicated to us until we checked in and a solitary piece of paper was next to the till informing us.
Very cheap and very disappointing and prevented us from making an informed decision about where to stay.
Secondly despite the fact that the said piece of paper assured everyone that the other bar was open, it actually wasn't at 11.20 pm when we returned wanting a night cap.
Thirdly the TV in the room did not work all weekend. Despite the management being so advised three times.
Fourthly the attitude of the staff was shocking. On check out, us having been reassured that our concerns would be addressed, which sadly, they hadn't been, the female receptionist was dismissive, disinterested and downright rude. she also falsely accused us of having had free cocktails as compensation .
Fifthly there were broken tiles in the bathroom which were dangerous.
Sixthly the night before, when the roof top bar was open, a fight broke out involving broken glass and tables and the police were called.
Seventhly, the breakfast was dismal. the poached eggs were boiled beyond an inch of their lives and 2 pieces of toast between 2 was provided.
Awful. We will never stay here again",1,2014,06,30
148,Worst service ever,"Our travel agent booked us at this hotel (American Express travel agent). Upon arrival at 11 am they did not have the right check in date and despite showing our voucher and documents they proceeded to lock us out of our room a day early! We have to enlist the help of our travel agent to rectify that they were going to charge us to ""stay another night""- in addition Silvia the ""desk manager"" was extremely rude and condescending. Of all the beautiful hotels London has to offer why stay here?",2,2014,06,29
148,ME is for You and You,"From arrival the door man greets me with a genuine and sincere smile passing me onto his colleagues at the concierge . I am then taken to reception on the first floor . This is assume pyramid I am given a glass of fizz whilst they check me in.
The concierge or runner as they call them takes me to my room he shows me how to operate the room council similar to my iPhone 
The room was great was taken by the mini bar which has such a refreshing change from your standard in room mini bar. Great variety of food and spirits .
Dinner was in their Italian restaurant serviced faultless food delicious and fresh. Never normally eat in a hotel restaurant especially in London where the choice is so good. But their restaurants are well worth staying in the hotel for.
Breakfast out of this world cooked to order tho a buffet if you prefer also operates.
If your on the out look for a Central London hotel make ME London your only stop.",5,2014,06,28
148,Uber cool!,"Of course it is 5 star so a wonderful hotel with exceptional service. This uber cool hotel is in a fantastic location for exploring London and the roof top bar has amazing views. The rooms are very clean and spacious for a city hotel. But for me this place was too chic, I could't find my way out of the toilets, the lighting in the room is just frustrating and it is full of young trendy people. I had a room on the first floor on a Friday night and it was very noisy from the bar. I was told that under normal circumstances this room would not have been filled but it was a very busy night. The noise was not horrendous, but you could not describe this as a quiet and peaceful room! The hotel was beautiful and if you are looking for somewhere ultra trendy, ultra modern, good food, great location and you like to stay up and party this could be the place for you.",4,2014,06,27
148,Excellent experience at the ME,"Really enjoyed staying last weekend. In a sea of hotels this one stands out with its unique design, quirky touches and extras. The staff were a delight - unobtrusive but so eager to help. Loved the message, Aura team and would totally recommend.",5,2014,06,27
148,Simply Awesome!,"I can't say enough about how crazy wonderful this place is. We reserved a Chic Suite but were upgraded to a Passion Suite for our three night stay in early June. It was great. A round bedroom, side sitting room and 1.5 bathrooms with a tub that could likely fit three people. I agree with folks that the hallways are dark and the remote controls for the room can be slightly confusing but this is a modern hotel with a cool edge. If you want the standard fare, stay accross the street at One Aldwych but if you want an experience you will never forget (jellyfish climbing the walls in reception? How cool) stay here. Plus, do not leave until you have visited the roof top bar. The views are amazing.
I have stayed in five star hotels aronud the world and I will never forget the passion suite and the ME - well done!",5,2014,06,24
148,Achingly cool but not always practical,Overall I like the hotel but they let themselves down on small things. Our room did not get cleaned until the evening first day and then it was just a quickie. Trying to get a shaving kit as my byfriend forgot took 3 irate calls and 30 mins and then it was the maintenance man that did it!! There was no bath which we were not aware of before :( The bar on the roof has obviously become very popular so not really easy for hotel guests to use in comfort. Breakfast was good and food quality good. Like the overall concept of the hotel and it is certainly different but pricey really. They do try very hard with the customer service but just don't always seem able to provide the basics.,3,2014,06,24
148,Classy Boutique Hotel,"Pros:
Designer and minimalist design (very zen)
Superb location
Warm and friendly customer service

Cons:
None really. Would certainly recommend this hotel. 

This is a modern designer boutique hotel in the middle of SoHo. Well connected by the tube on multiple stations incl. Leicester Square which has the Piccadilly Line to Heathrow. Strong recommendation to see the 8 PM universe creation show - it is free for guests of the hotel and seemed sparsely attended.",5,2014,06,23
148,Cracked floor tile,"Hotel has the wow factor, but our room had a cracked shower floor tile. This caused a serious injury to my wife's toe. 
When staff was informed they said that housekeeping had confirm the tile was not crack before we check in... Total lie....so questions the integrity of this high end hotel staff!!!!",1,2014,06,23
148,I would stay again,"I read previous reviews with some trepidation, concerned that I may have made a mistake booking this hotel. My experience was great. The staff were warm and friendly, the food was exceptional and the minimalist design of the room was fantastic. Definitely worth staying at again.",5,2014,06,23
148,Walk over and see the stunning design and retreat back your room at the St Regis or Ritz Carlton,"The service... When paying over 1,000 per night US and a property that claims to be 5 star, I expect just that. They have a roof top bar, that seems to be a hot spot in London with pretentious clip board bouncers controlling who is ""in, and who is ""out"". On our arrival we went up only to be told we could not be accommodated ! Really at these prices? So, we arranged our entire evening around returning on Thursday evening. We made a reservation with the concierge, heard him call, request one of their best outdoor tables... We dressed on Thursday night, went up only to be told they had no reservation for us. I went ""a-wall"", but in a dignified manner requesting a private space with the manager to voice my displeasure.  The manager returned and told us she got us a table, but only inside and we could only stay for 30 minutes... We did not get turn down service on 2 of our 4 nights. Twice I did not receive my wakeup call.  Every evening before dinner, we could have a cocktail in our own hotel bar, because every night they had rented the space for private events, which the hotel guests paying thousands of dollars were restricted from entering.. On our last evening... the concierge promised he would personally be up in the morning to help with our luggage... When he did not show, we came down carrying it ourselves... everyone realizing the slight... three people rushed to help us to our car... too late...! My advice, walk over and enjoy Foster + Partners great design and go back to your suite at St. Regis or Ritz Carlton where the staff understands 5 star service.",3,2014,06,18
148,First London Experience,"This hotel is breath-takingly gorgeous!  The staff were all totally on their game- extremely attentive and courteous. We were made feel so welcome and pampered.  We were in aura on the first floor but we still had an amazing view of The Strand. The room was spacious and the amenities were great. We visited two of the restaurants and the rooftop ""Radio"" bar.  The restaurants were excellent- the breakfast buffet was bountiful with anything you would want.  The Italian restaurant was delicious with great service and wonderful tiramisu.  The rooftop ""Radio"" bar was spectacular !!! The views were just out of this world with a hip London vibe.  This hotel is so close to everything we walked everywhere- from Tower Bridge to Buckingham Palace with so many things to see along the way and plenty of wonderful restaurants and pubs to drop in.  This was the most fantastic first trip to London and the beautiful ME London Hotel helped make it that way!!!  I would totally stay there again and would highly recommend to anyone!!!  Keep up the great work- We hope to be back soon!!! ",5,2014,06,18
148,Great location,Very modern hotel with extremely comfortable and quiet rooms. Rooftop bar is fantastic but avoid going there on sunny Friday 's when hoards of people vacate their offices and descend! The hotel is in a fantastic location for visitors to London . ,4,2014,06,18
148,"Slick, friendly and uber cool","Our first impression when we arrived at the ME was ""where are the doors??"" as many of the entry points are in black glass and seamless - with our room being located on the second floor ( which is same floor as check in counter) - it took me a little time to work out that door to the rooms was one of the wall panels located near the lift - kind of felt like we were entering a secret hall reserved for service staff.
There is no doubt that the ME is designed with the wow factor in mind - the reception on level 2 is like entering a modern art gallery with a super impressive mosaic glass light well in the ceiling. We were in an Aura room which is the standard room and, like all hotels in London, a very compact space but nicely finished. I was a little disappointed that the premium price tag didn't include a fraction more space but this was offset by the super convenient location to practically everything a tourist would wish to explore - from top theatres, restaurants, and shopping to the 'must see' London sights ( Buckingham palace, London Eye, Tower of London etc).
What impressed me the most about the ME was not the rooftop bar ( which is certainly a cool place to hang out and people watch the trust fund kids in their designer clothes), but the breakfast, which was one of the best buffet breakfasts I have ever enjoyed - the quality of food supplied was incredibly high and, although not an extensive range compared to larger hotels, certainly had a menu designed to satisfy all tastes.
Overall, the ME hits the mark as a trendy, upper class hotel in the heart of London - the service levels from all the young (and good looking) staff did not disappoint and as we were located on the lower levels, we had no problems with noise from the rooftop bar as mentioned by other reviewers.",4,2014,06,17
148,good goes awry,"I'm mad so it's a bit long. No bad words and its not a rant because i'll start with the good. 

Team is friendly and professional - they know how to make a gen-y vp feel right at home. 
Design & Room are contemporary - bath*room is fab, flat screen is big, bed/pillows are fluffed
Hotel amenities are high standard - roof has great view of london & the croud. Gym is modern. 

Issue is they failed to deliver on the basic part of the offer - a good night's sleep.

A tech issue made it impossible to turn off my rooms lights when I decided to go to bed. To understand how i felt, let me explain the context. I flew in at 11pm after a 4 hour trip. I was tired but had to work so ended up finally ready to go to bed at 1:30am worried about the next day as I had an early meeting at my global HQ.

I tried to turn off the lights with their LED touchscreen control pad attached to the wall. It had all the options: more red, more green, more yellow all the way to more mellow with ""SEXY"" lighting. All options working except  ""ALL OFF"" keeping the light on in the furniture around the tv. 

I got out of bed, tried every switch in the room, tried to see if there was a trap door in this big tv furniture but nothing worked. So at 1:40am I called reception. ""it works with a motion detector"" she told me. I put a pillow around my head and tried to lay as still as possible. I awoke from under the pillow with the light on at 2 am. 

I called back to the manager, they had to come to my room, I had to get out of bed AGAIN (to put on my pj's ;-) and I'm exhausted. The manager came, tried the touchscreen, it didn't work, he had to call his manager, 5 minutes later finally the light went off, 5 minutes later they knocked on my door to see if it was off. ""yes"" I yawned back. 

Next morning I woke up too late to use the breakfast i had pre-paid so I went straight to check out and explained, in my most tired voice, the story. ""Sorry about that sir"" the receptionist answered with slight empathy. He went on to print my bill with my minibar popcorn, my in-room dinning and my missed breakfast. ""would you like an envelope with that"" he added. 

..I had two options:

- make a scene
- share my tale on TripAdvisor",1,2014,06,17
148,Very nice hotel with great staff,"This is a very nice hotel with a great location. I found the staff extremely helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean. The rooftop bar is also excellent and def worth a visit. I have little to fault about this hotel and there are only a few things negative things I could say. The corridors were a little dark and could do with more lighting, I would prefer a kettle over a coffee maker and some of the fittings have quite sharp corners so please be careful esp if you have jet lag. But this hotel really stands out as a top place to stay.The hotel doesn‚Äôt have a pool and if you would like to swim I really recommend a trip to the Olympic pool in Strafford, which can be reached very easily and is worth a visit. You can check the opening time online.",5,2014,06,17
148,Its not a 5* hotel :(,"The hotel is new therefore the room was nice without any damages etc but I am not sure it will stay this way. 
The service is NOT 5*, the room is NOT 5* and the hotel is NOT 5*‚Ä¶ 

Explanations: 
- my room was on the before top floor with a balcony. The nice thing is the view but the horrible thing is the noise from the rooftop bar which you get till about 1 or 2 am in the morning EVERY single night! You can hear/feel the vibrations in the room. 
- some essential things were missing in the room which you expect to find in a 5* hotel such as earbuds, toothbrush, make up remover pads etc..
- no bathtub only a shower 
- the room is small compared to what you see on the pictures - optical illusions I guess, or a very good photographer 
- the rooms are made up for hours! and they are not clean - found someones hair pin near my bed ‚Ä¶ 

The atmosphere in the hotel is weird ‚Ä¶ The corridors are very VERY dark (so you can't see the dirt?) and the lifts take hours!

I didn't eat in the hotel so no idea about the restaurants but the rooftop bar is very nice. Anyways you have to have a reservation even if you're at the hotel so you can stay in a nicer hotel elsewhere and book to come to the rooftop bar here. 
For this price you can be in a nicer hotel in London and get a better sleep at night! 

Also, there are many girls around the hotel who look like call girls (and cheap ones)‚Ä¶ very strange that this is so openly advertised! 

I wouldn't recommend.",2,2014,06,17
148,"Stunning building, a real experience","I have walked past the new white brick imposing ME hotel of over a year now, unlike other hotels on this bit of London turf it seems from the outside at least a bit hostile to visitors keen to explore the interior of this historic London building.

I confess early on to being blown away by this hotel, only a brief one night stay, but it is something special. The reception area alone worth some of the cost of a nights stay here. A huge internal pyramid laced with polished black stone creates an interior space that must go down as one of the most unique spaces in London- the sky funnels down from the Marconi aerial to smart reception staff helpfully providing a nice glass of prosecco on arrival.

My room on the eighth floor had a balcony with a great view out over the rooftops of London, and whilst the public areas are black and dark the rooms are light and white and clean. Foster the architects have left their stamp over the whole place with a real eye on the details, thus the whole room can all but disappear in the swish of glass doors closing off the bathroom area and cupboard spaces.

The nespresso machine worked well and for once was well stocked and free to use, a TV hub that connects to your laptop and some lovely toiletries makes you feel as if you are staying somewhere a little special. The lighting in the room can also be controlled meaning you can change the feel and 'Aura' (one of the hotels buzz words) at the touch of an LCD screen.

The rooftop bar is almost the best bar in London, yet the insistence even at day time of heavy beats and 'party' atmosphere in my opinion takes away from what is a stunning, stunning view now rivalled only by the Shard which stands clearly in the distance.

I used the gym after midnight- it was empty, socked with fruit, towels and water along with state of the art equipment. Everything just is as it should be.

My room rate included breakfast- yet on ordering room service found at check out that room service breakfast is not included which was not stipulated and led to an additional ¬£35 being added, this was the only bum note in the 24 hours I spent in the hotel.

In short, for location, design, service and experience I can think of few hotels to rival this one- I loved it and will i hope return.",5,2014,06,17
148,Stunning Hotel. Shame about the intrusive bar noise.,"A beautiful and stunning looking hotel, which certainly lives up to its 5 stars. 
The good points to mention are:
Its location. It sites right on The Strand, in the centre of the West End and next door to Covent Garden. 
The Concierge. A helpful crew of guys, there to direct you to reception, take your bags and for generally guidance. Always very polite and helpful.  
Receiption. It really is as stunning as earlier posts have mentioned. Try and go down at night, when the light show is on. Very impressive area. Friendly reception staff.
The Lifts. We had no real problems with the lifts. The third one is for the Radio Bar, but was available to guests in the mornings, before the bar opened again at 11am. We never waited more that 30-60 seconds for one to arrive, and we were on the 9th floor.
The Rooms. High class bathroom fittings. Lovely shower. Lots of towels! Wonderfully comfortable bed and linen/pillows. Guides for the technology are a bit vague. But we worked out the safe, lighting and air con in the end. TV never did work properly.

The only reason I've not given 5 stars here is due to the noise from the Radio Bar. We were on the 9th floor, so directly below it. You'd expect to get some 'people' noise, but what I don't think is acceptable in a 5 Start hotel is hearing the base of the beat music pumping out at an unacceptable level into the wee small hours. 
When we arrived at our room after checking in at 9pm on Friday, it was pretty loud, and we almost went back to ask for a change of room. But that would mean a lower level, and missing the great views of the skyline. We decided to see what it was like after we'd eaten.
On returning at midnight, it was certainly quieter than before, so we decided to go with it.
On the Saturday, the bar was closed for a private function until 7.30pm. Returning to our room at 4pm after a day out, the music was even louder than at 9pm the evening before. It was the thump, thump of the base that you couldn't ignore. Thankfully, after the private party had ended, and it had reopened to the public, by late evening it had again been turned down somewhat. 
We mentioned this intrusive beat to reception on leaving, and they said that if we'd complained, they would have turned it down. I don't think this is really acceptable. They need to decide whether they are providing a night club for paying guests on the roof, or high quality hotel rooms on the 9th floor. I don't think they can achieve both, unless they CLEARLY state when booking that this floor will have such noise. (The club is open until 3am on Fridays, and Saturdays; 1am on Mondays to Thursdays.) 
It is a shame, as all other aspects of this hotel were excellent. It just seems ironic that if you pay for a better room, with a balcony and that view, you'll get more noise than if you are on a lower level. Depends if you intend to try and get up to the Bar, and stay there all  night I suppose!!!",4,2014,06,16
148,Epic hotel - stunning views - what a night,"Great day at the ME, started with team lunch at Radio bar, good tapas and bubbles. Really awesome views over London. Then upgraded to Passion Suite, (whilst sipping the complimentary Prosecco),  one of the best rooms ever stayed in, it was massive, fab views on 6th floor, lovely touches in terms of the turn down and lighting candles. Stunning meal at the STK restaurant, it just had to be steak and night time drinks back up at the Radio bar, glad we'd paid to reserve a table as gets v busy. Great level of staff service and awesome sophisticated experience, will definitely be back.",5,2014,06,13
148,Beautiful design,"I only stayed one night, but what beautifully chilled place. The staff are young and very helpful and professional. 
Very well designed rooms (love the window). Massive comfortable bed. 

The only downside if there was one was when we went for a drink on the roof bar, there were no tables... All reserved but with no one sitting at them. I guess that's just poor planning by myself though. 

Seriously one (if not the) nicest hotels I've stayed in London. Best location!! 
",4,2014,06,13
148,Ultra Modern,"On arrival you are greeted by the very welcoming Concierge men . These gentlemen relieve you of your luggage after which you are escorted in the lift to the reception for check in . It is amazing ultra modern setting located in the atrium . Complimentary Prosecco  is offered  which was extremely pleasant . The reception  was extremely friendly & professional 
Our room again was very modern with sleek lines and panelled white leather walls 
The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is very up to date . Lovely toiletries and cascading shower however no bath which is always a disappointment for me 
There is a fabulous coffee machine however if like me you don't drink coffee there are no tea or hot chocolate making facilities . Water however is provided . 
When the beds are turned down for the evening there is beautiful mood lighting in purple/ pink hues which was very relaxing 
The rooftop bar "" Radio"" is fab with great views over London which was especially nice at night when London is all lit up . Great service and nice selection of cocktails and Tapas 
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this modern hotel that is also in a great location . 
The concierge are brilliant making you feel welcome whenever you return and can't do enough  to help you at anytime during your stay 
I would love to stay at ME London again",5,2014,06,12
148,WOW just isn't enough!!,"Our first experience of the ME was sitting at the  bar in the Waldorf opposite wishing we'd stayed at the hotel 'opposite' seeing the fun on the roof top bar a year ago.  My husband booked theatre tickets and knowing how much I loved the look of the ME, booked us 2 nights on either the 8th or 9th floor which are the rooms with balconies. We arrived just after 1pm knowing that we could have the car parked and luggage left with concierge so we could make the most of our stay, however we were guided to reception on the 1st floor, checked in within minutes, amazing.... cold bubbly, nice touch), and in our room very quickly. Room view of Drury Lane, ROH, and Big Ben and HoP in the distance. We were lucky to get last minute tickets for Les Mis and booked into the Italian restaurant at the hotel. Fabulous food and service, we knew we'd made the right choice. The rooms speak for themselves, very comfortable bed, mini bar had everything you could need, lighting awesome, best nights sleep in a while. Breakfast..... buffet but very good quality, and the service?? Awesome.  Yvonne, assistant manager, got chatting to us for a while, we were hoping to eat in STK, the hotels other restaurant, to cut a long story short, she booked us a table for after a show. Wow is all to say about STK, food, wine, service, atmosphere, amazing, just loved the DJ!!! If you want an experience, with quality, just book this place, we can't wait for our next visit!",5,2014,06,11
148,Fresh & Stylish,"It was a thrill to be situated in a clean modern hotel in the heart of London. Architecture was so exciting. Roof Top Radio Bar & Cucina Asellina Restaurant an obvious draw to towns folk. Fabulous disability access in hotel and the surrounding area due to Olympics 2012. 
Staff very helpful and polite.",5,2014,06,11
148,A perfect staying,I and my wife had stayed in this hotel for a 4 day visit to London and we had an utmost experience in this hotel. The environment is very urban and sophisticated and yet you feel relaxed and comfortable. Everyone is nice and friendly and very attentive to whatever you might need. Everything in the room is of the highest quality and thought to the minimal details. Location is just perfect either for day walks either for going out at night. When coming again to London we will certainly stay here again.,5,2014,06,11
148,Take a torch,"Fabulous location, bizarre hotel. Rooms overall are okay, corridor huge and bedroom area small! If you don't like lifts, don't go here, there are no public stairs and even reception is up one floor. All the public corridors are black, windowless and lit by the floor, the doors have no handles and look like walls. Staff are VERY helpful though.",1,2014,06,11
148,Favorite hotel in London,"This is by far our favorite hotel in London . Service is excellent and staff cannot do enough . Location wise it is excellent and I can't reccomend it enough. I was traveling with the children but have previously been just the two of us. The Radio bar upstairs is excellent , lively with a superb atmosphere
      
      ",5,2014,06,10
148,My new favourite hotel in London!,"Everything inside this hotel is stunning and so individual in design : from the ground floor area, the AMAZING reception (and the chilled Prosecco at check-in), the rooms (wonderfully kitted out and perfect to hold your own ""private"" cocktail party!) and the stunning rooftop bar (we  had drinks on a hot afternoon but also went later one evening after dark).  
In addition the staff are lovely (not at all pretentious which can be the down side of some other trendy establishments!).
I have stayed at Hotel W and this hotel wins hands down on style/design and service.
We had some latenight dishes around midnight at the rooftop bar which were delicious and the service was fantastic.
There were a couple of things in the room that need attention (broken tile on shower floor) and the toilet door doesnt actually fully close (could do with some magnetic closure).  However I will still give it 5* as I loved everything about this hotel.  I cannot wait to go back!",5,2014,06,08
148,Knocks your socks off,"We are a few days into a week long stay at ME London.

We arrived on a red eye...landing at 8:30AM.  ME was able to get us into our room right away....a blessing considering our exhaustion from travelling.  

Check in was a breeze.  Reception area is a giant pyramidal architectural feat, with triangular marble laid vertically to a sunny opening 9 stories above.  The furniture in reception is almost too comfy....after they gave me a glass of bubbly I almost didn't get up!!!

We were escorted to our room.  A bit on the smaller side, but ultra modern and efficiently designed.  Very cool wall panel let's you set the ""mood"", from party to ""sexy"".  Nice touch.

Concierge is tremendously helpful,  eagerly pointing us to restaurants,  shopping, and attractions.

Don't be surprised if there's paparazzi out front, as there has been during our visit.  Apparently this is quite the celeb jaunt.

The rooftop bar, Radio, is a fun scene.  You may have trouble with admittance,  unless you're staying at the hotel.  We were made to wait until they realized we are guests, at which point we were quickly whisked upstairs and placed at amazing real estate: a table labeled ""reserved"" along the perimeter with brilliant views.

Sadly,  I've been a bit I'll and just now feeling tip-top, so I've lost a few days and spent more time in the room then I would otherwise have desired.  Fortunately,  it's quite comfortable!  

Will post an update at end of our journey!!

148,Nice hotel ,"Stayed three times in May at a couple of nights per stay. Enjoyed all three. Staff was great. No issues getting to the rooftop bar, even on Friday night. Rooms and location were fantastic as well. I did have issues with the hallway lighting the first time I went to my room, but it's quickly a non-issue. ",5,2014,06,01
148,BEST Hotel in London,"New MODERN hotel, great LARGE and comfortable bed, clean, shower for two, modern bathroom/shower, great food, fantastic ambiance, great service and one of the best location in town. I have never stayed at such a comfortable hotel in London. We loved it. We will be back.",5,2014,06,01
148,Fantastic hotel!,"Stayed here with a friend for a girlie weekend away and was amazing! Right from when arrived, taken to reception and complimentary bubbles to arrived in out room. 
Very comfy bed and was huge!
It was my friend's birthday and as a surprise wrote a fab message on the mirror and lovely card.
Hotel really is lovely!
Really recommend.",5,2014,05,28
148,Great Experience,I stay in hotels about 50 nights a year and rarely do hotels exceed my expectation.The ME was one of the few that is truly outstanding.  From the moment I arrived to the moment I left everything was perfect.,5,2014,05,27
148,A great stay,We really enjoyed our two night stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We ate in Stk and afterwards went to Radio bar. We experienced no problems with admittance to either and the staff generally couldn't do enough for us. The hotel is modern and funky and a fun place to stay. We will be back.,5,2014,05,26
148,Me and ME,"This modern, well-located hotel in a renovated classic building offers cutting-edge interiors, a welcoming and able staff, and a super rooftop venue that attacts throngs. Very comfortable rooms , many with balconies offering spectacular views. ",5,2014,05,26
148,Amazing hotel.,"I stayed in this hotel for almost a week in April.
The staff was very friendly, the location is great and the room is superb.

Only thing I didn't like was that they take 50 pounds deposit for every night you're supposed to stay. So in my case they took 250 pounds from my bank account and then I got it back after the trip. I think 50 pounds a night is too much, imagine if I had a very low budget on me, I wouldn't be able to spend that money in shopping.

A part from that the hotel is amazing, love the hall ways to the rooms and the top floor has a very nice sky bar.",5,2014,05,26
148,Modern upscale in the heart of London,"Located five minutes from Covent Garden, next to Shaftsbury Ave and on the Strand.  Comfortable stay.  Staff super nice, polite and helpful.  Will stay here again.  Restaurants convenient along with shopping and theatre.",5,2014,05,25
148,a few things to fix but I am sure it will be an awesome venue,"Staff was very nice, helpful and friendly and the venue is stunning, feeling like inside a pyramid, the architecture is mind-blowing. I have been kindly upgraded and had a room on the last floor with a terrace. the room was like a corridor but very well-equipped and with a nice bathroom.
There was a lot of wind that night in London and it whistled all night in the room.
I had the feeling that the hotel was not fully finished as TV was not working and wifi was pretty hectic.
Room service gives several option from different restaurant which is very nice",3,2014,05,24
148,nice surprise,"hmm, this one is tricky, 
we booked in Me , as we had some vouchers, and the location was close to where we wanted to be, so from the beginning we did not have high hopes in mind, 
and as we arrived we were quite disappointed, it felt funny, young boys looking cool , made you feel like you re going to a night club in the middle of a day, 
the design of the lobby, also , they tried to make it look impressive and super modern but was too cold for my taste, over all, it was not welcoming, corridors are black and dim lights as part of the over all mood of the hotel, 
however things changed when we went into our room: space was nice!!! the design was clever, we had plenty of room , bed was comfortable, shower/bathroom fantastic, product they used was so good and all together we had a great time, 
it was rainy and we stayed in quite a lot of time and room did not make us feel suffocated, on the contrary we preferred to stay in, the balcony gave us an amazing skyline , room service was great, 
we even used the restaurants and the roof top bar, and they were outstanding!
so overall: it was really a nice surprise .",5,2014,05,22
148,WOW,"Great location and amazing service. They took care of every single need to make our 20th wedding anniversary an unforgettable experience. London is an incredible city and Me London an excellent base to explore it. 
      
      ",5,2014,05,21
148,London weekend,"Excellent weekend, had room with balcony overlooking the river and were very lucky with the weather.  Went to Radio Rooftop Bar for cocktails before theatre and were able to sit on our own balcony with drinks in the evening overlookling the lights of London.  Meal at STK was also very good and the waiter was extremely helpful.
      ",5,2014,05,21
148,All great!,"This hotel is pricey but worth it. Located on The Strand, a 5 minute walk from Covent Garden & lots of London's prime theatres it has first rate staff & excellent rooms & restaurants.
Check in is one floor up but the concierge is located on the ground floor & they easily directed us to reception. There was a short wait to check in but the lady was professional & helpful. We were told our room wasn't ready (it was 11-30am, check in was from 3) but said she would call if it was ready sooner. We left our bags at the hotel & went off to explore London. We weren't called but when we got back just after 3 the room was ready. And what a room, lots of nice touches like mood lighting, a great view over the Strand, glass & high gloss wood mixed with faux leather panelled walls & a high tec' sound system plus in the bathroom high end toiletries & a large rain shower. The frosted glass door over the W.C. wouldn't be to everyones taste but it was still private.
We had drinks early evening & again later on in the night on the rooftop bar which was great although the wait to get served was a little too long if I was to be picky, the drinks were a little on the pricy side but what a view. It obviously draws in a mostly young & attractive crowd who all seemed to be having a good time too.
We also eat at the in house STK restaurant which was a good experience (reviewed separately)
Overall a great experience, can't really fault it. If you like modern & trendy, this is the place for you. If you like a more traditional hotel, maybe the Savoy would be another option.",5,2014,05,19
148,"Fabulous, fun & friendly!","by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in!

took my husband for his birthday, kept it a surprise! got a great deal through Agoda, spoke to the hotels Aura team, to tailor my stay, spoke to a lovely lady called Marcella, who was amazing! very professional and friendly, she went out her to way to ensure all my needs were met, she talked me through all the options, arranged my booking for the rooftop bar, had roses, champagne, chocolates and a lovely mirror message in place in the room for our arrival.  she went above and beyond customer service, definite asset to the hotel! I highly recommend her!  her co-host Emma was equally helpful, she even gave us a free upgrade to a room with a better view!

the radio rooftop bar is something else! vibrant, brilliant views, great food and music and a fantastic selection of drinks! I had reserved a table for two, the minimum spend is a little steep but worth the experience.  our waiter was Stefan, who also was extremely friendly and helpful! lovely guy..again another asset to the hotel!

all in all, I was very happy with this hotel, the staff made it all that much better! the complimentary champagne at check in was also a plus point!  will definitely be going back!",5,2014,05,19
148,A stylish hotel let down by staff,"I stayed at this hotel for one night for work.  The design is certainly striking, and it is very much a trendy hotel, not your standard business hotel.  We were greeted before reaching the door by a man offering to take our bags.  Having declined (mine was on wheels anyway) we then encountered a man immediately inside the door, again offering to take bags.  Having again declined, he directed us to the lifts and informed us that reception was on the first floor.  While waiting for the lift he engaged us in conversation.  I personally detest this kind of over-familiar service, but unfortunately it seemed to be the template for all the staff.

I understand that the lifts are room card controlled for security reasons, but it therefore seems bizarre to put reception on the first floor where new guests can't get to it without the doorman waiting with you.

At check-in my boss was asked for his passport.  He didn't have it (why would he?) and the lady looked confused and asked for other ID.  It then finally occurred to her that perhaps he wasn't from abroad, and there was no ID requirement.  She then went throught the whole process again with me.  It would be helpful if the check-in process included a quick question on where you were travelling from.

The corridors are very dark (I think it is supposed to contribute to the ambience) and makes finding your room more of a challenge than it should be.
The room was nice, and clean, but suffered from the usual hotel room problem of impossible to operate air-conditioning controls.  

We ate in the Cucina Asellina.  Our waiter introduced himself (more of the over-familiar service), but we then had at least three other members of staff (fine in itself, but why introduce only the first one?).  Service over dinner was always either too fast (clearing of plates after the main course) or too slow (we eventually had to accost a waitress for the dessert menu).

At breakfast I requested tea, and was very surprised to be brought a cup of hot (not boiling) water and a tea bag, and no milk.  When I asked for milk the waitress gave me a politely bemused look and returned with hot milk.  I don't think it is too much to ask that a five star hotel in London can produce a properly made cup of tea (in the English style).

If you are a fan of style over substance, and don't mind staff who act as if they are your best friend, then this is a well located and comfortable hotel, but if not, be warned.",3,2014,05,14
148,Pleasantly surprising evening away,"A friend of mine booked this hotel last minute on a Friday afternoon to put a roof over our head on Friday evening after we had an evening out arranged.

This certainly was something different! Black marble everywhere.

Very modern interior and rooms. Even touch screen controls for the lighting and aircon etc.
Balcony to our 9th floor room was excellent with views of the Novello theatre and straight down Catherine Street). Even though we were one floor beneath their sky bar (which we did pop up to for a drink and was VERY busy) we did not hear any noise from it.

One drawback would be their Valet park service. We drove around the hotel on Strand and Aldwych a number of times before finding what we thought must be the parking, only to be greeted on the intercom by a very rude man. Once we finally managed to find somewhere to stop we managed to go inside and find someone to park the vehicle for us. Not impressed.

Overall though good stay. Albeit brief",5,2014,05,13
148,Dream Engagement,"Planning and executing an engagement is supposed to be a stressful time, I am delighted to say however, that the entire team at ME London, made it not only so easy and stress free but an absolute pleasure.

From start to finish everysingle member of the ME team made us feel so special and they emitted genuine warmth

. Prior to the engagement when I was nervouslly traipsing the lobby, James the doorman and the rest of the lobby team (Ronan, Claudio, Armin and Cosmin) put me at ease and made me feel that they genuinely cared about the outcome of the propsal. After realising that I forgot to pack a shirt for the evening, James even offered to give me one of his shirts! After kindly refusing this offer he even offered to purchase me a shirt on my behalf. Outstanding customer service, that personal touch was much appreciated and reflected by all of the staff members.

The Aura team managed to decorate and personalise our suite ensuring the room looked amazing, which my Fiance absolutely loved. After all that effort my fiance could'nt help but say Yes! 

I can't impress on how great the service was before and after, the hotel and the staff made it truly an unforgettable experience, My only regret was not writing this review sooner! Highly, highly recommend a stay in this hotel, no matter what the occasion the friendly staff will make you feel like royalty.

Many Thanks

148,Simply Excellent,"Stayed there for 2 nights and going to make it my regular hotel in London from now on - perfect location, Covent Garden, Beautiful design, room specious and very clean, wifi free and worked well and service was very good. Simply an excellent hotel.",5,2014,05,11
148,Great hotel in a great position,"Trendy, great design and great position.
Staff at the entrance were friendly and helpful, the reception check in is on the 1st floor in the centre pyramid. A glass of fizz and escorted to a great room. Lots of space, and lots of black marble. The room was really well appointed with a great view, shower and toiletries were great too. We didn't eat at the hotel but did go to the trendy bar on the top floor. The bar was busy full of young people on a Friday evening out. The bar on the ground floor was great too,  great wine list and service. Overall a great hotel.",5,2014,05,10
148,Great all round.,"Went there on Bank holiday before going to the Opera, excellent food and service. And the pre show mean although very limited, not bad. We choose from the main menu and was Italian food with a twist. Everything is freshly made. and worth the wait. Defiantly visit again.
Did not stay in the hotel or go to the roof top, no time.",4,2014,05,07
148,Initial problems resolved,"We arrived early (around 1 pm, check in is 3 pm) - the room wasn't ready so we were told it was going to be marked as priority and we went for some lunch. We arrived back at 3 pm to initially be told our room still wasn't ready (at this point I was about to lose my temper), but we were then upgraded to a suite as the room had been trashed by the previous guests, which was awesome. The staff are pleasant and nothing was too much trouble for them.

The location is very convenient for Covent Garden etc.

The hotel is very modern (Norman Foster designed, I think) and the reception is amazing (you are offered Prosecco on arrival). The rooms could do with better curtains as we found them to be quite light and the air conditioning/lights were somewhat fiddly.

The Radio Bar is a spectacular setting, however it (along with the patrons) has a very high opinion of itself.",4,2014,05,07
148,Great roof top bar for a sunny day,"Went to the Radio Roof top bar in this Hotel for my friends birthday, what a fabulous place if its a sunny day you can sit out and look all over the city of London it really feels like you are on holiday the place is pure class. Tapas that they serve is not that great tho! and the place is pricey however as the saying goes you get what you pay for. Well worth a visit if theres a few of you book. As on a sunny day everyone wants to be outside great experience for somewhere in the city of London its in the Strand. There was 4 ladies in one round had some tapas and drinks from 2pm to 7pm it came to ¬£70 a head just to give you some idea. Will definatly go back.",5,2014,05,07
148,ME Hotel is worth a see,"This hotel is only  1 year old .Its an experience worth doing Modern d√©cor and a breath of fresh
air. The roof top bar over looking London skyline . You can see many attractions  of London
Its very popular with the younger generation. The rooms are very generous ,an I pad to operate the lights and the air con state of the art .",5,2014,05,06
148,Very cool and hip. However allow time as lifts slow and you are perpetually but politely challenged.,"This was a very  different hotel with completely black corridors. I have never stayed anywhere like it. The reception area is very different also. 
My key card kept failing me (it wasn't next  to my phone btw!) so I kept having to wait for lift to revisit reception on first floor. 
The bed room was very unusual with funky organic toiletries. And a lighting panel with the option of ""sexy. ""On my first night I was quite pleased to return to a soothing ambient lighting and music from the tv I think  ! but that didn't happen on second night. The bed seemed to be the widest I have ever seen it was completely square. Huge too. And dressing gown provided. 
Surprisingly for such a well designed sort of place there was a terrible draft from the small balcony window. The balcony overlooked convent garden direction. Nice in summer. 

There was a problem in the shower of a broken slate underfoot but this was fixed the same day.

One thing I wasn't keen on was that I struggled to find the stairs and as I mentioned the lifts were slow. It made me uneasy as in a fire they should be fairly obvious alternative to the lifts. I think the darkness of the corridors made it harder to navigate. I got really frustrated having to use a lift for one or two floors.  

There is also a pretty good gym especially for a hotel. Nice new kit. 

There is a fantastic and very popular rooftop bar again expect to be challenged until you show your key. It is worth it the view is lovely. I was surprised in this day and age that there were only two non alcoholic cocktails on the menu. Overall it is an odd place but good fun and quirky. The restaurant below (Italian) gave us a beautiful meal.",4,2014,05,05
148,Great design but a little up itself ,"Amazing atrium. Somewhat condescending check in staff. 
Lift a complete pain. 
Corridors too dark. 
Room lovely and very comfortable bed, bathroom great . Good breakfast. 
Radio bar fun and amazing view, lower bar worth a visit too. 
Great design ",3,2014,05,04
148,Stunning design hotel ,We stayed at the ME hotel last night  and we loved every part of it from the stunning Sir Norman Foster designed building to the amazing Radio rooftop bar and the very stylish clean rooms! The location of this hotel is fabulous we will definitely return soon! ,5,2014,05,04
148,Beautiful,"Me and my boyfriend decided to stay in this hotel for a night due to the fact that it was in the centre of London and it has positive reviews. From the glass of complimentary champagne at check in to the late night room service, everything was amazing. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean and tidy. The bathroom had a wonderful shower with a power head assisted with complimentary shower gel, shampoo, facial wash and a shower cap. We stayed on the 9th floor with a room situated right under the rooftop bar, which was noisy until quite late, so if you like to have a good nights sleep I suggest you get a room on a lower floor; however the view from our room was amazing. I will definitely be staying here again!",4,2014,04,30
148,Probably the best contemporary hotel in London,"Having designed quite a number of hotels over the years I'm always quite critical of the accommodation.  Norman Foster's design was superbly executed in both the public areas and our bedroom.  The superior room was slick, well specified, tranquil and relaxing with a range of different features and a tremendous bathroom.   The floor to ceiling window and ground glass shutters were so different to normal hotel windows.  Very comfortable bed, Egyptian linen and the sound insulation provided by the room's structure and finishes gave the best nights sleep in a hotel for years.  The reception was truly different and staffed by a well trained team. We didn't get to the rooftop bar this visit but will do next time.  There will certainly be a next time, as this place has spoiled us for other London hotels.  Unreservedly recommended.  Expensive (even through Laterooms), but well worth it for a treat.",5,2014,04,28
148,"Beautiful hotel, that's about it.","Stayed here over the April bank holiday and overall enjoyed the stay but there were a few let downs.

When we arrived, concierge were great and directed us to check in at The Atrium which is up one floor. Visually stunning, Foster + Partners did a great job on the architecture. There is a scent of melon & cucumber piped around the hotel that I thoroughly enjoyed.

We arrived just after 3pm to be told that our room was not ready, and the lady behind the desk got on her walkie talkie and was going back and forth like some form of military operation in plain view of myself. All other guests that checked in were offered a complimentary drink, however we were not. I didn't make a fuss out of it. We were finally told after waiting 20 minutes our room was ready. Not impressed on that point.

I loved the dark hallways with the marble based around the centre column, again, beautifully designed. Went up to our room, a Chic suite. Nice room, fantastic bathroom & amenities. Spacious and had a fantastic mini-bar, one of the best I have seen. The remote doesn't seem to work very well unless pointed at a certain point of the TV because of the glass/black casing it is housed in on the wall.

We stayed one night only to be rung by someone claiming that our room was leaking to the floor below. An engineer came and inspected the shower, said it wasn't our room and we were fine. We had dinner arraingments so this was a bit of an inconvenience but we just moved on. Half an hour later we received another call saying that it was our room, and we needed to move. After looking at the room and frankly, without a choice, we moved. The lady who moved us contacted her manager and we had breakfast and a bottle of champagne free. This is not bad but again, the inconvenience of moving mattered to me more.

Not only that, but the surround sound system did not work in the bathroom. I asked the lady who showed us to our new room how it worked. She obviously had no clue and called the engineer who said something about it needing to be rewired. I requested this was done whilst we were out of the hotel as we needed to get ready for dinner and we were already behind schedule. She agreed. I came back to the room to note this was not completed but I didn't have the energy to ring up and complain again as I was leaving the following morning.

I do class myself as within the niche that the hotel attracts, however there were certain things I did not enjoy. The concierge wore jumpers and were it not for the tiny badges, I would have thought someone was stealing my bag. I think it is a must that in a five star hotel, concierge wear suits.

House keeping CAME INTO THE ROOM UNANNOUNCED on THREE occasions. I do not know how this is even allowed to happen. There was no knock, they just walked in and acted shocked when they realised I was in the room. I have never experienced this and quite frankly was appalled.

To sum up, a beautifully designed hotel that could be so great but falls short in the areas you would expect it not to.",2,2014,04,27
148,Definitely possesses the Wow factor,"London has a great number of 5-star hotels, all renowned for the service they provide, and their great history. Well, this is an hotel which provides great service, and could easily feature in the history of the future. Firstly, service. All staff are smartly dressed, but in casual clothing, so the timid traveller does not feel intimidated. Every one of them we met projected a genuine willingness to help their guests, and offered little extras to enhance our stay. Next, the decoration. Very sleek, dark and light contrasts, with black marble, white leather, and glass featuring strongly to give an ultra modern look. It really works. Guest rooms are extremely well equipped, with king sized bed, large television (sorry, media hub), his and hers sinks, double shower room equipped with high-end toiletries, minibar with all sorts of snacks, and atmospheric lighting. The porter delivered our baggage, then gave us a demonstration of this lighting, leaving it on 'sexy mode'! As we were celebrating our ruby anniversary, we were greatly amused. Our only complaint of our stay was that our television picture froze regularly, but when this was reported we had an immediate apology, and a promise to rectify the problem, The breakfast was excellent, with super orange juice, decent coffee, and a great array of Continental and cooked options. I succumbed to the latter, and can confirm that the sausage was among the finest I have ever eaten.
Finally, a tip. Make some excuse to go to Reception after dark. They put on the most fantastic light show up the marble walls of the atrium, that I guarantee will impress.",5,2014,04,27
148,Lovely place ,Me and my partner stayed there last night it was amazing . The views were beautiful especially from the roof top bar. The staff were lovely and very polite . We felt like royalty it was amazing. Food was nice . All the essentials were in the hotel room everything you needed they had it .we had a lovely time and we will defiantly be going back there soon :) ,5,2014,04,27
148,Amazing,"Trendy Hotel with the best service ever, great roofbar and THE restaurant of this moment STK. Do not forget to visit the reception in the evening for a Big Suprise. Take a glass of champagne, lay down and enjoy. ",5,2014,04,24
148,Very nice but...,"Stayed on a Saturday night as a surprise for my husband's birthday.  The hotel is impressive inside, concierge desk friendly & helpful, fab bars on the ground floor and rooftop, dark ambient corridors, background music played throughout and a wonderful fresh melon scent everywhere you go.  Rooms clean and comfortable with all mod cons you could wish for.  One downside: upon a (very slow) check-in we were told without apology that the only room they had available for us was disabled access - we agreed to have a look at it but the bathroom resembled a hospital with many fixtures and fittings around the toilet and shower area.  Plus the room had been set up as a twin, and had no birthday message that had been previously agreed, so this obviously wasn't 'our' room.  We returned to Reception to say we didn't want it to be told very bluntly  'it is the only room available - we are fully booked tonight'  After some angry words they found an available room on the 9th floor, it was smaller than the previous but had a balcony so classed as an upgrade.  However the upgrade was only due to the hotel over-booking and not allocating us a Vibe room I had pre-paid for some weeks earlier. At these prices you would expect a seamless, professional service which we unfortunately didn't get. Our overall stay was enjoyable but the shambles at check-in spoilt it.",3,2014,04,23
148,Weekend stop with family and in-laws,"Perfect location for most attractions in London 
Covent Garden and Theatre land within 5 minutes walk.

Hotel was very modern and rooms very well thought out.
His and Hers shower room was loved by all

Rooftop bar is a must too , but again you must reserve a table . Fabulous views of London from the bar and outdoor patio.
One tip though , if you have under 18's they are not allowed there after 5pm.

STK Restaurant within the hotel is a must , but ensure you pre-book and have a bulging wallet.

Would definitely stay here again albeit a little pricey.",4,2014,04,23
148,Amazing...,"A hotel with the wow factor!!!   As soon as you walk in the staff look after you.  On arrival we were greeted by concierge and taken downstairs to reception to be given a glass of Prosecco..already this hotel was ticking all the boxes!
Great location, stunning interior, amazing artwork, peaceful rooms. Fantastic views from our room terrace on the 9th floor and even better from the rooftop bar 
Cannot fault this hotel and would definitely recommend",5,2014,04,22
148,Star Wars set with style!,"Dark corridors, funky lighting, stunning atrium, plush modern ground floor lounge, great staff...friendly and efficient. Chose this hotel over others nearby as it looked pretty funky, we were going to the Lyceum over the road and were with my son and his partner visiting from Adelaide...felt the young uns might prefer this over say the Aldwych opposite.
They loved the funky touches...varied goodies in the room to play with massive array of lighting options etc (I think this varies according to the room type you select)
We were not told their suite adjoining ours was equipped for disabled clients and differed in layout to ours...bathroom bigger but with  various aids (room 111).
The Italian restaurant was good, very accommodating friendly staff, excellent food...best fillet steak I have had in a while.
If you like funky and different you will love this",4,2014,04,19
148,Stunning hotel ... As good as it gets!,"First time stayed at the ME London. Having a mini break over Easter with wife and 11 year old son. We have enjoyed our stay here so much that I have felt compelled to write this review on our last night.

The hotel is perfectly located, walking distance to many attractions including theatres, shops, Covent Garden, St Paul's, Trafalgar Square, Houses of Parliament, London Eye, Westminster Abbey etc. etc. 

The design of the hotel is cutting edge but also very welcoming, the main reason being that all the staff genuinely want to give great service and genuinely care about the guest experience. The check-in area (hard to describe) is simply amazing and needs to be seen first hand to be fully appreciated.

Radio bar (roof top) has to be amongst the best views in London, my son must have taken 100 pics! We have also eaten at both ground floor restaurants and the food and service was excellent. In fact we have just tonight enjoyed a lovely meal at STK and special mention and thanks must go to Leo who was extremely knowledgable and went the extra mile to make sure we all enjoyed the experience, and nothing was too much trouble. He is a credit to the hotel.

We will definitely be returning to the ME and already looking forward to a Latte on the terrace at Radio, looking out over the heart of London, it doesn't get much better!",5,2014,04,18
148,Wow hotel,"From the moment we walked in we felt we had finally found the perfect hotel in London. My sister and I were welcomed like old friends even though this was our first visit. Our concierge took our bags and directed us to reception where prosecco greeted us whilst the reception team processed our booking efficiently. We then headed to our room on 4th floor which was gorgeous. A friendly me consultant arrived to show us how to work our high tech/spec room (mood lighting was brilliant addition). The fit and feel of the room was luxurious despite this being a standard room - turn down service wonderful as was in-room dining.
We visited most of the hotel bars with fab service from team who could not do enough. the only disappointment was a muddle up with reservation (team did not confirm our request for booking so request was lost in translation) for radio roof bar which meant we were quickly dismissed to a corner of the back terrace with a rather hassled ""greeter"" who did not want or have the time to assist us despite us asking what we could do to get a table the following night. However this would not put us off rebooking as the rest of the hotel made up for a small miscommunication.
We had a stunning meal in cucina asallina great value for money and well worth a visit!

Fab find now just waiting on an excuse to revisit",5,2014,04,16
148,"Convenient location, interior modern but bordering on impractical","Stayed here for about a week while on business. Conveniently located on the Strand. Very modern interior. Rooftop bar and steakhouse on ground floor seemed popular with the Ultra-Chic. Very nice selection of dishes at the steakhouse and drinks were nice, if a bit pricey. Concierge was friendly and very helpful. Checking in and out is an experience as it requires going to a different floor from the entrance but at lease you are rewarded with an incredible view (Look up and you'll see ceiling to the lobby extend upwards like a cone to the rooftop bar. Quite impressive. There was only one person at the check-inn counter which required a little waiting. The rooms require a magnetized stripe card which was not easy to use as it would repeatedly fail in both the elevator and the door to the room. The room itself was, again, very modern. Sadly it was too small and the desk area cramped. The bed was comfortable at least. It is not suitable for business travel but there are 'amenities' in the room which would keep couples and bachelors entertained. Not recommended for families. Entire place was very darkly lit, as if in an attempt to create mood but ended up being a strain on the eyes.",3,2014,04,16
148,Unique and enjoyable property,"I have stayed in this hotel a number of times since it opened and it really is a stunning and unique property.  Everyone is warm, friendly and welcoming but unfortunately I did not feel valued as a loyalty card member because it was not noted on my booking that I was entitled to a 2pm check-out. I understand that these things happen but what was unforgivable was the fact that a member of the housekeeping staff entered my room in the morning WITHOUT KNOCKING FIRST! Luckily I was decent but I really wasn't happy!  That being said, I would definitely stay there again as, from experience, the hotel team are committed to resolving issues...even if a quick response is not always forthcoming!",4,2014,04,13
148,Fabulous stay.,"Top hotel. Great location. Great facilities
Can't say much more other than loved my stay here- roof top bar offers fantastic views and provided a fabulous atmosphere.  Stk restaurant is lovely.  Would recommend to all.",5,2014,04,08
148,"Fantastic, luxurious stay!","First impressions : snazzy, polished modern hotel.
Great , friendly service.
Reception incredible. Loved the original Banksy pieces and Banksy walled lifts.
Room was very nice if slightly narrow. My girlfriend needed a window really but I was fine with the AC.
Bathroom very nice, walk in shower ( lovely!!) , speaker in toilet connected to media hub(!).
Media hub didnt work after many attempts and asking reception but this wasnt the end of the world. Would have been a nice touch though.
Beds incredibly comfy.

No sound from other rooms at all.

Breakfast superb - one of the best I have had, could not stop eating!
We had a drink at the radio bar ( book in advance). It was worth doing for a drink or two as the views of london are superb ( 360 degrees) . Very expensive though.

One minor comment was that a heavy slab fell off in our room suddenly - this could have been quite nasty.

Apart from this, the hotel was superb in every way and we would definitely come again.

Location was superb, walk out of the hotel and you can see the Lion King.",5,2014,04,08
148,Excellent,"We hava stayed for one night at this luxury hotel. Marcella was our host and i have to say she was wonderfull! The congierge team was excellent and the room was amazing and very clean as well. The most impressive part though was Cucina Asellina. We enjoyed our dinner in this beautiful restaurant,the atmoshere,the food and of course the professionality of Giancarlo and his team!huge thanks! Breakfast is awasome dont miss it. Thank you all.",5,2014,04,07
148,Fantastic,"I was at the Me London for five days and had the most incredible experience, the staff, my room, the ambience, the Radio rooftop, the location, the service all outstanding. My first choice for business and leisure. 
Very stylish and young crowd, 30-50 ",5,2014,04,07
148,"Great location, very professional staff","I have mixed feelings about this property.... I stayed last week for 3 nights with my husband and 9 year old daughter.

This is definitely NOT a hotel for children and I knew this going in, so I will try and write my review from the experience of a couple travelling sans child.

The positives:
Stunning building from the exterior and the most amazing reception area that I have ever stepped foot in.  The Jelly Fish ""light show"" in the pyramidal reception area is captivating and unique.

Fantastic location close to Covent Garden and accross the street from the Lion King.

HUGE and exceptionally comfortable bed with high quality, crisp, white linens.

Incredibly sound proof rooms - we didn't hear any street or hallway noise - and just a muffled bit of music for a few minutes from an adjoining room.  Very good for this light sleeper.

Professional and courteous staff at all encounters, despite the fact that we were dressed in ""comfortable"" (read uber casual) tourist attire and had a small child in tow.

Luxurious toiletries and Rain pan shower.  Enough Said.

The not so positives:
It just feels like this hotel was designed for, and caters to, pretentious hipsters.  Not that there's anything inherently wrong with that - but it's just not my style of hotel.  It is very modern and although I was somewhat amazed by the ""control panel"" next to the bed... my need or desire for Neon room lighting is quite limited.  My 9 year old liked it though... she would switch it to ""sexy"" mode with an accompanying ""ooh la la"".

My husband went to the Radio bar by himself on two separate occasions and was amazed at the utter lack of service or acknowledgment.  He noticed that the guys who were conspicuously flashing large rolls of cash were garnering all of the staff attention.  OK - I get it, I used to work in the service industry... but Warren Buffet still lives in the same modest bungalow he purchased for $31k.  Not everyone with money flaunts it... and not everyone who flaunts it actually has it!

So a beautiful, modern hotel with great staff (with the exception of Radio bar) best suited for an adult (couples) getaway.",4,2014,04,05
148,Enjoyed my stay!,"The rooms are big.  Floor is quiet, very little window light and the hallways are black.  Rooftop bar is fun if you're looking for a scene. View is amazing.  Italian restaurant is also really nice and staff at both are very friendly.",4,2014,04,04
148,Still somewhat disappointing,"We stayed here a year ago on my birthday.  We were disappointed but they had just opened and we felt they would improve.  We were offered a free night following my wife's review on trip advisor so we took them up on it.  Unfortunately, they still have some way to go.  The hotel has been built to provide a wow factor.  They have some very striking features such as their multistorey reception hall and their rooftop bar.  The staff give the impression of cool dudes working in the coolest place in town but can get really a little carried away.  They try hard and gave us a glass of Prosecco on arrival.  The guy taking us up to our room started telling us about Banksy (whose exhibition they are sponsoring) and showed us our balcony on which we might care to take breakfast.  Truly a horrid and grimy balcony.  See the view below.  It was nice however to be able to open the door for some semi fresh air!  The room was also disappointingly grimy.  White leatherette wall panels with dirty finger marks.  Shiny bathroom and loo with spots, smears and just not properly cleaned.  No soap and no shampoo when we arrived although it was forthcoming on request.  Slept badly on a very hard bed.  Last time it was very soft. Breakfast was very poor.  Bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes and scrambled eggs all too cold by the time they got back to the table.  Tasteless coffee.  Waitresses chatting not serving.  They do try in their own way.  At the end of breakfast a waitress arrived with a chocolate muffin with a lit candle stuck incongruously in the top and a 'Happy Birthday'.  I think they could do a lot better.  More close management of the details such as cleanliness and less emphasis on the cool. It all feels rather smug. Glad we were not paying their expensive rates for this rather poor 5 star Melia experience",3,2014,04,02
148,"Frank & Rae L  ""Great 6 nights in London""","ME London made our first visit to London a great experience
The staff was excellent from Jamie the doorman to Emiliano the Concierge and right down to the room getting made up on time each day, everyone on the staff made our visit one to remember 
The hotels location could not have been better within walking distance of sightseeing, shopping and restaurants. And last but not least the rooms are excellent
I would recommend the ME London to anyone traveling to London. Next year when we visit Europe again we will be stopping in London for a few days again at the ME London",5,2014,04,01
148,For a special occasion,"We regularly stay with Melia as their customer service is always exceptional, as we chose this hotel for a special celebratory visit. The Hotel is an Experience as the name suggests and  we were not disappointed. We checked in early and  everyone went out of their way to assist or welcome us with a glass of prosecco, the concierge service was the best we have ever experienced. The hotel itself centrally located ,  modern decor, spacious rooms with many digital features. Our room was quiet -6th floor- views over the city and so comfortable. . We visited the Radio Bar in daylight to see the views and have a drink - pricey but this was London.. A couple of bewares that we didn't know about,  the prices displayed for drinks are before VAT and service charge is added, and we also did not expect the inprint taken of our credit card to be chaged to our card at the rate of ¬£50 per night . Apparently this is refunded up to 5 days later.. we will know the next time not to hand the card over. 

Apart from this 'learning experience'- I would certaily recommned this hotel",4,2014,04,01
148,Avoid top floors,"When we arrived we were told that we could check in early if we took one of two more expensive rooms that were immediately available. We were recommended the higher floor one and happily accepted it thinking it would be quieter. Little did we know, and the hotel did not disclose it, that there is very loud noise and music coming from a place called Radio on the top floor. Last night, my wife could not sleep properly even with earplugs. We are still at the hotel and and will spend one more night in the same room (#907)as our time in London is short and we do not want to go through the trouble of packing/unpacking to change rooms. However, we regret to be paying more for this room and would definitely avoid being close to Radio if we were to return here. This brings me to another problem with this hotel, which is the almost complete lack of space for luggage and belongings (e.g., not a single drawer). In short, a stylish and well-located property with a couple of annoying flaws.",3,2014,03,29
148,Modern Luxury,"I just returned from London and this was my third hotel in 10 days. By far the most modern, friendliest staff of all. The d√©cor, the ""vibe"" the comfort were the finest. I never wanted to leave the bed. ",5,2014,03,26
148,Best 5 Star Hotel in London,"Stayed 3 nights in this wonderful hotel in March.  Location was perfect, walking distance to Convent Garden and tube stations, great staff and clean rooms.  The room was good sized by London standards and everything about the hotel is just wonderfully modern yet classy.  The open concept of the room really help to create the feel that the rooms are bigger than they actually are.  Had a chance to grab an afternoon drink at the rooftop Radio bar and the experience was nothing short of exceptional, would definitely stay here again on my next trip to London.",5,2014,03,26
148,Not even 1Star!!!!,"Firstly, the hotel is perfectly acceptable in terms of rooms, location etc. My main problem is that for a supposed 5 star hotel they have drunken people spilling out of their nightclub 'Radio' and the STK restaurant who literally cannot stand up and who are consequently aggressive and rude towards guests. We witnessed three people exiting the disabled toilet in a very drunken state who stumbled into us and then were very aggressive to me and rude to my wife.  If that is the kind of experience you are looking for then this is definitely the hotel for you!!
Honestly, this is one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had.
Also, be careful which card you make the reservation with.  If you reserve with one card and pay with another card the hotel holds on to your 'reserve' sum for FIVE WORKING DAYS after you have paid the bill.  When I spoke to them about this they tried to blame the banks, but the truth is it has nothing to do with the bank - it is Meila holding on to your money!!!!
Finally the staff simply do not care - when I raise these issues with them they twice promised to get back to me but never did - they are not interested!!
You would have to be mad to even contemplate staying at this hotel!!
",1,2014,03,26
148,Wonderful staying,"The hotel is simply wonderful. Located in a central position, very close to theaters, museums and other cultural attractions. Modern and stylish, with an impressive contrast between black and white (or silver) tones, rooms are quite spacious (I had the vibe one); they are equipped with a nespresso coffee machine, and a large range of bathroom amenities (not to mention the wonderful shower room); beds are really confortable; maidens come twice a day to clean and order them; I especially liked the melon frangrance in the hall, the possibility of adjusting lights in the rooms, according to different colours and mood; breakfast was very good as well and the members of the staff all very kind and attentive. Unfortunately I did not have the time to enjoy the rooftop bar, which is praised in many other reviews. Perhaps the hotel is somewhat expensive, but I was really pleased to stay there and had a marvellous experience!",5,2014,03,25
148,WOW - the lobby,"Even if you don't go and stay in this place, I would defo sneak to the 1st floor if you can and check out the lobby - it is mesmerising!

As a huge design fan, the attention to detail in this place is amazing - beautiful bathroom with a HUGE tub, crisp white sheets and a sexy monochrome feel all over.

The rooftop bar was very nice, but the client√®le were pretty pretentious...I would give that a miss for somewhere on the Strand.",5,2014,03,24
148,Phenomenal Hip Luxury Hotel,"I visited here at the weekend with my now-Fianc√©. I'm not sure of the price as my other half booked but i think it was in the region of ¬£300. The whole experience was perfect. I was sceptical upon pulling up outside, as it's new I'd never heard of it & I know a lot of top London hotels. We were greeted outside the doors & our luggage taken in for us, upon entering the building the decor is magnificent, its both simplistic and somehow contemporary extravagant at the same time, and theres a beautiful aroma. 
I was offered a glass of Prossecco on checking in and our bags were taken to our room. 
The room was a touch of luxury, it was massive with a Super King bed. Very spacious, black & white simplistic & modern decor. Large enough wardrobe with automatic light sensor! The bathroom was pretty special too, all frosted glass doors, large shower with 2 choices of shower head (or both can be used together) and double sink. 
Wide selection in the mini-bar (which was a lot less ""mini"" than usual), a large flatscreen positioned in front of the bed on the wall, fully stocked with amentities & a coffee making machine. 
Our room also featured a floor length window corner with views of Strand & over the thames (we were on the 6th Floor). It was top luxury. 

We visited the rooftop bar, The Radio Bar, which was buzzing, lots of people, a DJ and dancefloor and centre bar. Outside on the terrace were lots of seating areas, patio heaters, blankets and beautiful views over London. Obviously very popular with non-guests who had to use separate entrances/exits, it was quite exclusive, not just for anyone, there were a few tv celebs about too.

I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for luxury, have a very good budget or are looking to go for an extra special occasion. ",5,2014,03,24
148,One Night in London,"it was wonderful:
Bed, breakfast, service, room, mini bar, check in, check out, clean-up, design, friendly

the only thing was not so good is the expensive wlan.
in my opinion it must be free for guests.",5,2014,03,24
148,When in London book the ME,"Just got back from a 2 night stay at the ME London to celebrate a family members birthday.  All I can say is, when can I go back, absolutely loved it.

PROS
Fantastic location on the Strand opposite Somerset House and only a 2 minute walk into Covent Garden.
The interior is so good, ultra modern, very dark in places especially the corridors but all part of the make up of the hotel.
The service from the staff was first class, we travelled with our young family and we felt comfortable with our children.
We travelled as a group and had four rooms between us, can definitely recommend upgrading to the MODE room type, huge room with enormous shower and the most comfy bed ever.
The URBAN Terrace rooms are also nice with a balcony, smaller than the Mode rooms but still very good.

CONS
The one thing for me that stands out which would be easy to alter is the quality of the breakfast.  Everything about the hotel is amazing apart from breakfast, it really does let it down, the hot breakfast for this calibre of hotel is poor.  Luke warm and kept in metal trays, I hope the hotel does something about this to improve the quality of food and presentation.
Sometimes the room key would not work in either the lift or room due to mobile phone but no major issue.

The hotel really is superb, there is no way I would want to score lower but please, sort the breakfast out.

Hope to be back soon,",5,2014,03,21
148,"Great hotel, shame about the Roof top Bar","I stayed at ME London last week for 1 night courtesy of the ME chain after a poor experience at ME Barcelona. I took a friend and despite requesting a twin room it was made up with a single King which was later rectified. It was a good sized room, well equipped with a great view onto the strand. Checking in was definitely a 5* experience; the staff were very helpful and the glass of prosecco certainly impressed. The interior lighting was very dark in both the corridors and the lift; very cool but not very helpful. I have reviewed the Italian restaurant, for dinner separately. The same restaurant hosts the hotel breakfast which was excellent. I would certainly eat breakfast there again, although not dinner.

Where the stay was ruined for me was our experience trying to get a drink in the roof top bar. The bar was occupied many with non-hotel residents. We were there very early, hoping to get a drink before our dinner in the on-site Italian restaurant. Despite several empty tables on the roof terrace we were not allowed to sit there as they were reserved. Eventually I attracted the attention of the bar concierge who at least managed to get us some drinks, which due to the wait, were on the house. We stayed for about an hour and during that time many 'reserved' tables remained empty. I felt that my guest and I didn't fit the desired 'Customer' profile and were treated as such. If I had paid for my room I would have been even more unhappy at the poor service received at the Roof Top bar. I would expect hotel customers, paying 5* prices, to get priority in the bar.",4,2014,03,21
148,"A ""Curate's Egg"" of a stay","I booked this hotel primarily as it is a 5-star hotel close to Theatreland and it would be easy to access from airport and it has got a lot going for it. It also, unfortunately, has a few quirks and issues I've read in many other reviews and can agree with.

Good:
Location - spot on for theatres, Covent Garden, Embankment etc., all the parts of London we like best.
Architecture/design - I'm an amateur architecture fan so I loved it - the outside is pretty plain, but inside the public spaces it's truly amazing. The atrium is just sensational, I defy you to gape!
Room - well-finished, reasonably well appointed but pretty small. Bed was terrific and we slept as well as we have in any city hotel
Food - we only had breakfast, were on a B&B deal and many of the sevice issues mentioned previously on TA were no longer an issue. Buffet was pretty limited but of good quality.

Not so good:
Room - TV stopped working, and as it was so late at night I didn't pursue this at the time - never worked again for the whole stay (although didn't really want it that much)
Room again - shower doors, wrdrobe door, shutters etc are all stainless steel & glass - they clang and clank horrendously when opening & closing and don't close properly. Very poorly designed, they need some sort of dampening or gaskets to calm them down.
Room again - decor was a bit scuffed in places and security lock was broken off of the door.
Staff - very variable. All seemed very friendly but not necessarily helpful or practical. For example, on arrival concierge insisted on taking our (2 very small trolley-style) cases from us, then followed us into lift & to reception, and then to room. We were quite capable here and he offered nothing other than a shadow. Also, at breakfast we were told to help ourselves to a table and... that was it. No other service to speak of.

Overall: I booked this through a 3rd party site at a really good rate compared to rack rate so probably got one of the poorer rooms but it was still fine. It is in a great location and to be honest, I would probably still return but would go for a higher-spec room. Probably a 7 out of 10 but not a 4 out of 5 based on our room.",3,2014,03,17
148,So impressed,"We have just come back from a London Weekend staying at ME London. From the welcome at the door to the minute we left we had nothing short of excellence. The room was beautiful. We had a MODE room on the 6th floor. There was no shower but floor to ceiling windows. (the 7th floor rooms have a bath but a small high up window which is not as nice).
Impeccably clean and ultra modern room which is much better priced than most ultra modern hotels.
The view from the Radio bar on top is simply amazing. The only downside is that non residents pile in there and fill it up quickly.
The shower was fantastic and the bed and towels the best we have ever experienced, even though we have been lucky enough to have stayed in some of the world's best hotels.
Well done ME London",5,2014,03,16
148,SUPER,"I spent two nights at the ME London last week (March 10/11) and had a fabulous experience.  I was greeted on arrival by the Concierge who took me up to the 1st floor for check-in and was given a complimentary glass of Prosecco which was was a lovely greeting.  The reception area is a beautiful marble room with a light show at  8pm each night and it pyramid shaped - quite amazing. Our room was on the 6th floor and despite the corridors being very dark the room was beautiful.  Very modern and streamlined.  Huge bed and nice crisp sheets.  Large bathroom with great shower head. I had a phone call to make sure everything in the room was ok including instructions on how to use the lighting panel on the wall which also controlled the air conditioning system.  There was a Nespresso machine for coffees which was really nice.  We had cocktails at the rooftop bar - great view on the 10th floor.  It's very busy there so advisable to book or at least enquire how busy it is.  We only had breakfast at the hotel which was substantial with great choices and lovely fresh fruit and juices.  The coffee wasn't as good as the bedroom!  A really convenient location for theatres, restaurants.  Taxi ranks right outside the hotel and the 2 tube stations (Temple and Covent Garden) within 5-10 minutes walk.  All the staff were extremely polite and couldn't do more to help.  A really great experience and will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,03,16
148,Very good,"This is relatively new hotel in London. Very good. Decoration, services, convenience, sleeping, attitude, everything as you expect from such a hotel. Thanks. Location - not far from the center, if we talk about Soho and Oxford Street, but not the center.",5,2014,03,16
148,"Best hotel in London, best stay of my life","I went to ME London in February with my fiance and we had an amazing time. Our very modern room (Energy Urban) was flawless with its spacious shower area and enormous (and extremely comfy!) bed, not to mention the spectacular view from the balcony.
We found the control panel (for lights and ac) next to the bed really handy as well. 

We decided to have dinner at Cucina Asellina. The food and service (by Feri, who, aside from being very nice and chatty, really knows what he is talking about when he provides you with his recommendations) was perfect.

My finace - with the help of the lovely AURA team, who turned the mood of the room around completely - had arranged a surprise turndown service. When we got back from dinner, the room was packed with flowers and candles, ""sexy"" lights and romantic music on, you can imagine how nice everything was.. :)

Breakfast also exceeded my expectations the next day, and I would like to emphasize how smiley and attentive the staff is in the hotel. They definitely deliver exceptional and energetic service despite their young age. Upon checkout I had the chance to meet Marcela and Marta, members of the AURA team, who came to check how everything was. I thanked them the incredible stay, as they did an amazing job. This has definitely been my best hotel experience by far.

P.s.: I usually do not have the time to review hotels, but I had to share this with the world. Give ME London a try, you won't regret it! :)",5,2014,03,12
148,Very nice,"Stayed at the ME hotel for 1 night, wished we stayed longer.
Check in was a pleasure, rooms were amazing, and the hotel
Was seriously trendy.
If your after a trendy hotel in a great location then this is the 
Hotel for you.",5,2014,03,12
148,Outstanding Property,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the ME London hotel. My room was of a very high standard, quiet, great decor and power shower. The bed was firm and the pillows soft. The Staff were professional and helpful and the Radio Bar was a firm favourite with my friends and I. I would highly recommend this hotel and plan on staying there again soon.",5,2014,03,12
148,Glamours and stylish,"I spent two nights in the ME hotel and the design and d√©cor really was something special.  The view across the city was fantastic the feel of the room was one of quality and class.  I very much liked the lighting and music system and all the doors (including the blinds to the windows) were sliding which gave the feeling of space and crisp lines.  However, although the Nesspreso machine was a nice touch I did miss my morning cup of tea (essential for most Brits!).  The reception is beautiful and the views from rooftop bar were exceptional! 
Unfortunately I found the service at breakfast leaving a lot to be desired.  The staff were slow and appeared quite condescending.  
Overall the stay was one I'll remember.",4,2014,03,10
148,GREAT EXPERIENCE,"WOW! WOW! WOW! 
I did spend three days in this Hotel about a week ago and I have to say that this one is the best in London and one of the best I did visit traveling around the world. The location is great, the hotel , rooms, restaurants, service, Staff, will leave you speechless as it is all perfect.
Unfortunately I do not remember the name of each Team Member of the hotel which helped me to exceed my expectation, but, starting from the General Manager, to the Ladies at the reception, the Housekeeping Stewardess which took care of my  suite, the Concierge Staff, the Staff which welcomed me upon my arrival , taking me to the check in desk , were all absolutely amazing.
As soon as you will walk in to the great lobby and then up to the reception floor , you will immediately understand that you are walking into a dream come true.........
The room including the high tech, amenities, bathroom, bed, etc are astonished.....

I do also suggest to try both the steakhouse and the italian restaurant. Both amazing.
The Cocktail bar located at the 10 floor is great and deserve a visit or more than ones........

About the Italian restaurant, the food is great, the service super and in particular I do remember a young Lady from Perugia which was extremely professional and attentive during the service and even if the place was extremely busy on Friday evening, she was always smiling and ready to assist every customer needs. 
To conclude, I cannot wait to visit the ME Hotel again during my next trip to London and I do certainly recommend this hotel either if you are in the city for both business and or pleasure.

Great Job!!!!

148,Me! Not really about ME!!!!!,"Left the hotel not feeling happy at all. First night the hallway outside my room was like being in Oxford circus with rowdy party goers and people being sick at 3am. 
The staff came across as unpleasant and not trained in the hospitality market. I felt as though everything was like they were doing me a favour. They forget the price we pay for such service. Even the doorman made us feel uneasy.

148,Best hotel in London,"When I arrived at the hotel the excellent Emma said,mr Callaghan do you have a spare 8mins and 20 secs. I said no problem,so she said sit on one of these comfy sofas and I will fix you a drink. Then all the lights went down and a dazzling wall to ceiling picture/laser show took place.

So a great start,the rooms carry on the experience and the roof top bar is absolutely stunning and I cannot wait to visit it in the summer.

The quality of the service is first class as is the location on the corner of the strand with some fantastic bars and restuarants close by. This hotel,in my view,is right up there with the best in London.",5,2014,03,08
148,Amazing Hotel,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Me London for the night  and I was speeachless at the decor. it is absolutely stunning to look at. I found the staff on the whole very friendly and welcoming which is often not the case in 5 star hotels. We had a meal in the Italian restaurant, the food was sublime. The service was attentive but not intrusive. We then went up to the Radio bar which was brilliant, there was a good mix of ages and the vibe was really good. Great music and I can recommend the mojitos they were the best! Breakfast the next morning was ok but not the best breakfast I have had but nothing wrong with it either just another hotel breakfast. The only negatives were that the hotel was very hot for me and the floor tiles in the shower need to be sorted we had 2 types and they moved when standing on them. All in all a fantastic stay and I would highly recommend.",4,2014,03,07
148,Me Hotel London,"My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel from the 25th- 28th of February. The hotel is visually stunning, but unfortunately that's where the pleasing aspects ended. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly fellow, who brought us to reception. From here, we went to the elevator. The man manning the elevator made us feel ill at ease. The lift system is ridiculous. There is one elevator you cannot use, yet this is not clearly sign posted at all. We got to our room to find it rather dusty- disappointing for a five star hotel. The dust  immediately set my asthma off, which again wasn't a great start. Despite these minor set backs, we were determined to have a good time and to be happy with the hotel. Later that night, we attended the Radio Bar. Again, it failed to live up to all expectations. It was loud, crass and brash. We were kept waiting far too long considering the barman was not busy at the time. The atmosphere was one of snobbery and we could not leave fast enough. When we exited the lift, an aggressive lady manning the lifts grabbed my boyfriend's arm quite forcefully and tried to escort him to the exit. She could not apologise enough when he explained we were guests in the hotel, but again, this was not good enough. Perhaps it is because we are quite young, but I am a teacher and my boyfriend  a solicitor, yet we were treated in a condenscending manner throughout our stay in the ME hotel. I feel the way the staff differentiated the way they treat guests according to the price of their hotel room to be very unprofessional. 

On Thursday morning, a maid barged into our room. This was a huge invasion of privacy as we were still in the room and it made me feel very uncomfortable. She very rudely told us that she needed to clean the room, and made us feel that we had to rush out to allow her to clean, which we did.

That night, we returned to our room to find a bag missing. We had visited the Harry Potter studios the previous day. We spent over 100 pounds on merchandise, including photos and a dvd. These goods held huge sentimental value for us. This bag was taken from our room. The goods were irreplaceable, we live in Ireland and will not be able to return to HP studios easily.

We spoke with the concierge Friday morning. They assured us that they would deal with the matter and encouraged us to go out for the morning and not to worry. We returned to the hotel two hours before our flight to find that nothing had been done. Absolutely nothing. We spoke to the duty manager, who informed us that it was the first she had heard of the matter. She basically said there was nothing they could do. Considering that only staff members had access to our room, I found this to be a very unhelpful response. They dealt with our problem with a lack of compassion and decency. They couldn't get rid of us fast enough and provided no solution to our problem. I found it to be very distressing and I am heart broken over the loss of my Harry Potter goods. I wouldn't stay here again due to the way in which first of all, the bag went missing, and secondly the staffs unhelpful and insincere manner. It was not what I expected from a five star hotel.",1,2014,03,04
148,unforgettable,"already months ago, i've been in this unique ME hotel! But still i'm telling everybody to go and visit. just had so much luck, to spend one night in the 8th floor in the personality suite. was graded up only for one night, but it was the best sleep, the best atmosphere, the best place to be! thank u for the experience! it is uforgettable! and the fire alarm that morning, was exciting and almost funny! :)",5,2014,03,04

148,Fab funky evening,"Had a great meal in STK prior to going up to Radio bar with business colleagues, amazing views of London, we sat outside and it wasn't too cold!! Was very impressed with the check in and even had a lovely glass of bubbles up on arrival. The very kind staff also put on the light show for us at 11pm when we popped back as we missed it at 8pm. The room was brilliant especially the gummie bears, yum. All in all a fun, funky experience and I will be back!!!!",5,2014,03,03
148,"Truly stunning! Perfect location, amazing interior","We booked to stay for 2 nights to celebrate my husbands Birthday, wish we'd stayed longer. Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly helpful staff who took care of our luggage, checked us in, gave us complimentary drinks and showed us to our room. You cannot help but to be amazed at the interior, fabulous high quality finishes, beautifully clean and yet still welcoming. The room was spacious, light, and more importantly incredibly quiet to say how close it was to a very busy area. The location was perfect for our theatre trips, within a few hundred metres to both. Our only regret was we didn't have time to sample any of the food, or the rooftop bar. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2014,03,02
148,Great hotel and Location,"We stayed here for one night in September. The hotel is contemporary and our suite was excellent.  On the Friday evening when we stayed a ""party"" is thrown on the roof terrace which creates a real hip about the place.

The hotel is next to covent garden for tourists and has easy access to the City area of London for those who want to visit the City but do not want to stay in the City. 

Overal, best hotel we have stayed at in London.",4,2014,03,02

148,nice hotel,"Nice hotel for a business trip, a little bit too dark (floors) and a touch too much sophisticated attitude of the staff.
Well equiped rooms, for Ladies bathroom lights and mirrors need improvement, no plug in for hairdryer etc in the bathroom... Not enough space in the wardrobe.
Wonderful rooftop bar!",4,2014,02,23
148,Great...!,"Very cool, amazing design and a great place to be - a real event. Very helpful staff, extremely comfortable beds, room was much larger than we thought and looked even better than on the website. The, music system very complicated (media hub), tried to plug in iPod and wasn't working, sent a very helpful and polite engineer very quickly but he couldn't fix on the spot so we didn't bother. would be good if this was checked 1st.",5,2014,02,21
148,"Top hotel, amazing design, great service","This really is an amazing place to be, just staying here felt like a real event. Everything has been done to the highest standard, the most amazing atrium in reception, marble tiles all along the hallways, heavy doors, great beds. Quite dark and very cool - I loved the design. Our room was bigger than it looked on the website, friendly efficient service. 
We ate in the restaurant (STK) food was incredible - really good steaks (and we like steak!), service great, really good wine list and reasonably priced for London. 
Only slight problem for us was the clientele - full of wannabe Essex birds and city blokes / flash footballers. The first time we came here (just when it opened) was full of Russians and dubious ladies of the night (and Peter Stringfellow at the next table with his latest young pull), so seems to have changed a bit since then, suppose you could say ""its the place to be"" if you are into that sort of thing.",5,2014,02,20
148,Good but expensive,"Very good location for theatres and attractions. Very stylish hotel and ultra modern. Stayed on a Sunday night and had no problems with noise. Plus points - quiet, comfy bed, nice staff, lots of free toiletries, luxurious feel. Minus points - the trendiness goes a bit far in some things, such as the dark corridors which feel a bit creepy. It is very expensive with no reduction for single room. Staff do not wear uniforms and this can be confusing. Was ignored in the lobby bar because they were closing the bar down early.   All the staff are very young and although most are brilliant, just the odd ones let standards down. One weird thing in the rooms is that the lighting panel is only on one side of the bed, so the person on the other side has no light.
if I could improve two things it would be... Please have teabags in the rooms as well as coffee, and quality of bacon at breakfast needs to be improved. 
Being very picky because it is expensive, but it certainly is a unique place and a great experience. Special mention to the concierge staff in the entrance, superbly helpful.
 Would visit again.",4,2014,02,20

148,Fantastic!,"From the moment we arrived and were greeted with nice chilled glass of fizz! we had a truly fantastic two night stay at the ME.

I work in the city a lot, travelling down from Cheshire but was looking forward to the location of the Hotel for a valentines weekend....and wasn't disappointed!!

Hotel reception is stunning! rooms very nice indeed (excellent Beds), Radio Bar offers some of the best views of London (whilst holding a crisp glass of white!)..... we also found the food onsite at STK and Cucina very nice also.... 

Well done to all the team at the ME.

148,A breath of fresh air,"We stayed at the ME London over the weekend of the 16th of February. on arrival the staff where very helpful our car was valet parked and our luggage was taken straight up to our room.
On arrival we noticed that the internal catch on the door was faulty and we rang reception within 10 minutes were were allocated another room and staff came and transferred everything for us. Dinner in the Italian restaurant was very nice and the staff were well versed with the wine list.

Monday were were in and out of the hotel and Emiliano and Roberto in particular could not have been more helpful.

Great experience and very well motivated and enthusiastic staff.",5,2014,02,18
148,Nice hotel but communication problems,"A pleasant stay spoiled by poor communications.we were asked to leave the ground floor bar area at 1:00pm as they needed to set up for afternoon tea but directed us to the 10th floor bar.

148,A real Experience,Me is a stunning hotel and really excels at giving you an exclusive experience in an inclusive way. The STK restaurant is amazing and the Radio bar is a real treat. even if u can't afford to drink all night,4,2014,02,17
148,Too Many Flaws Outweigh Positives,"I stayed for one night, travelling on my own and paid ¬£259 for a room with a balcony.

At first sight the hotel is truly 5 star. Excellent check in and the lobbly is a fantastic structural achievement but the attrium does make it very, very echoey.

My room was on the 9th floor and I paid for an upgrade to a room with a balcony.

In general terms, the layout of this room was good and the balcony is an excellent feature.

My one biggest gripe though and why I have marked the hotel down is the TV in my room was very poor. The reception was non-existent in places and as I was travelling on my own for business, this is always of importance to me. There was a particular football match i wanted to watch and as I could not wait for this problem to be resolved, I had to find a local pub and stand shoulder to shoulder with the throng of folk watching the same important match.

The WI-FI seemed to suffer as well as my connection kept cutting out and I needed to log back on over and over again. Being on business, I am reliant on receiving and sending my emails in a timely fashion. Just so frustrating! 

I had a few drinks upstairs in Radio and this is an excellent bar although the service was slow considering it was not that busy.

There was no Express Checkout facility which seemed a bit strange.

All in all, I would not stay here again either for business or pleasure as there are many other new hotels in the area, where I have stayed on many an occasion and have not endured any such problems.

I appreciate these may seem small problems for some but for me it didnt just cut it.",3,2014,02,17
148,Very poor service,"The hotel is beautiful and designer, but I had a very bad experience with the reception staff.
When I did my check-in the lady did not inform me about the breakfast and when I asked her, she mentioned that my tariff (338 euros/ night) and room were too basic to have breakfast included ,  with a very snob face. I asked her to confirm and the answer was: I am sure, with this tariff.... I insisted that I have an email confirming breakfast was included and, without any effort, she finally mentioned: Ok let me see. Oh yeah it is included. She even did not say sorry.
In the day after, I was waiting for doing my check out while the lady, another receptionist, was finishing the check-out of other couple. She was extremely nice and at the end she invited them to drink a flute of champagne and gave them a small gift mentioned that they would expect to see them again. I was exactly there and thinking that it was only a problem of the there receptionist. I was expecting a similar service,  but when she did mine, the only thing she said was: did you use anything from mini-bar? If not, thanks and bye bye. It makes me feel that there are different types of clients and you were not so welcomed. Its a shame, I could accept  different rooms, but never different services.",2,2014,02,17
148,Designer Hotel,"If your looking for the latest designer hotel, where the trend setters are, then look no further. This is a fantastic hotel, from the reception area where your inside a pyramid, to the only rooftop bar in London, where you have fantastic views, and a nice Champagne menu. Our room on the 5th floor was really nice, must be the biggest bed I have come across in a hotel before, also really comfy. Lighting controls were on an LCD panel which was strange but a little fiddle soon got us used to it, also the sexy mood lightening was a nice touch. Nice big double shower, was an added bonus. Great location to all the theatres, and Covent Garden. Highly recommended.",5,2014,02,16
148,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,"I have stayed at the me melia on strand in central london three times now and found it to be an excellent hotel. Both times I have stayed in the passion suite and once in a standard double room. All rooms are stunning but the passion suite is something else. And I believe it to be very good value for such an excellent hotel. If it was just a bit cheaper or I had access to loyalty rates i would stay here all the time. There is so much attention to detail throughout the hotel and the service of the staff is second to none. The staff act as though they are proud and happy to be working there and I can understand why. The rooftop bar radio is buzzing with professionals in business and media, so fantastic for  networking. This hotel is my favourite in London. The only thing I would say is that at times the scented air in the lobby is a bit too much, I like the idea but it upset my sinuses a bit. But that's the only thing I can honestly fault and since i was only passing through the lobby quickly, it did not infringe on the enjoyment of my stay.",5,2014,02,16
148,Pricey and Stylish,"Designer and cool throughout. From the unusual check in (why only 2 desks manned) with a nightclub style decor; complete with a glass of Presecco whilst waiting in line, to the spacious room with the biggest hotel bed I have ever slept in. You need at least two nights here just to work out how to use the in room controls and window blinds, which I only fathomed out how to close the next morning. 

The location is great for Theatreland and access to the Thames and southbank. STK restaurant was expensive, but far better than the reviews here on Tripadvisor suggested.

Is it for you? Guess it depends on if you are looking for a new hotel with cutting edge interior design and uber cool bar. 

Would I stay again? Probably; now I have worked out how to 'use' the room. I just wish they would drop the automatic fragrance system that makes the whole ground floor smell like a well disinfected public loo!",4,2014,02,15
148,"Stylish, ultra modern hotel in a fantastic location","If you're looking for a lively, buzzy hotel In the heart of London this hotel is for you. A 5/10 minute walk from covent garden station and right in theatre land, It's incredibly stylish with very minimalistic decor. The staff could not do more to help you. The radio rooftop bar gives you an amazing view of London, great music until the early hours and a good atmosphere. It was a shame that we couldn't dine in the STK restaurant due to being fully booked since early January! Breakfast was really nice with lots of selection. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I don't think it's a very romantic style hotel as my partner and I stayed for valentines day, we both agreed we'd had more romantic experiences at other London hotels, however I think it's perfect for groups or friends looking for a base to explore London or somewhere to stay after a night out.

148,Deb&Mike,"Fantastic hotel in great location but it is pricey.It's up there with the top London hotels both in quality and price.We would definitely revisit this hotel for another special occasion.The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable.

148,Stunning avantgarde design and a top location near Covent Garden,"Note: I blog about Luxury Fashion & Travel at www.shoplemonde.com. Feel free to check my blog for many more photos we have taken at the ME Hotel :-)

To get the most out of my time on vacation, I not only plan ahead restaurant visits and shopping tours, I also do a lot of research in regards to the hotel. Using travel websites like TripAdvisor.com and Booking.com, I can always get a very good first impression on what to expect from a hotel. Well, while browsing these sites, I  stumbled upon the beautiful ME London, a highly rated new design hotel.

Even though London is one of the most beautiful and interesting cities on earth, I often have a hard time finding a hotel that is appealing to me. Most of them have been there for many years and their classic design/architecture is not always to my liking. I often miss the certain something that sets a hotel apart from the rest, but I may have found it in this hotel.

The first thing you notice when entering the ME hotel is the lovely and refreshing smell of honey melon. This is the hotel‚Äôs ‚Äúsignature fragrance‚Äù (which you can also buy to use at home), and it immadiately makes you feel as if you were passing into a mysterious world.
For guests to feel completely at home, this hotel employs an ‚Äúaura manager‚Äù who is responsible for ambience, service and special requests. You could say that his job is a mix of interior designer, concierge and DJ, and when looking at these pictures, I must say that he does a pretty good job!

Dark marble, clean lines and sharp edges are reminiscent of the newly remodeled Saint Laurent Paris boutiques and the avantgardistic design is the common theme throughout the hotel.

The hotel was designed by Foster and Partners, one of the most innovative architecture and integrated design practices in the world. It is the first hotel in which the design of everything, from the shell of the building to the layout of the public spaces and guest rooms ‚Äì down to the smallest details of the room fittings ‚Äì has been undertaken by the Foster studio. I especially love the small touches like integrated european electricity connections, which can be found in every room.
The hotel is also home to two well received restaurants. Cucina Asellina is based on New York‚Äôs Asellina restaurant, specialising in ‚Äúsimple Italian cuisine‚Äù. STK blends two concepts into one: the modern steakhouse and a chic lounge. I especially loved the atmosphere and beautiful design at STK and I hope my photos do it justice.

A highlight for me was the rooftop bar on the top floor. With a spectacular view of the entire city coupled with fantastic cocktails, the ‚ÄúRadio Bar‚Äù has become a popular hot spot where you can enjoy a good drink with a pleasant audience. A very unique feature is the heating system which was specially developed for the outdoor terrace; it allows you to sit outside and enjoy the view during wintertimes with nothing more than a thin blouse ‚Äì how amazing is that? This place has become one of my favorite venues in London and I absolutely recommend you visit Radio Bar on your next trip.

MY CONCLUSION:
The ME London captivates through its stunning, modern avantgarde design and a top location near Covent Garden. Great restaurants, famous theaters and nice boutiques are all nearby. If you want to have a great time in London, this is the place to stay at.",5,2014,02,09
148,Amazing hotel & Location,"Stayed here for a few days over the new year with my partner and another couple and we where not disappointed. First impressions of the hotel where breathtaking, its ultra modern, stylish, it defiantly has the wow factor. On arrival we where greeted with a cold glass of champagne while we checked in which was a lovely touch. The rooms are fantastic and they look right on to the Strand they are also packed with all the essentials. The location of the me London is fantastic its just minutes away from Covent Gardens, Big Ben, London eye etc. Best places to eat are The Ivy & Gaucho Grill. I would deffo recommend spending New years here and getting tickets to the Radio bar in the hotel which is a roof top bar that looks right over the Themes, its has the most perfect view of the countdown & fireworks.",5,2014,02,08
148,"Amazing hotel, great staff üòÉ","My daughter and I stayed at the ME for two nights, we were amazed by the hotel it is very modern but with a friendly atmosphere.  The rooms were more than perfect, wonderful showers and loved the lighting.  We changed rooms on the second night as the room we had was opposite the theatres and the light was shining through the window and I like pitch black to sleep (personal preference my daughter slept fine) however this was no problem and staff were very accommodating with moving us.  The staff were wonderful the concierge could not of been more helpful with all of our queries,  having been our first time to london there was a lot!! And the reception staff were exceptional even plotting a map of things for us to do during the day and making sure we were able to get to the train station even in the tube strike.  I would recommend this hotel it's very central with everything walking distance - covent garden -oxford street - london eye- westminister - Trafalgar Square all within 10 mins walking.  As for the price we got an amazing offer so just makes it all the better. ",5,2014,02,05
148,The Best Hotel in the UK,"Great Experiece!
Since my arrival at the ME London Hotel,I was realy impressed,the dorman opened the door of my cab and escort and helped me and my familly with our bags all the way to concierge where we dropped our bags so we get confi on our way to reception and again escorted to the reception by concierge staff who explained us the hotel outlets and upon check in as well we was invited to a glass of prosecco,very nice touch,after all this we arrived to our room wich is verry high tech and futuristic design,apreciate all the hard work of hotel staff,tks guys!",5,2014,02,05
148,"Ultra Modern, Chic and smart!","The hotel is located just up the road from Temple Tube station (about a five minute walk)
The hotel on arrival is breathtaking and the aroma of the hotel is devine on arrival we were advised to take the elevator to the first floor where reception is and this is inside the pyramid design!
we arrived at 1115 and our room was not ready so we left our bags and went out for the day.
We arrived back at the hotel at about 1700 and checked in our room was ready and our luggage had already been taken to the room 
Our room was located on the 5th floor (509) and was Aura category, the room was huge with floor to ceiling window that overlooks The Strand close to Lycian and Novello theatres
We had no noise disturbance at all - there are screens that close to prevent the noise however we actually left ours slightly open but still had no disturbance from noise!
The beds were comfy they are hard matresses but i like this. The Nespresso machine was a great touch and we loved the rain shower in the bathroom.
The Radio Bar on the Roof Terrace was reasonably priced in my opinion and what fantastic views! Well worth a visit - we saw a celeb too which always makes it feel like a special place/upmarket place.

Staff are fantastic nothing is too much trouble - hotel has turn down service too which is nice touch

The hotel breakfast is devine excellent choice of Pastries, cakes, muffins, cheese, ham, smoked salmon, Fresh juice coffee and teas, Also the hot options are amazing scrambelled eggs, hashbrowns, streaky bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, beans and if you wanted something slightly different such as poached egg on toast or fried egg with bacon in a roll they can do this to order too - really nothing is too much trouble.

Hotel is located:
5 min walk to Temple Tube station
10-15 Min walk to London Eye
20-25 min walk to Oxford street
15-20 Minute walk to Trafalga Square, Leicester Square and Covent Garden
there is a boots pharmacy about a 2 minute walk up the road and there is a tesco express over the road.

Cannot reccommend the hotel enough - I will be back",5,2014,02,04
148,"Chic, but peculiarly unwelcoming","Stayed for two nights on a business trip, and won't be going back.  The hotel is unbearably stylish, and can't quite get over just how chic it is - the snazzy chrome in the ground floor bar, the beautiful light scheme in the reception lobby, the high tech minimalist bedrooms.  It is certainly beautiful, and by the standards of London hotels the rooms are large enough and comfy enough.
The hotel clearly makes a lot of its revenue from functions in the (very impressive) bar areas, and didn't seem that interested in helping me as a business traveller to get on with my day. For example, of the three elevators, one was often 'looked after' by a bouncer trying to shepherd guests up or down to a party, so getting between my room and the public areas was always an adventure.  If there is a party in the roof bar and a party in the ground floor bar, then there is nowhere where you can sit and have a beer and a quiet business discussion.  I complained to a member of staff about this and he just said 'well sir, this is a party hotel'.
The Italian-themed restaurant is big and noisy and un memorable - I've had nicer food for half the price at almost any Italian restaurant in the west end.
If I'm having an office Christmas party and I have a huge budget I may give these guys a call, but as a business traveller I won't be going back.",3,2014,02,04
148,"Very good hotel, but not very smart people","The hotel is beautiful, the location is very good, rooms are comfy. But when you try to go to your room there is only one elevator out of three you can use :(.
It takes lots of time and when you ask the management to allow hotel guests to use the other elevator they simply don't care :(.

I teach management consulting courses and will use this case as a good example how people can destroy the results of good job, done by other people.",2,2014,02,01
148,Fantastic service and Hotel,"Have been going to London for many years and just started staying at the ME London.  It was a fantastic experience with incredible service from the staff and a wonderful hotel room. The reservations staff are top notch and the Italian Restaurant and the Steak house are marvelous. Great food.   The Radio Bar at the top of the hotel overlooks London and it is magnificent. Renato and the staff at the Radio are extremely helpful and it is a lot of fun.  

Really a nice experience.

148,Not quite up to standard,"When you arrive there is nowhere for your car to stop outside. So by the time you have got out in the pouring rain and carried your suitcase inside (there doesnt seem to be anyone waiting outside, but it was raining), you are already slightly annoyed. One floor up to the very spectacular reception. Very nice staff and then to our room. We paid the same price for the two rooms but one was twice the size of the other!! The small room was really very small. 

Went down for a coffee and cake in the bar in the lobby. The place was freezing with a howling gale coming in through the main door. The waitor was very friendly but completely unprofessional. Had no idea what flavour the cake was! Trying to get to the room in the evening is a bit complicated. One lift doesnt work and the other is reserved for people going to the bar with a very unfriendly clip board lady asking is she can help but telling you that you cant take that life. So you end up waiting about 6 or 7 minutes for the lift each time.

I ordered room service breakfast which was excellent. The only problem being the size of the room there is nowhere to put the enormous tray except on the bed. Luckily I was on my own, but if you are two in the room, better not have room service as it is really too small. Also ordered a newspaper the day before, but had to call back as it had been forgotten.

The hotel is very beautiful and the staff friendly, but you cannot compare the service with the sofitel for example even though the price is similar. 

For me it was trying to be just a bit too cool!",3,2014,02,01
148,Something weird with elevator transportation,"There are three elevators in the hotel. First one is reserved for bar on the rooftop, second one does not work and it is impossible to call the third one if first one is already downstairs. Today I have approached first elevator (I did not know that it is reserved for guests of the bar - in is written nowhere). Skinny guy without badge (he was called 'host' later by management) told me 'can I help you?' in rude intonation like I committing something bad. He did not explain that I for some reason there is top priority to visitors of the bar and that left elevator is reserved for someone. When I tried to explain that he has to call my elevator somehow, he told me not to raise my voice and not to say 'man' to him motivating that I came to England I have to be extremely polite and not to tell him that he does the job improperly. So, I had to wait 4-5 minutes for someone to come downstairs on the right elevator. Then I was so lucky to jump in and eventually go to my floor. That 'host' guy refused to tell his name (as far as I found later, his name is Adrian). Upon my observations, guests have to wait inadequate amounts of time for the elevator while they just can't call it if left cabin is already downstairs, but they can't use it. I recommend management to - 1. Make separate button and algorithm for left elevator or make all guests (hotel and rooftop bar) equal; 2. Provide badges to all employees. 3. Fire that 'host' Adrian - he is one of the guys who is not smart enough to understand that he is doing his job completely incorrectly.",1,2014,01,30
148,5 Star hotel that deserves 5 stars,"This is a wow of a hotel that still looks after the basics, As soon as we stepped through the door our bags were taken & staff escorted us to the first floor reception where we were given a glass of prosecco while
we waited to check in. Reception is incredible, a massive pyramid of marble tipping at roof level. at night images are projected on to the marble. We had the least expensive room but this was great. I think the main difference in rooms are the size. everything that you could possibly want or expect in a 5 star Hotel  is provided. Massive walk in shower & well lit bathroom, one of the most important things along with the mood lighting. A touch screen panel to choose what colour & volume of  lighting to suit your mood.  And a very nice touch, a half bottle of Champagne & chocolates. We were made to feel very welcome. The ME Hotel is in the very heart of Theatre land & Restaurants and although it is situated on a very busy junction, the rooms are soundproof. There is a wonderful roof terrace & bar & guests can go without booking as this gets really busy in the evenings. For my taste its a little loud with the D.J. but I am sure that younger people will love it, It really seems the place to be. Staff were all lovely, special mention to  Ingrid,Jamie & Emilliano who were very helpful & some whose names I didn't get.
One young man on concierge when I asked which bus to catch insisted on running down to the bus stop to check that he had given me the right information. That is service & a half. Overall a wonderful experience that I will repeat next week.",5,2014,01,30
148,Best Hotel in London,"Everything about this hotel is brilliant.. the staff are so helpful, nothing is too much of an ask. The rooms are a good size and kitted out with the best of technology to enhance your stay. The location is perfect, so central and the Radio rooftop bar has to be one of the best bars in London!

148,fantastic hotel,"Enjoyed a 1 night stay for my wife's b'day.
Beautiful, very modern hotel with great staff / service
Have traveled worldwide and this hotel really stands out 
Moved from a room to a suite as high winds meant original room on 7th floor was noisy however room transfer was done complementary.
Staff really could not do enough for us.  
      
      ",5,2014,01,29
148,Black and white,"Not much to add to the other reviews really; very courteous, polite, helpful staff, very clean and ultra-modern; fantastic location.

 I forgot to ask for a quiet room, but needn't have worried as I could barely hear the traffic outside or the lifts/other guests etc. Unfortunately as hotels must have fire doors I'm usually kept awake/woken up by doors slamming but that wasn't a problem here. 
Also no loud chatter/laughter from other guests outside, maybe because the layout meant there were only a few rooms near mine.
I did however hear the couple in the next room at 1:30am, so perhaps soundproofing could be better or they were really having a good time!

No bath in the room but I see some rooms have them so obviously you just need to request a room with a bath. 
As usual the beds were very firm; I wish hotels could provide a choice as I always wake up with backache which takes hours to ease after sleeping on a firm mattress. It's not for everyone. 
Temperature control and lights were great. My room had two washbasins, one was much lower which would be great for small kids. Sliding panels covering the windows kept out 95% of light and noise. Great idea. Luxuriously soft carpet felt lovely underfoot. 
Wi-fi included in the price but not great, I noticed high-speed is available at extra cost.

We stayed on a Saturday night, as we were watching a show, and hadn't realized that all the restaurants would be heaving (duh!-obvious with hindsight), including the hotel's own. So next time we will definitely book a table, as we were told there was no availability before our show. However, a table was found and the food was superb.
Thanks to everyone who helped make our stay enjoyable - all the staff were great.",5,2014,01,28

Very keen to help.  The room on the 8th floor was very nice, massive comfortable bed. Tv etc all there and working. The room is modern and gadgety. Had fun adjusting the lights.  Walk-in shower room was big enough to fit 10 people at the same time. Roof bar does have great views of London, but we thought the drink prices were a tad high. We had a few negatives but minor stuff really.",4,2014,01,26

The view in the roof top is amazing. I did not try any of the restaurants, but they all look lovely. My room was very comfortable. Only two small details: 1) the plug of the hairdryer could only work next to my bed, not in the bathroom 2) some days I had one towel, some other I had three. However, my experience in the hotel was superb. My only suggestion would be to make the gym a litlle more interesting, there isn¬¥t much there to be called gym.",5,2014,01,18
148,One word!  AMAZING ,"We had a fantastic experience by staying in this beautiful hotel...  The reception was pure joy, and a nice complimentary glass of prosecco while checking in. 
The room was on the 9th floor with a balcony overlooking the river Thames, I was a bit worried as the radio bar was just above us for the noise but no.. We barely heard anything. 
All the gadget in the room were easy to use and nice...  Nespresso coffee machine,  different light colour ambiance from pink to blue via red!  The music in the telly with several playlist to choose. .. 
Well I will go back for sure!  Do the same it is worth saving a little to enjoy a lot!  ",5,2014,01,18
148,no room ready,"we stayed at the me on the 12th jan 2014. when we arrived only one room was ready which was fine as we wanted to go out and get a drink and wonder round covent garden. we were told that the second room on the 8th foor with a river view would be ready on our return.
on our return at 5pm the room was not ready so we were offered a room on the 9th floor which was on the same side with the river view, great we thought and hurried to get up and see the fab room and view. when we arrived in the room it was not river facing so i called the reception and  asked if the difference could be refunded as the river view is more expensive. i was told no we will not give the difference back. we then askd if this is the case we want our river view room which all of a sudden became available funny that.
anyway we had a lovely room but the Bali shower door did not shut so dont forget to take a bottle of shampoo to keep it shut. we were rushed due to not getting our room on time as we were going to the theatre to see War horse which was amazing. 
over all the rooms are nice but if your not a hip cool trendy person you could pay the same money and stay at a better hotel with better service.
just to top of the stay we were charged twice for the rooms we had and my sister got charged to her card too. she is still awaiting a refund so thumbs down to ME.",1,2014,01,18
148,Over charges nightmare,"Booked river view rooms with balcony - Checked in early to be told second room wasn't ready - fair enough put cases in one room told ready at 3pm. 
Came back at. 5.pm - to get ready for the theatre for 6pm room still not ready.. Fobbed off with lesser room but didn't want to credit for river views! Then rushed as had to sort all that out! 
Had one drink and off to theatre. Rooms were very clean and fresh.
When home checked credit cards one couple had paid for room in advance - charged twice in one week the other card charged for rooms and drinks again. Nightmare - goes on",2,2014,01,18

148,Sleek Hotel,"Beautifully designed hotel by Norman Foster in an excellent location.  Excellent service, and felt very welcome.  State of the art rooms, with lovely baths.  State of the art technology that on occasion did not work perfectly.  In our suite the wifi did not seem to work in bedroom, only in sitting area.  And the fancy lighting is sometimes difficult to figure out.",4,2014,01,17

Its very trendy and the Radio bar is fantastic. This will defiantly be my hotel of choice from now on. Well done to every single staff member for making my stay one of the BEST in London.",5,2014,01,17
148,"Luxurious, modern, hi-tech - slightly too cool for it's own good","I stayed for a few nights after the New Year, and enjoyed the stay, with a few points. The arrival experience is not ideal - I guess through no fault of the hotel, there is nowhere for a taxi to stop conveniently, and no doorman to welcome you and point you in the right direction. When travelling with 4 large suitcases this is slightly awkward, although as suitcases these days have wheels (much to every Concierge and Porter's ire, no doubt) it was not a major obstacle. Entering the lobby bar of the hotel is visually stunning, although I knew it would be before I even arrived, by the loud Lounge musak being played through outside speakers. No doubt it was some Buddha Bar style compilation, but it set the tone.

Having asked the barman how to get to Reception (in the lift, up to the first floor) we reached the Reception, which is a unique and quite bizarre design. The inside of the lobby is an enormous pyramid, reaching up the height of the building (8 floors or so) lined with some sort of marble. There is a central display piece, a small bar top for arrival drinks, the Reception desk and a curvy sofa. While visually stunning, it was also visually numbing, and I can't imagine working there, being devoid of windows, people, or anything really to cast your eyes on. It was literally like being inside a large, shiny pyramid. There is a light show in the afternoon when images are projected onto the pyramid walls, which would quite possibly cause flashbacks for anyone from the Flower Power generation!

As mentioned by others - the corridors are dark, the music follows you everywhere (although they do seem to change the mood and tempo depending on the time of day?) and there is a melon smell pumped throughout, or smells like there is. The rooms were fantastic though - dual rainforest shower-heads, twin sinks and good toiletries. I was perhaps mistaken when I saw they charged for the disposable slippers if you wanted to take them with you? If they charge, does this mean they are re-used from guest to guest? If so, my apologies to the next guest that gets mine - I just can't seem to fix this darn Athletes Foot infection, and the Verucas are a pain, but Boots should sell you a cream that will help. The TV system worked well, and had good speakers above the bed, but the IPTV was slightly buggy, and there was some jitter in the display from time to time. 

Breakfast is served in the Italian restaurant of the hotel, and was very good. Service was efficient and friendly, and there is a type of hot buffet that is nicely served for you, which no doubt maintains the quality of the buffet better than letting the hungry hoards descend on it themselves. Overall the hotel stay was very good - it's a cool hotel, in a good location for many things in Central London, and I personally liked the area, as it was walking distance from everything I needed. Apparently there is a bar upstairs, but I was put off by the imposed exclusivity of the place. It's a bar. On a hotel roof. With a view. Get over yourselves please - other than that, a recommended hotel.",4,2014,01,16
148,Could be so much better,"This is a new hotel and has great potential.  The service upon check-in was great. We were escorted by the concierge to the check-in desk towards the back of the hotel. We requested a quiet room (club music is always blasting throughout the hotel) and were told that would not be a problem.  Turns out it was a HUGE problem.  We got a room on the second floor above the restaurant and around midnight the bass coming through the walls was unacceptable. We called the management and it took about 30 minutes to get the issue resolved. 

With the noise problem aside, the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are lovely - spacious and clean.",2,2014,01,14
148,5star experience but definitely age appropriate,"Stayed Dec13 one night for theatre as location is superb.  Building striking, reception atrium awesome. Had read about first floor reception, dark corridors and techno lifts so not surprised there. Twin room 8th floor was beautiful, excellent beds, luxurious toiletries and mini bar and extras. Very nice touch to have birthday messages on mirror and complimentary cake. Then...a terrace..in London!! Fabulous!!! However, this came back to bite us as you can hear the radio bar until it closes...ALL NIGHT until the early hours, absolutely ridiculous for a room tariff published at ¬£400. Unfortunate incident when a radio bar (again) patron set off fire alarm at 1.30am. At checkout we were one of many that mentioned it to get a ""sorry it was a very drunk man"" but not really a sincere apology, felt sorry for business clients checking out who had to work that day.  Expressed opinion that we could have stayed at a budget hen/stag party hotel for a quarter of cost with same shenanigans!! Another bug bear was with the crowds around doors at night for the bars and restaurants, good promotion for the hotel but paying guests struggle to enter!! Breakfast was nothing to write home about, had better in 5,4 and some 3 star hotels in London. I'm sure the pleasant staff would've obliged with whatever was requested but you had to go to them with questions or even tea/coffee refills. All in all, fab 5star experience for a young outlook crowd!!",4,2014,01,13
148,Hip Design. Location. Love!!,"Spent our first week in London before Christmas in the happening, new beautiful ME London.  Cool, comfortable, crisp and clean best describes our beautiful suite.  Loved the bed, pillows, linens, luscious products, fresh flowers and well stocked not-so-mini bar including a much appreciated Nespresso machine.  Our return visit in January was to a slightly upgraded room from standard and it did not disappoint. Mostly same amenities just less space but still more than adequate. Great breakfasts - something for all tastes, hot and cold. Stunning views from rooftop Radio bar and judging from traffic in and out of STK restaurant, a must go night spot.  Spa services available but did not experience so no comment. Service excellent throughout - found the front door staff especially attentive.  Walked everywhere from here - close to theaters, Soho and around the corner from Covent Garden. Would return to this hotel in a heartbeat and hope to do so sooner than later.

The bar is a decent size, good prices and lovely staff. The peach bellinis are to die for !!

Our room was a very good size, with a double shower/wet room, desk area, seating area and HUGE bed that was like a cloud to sleep in. 

Good selection in the mini bar & not overly pricey for a central London Hotel.

Most definitely somewhere to return to on future trips.",5,2014,01,07
148,Early Christmas present!!!,"Staying at the Me was part of a truly incredible weekend planned by my absolutely wonderful lady and the hotel did not disappoint.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty with champagne on arrival and a room upgrade to boot!!

This is what you would describe as an ultra-modern, very cool place to stay, right in the heart of Theatreland.  Rooms are spacious with all the latest mod-cons (including the 'mood' lighting!!), drinks and snacks, gowns and slippers all provided whilst our bathroom had this amazing rain shower (although I think the good lady would have preferred a nice, relaxing bath but hey, beggars can't be choosers!)

Having done the usual 'touristy' stuff, we'd booked pre-dinner drinks in the Radio bar before heading to STK downstairs.  Whilst Radio does provide stunning views overlooking the city, it is very much a place to be seen and definitely all about the kudos that goes with hanging out in such places so, whilst it was fantastic to experience the views of London at night, have a glass of champers, we felt a little uncomfortable and it probably wouldn't be the first place we'd choose to go for pre-dinner drinks in future but, again, that's just personal choice.

Following our little aperitif in Radio, we headed down to STK for dinner - quite possibly one of the wackiest places I've ever eaten in but loved the atmosphere!!  Food was nice but have had nicer food for half the price; staff were incredibly attentive and pleasant as well as a good laugh as they were very much part of creating the vibe that comes with this place.  A word of warning to those who may be thinking about eating here - be sure you know what you are letting yourself in for as STK is lively to say the least because there were those sat around myself and the good lady who probably thought booking here was a good idea at the time but just looked like they'd rather be somewhere else when the discovered how manic the place is!!  I'd also suggest it is more a place for groups rather than couples but that's not to say it would make a difference to your night if you were wanting to schmooze your loved one because the good lady and I had a ball!!

We said we would probably stay somewhere else (that's not to say we wouldn't stay here again) next time we're down in the capital but I would definitely recommend if you're maybe wanting to treat yourself to a little bit of luxury.",5,2014,01,06

148,Stunning Hotel in brilliant location,"I will keep this brief, the ME London is a place to stay if you want to impress. It is absolutely stunning inside with incredible attention to detail.  Rooms even have mood lighting controllable from an electronic touch pad by the bed....a real geeks dream.

Service was excellent throughout and was very grateful to the chap on reception who kindly upgraded us to a nicer room with a stunning view of Trafalgar Sq, London Eye and the South Bank.  We even got complimentary welcome champagne in the rooftop bar which has a really good view across London.

Oh while I'm on the subject of the rooftop bar, you HAVE to eat there, we had a selection of a few mini dishes and they were all fantastic, especially the sliders.

We were very lucky to get this place as a deal from Lastminute as we had booked to go to see The Lion King, had no idea the hotel is opposite the entrance to the Lyceum Theatre...bonus!!

148,Great Location,My mum and I stayed at the ME London for 2 nights in between Christmas and New Year. Check In was quick but on arrival at the hotel and we were in our room within 5 minutes with our complimentary prosecco. One thing I must note that although check in was quick we were not given much info about the hotel ie breakfast times or location of breakfast room / check out time etc etc and no info on this within the room either. Once in our room we reported at 7pm prior to going to the Theatre that heating wasn't working and room was very hot upon on our return at 10.30 heating still wasn't working and we were given 2 different stories as to what was wrong. Eventually it got fixed just before 11pm but must also note that we did not receive turn down service or fresh towels on 1st night. Room was very comfortable with good facilities and hotel was in a great location for Theatre and sightseeing in general. Breakfast buffet was good with plenty of choice. The staff were very polite and extremely courteous. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short break especially if you want to go to the Theatre. ,4,2013,12,30

148,Amazing hotel,"Beautiful hotel - the best location in the heart of London. I will go there again for sure and will recommend anyone to stay there. Amazing parties and beautiful roof top. Loved the room design very modern and clean. 
      ",5,2013,12,24
148,PERFECT EVENING IN EVERY WAY,A christmas get together with old friends.  We ate in Cucina Asellina.  From start to finish the staff at the bar and in the restaurant were professional and attentive.  The food was delicious and not served too quickly in between courses.  We then went to the Radio Rooftop Bar - what a great way to end the evening.  The views over London were spectacular.  I would definitely recommend a visit to this hotel.,5,2013,12,23
148,Radio and stk,"Me and my girlfriend reserve a table the STK food was brilliant, and the atmosphere was vibe, after dinner we've asked the hotel concierge where to go after that, and he recommended the radio bar on the top floor, been up and it was so busy but amazing, the view from there is properly the best view all over London what a place then we knew why it was busy. The music is great, and the staffs is nice. Thank you Hamd from the concierge of recommended that place to us. ",5,2013,12,22
148,Awesome trip to London at Christmastime,"We have been to London several times before, but this was our first time staying at ME London. Can't wait to return! The hotel is perfectly located on The Strand, allowing us to walk everywhere! The rooms are very nice. We opted to upgrade to the balcony room & I'm glad we did. We had a nice view of the city. The rooftop bar is fabulous with breathtaking views of London! The lobby area is inviting and welcoming. The staff from the concierge to housekeeping are all friendly and helpful. I had a mishap with the bathroom doors (careful, they're super heavy) and the manager and staff couldn't have been more attentive! Overall, we had a fabulous time there & can't wait to return!!!",5,2013,12,22
148,hip hotel with good location,"Really enjoyed stay but best part was the service.  I had back problems and concierge got me a physical therapist within an hour and offered to go out and get medication from Chemist.  Asked me about how I felt as I left in am.
      
      ",4,2013,12,20
148,"Great place, but poor attitude in the bar","Great place, lovely ambience. Lighting the the room was superb. However visiting the very cool bar we weree treated like second class citizens by the barman, who said last orders had been called but then went on to serve others, as were his collegues. Spoilt what was otherwise a great stay.

",4,2013,12,20
148,Good Location and Vibe,"The hotel and the rooms has a sexy, cosmo good vibe and location is fantastic.  The service was good, especailly with Conceirge and baggage service since that is the point where the entrance is.  The check in was polite, however the room was not ready at 1pm and could not accomadate an early check and got me to upgrade.  Which was totally unnecessary and the upgrade room had a small opening instead of a window, when complaint for room with a patio which was nice.  Overall, a pleasureful stay.  ",3,2013,12,19
148,Amazing,"Ticks all boxes and more... fabulous hotel, modern, chic, nestled just the right distance from the hustle and bustle of London.  I have to say the attention to detail was amazing, the staff were attentive, friendly and welcoming. We were greeted in the lobby by concierge, brought to the reception on the first floor, greeted with glasses of processco and then escorted to our rooms where we were inducted to the vast array of modern facilities....amazing. The roof top bar provides a lovely heated view of London, any drink you could want, and great music. All-in-all a once in a life-time experience, one we won't be forgetting anytime soon!",5,2013,12,17
148,Uber cool hotel,Really cool hotel very close to Covent Garden.  If you have a special occasion mention it as you may receive an upgrade!  The breakfast was fantastic and so was the rooftop Radio Bar which stayed open tip 3am.  Loved the lighting options in the bedroom and the decor.,5,2013,12,17
148,London beats Me,"Absolutely a place to be for a journey in London: alive lobby area, always full of people and with a very very nice tea time, STK and Cucina Asellina restaurants (where the breakfast is served) so cool and with so attentive service, reception at the first floor where they offer glass of Prosecco 24H, separeted lift to go at the RADIO roof terrace... TERRIFIC!!! the best view ever in London... it dominates everything... Big Ben, London Bridge... that the perfect cocktail bar to enjoy a drink or a glass of champagne!
The rooms rounds the pyramid that is in the centre of the building (designed by architect Foster), black color dominates the rooms levels. The bed is very comfortable, the amenities simply fabulous, the minibar and the facilities make you feel like home... Every year at least I come to London twice, and from now on ME London will be definitely MY Hotel!!!
And once you try ME experience... you become addicted to;)",5,2013,12,16
148,Absolutely Stunning!,"This hotel is just absolutely stunning! Jamie is great very friendly and willing to help all the time. Cosmin was also great nothing was ever a problem, the whole concierge team were great. The STK bar was lovely however the music was very loud and we were having to shout at each other but the food was delicious. Would love to visit this hotel again very soon! Thanks again to the concierge team. ",5,2013,12,15
148,This has the WOW Factor in spades....,"From the champers welcome at Check In (wow - what a stunning  reception), the fabulous architecture (wow), the room (wow), and all the assistance from the wonderful concierge team - it was a wowderful experience, we felt totally pampered. No noise and we were on the main road, 5th floor, and so often in London you are disturbed by street noise and adjacent rooms.  Can't understand why peeps mention the lift issue, it was no hassle (to have to go to the ground to get the lift up to the sky bar), as can appreciate you want the security of members of the public going up to the bar not getting out onto the corridors. Location perfect for our Theatre break.",5,2013,12,13
148,That Extra Mile,"We were lucky enough to stay at the ME last weekend and found the whole experience excellent.  Where to start!  The whole layout of the hotel is fantastic and that reception area really is quite something.  The staff were just wonderful and really do go that extra mile for you.  We were quite demanding as guests and nothing was too much trouble for them and all the help and assistance that we needed was carried out quickly, effectively and with terrific charm.  Lovely rooms, beds that you should never get of and great modern bathrooms.  Then there was the Radio Bar.  I have never seen views like it (or drunk cocktails like it!) - the ME Hotel is really something special.",5,2013,12,11
148,A trip to remember,"The hotel is modern, chic, and clean.  The concierge staff could not do enough for us while we were there.   They were well organized, knowledgeable, extremely patient, and though I am sure they had plenty of other things to do, they made us feel like we were the only guests there. 

The rooms were modern and chic.  They were well equipped with everything we needed, including an umbrella!

      ",5,2013,12,09
148,Afternoon Tea,"I had read a review that afternoon tea takes place in the hotel reception so we checked this out before booking.  We did indeed eat in the reception BUT it's gorgeous, little alcoves cleverly created by chrome bars, a fire pit, throws and all in all very laid back and cosy.  At for the tea - it was probably one of the best I've had in London, really fresh, we were offered more sandwiches, the scones were light and fluffy and the little Christmas themed cakes were scrumptious.  The waitress was really friendly and just the right amount of attentiveness without being in the way.  We were there two hours, and not hurried at all, lovely atmosphere.  Afterwards we visited the open air bar on the 10th floor which was just as lovely with more fire pits, overhead heaters and more throws - little bit expensive BUT everyone works to their own budget so don't let that put you off -  worth a visit",5,2013,12,09
148,NICE !!,"chose to stay here cause the interiors are done by Sir Norman Foster.  the service was casual and very friendly.  the check in area was stunning ! was offered a free bottle of champagne (thank you ME). stayed in one of the suites but it was still a tad small. the room was clean and the toilet very well designed.  good location, really convenient especialy if you are catching a musical.  breakfast was kinda sad though, very limited choice.",4,2013,12,08
148,Could have been better service,"I booked a room at this hotel through last minute.com. I needed a twin room as I was sharing with my son. I was assured that I would get one.  The booking was made for a Vibe room.
We turned up at the hotel, we're given the key to the room and went in, the Vibe room is advertised as having a floor to ceiling window-the room we walked into had a small window up quite high and a double bed. I went back to reception and asked for the room I had booked. I was given the key for Nother room, which I was assured had 2 single beds. It was exactly the same as the room we had just walked out of! In this room, the internal lock on the inside of the door was missing and again it had a double bed.
Again another trip to reception,  I told the receptionist that the Vibe room (I thought) had a large window and I was still waiting to be given a room with 2 single beds. The guy on reception told us that there were no Vibe rooms on the 7th floor and as we were moving our own bag (1 small pull along) he didn't want to put us out. 
We finally got ther room we had booked (and prepaid) on the 6th floor, but to be honest, I wouldn't bother booking here again. I don't think that a receptionist should dictate which room I should be given, the first 2 were certainly not the room advised as the Vibe room on the hotel website.
I mentioned this on check out and was told I would be contacted by the hotel within the week, 3 weeks later I'm still waiting.....",3,2013,12,07
148,ME OK,"Decided to stay at the Hotel after enjoying a wonderful afternoon tea a while back. We were greeted by friendly smiling faces every time we left and returned to the hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, especially the Concierge, and we will definitely return. Rooms ultra modern, and with views from the tenth floor ultra modern.
Multicultural, multilingual staff providing a perfect representation of all that we admire about London.",5,2013,12,07
148,Just does not make the grade!,"Very swanky and very modern almost to the point of being impractical. It so dark tht the first time we visited (just after it opened) we had no idea were the restaurants were. We went back assuming and hoping that the niggles we experienced first time round would of been ironed out (and because of its location to the BFI IMAX theatre) and some of them had. We were offered a glass of proseco this time on arrival and while we waited for our room availability, we were a little early. The lad on reception was difficult to understand and spoke down into the desk and i had trouble heating anything he said. He gave us our key pack mumbling something and pointing towards the lift, when we got in we pushed the button and nothing happened, in the darkness we rummaged around trying to seeing where to place the key card. A member of staff saw us and asked us had we not been shown how to work the lift and we said no, he then said well you should have been. We found our room which wad on the 8th floor, small but adequate. At reception I asked if a phone charger was available and yes it would be sent to room however we had to go back down and ask for it as it did not arrive. 

There was a capsule coffee maker in the room but no kettle and no tea bags!! As I am not a coffee drinker there was no early cuppa for me!

Breakfast was pretty abysmal. A 5 star hotel which offers just a buffet service?!! The plates were cold, the food only lukewarm, bacon leathery and felt like it had sat that for ages. Triangular hash browns resembling Birds Eye frozen ones were frightful. Toast was the thin plastic stuff from a plastic bag (most 5* hotels service artisan breads these days). I asked for English breakfast tea and my partner ordered coffee.  I received a cup of warm water with a teabag on the saucer and my partner received a cup of black coffee which we asked to be served with cream.  The teabag had split another was forthcoming and when i asked for milk i was told there was cream! ME hotel we do not use cream in our tea here in this country. Needless to say it was cold and undrinkable and the water not hot enough to produce any colour from the tea bag. No refill on the coffee was offered. 

On a positve note, the valet parking worked well, the STK restaurant was super in every way. Service impeccable, ambience superb and food simply stunning with the best sirloin steaks I have eaten. Side dishes were ¬£4.00 each but so easily service two hungry appetites -  we found we over ordered. I can highly recommend this restaurant even if you chose to stay in a real 5* hotel somewhere else.

I booked this hotel on line and was given a voucher for ¬£20.00 to be used in the hotel. It said to present this at reception which I did but was told it was not necessary and would be dealt with at checkout. At checkout there was no reduction of ¬£20.00 which I queried and i was told I had spent nothing!  The lunch in STK was ¬£120.00 I pointed out but was told as I had paid in the restaurant on my card and not charged it to the room it did not count!!!!",4,2013,12,07
148,Funky new hotel on the Strand,"My husband & I always travel to london in dec for his work. We always have stayed at the Sofitel-this time, a colleague  of his told us about this new hotel on the Strand, so we tried it. Great location-close to the river, close to Trafalgar Square...It's ultra modern & quite dark-all black hallways, electro house music in the elevators, a touch screen panel in the rooms to control light & heat. Nice double rain shower-ozone scented water, which was weird. Lovely rooftop bar with great city views. I felt as if I were in a space station-the reception is on the first floor, concierge on ground level. A tad different-staff hip but friendly.",4,2013,12,05
148,TOP CLASS,Stayed at ME London for our anniversary and received nothing but top service. The room was amazing the food was amazing and the service was amazing don't listen to negative reviews. BOOK NOW YOU WONT BE DISSAPPOINTED! ,5,2013,12,05
148,me london,"A great new hotel smart and friendly staff .Comfortable rooms and an atmosphere of quiet luxury.The roof top bar was bouncing with fun people.Service at breakfast was as quick as needed with great choices.
The lifts are a bit annoying from ground floor particularly when Radio is open and the wait time too long
      ",5,2013,12,04
148,Enjoyable stay/good location,"Slightly slow check in alleviated by very pleasant, helpful staff which was matched throughout the hotel. Comfortable clean room. Excellent dinner in cucina asellina, breakfast ok. All in all an enjoyable stay in a good location, will visit again.",4,2013,12,03
148,A feast for the senses!,"Well... What a surprise! I had no expectations about this hotel as my husband had booked it! I don't think it is easy to articulate the uniqueness of this hotel. 

The architecture inside is stunning. The reception is on the first floor.. Took a bit if finding as not well signed. The reception area is striking... It is a huge pyramid atrium which extends right to the roof with a glass prism. We were welcomed with a glass of prosecco, lovely! The service was excellent and the reception staff could not have been more welcoming (which is lovely for a 5* as sometimes this isn't the case). Our room wasn't actually ready until 5pm...Which is a bit of a shame. When the rooms are as costly as they are you want to get your money's worth!

The furnishings throughout the hotel are of a very high quality, beautiful carpets and funky wall coverings throughout.

The rooms are as you'd expect, lovely, funky, luxury, interesting layout with lots of gadgets! They aren't massive rooms, but a lot of thought has gone into the layout. Gorgeous rain show. Very comfortable, large bed with such soft sheets! Nespresso machine with cup and saucer! Lights you control with a touchpad next to the bed. We had a little balcony with incredible views over Somerset house and the Thames. The double glazing was amazing was you couldn't hear any noise from outside.

Another slight downside was the lifts to the radio bar. You have to use a separate lift to get up to the bar, only accessible from the ground floor. So we had to go all the way down, get out a lift, wait for a lift to the bar and go all the way up to the top. When you get up there it is a funky place for a cocktail and to people watch. Also, there were no tables at all, and little space at the bar, so you def need to reserve a table. The views from the bar are incredible, especially at night.

The only reason I have given this hotel 4 stars, rather than 5, is that the hotel is very expensive. When you charge these prices (without breakfast) your expectations are very high and you are looking for perfection... The ME came very close :)",4,2013,12,02
148,I wanted to love this place,"As a supposed 5 star hotel it needs to live up to its high prices. For me it did not make it, probably needs a good rather than average score but certainly not very good. So many irritations. Guaranteed check in at 3pm became 3.45pm, no wonder they need to give everyone a glass of champagne. Internet disconnected in my room every few minutes, leaking sink, doors close with a loud bank, clock not set to the correct time in the room, annoying lift service, specially when we were down to just one working and I could go on.
The things that worked where good, lovely beds and perfect glazing which meant zero road noise. Architecturally I found it stunning, but for a five star hotel at these prices you need to get the basics perfect, this place falls short.",3,2013,12,01
148,ME Hotel London,"Loved everything about this hotel. Great interiors, Aura room cool and comfortable. Radio Rooftop bar excellent, STK restaurant superb. Staff were brilliant. Usually stay at the Sanderson but not anymore!! Cannot wait for next chance to indulge in ME!!",5,2013,12,01
148,Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In !,"me and my girlfriend stayed at the me hotel last week for a couple of nights, we went there for my girlfriends 21st birthday. Staff were so friendly, amazing place to be in, we had champagne on arrival in the very lavish reception which is on the 1st floor, the aroma throughout the hotel is so refreshing... we wanted to take the smell home with us....  The hotel set our room up with fresh flowers, a small cake and a bottle of moet. they also put a little happy birthday message on the mirror for my girlfriend. the hotel upgraded our room as soon as we got their due to being a special occasion. The rooms are perfect, so comfortable. each evening we got back they cleaned our room again, lit candles all over the room and our bed were nicely folded out with robes on each side of the bed. i cannot fault this hotel at all. A must do...is the radio bar, great atmosphere.....all i can say is.....  amazing amazing and amazing... defiantly will be returning back here again.",5,2013,11,28
148,"Great location, high quality standards","A different hotel in London. New, modern with high quality beds. Rooms vary in size but are neat clean, well distributed. Amenities are high class. Location is great, just in the middle of theatre district, 10 min walk to Picadilly, 5 to Covent Garden. Many restaurants in the area. Roof Bar has one of the best views in London, specially at night. The only negative point is it is too dark in the common areas. Reception area is almost scary in its design. The breakfast is high quality, good choice, good service.",4,2013,11,28
148,A wonderful stay.,"As part of our silver wedding celebrations we stayed at the ME for one night and took in a show as well.
We arrived early and our room was ready so after a very quick check in we were taken to our room on the 5th floor. This is a very modern hotel and we loved the design , the black marble walls , subdued lighting and amazing flowers arrangements . Our room was large with a great view and everything was of a very high standard, towels, bed linen etc and the bed was massive. We went out and when we returned ., to our surprise we had been given champagne and strawberries . This was a delightful gesture and very much appreciated and enjoyed .
We visited the Radio Roof Top Bar and sipped cocktails whilst absorbing the amazing view over London .
All the staff whom we encountered were charming and helpful and we cannot wait to return to this exciting hotel.
Thank you ME

148,More smiles than competence,"We stayed here this past summer. It was very hot and the AC did not work in our room. We called the desk and a ""technician"" came up to assess the situation. After it was clear he had no idea what to do they changed our room - very late at night. Only after we were situated did they realize there was no AC in the entire hotel. They gave us 2 free nights for our trouble. We just returned for the 2 nights, in November. It's very cold. There is no heat in our room - but the AC works just fine! We called down and they sent a ""technician."" The best he could do was give us an extra blanket. Yesterday we were out of toilet paper. It took 2 calls and an hour to get some. This morning when we woke up and tried to take a shower we learned there was no hot water. When we called down to see if it was just our room or the entire hotel they had no clue. While we were eating breakfast in the hotel we learned there was no hot water in the entire place. The manager very nicely told us it would be back on .. she had no idea when, but requested our patience. It is shocking how grossly incompetent a new hotel can be - no AC, no heat, no hot water. Everyone here smiles a lot, but we'd rather have fewer smiles and more basics. We will not complain this time, because we fear they'll give us free nights ...  the last thing we want is to ever come back to this hotel.",1,2013,11,24
148,Almost perfection,"When you arrive at the desk , you feel like being in a cocoon, out of this world. The reception is impressive and gorgeous if you like modern style. The room was perfect with a king size bed and the bathroom is really modern and beautiful. Everything is in black and white. Staff is always ready to help you. 
Breakfast is served in a restaurant. Large choice of hot and cold dishes. Very tasty.
Great location on Strand. 5 min walk from Covent Garden substation. Plenty of restaurants and theater around the hotel.
Complimentary wifi in the rooms. 
Minor drawback: I had a room above the bar of the hotel. On saturday night, they play loud music until 2 or 3 am and you can hear it from the room. 
This fact apart, I had a great moment in this hotel and I will certainly come back next time I visit London",4,2013,11,23
148,Wowzers View in Bar!!!,"Went for drinks in the roof top bar and what a view, especially at night. Lovely outdoors and indoor, with plenty of seating outdoors with patio heaters and nice ambience inside but difficult to get seats. Make sure you take plenty of lolly as not cheap, however a real touch of class.",5,2013,11,23
148,Sorry but it was a letdown!,"I had heard great things about this hotel that it is fabulous.  Besides being really cool place for drinks on the rooftop bar, and nice funky loungy music in the elevator for the party goers, hotel lacks the warmth.  Some rooms are small, and some with a really small window.  The Vibe rooms are bigger.  There is a nice large bathroom with double rain shower.  

Don't stay in any rooms close to service doors.  I am staying in one of the rooms, and all night I kept hearing the doors shutting down with a bang.  I was up at 2am with this constant noise, and couldn't go to sleep because of this noise. Even during the day, I could hear the same noise all day long, I think I will sleep out of exhaustion now.    I have called the reception twice, still waiting for their call for change in room.",3,2013,11,23
148,Unique experience,I like the extra touch upon arrival where ME offers a glass of Prosecco. Personally for me genuine service is the most important yet ME is popular for it's design. It would be nice to have a fragrance in the hotel so guests have the recognition staying in a Melia property.,4,2013,11,19
148,Beware !,"We had two rooms with an interconnecting door this weekend a beautiful hotel, lovely food and professional staff. However when we checked out we were asked about the mini bar and paid ¬£2.80 in cash for the one item we had had from the mini bar, when I checked my bank the following day we had a debit of ¬£100.00 to the M E hotel I was confused about this as the bill had been paid in cash so when I called the M E to ask what this debit was for I was told its standard practice to debit ¬£50.00 per room for the mini bar in case the guest is not telling the truth when they check out ! I was never told about this and I never had to input my PIN the ¬£100 is still owed to us I think this is totally unacceptable to not tell the guest hence this review !BEWARE ! !",4,2013,11,19
148,disappointment,"We stayed a weekend in this hotel. The ambiance is very cold and the lighting is terrible. Very dark all over the hotel, it felt like a tomb. The reception lookes like a crematorium. The staff made me feel not welcome during our stay. The public is common and cheap. Generally my impression about the hotel is poor. The rooftop bar is only allowed when you make a reservation but at the reception they don't inform you about this. If you are looking for a stylish hotel I recommend you to visit another 5 star hotel.",2,2013,11,18
148,Absolutely fabulous,This is an amazing hotel. The reception has an atrium reaching up to the tenth floor where the rooftop bar has a wonderful view over London with so many landmarks visible. The rooms are well designed and have many features. The hotel is certainly not cheap but is still good value for a short stay in central London. Well recommended and the best place I have stayed in for a long time.,5,2013,11,18
148,Afternoon Tea Experience ,"Wow, what an amazing place. The ambience was perfect for the occasion. This is a very contemporary hotel and the tea is superb. The quality of the food was excellent. The staff were attentive and keen to please. There is a mixed clientele but everyone gets a personal experience . Very impressed . Decor and presentation are outstanding. The toilets are a long walk and there is only one . I would definitely go again . ",5,2013,11,17
148,"Excellent location, something a little different..","Stunning decor, friendly staff and very comfortable rooms with some very interesting extras! A bath and a hair drier would have been nice though..I am luckily blessed with the ability to sleep through anything but if you arent you might struggle due to the noise from the Radio club downstairs.

Fantastic buffet breakfast - worth visiting for that alone!",5,2013,11,17
148,Absolutely fabulous,"We stayed last night and what a magical time we had  the staff are very professional and friendly especially Jamie he is a credit to the hotel, breakfast was very good nothing was too much trouble the room was spotless and very quiet we would definitely stay there again I would recommend it to anyone  ",5,2013,11,17
148,Overnight stay in West End,Room was very modern minimalist design including a Nespresso Machine but no Tea. Lovely soft bed and no noise from outside traffic. Bathroom had a rain shower and dual sinks. Hotel would suit a young person. The bars had excessively loud music so not somewhere you can relax over a quiet drink. However in a great location for bar and restaurants outside.,4,2013,11,17
148,Friendly 5*,"This is a beautiful hotel.  Very comfortable.  The staff are very helpful.  The drinks are 5* London prices.  The reception area (when you find it) is a sight to behold!  Be prepared for dark corridors, it felt like being down a posh coal mine!  If going to shows it is in an excellent position.  The roof top bar was very expensive but a wonderful treat.",5,2013,11,14
148,Very cool..bit clinical,"Bit of a strange entrance. You are greeted by concierge  at the entrance and then escorted past the bar to a set of lifts round the back. Lift takes you to reception on first floor (and what an amazing reception it is too with a skylight to die for).

The corridors are dark and mysterious. The standard room was tiny. The TV wall had neon backlighting which you can control the colour with a remote control. Very good insulation so couldn't hear the busy Strand's traffic.

Overall a very trendy cool hotel.

Overall a",4,2013,11,13
148,Lovely but expensive!!,"We stayed in the ME in October within a party of 12 and the hotel is truly 5 star.
The room was beautiful, modern and clean and ticked all the boxes.
Breakfast was fantastic and plentiful and all the staff were helpful and friendly.
The staff really do go that extra mile to ensure your stay is a pleasant experience.
The roof top bar is also an experience, but very expensive with seating coming with minimum spends of ¬£1,500.00!!!....hence we bumped into Liverpool FC players on a night out!!
All in all great hotel and worth the visit, and certainly makes you want to return.",5,2013,11,13
148,Outstanding,"The striking internal architecture and design may seem strange at first but soon you appreciate its functionality for a hotel. The reception is located in a space that must be unique and gives you a feeling of grandeur. The corridors on the bedroom floors are mercifully free from muzak, and you quickly get used to the dark lighting, which is restful, When you open the door to your room, there is a flood of light. The rooms are really smart and perfectly adequate in size. The beds are comfortable and, in spite of having a room on the second floor over the Strand, it was very quiet. A full breakfast is included and was good. The top floor lounge/bar is a great place to relax with wonderful views and has a large ouside terrace.I found the hotel a refreshing change from the usual city-centre hotel and its location is perfect - just 3 minutes walk from the Royal Opera House. The staff are welcoming and helpful. Strongly recommended.",5,2013,11,13
148,Best Hotel Ever Been,"I took my girlfriend to London for her Birthday to get engaged, booking a room at the ME hotel was what helped make the day so special.
From the second we arrived to the moment we left the hotel couldn't do enough for us. They spoilt us with Champagne, food and service of the highest standards. On arrival i told the staff of my plans and they upgraded our room, they put champagne and chocolate on the table, helped with all my requests. Wasn't left wanting at any point of our stay.
The hotel is just excellent and the roof top bar in the hotel has wonderful views and likeness of that like the hotel and bar situated over the F1 track in Abu Dhabi.
Thank You",5,2013,11,12
148,Did not deliver,"Usually stay in another 5 star hotel in London, gave ME a try for a very special occasion. Expected something, at least a mention, to commemorate this but not to be. Check in staff sterile if im honest. Corridors too dark, I like cutting edge etc but this and the mood lighting is not cutting edge anymore and nothing new if we are honest..
Breakfast farcical, no milk on tables, no skimmed or low fat milk when i asked? seriously 5 star hotel and no 5 skimmed/low fat milk? 3 cereals was the choice which is very poor. Porridge extra!!! Come on!!! Tea cold each time, gave up when I saw a waited stand for at least 5 minutes with my tea in his hand speaking to a colleague(cold again when it arrived on my table, I wonder why!!!).
Gym like a showbox. I would be bored if I stayed too long at this hotel.
Also extra mini bar items on my Bill when checking out which were not consumed.

Wont be returning Im afraid. MUCH BETTER OPTIONS IN LONDON.",3,2013,11,12
148,Maybe too cool for school?,"this hotel tries to be the trendiest place in London, which has its positives and negatives.  the hotel has a club on the ground floor which makes sleeping on floor 1 a bit of a task.  

the room is quite small and all the electronics take a bit of time to get used to.  the quality of the hotel fit-out looks good, but I am shaky on the quality - examples include rips in the wall (odd material) and rust in the shower.  

the location is perfect and is the hotel's biggest asset.  the staff were nice and accommodating.",4,2013,11,11
148,Great - worth a treat!,"Great location if you are at the Theatre (which we were) or visiting Somerset House.  Lovely hotel, very modern.  It is expensive, but offers super service, and lovely rooms.  Very comfortable indeed.  Lovely shower separate from the toilet which meant for a couple it was a lot speedier getting ready in an evening as you weren't restricted whilst one person was using the bathroom.  Not large rooms, but you are in the Centre of London.  Would definitely stay again.  Roof top bar offers great views of the City - from the London eye along the Thames.  Lovely. ",5,2013,11,10
148,Brings the word stunning to a whole new level,"We had a very enjoyable night here in this beautifully designed luxurious hotel.
The check-in desks are particularly amazing and are in the most magnificent space, a marble pyramid extending to the roof ending in a skylight, truly dramatic and they presented us with a full outer space presentation on the pyramid walls making us really feel as we where in outer space .

There's a touch of ostentatiousness about the place with varius sized champagne bottles displayed about, ince baths with champagne and the like. There's even a nightclub at the entrance when you enter leaving you in no doubt that the hotel is aimed at the young and wealthy.
The mini bar offers some useful eqiupment for a kinky night away our deluxe room located on the 7th floor with view of the Shard and London Eyes! The Balcony giving you a 180¬∞ view, the lights can change from sexy colors to intimate ... just something I would go for again!.

Overall though a great stay was had. The bed was supremely comfortable and enormous

To top of everything of there is a amazing Roof Top Bar, large bedroom with beautiful bathroom and incredible sound system for the amateur of clubbing!

The staff where amazingly helpful well done!!!!",5,2013,11,10
148,Not impressed.,"This hotel does not deserves the 5 stars it has been given. The hotel has obviously forgotten that customer service is meant to be part of the package when staying at such a highly rated establishment. 
The hotel gives off an impression of trying too hard to fit in. It is ultra modern and as a result heartless.
The highlight of the room was most definitely  the bed which was humongous and the impressive collection in the mini bar..however it is cheaper to go and buy a drink in the over priced Roof top bar than it is to have one in your room. The fixtures looked impressive although many were broken or needed repair ( I would expect this in 2 star establishment not in a 5 star.) Our toilet seat came off in my partners hand when he lifted the lid. The sliding door which acts as a curtain did not slide, the tap was loose, the shower head in the wet room had bits missing and as for the cleanliness...well I do not expect to find other peoples hair left in the shower or a thick layer of dust along the mini bar and tv shelf.  The mood lighting in the room does not give a romantic aspect it makes it feel sleazy
All in all I was incredibly disappointed with my stay at this hotel and for the price that is charged I would recommend that you look elsewhere to receive proper 5 star treatment.",2,2013,11,10
148,"STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE, DESIGN OVER PRACTICALITY, STAY SAVED BY FRIENDLINESS & WILLINGNESS OF STAFF","Style over substance, design over practicality, does not make always make it easy for guests; for an eight-night stay, we were initially given a room with an 18"" wide wardrobe, until we changed next morning but still no space in room for luggage. Bathroom lacked privacy; more like a giant glass cage in the middle of the room; lighting/heating/air conditioning only works by a computer controlled panel on ONE side of the bed!
The hotel has become so popular with London locals that at times it's impossible for guests to use the restaurant & bar facilities. The Radio Roof Bar was always full and to book a table we were told the minimum spend had to be ¬£50 each (¬£100 after 9 pm)! Another night the foyer bar was cordoned off from guests, while 200 outsiders stood jam-packed inside quaffing champagne and eating canapes.
Breakfast organization (served in the hotel's Italian restaurant, Cucina Asellina) was haphazard: one morning an open buffet; the next, a la carte with severe restrictions on choice.
After the first night we felt like checking out but on the last morning, we didn't want to leave!
The change was brought about entirely by the friendliness, willingness and efficiency of the staff. All credit is due to the highly trained professional Aura team, who sorted out our problems. It was always so pleasant to arrive and leave the hotel whenever the cheerful chappie, Jamie, the doorman was on duty (he's so helpful and polite).
Thanks, also, to the management team in Cucina Asellina, who sorted out some initial breakfast difficulties so willingly and to Maria and David for their excellent service. We also had two wonderful dinners in there: great food at an incredible price. The same thanks go to the staff in the hotel's  STK  restaurant/club, where we dined on a busy Saturday night.
Whenever we could get access to the foyer bar, it was relaxing and thanks too to barmaid, Charlotte, who was always so calm and polite.
Overall, would we stay there again? Yes, indeed! One winning aspect was the room's balcony terrace ( a rarity for a London hotel room) for a breath of fresh air and wonderful views over the City. Well done designers but why didn't you personally use some of the room facilities, in order to see how practical they were (or not!) for guests?",4,2013,11,09
148,Wow!,"A luxury hotel with a modern twist, the ME London is housed in the former Marconi building and in a prime location close to Covent Garden and, of course, right in the middle of London's best known theatres and next to the river.

The rooms are beautiful and very modern, with lighting operated by a touch screen next to the bed. This includes a Sexy setting, to go with the package of kinky items in the minibar, which bathes everything in pink. Quite a giggle, shame I was there for a business trip and, as a result, on my own.

Downstairs, the restaurant serves incredible food but the DJ and dance floor nearby will annoy some people. Didn't bother me though. The highlight is the Radio roof bar, with views out across most of London's most famous buildings. Canary Wharf, Big Ben, the BT tower, the Shard, Tower Bridge, just to name a few.",5,2013,11,08
148,Not quite 5 star ...,"First impressions were good, very professional friendly doorman and then  staff to take you up to reception, complimentary glass of fizz while wait to check in, more than 1 person on reception would have been good. Was given room key but on opening room was confronted by dirty towels on floor, old food still on a trolley, not sure if room was occupied or not! Back to reception and given an upgrade but after waiting for lift found key didn't work so back to reception again. Finally got access to a very pleasant room. most things worked OK but shower/wet room floor was very uneven and flooring moved unnervingly.
Rooms are very well equipped but lack of tea making facilities is not good.but basis things spoil this hotel with lack of attention to housekeeping and very long wait for the single lift that serves all the 157 rooms ( one lift was out of action and the second one I was told on returning to the hotel was exclusively to go to the 9th floor roof bar not for humble guests!). Overall very disappointed.",2,2013,11,08
148,"Kinky 5 star, a touch ""Made in Chelsea""","We had a very enjoyable night here in this beautifully designed luxurious hotel.
The checkin desks in particular are in the most magnificent space, a marble pyramid extending to the room ending in a skylight, truly dramatic.

There's a touch of ostentatiousness about the place with varius sized champagne bottles displayed about, ince baths with champagne and the like. There's even a nightclub at the entrance when you enter leaving you in no doubt that the hotel is aimed at the young and wealthy.
Overall though a great stay was had. The bed was supremely comfortable and enormous! 
Plenty of complimentary water was available which is a godsend at the end of the night.
We didn't have breakfast nor any other food in the hotel so can't comment upon these.

Wonderful location, wonderful service, wonderful hotel.",5,2013,11,05
148,The Best way to experience the West End !!! ME London,"The HIT & HOT SPOT in London!

ME London actually make you start the fantastic London Way of Life of the West End with an amazing Roof Top Bar, large bedroom with beautiful bathroom and incredible sound system for the amateur of clubing!

Lucky enough I could upgrade for ¬£25 in order to stay in a deluxe room located on the 7th floor with view of the Shard and London Eyes! The Balcony giving you a 180¬∞ view, the lights can change from sexy colors to intimate ... just something I would go for again!

The staff is always happy to help or even give some advices, not too much so just as I like it.

At the time of reservation, I mentioned it was my girlfriend birthday and they have included a bottle of champagne in the room, great attention from management - you really feel the whole team look after you to make your stay unforgettable and believe me I will not forget it!

I even plan to try another ME destination - why not Cabo or Barcelona :)

Thank you again and see you soon!

148,"Chic, Fun and a definate return!","As a London ex-pat I have been trying to find a centralised hip, fun and luxury hotel well ME is all that...the rooms are gorgeous and although the low lighting and black marble may not be to everyone's taste it is the staff who shine at ME is a city I adore the one thing I have often noticed is that people can be dismissive and cold in the service industry however at ME the staff couldn't ME more helpful and I always felt that my custom was valued....I loved Radio bar...the views of London wrapped around me like a panoramic tourist advertisement for all that is great and wonderful of the london skyline, the staff at Radio once again were the highlight...even though we had just gone up for a look around on the first night we were offered seating and looked after very well.  I loved this hotel. I loved it's style. Okay I probably wouldn't bring the Mammy but I will be back and I would highly recommend this hotel on the edge of Covent Garden.",5,2013,11,01
148,hip hotel in good location -- best roof bar!,"it's a very modern hotel with all amenities and great service.  The roof top bar has some of the best views of London... you can see canary wharf, the gherkin, the london eye, tower bridge, big ben, houses of P etc.  While i wasn't traveling with kids, i did see a few at the hotel and the hotel seemed very welcoming to families.  The room was spacious and extremely comfortable... good amenities and funky lighting pad but easy to manage.  One note -- my room didn't have a tub. Will also had there there was a slight mishap with my room where the hotel made a mistake and they were very quick to apologize and make it up to me with a little amenity.  Every place makes mistakes and it's how you handle them that sets good service apart.  Only thing i didn't like is the hallwyas on the bedroom floors are too dark.  low lighting is cool but these (in my opinion) are just too dark.  While the roofbar was great -- we also ate at STK and were not wowed.  Perhaps because the desserts weren't so great and that's the last thing we ate!",5,2013,11,01
148,"Well designed, remarkably quiet","Stayed here for one night after an evening function elsewhere. Although public areas somewhat uber-chic for our tastes, with black low-lighting corridors ( each to their own), the room was excellent. Although quite small it was extremely well designed and fitted, making use of the available space very well. Fixture and furnishings very modern ( bedside lighting control panel) and extremely well soundproofed. We had a first floor room facing onto the Strand, and when I walked in I immediately thought I would have to ask for a different one due to road noise - until I realised I couldn't hear any!  We had a very peaceful night. 

A very good hotel at a very reasonable (for London) price.",4,2013,10,30
148,Stunning modern hotel,"Myself and my wife visited this hotel for an anniversary treat last week and could not have been more impressed.

Firstly however, I will say that this hotel is likely to split opinion as it is very much at the 'funky' modern end of the spectrum! Anybody who prefers a more traditional style hotel with a bit of history this is unlikely to be your cup of tea!

On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a very friendly doorman who accompanied us in the lift to the reception area which is unusually on the first floor of the hotel. The reception (which looks like something from the matrix) has an amazing 'pyramid' style architecture with an atrium that rises all the way up to a window of the floor in the rooftop bar. I'm sure that the reception staff must get used to everyone gazing gormlessly around the hotel in wonder!! 

We were offered a welcome glass of champagne and as it was our anniversary the hotel were kind enough to upgrade us to an amazing room on the 9th floor. Corridors were dimly lit, but very chic and the low level lighting just serves to add to the overall effect. The room was immaculately clean with a balcony overlooking Aldwych, fantastic bathroom, very well equipped, incredibly comfortable bed and some great lighting options.

After an afternoon of traipsing round shops, we returned to our room to find as complimentary bottle of champagne which was really appreciated and a very nice touch,

Radio Bar was very trendy with great views over the London skyline and we were invited up for complimentary drinks and canapes in the afternoon. Residents get access via a special lift on the ground floor where a member of staff gives you access to the 10th floor.

Other points to mention:-

- Staff all very friendly and efficient but particularly the doorman & the concierge. 
- Brilliant location, in easy walking distance of Covent Garden, the West End, etc.
- Didn't use either restaurant but both looked very modern (as you'd expect) with varied menus.
- One minor gripe was that when we ordered breakfast in bed in the morning we were charged ¬£3 for the privilege and then charged a ¬£7 'tip'. Not something that changed our opinion of the hotel but something we will know the next time we visit.
 
Overall, we were made to feel very special and although it is a bit 'pricey' we would not hesitate to recommend it to our friends. We will definitely be returning to celebrate our next 'special occasion',",5,2013,10,29
148,Wow beautiful lounge,"Was booked in for a Champagne Afternoon Tea for my birthday celebration with my husband as a treat from our son, must admit did not know the hotel and from the outside looked a bit plain but upon entering the Marconi Lounge the decor was fabulous, the champagne and afternoon tea was fabulous we was well looked after by Naheed our waiter who was very helpful with his information on the variety of teas on offer would definitely recommend this for a special celebration.",5,2013,10,29
148,Exciting central London venue,"My wife and I stayed here last week for our anniversary and were not disappointed. Reception is located on first floor which requires getting a lift to reception and then a lift to room (and same on check out) but also allows a quiet glass of fizz while staring at the triangular atrium during check-in. Our room was lovely - with all the features you would expect from a top establishment and some lovely extras in the minibar (including popcorn and a 'sweets' bag which would be ideal if you had time for a movie). Our welcomes, both on the door and at reception were generous and we were made to feel at home even though we were there on an Amex offer. I imagine this is a little out of our usual budget but a great place to stay if you can afford it.",5,2013,10,29
148,Nice Hotel,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

The rooms are very modern and have all the latest gadgets. Our room also had a great balcony with table and chairs.

The roof top bar was the main attraction but could hear it in our room until the early hours and that was my only complaint.",4,2013,10,29
148,Jaw dropping!,"Everything about the decor and architecture of this place will make your jaw drop - it really is quite something!  I imagine the reception staff struggle to get anyone's attention as we just gawped upwards at the atrium whilst enjoying welcome champagne!  It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it was ours!  I will imagine it will shake up the London hotel scene as it is so modern and so well thought through in all cases - good rooms, great furniture and amenities and very snazzy.  The Radio bar seems to be the place to be on a Friday night, great views.  Slightly annoyed that service was added to our drinks bill, which were ordered sitting at the bar!",4,2013,10,27
148,What a shame! Expected more,"Well was excited about staying at the ME. Went in September to watch a show with friends.
Stayed in a suite that was average but comfortable. The hotel is dark and gloomy. No warm feeling when you walk in. The room was well equipped. The staff were lifeless except the doorman. I feel the hotel has lost the feeling of a central London hotel. Don't go here if you want a touch of England. The hotel is lifeless. The roof bar is the only exception, the view is excellent and the staff great, Its definitely worth a visit for an hour for that.
We went to our show but and arrived back at the hotel early hoping for a night cap. The front receptionist sniggered and had pleasure in telling us all bars were shut at 12pm. He didn't even want to offer us something for the room.
Don't pre pay for breakfast if you are hungry. The staff are useless and have no understanding of customer services and definitely don't ask for a cup of tea. they looked at me like i was an alien. take a magnifying glass with you for anything you order. They should sack the chef. Was asked to pay in cash for the ¬£50 parking. Found that unusual too? watch that one, never had that before. I wonder who pocketed that. Thoroughly disappointing stay. Overrated and  dull. Only real plus is that its convenient for the City and major attractions.",2,2013,10,25
148,Chic and stunning!,"ME London was an experience! The reception room was incredible and surprising as was the whole feel of the hotel. The decor and mood were very sexy, though that's the farthest from my reason for stay ;) I was generally impressed with the whole hotel. The food, room and service were fantastic. Extra points to James the doorman/valet. He was always pleasant, good humored and gave us great advice as to where to eat and shop. He was our go-to-man :) The only minuses where perhaps the organization of breakfast, pretty confusing, and the tiling in the bathroom area of our MODE room. The floors looked dirty but we realized it was just a bad choice of tiles and they were stained. Overall I really enjoyed my stay at ME hotel. I wish I had had room to buy and take one of they're super plush pillows with me! Thanks ME London!",4,2013,10,25
148,"Wow, stunning hotel","From the moment we pulled up outside and were greeted by the smiling staff we new that we were in for a treat. It was london fashion week during our stay and we loved the exhibitions  in the entrance area and thru out the hotel.. We were then wisked up to the first floor check in desk and offered a glass of Fizz. Perfect. Paperwork completed and onto our room. We were shown how the lighting worked from a nifty pad next to the bed and loved the idea that there was a setting marked ""sexy"". Obviously we hit the button and the lighting turned a very subtle pink..I half expecetd Barry White to start playing ! 
The room was perfect , the beds were extremely comfortable and the shower very powerfull. The hotel location excellent.
We did visit the roof top bar, Radio where we were made to feel at home. The bar overlooks londons landmarks and we spent sometime here enjoying the fine wines.
This hotel provided a perfect backdrop to our 20th wedding anniversary plans.
Thankyou, we will be back soon!",5,2013,10,22
148,A bit too full of themselves.,"We stayed in a suite for 5 nights in mid September. The room was very nice though a bit dark for my taste-zero view but it is London. Hall design of black marble a bit much and incredibly dark. Marta was very nice to deal with but the main concierge was incredibly pretentious-when we arrived there was no bell man and no one bothered to assist us with our bags. The roof bar has wonderful views- the food was OK, nothing fabulous. Overall a nice hotel but not worth the price in my opinion given the plethora of options in London. ",4,2013,10,21
148,Very stylish and central of course,"The only thing Norman Foster didnt get right here was the lift system. Otherwise this was a very nice and stylish place. I had a 6 floor room, great design and lay out. Spacious and quiet. So i have no complaints, you get what you pay for here. Then, it was the lifts; the reception is one floor above ground, so you need to take the lift to check in. They have 3. One is reserved for the popular, trendy and very busy roof bar and they have not figured out how to program them so they work independently. You might end up waiting ages for a lift. I spent about 10 minutes at one instance to get down from my room. Most likely Norman Foster didnt work at OTIS.",4,2013,10,19
148,Just Perfect ‚Äì and real service without the pretension - a must stay !!,"We stayed at the ME back in September to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday - The complete experience was one of the best I can remember. (I must admit I have taken a while to deliberate over making a great review as my fear is that the next time I wanted to book the popularity of the ME will have grown and they will be fully booked!!) But, as they have got this so right they deserve the success!!
We are by our own admission very exacting with our requirements, and on so many occasions with hotel stays something generally gets overlooked ‚Äì this is  NOT the case with the ME they just made everything so relaxed and easy from the check in, the room facilities and location, the approachability of the staff, and the excellent facilities. This was the first time, for longer than I can remember, where I entered the hotel lobby and the hotel room and said WOW ‚Äì it was not the largest room but perfectly designed and well-appointed and just great.
The most refreshing aspect of this hotel is that you feel valued, the service is genuine and not stuffy or pretentious ‚Äì the prices for breakfast and glasses of champagne are just astonishing great value especially as this is a top central London hotel ‚Äì a stay here is a clear must do ÔÅä 
Thanks you to Marta and her team for making the stay great and we look forward to seeing you again very soon.",5,2013,10,17
148,Great concierge ...,"We are older and not their target market but were made very welcome...Rowan at the concierge could not have been more helpful on advising us on restaurants and plans etc. ..overall a very positive experience..rooms new, clean and sleek!",5,2013,10,15

Nice feathers with the light. No not the sexy button but to get it off in one switch and a nice motion detector of you have to go to the bathroom at night. Great coffee machine but missed the tea.

And clean and not noisy.",4,2013,10,15

148,√úber Stylish Establishment,"From the moment I appeared with two little ones and two furry ones, they made me extremely welcome. Lots of staff to attend to my needs. 
Rooms are pristine...especially 111....
A little pricey but hey, it's in the heart of the scene. 
The check in area is stunning. 
I love the building itself, and the rooftop area is to die for.

148,Anniversary celebration,"We have been lucky enough to have stayed in some fabulous places over years and subsequently look for something quite special when celebrating events like our anniversary. It is probably quite true to say that I am also quite fussy and subsequently hard to please.
From the moment we pulled up outside the ME and were greeted by the enthusiastic and helpful doorman and valet James to the minute we left the following day, everybody we encountered in this amazing establishment went the extra mile to be helpful, polite and genuinely happy which is so often lacking in many top tier hotels. This led to a level of service that really made you feel special whoever you were, but without it feeling pretentious or forced.
The whole property is spotlessly clean and the well appointed rooms want for nothing and are most importantly quiet with very comfortable and huge beds. Our Mode room had the best stocked mini bar in London, amazing double rainforest type shower, floor to ceiling window with excellent view, entertainment system- Take your iPod and plug it in, and multicolour multi mood setting light system - awesome! Some have commented on the rooms being small but we are in central London. ...... We found our room to be more than adequate and clever design and lighting actually Made it feel quite big. 
The rooftop bar is well documented elsewhere on this site and we visited both in the daytime and at night. On both occasions the experience was superb. Prices are as you would expect in this location with such views and bearing this in mind it's quite good value. Great mojitos. Breakfast at the Italian restaurant in the hotel was relaxed and very good.
Special thanks need to go Nicolas Matilla who made particular arrangements for us during our stay that have put the ME Hotel In the Aldwych at the top of our must return to destinations when in London.",5,2013,10,13

148,The place to stay in London,"I am a fan of W Hotel and stayed my first few days in London at W on Leicester. It was good and met expectations as in previous W stays elsewhere. I stumbled on ME Hotel while walking around the Strand. The ME Hotel is a brand I never heard of prior to this trip. I think it is only one of 4 ME hotels worldwide managed by Melia Group a brand not known for luxury. I was initially skeptical but long story short anyone who likes W concept will find ME hotel an improvement. The rooms are larger, sleek, modern and well designed. Almost a copycat of W in terms of music direction and attractive in room snacks, drinks and even green apples. The bathrooms were the largest I have seen in Europe. The service was good and concierge team most helpful and informative. Apart from the rooms and service the icing on the cake is the rooftop bar called Radio. I was there every night all six nights in a row. A cool and hip bar with good snacks and great outdoor area for cigars. Crowd a bit matured but well dressed and good looking. I would highly recommend this hotel if budget is not a consideration.",5,2013,10,11
148,An amazing place to stay!,"Went to stay at this hotel on an American Express offer and what a stay it was...

Thee staff were brill and helpful, the hotel was modern and the rooms were clean, with lots of tech features! 

The hotel has several restaurants and having had dinner at their Italian restaurant, I must say that it felt like home cooked food, it was very nice and fresh.

During the evening the hotel has a roof top bar, which to my amazement there were people waiting outside the hotel to enter it, as we were guests of the hotel we were able to go up without no problem.  

When we reached the top, I understood why it's such a hot spot in London, the views from there are amazing, you can see the shard, London eye and many more places and the place was buzzing with lots of people having a good time!

However if you prefer a quiet time, the hotel also has several places which are much quieter to relax. 

Overall we had a really good time and I'm sure you will too...",5,2013,10,11
148,Amazing hotel and staff,"Stayed here for a weekend break to catch a show in London. On arrival was greeted by very friendly member of staff who brought us through to reception on the first floor to be greeted with a glass of bubbly. Hotel and room more than exceeded expect ions which were already high having read reviews. Loved the radio bar in the afternoon and the restaurant in the evening would highly recommend both. Staff throughout stay we're always very friendly and helpful without being too obtrusive - in many respects they anticipated any requests we had. Can't wait to visit again, easily the highlight of the weekend.",5,2013,10,10
148,Amazing Hotel,Amazing hotel. Very nice modern rooms. Hotel has great restaurants and an amazing roof top bar. Great hotel service. Free champagne on arrival was nice. Great place to stay for a special occasion. Only negative point is that the rooms were not very spacious but that is expected in central London. ,4,2013,10,09
148,Incredible experience!,Gorgeous four days enjoying the city and having the greatest relaxing moments the rest of the time. All new and modern decoration in a quiet atmosphere.  The kindest staff all around and the feeling of being close to paradise. Thanks a lot. Hope coming back soon,5,2013,10,09
148,Ultra Modern in great location.,"We stayed at the ME in London for a two night period.  It was a bit of a shock walking in because of the ultra modern decor.  It was the tail end of London Fashion week so there were some Cirque du Soleilish elements to the atmosphere.

The rooms were very clean and of a decent size.  It was extremely quiet.  In a great location only a couple of blocks from Covent Garden and the Theatre district.

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  In particular doorman Ignas and Concierge Ronan.  All of the staff were young and good looking.

For breakfast we went down the street to Bob's which was recommended by the hotel.

Other than than the Electro-Euro Music playing in the public areas all of the time we thoroughly  enjoyed our visit.  My husband was not pleased with the fitness centre as it was very small with no windows and the equipment was not up to par.",4,2013,10,09
148,Fashionista's dream but not practical.  Great location for theatre goers...,"Interesting hotel in a great location for accessing so many theatres.  Not the star rating it raves about but clean and comfortable.  Designed to beyond an inch of it's life, doing the hotel no real favours.  Reception on the first floor in an impressive atrium.  Glass of Prosecco welcomes all guests, a nice touch.  Find your way to your room down dark black marble corridors again a design concept not helping the guest experience.
Clean rooms with comfortable bed, sound proofed to the busy streets below.  Mood lighting and funky electrical gadgets to gain just the right ambience in the room.  Unnecessary but in keeping with the rest of this fashionable hotel.  Call me traditional but I would rather the Housekeeping team cleared the empty glasses from the day of our check in as opposed to leaving them as ornaments for 2 days. Pink mood lighting cant make up for a lack of slick service.
Styled flat screen TV flush with the wall, music for all moods and many channels, signal broken with regular interference. 
Bathroom fell apart, tap fell off drenching me with water under high pressure.  Understaffed reception very slow to take action.  A big shout out to the lovely duty manager Maggie who had to deal with an angry and soggy guest...
A lovely breakfast, attentive staff and high quality food cooked to order.
A hotel all about the design concept and lacking a quality experience.  Location superb for those after the west end buzz.",3,2013,10,08
148,"a ""wow"" in London's theater district","This boutique hotel is in a section of London that I had stayed in before, the West End-the Strand.  I did not realize what a wonderful location this is, close to so many restaurants, museums, fun shopping (Covent Garden). The food was excellent, innovative.  The Radio Bar on the roof is terrific, unless you are older and don't like the loud music, low lighting - yes, I must be getting old! ",5,2013,10,04
148,Such a disappointment and will never come back!,"We stayed here for four nights at the end of September. The location of this hotel is great and very accessible to most of the tourist hotspots in London. It's very modern decorated and stylish. However, we found that other than having a stylish decoration and trying very hard to be a top class hotel equipped with a fanciful rooftop bar, the hotel hasn't made its basic right. Most of the equipments in our room do not function properly. When we arrived on Friday, we were told that the wifi was down and will be fixed asap. The ASAP for the hotel actually meant three days later. As we were in London partially for work, having wifi really means that we can work whilst we were away. We made numerous comments to the management but they always said they are fixing it now and will be on later. What a bunch of liars ! We have to go to the nearby Starbucks to get our wifi. :(. Next, the tv in our room doesn't really work very well. It seems like it is permanently in hibernation. We have to press 'on' for at least 10 to 15 mins before it can be turned on. The worst thing is the sliding door of the shower and toilet. We are so concern that whenever we close it, it will never be opened again. There are numerous occasion that we accidentally close the door and we need to open it by great force! Thanks goodness that we haven't broken the door or caused any accident. Our room is located at first floor. During the weekend, the hotel open the bar at ground floor and it's an all night loud music until 1am. Definitely not a good idea if u r seeking a good night sleep ! Will I stay this hotel again ? Definitely not, such a flashy hotel that hasn't got its basic right. The management needs to wake up! ",2,2013,10,02
148,"brilliant staff, great bar, room was a little disappointing","Had a good time at the hotel, staff were energetic and keen to help, the roof top bar was excellent, service outstanding.

A little disappointed with the room - for a 5 star Deluxe i would have expected a bit more - TV signal on all channels kept dropping out, the bathroom doors don't close properly and the room is quite small.

That said fantastic mini bar and a small balcony.

If you can get it at the right price then not a bad stay at all.

look out for James on Concierge - brilliant",3,2013,10,02
148,Great stay but could have been better,"This is a well located hotel right in the centre of the theatre district and close to Covent Garden.  This was our second stay at this hotel and we had a very friendly welcome from Jamie the doorman.  The reception is on the first floor and we tried to check in at 12.30 but were told our room was not available, despite the booking form saying you could check in from 12.00 am.  It turns out that this is a best efforts option for the hotel so we were offered a room immediately if we upgraded for ¬£55 which we reluctantly accepted.  The upgraded room was large and spacious with a nice bathroom.  The standard rooms are just as good and have better floor to ceiling windows.  There is a hairdryer provided but nowhere to plug this in near a mirror which was very annoying.  We reported this on check out and the Front Office advised Customer Services would contact us but we are still waiting for a response.  The Radio Bar on the roof has great views and is worth a visit although the drinks are expensive.  Overall a great stay but marred by the poor Customer service on checking in and out.",4,2013,10,01
148,Fantastic,"Just wanted to say thanks to all at ME for a great experience.  My girlfriend and I had supper in Cucina Asellina last week which was fantastic.  We got a bit lost (OK, I was directing) and the girl at Reception, I think her name is Annabel (Scottish lady) was great with directions and it was good to know we were then in good hands.  Thanks to everyone - we'll be back.",4,2013,10,01
148,Anniversary,"We booked this hotel for our anniversary, our first impression was WOWL.. The interior of the hotel is fabulous.
We was greeted by JAMIE ANTANIO at the front. He was more than helpful to us and went beyond his duties to help us and explain everything to us. He has a friendly manner and more than happy to help. We couldnt check in because our room wasnt ready until 3pm, which was a little diappointing as i had requested an earlier check in time. When we could get into our room we was let down a little as we had booked a Luxury double with balcony and river view, only to find we had been put in a twin room with a balcony and city view... Maggie the Manager came up to see us which we felt was nice rather than talking to us over the phone and she explained that she had looked to move us and could not even upgrade us as the Hotel was fully booked. We was very disappointed but she then went on to say that she would compensate us by halfing the price of the room and gave us a bottle of champagne, requested that the staff made the bed into a king. This all happened very quickly and although disappointed to start with MAGGIE made the situation right . 
On another note: The DJ Radio room at the top of the hotel is a must, the views over London are spectacular and not something that you should miss.You do have to be on the list to get in so make sure you tell them on arrival.

When we was leaving the Manager of the hotel had requested too see us and apologised for the misunderstanding.
All in all if you are seeing a show nearby than this makes this hotel a must. Marks out of 10 - (10)   :)",5,2013,09,30
148,"On another level, fabulous!","Me and my partner booked to stay at ME hotel over the weeknd as it was a special birthday occasion. It caught our eye straight away when looking through where to stay in London. It looked like the sort of place we would have an amazing weekend at and it definitely lived up to our expectations. This hotel was ' on another level' by far the best hotel we've ever stayed in. We loved how modern the hotel was. From the rooms, restutants, bars and interior design. Most of all what made our stay so welcoming is how friendly every member of staff was especially 'Jamie' who welcomed us on arrival. We thoroughly enjoyed chatting to Jamie. He was their until we checked out the hotel and helped us with everything we wanted to know. He made our stay very entertaining. Overall this hotel was a 10/10 for us. We would love to stay here again in the future.   ",5,2013,09,29
148,Absolutely amazing hotel :D,"I spent a night at Me London for my 18th Birthday last night! My mum booked us in this hotel especially for the occasion that it was my birthday and my boyfriend was taking me out for a meal in London. From the minute me and my boyfriend got there, we found everything about the hotel including the staff really great. The staff at Me London are very friendly and welcoming with smiles on their faces so we felt that we were being looked after. 

Our room was immaculate. Everything in the room was very clean, including the bathroom. I was very impressed with the cleanliness as well as the overall design of the room. Very nice and contemporary.

Our breakfast in the morning was really nice too, as we only had breakfast as that was the only meal we had at Me, the food from that perspective was nice :)

I would highly recommend anyone who is thinking of staying in London to consider staying at Me London. It absolutely lives up to it's 5 star rating. I will definitely be coming back to stay.",5,2013,09,29
148,Modern 5* Hotel - Great location,"Was welcomed on arrival with a glass of champagne at midday. We couldn't check in until 3pm so left our bags with reception and headed out for a few hours. Reception staff were all really helpful and professional. When we checked in our bags were brought to our room and we were shown the room controls (aircon, mood lighting etc). 

We stayed in the Aura room, the rooms was designed beautifully although we didn't have a nice view. The bathrooms were lovely and the shower was great. The minibar was well stocked but pricey. 

We started our evening with drinks in the Radio Bar, we didn't have a reservation as it was ¬£100 minimum spend PER PERSON when we were asked if we had a reservation we said no but we are staying in the hotel so they let us up.

The bar had amazing views and the staff were really helpful. Drinks were expensive, for a cosmopolitan and a corona it came to ¬£19 including the service charge which was added. 

We then headed to STK for our dinner reservation, great food, great service. Loud and lively restaurant - would go back.

After dinner we went back to the Radio Bar. Once again the staff letting people into the bar were a little pretentious about who they let in. The Bar was really lively and busy at this time and the music was great. 

We had breakfast in the morning which was included in our room rate. Once again the service and food was really good. 

Overall we really enjoyed our stay and thought that the staff, food and design of the hotel was amazing. It does get pricey though - but I suppose that's what you pay in a 5* hotel! ",5,2013,09,29
148,Would definitely come back,"Cool Hotel, James at the entrnace was extremely both helpful and professional.  Didnt like tiny things like how I had to upgrade my room for a night just because I was checking in early. 35 pounds is nothing, its just the concept. Amazing rooftop. But seriously speaking, certain staff members like James could change an entire experience.  Personalities like these managing staff could change everything in a hotel.",4,2013,09,28
148,This is a great 5* hotel,"We booked this via secret hotels guessing it might be this and was rewarded with this very trendy ultra chic hotel.  We were fortunate enough to have a room with a balcony on the 8th floor and were rewarded with decent views towards covent garden.  The rooftop balcony is a must.  The lighting of the room is such a fun gimmick too all controlled via a touchscreen, you can control the colour (blue,green,red, yellow etc..) levels as well as intensity.  The bed was enormous. The staff were proficient and welcoming.  This hotel would appeal most to the arty types.  The rooms are double glazed significantly reducing the traffic noise outside.",5,2013,09,28
148,"Funky, arty, but 5* service?","It's true, this hotel has a wow factor in its design and is located well on the Strand however I booked it for my 40th birthday weekend for 2 nights and believe there were things which you would and wouldn't get from a real 5* experience. Check in for example was a glass of champagne in the impressive reception area but unfortunately we struggled to understand the reception lady's accent and she asked far too many sales questions which were seemingly all about up selling the room, would we like a room with a bath just an extra ¬£50.  Would we like to join a loyalty scheme. Would we like to buy and add breakfast and so on. Nothing about us, or good info for us. We were there far too long saying no to a list of sales offers and we needed the champagne to cool down as I started to sweat as it was so hot in the reception.  Then the concierge carried our bag to the room and showed us the tv remote and light switch and clearly was hanging around for a tip which was uncomfortable and badly done, there are obviously times and concierge you do tip, we didn't feel this to be one of them.  When we left our room and was waiting for the lift it opened and a porter with an empty trolley was in there and he just shrugged his shoulders at us, however I have stayed in many hotels were the staff would leave the lift to let customers in, or at least offer.  We however waited again for the next lift.  Then after our evening out at the comedy store we returned to the hotel hoping to get a glass of champagne in the downstairs bar which was empty but still had music playing and we were told the bar was closed.  I believe it was 10.55pm. I was amazed that our level all the bedroom doors were made from some form of arty black coating however the result is a lot of scratched looking walls and doors. We had stayed in a lesser hotel a few weeks before whose bar served us until the early hours and I thought that most hotels usually serve until the last person is finished? The whole hotel was badly over heated, the place was uncomfortably warm to walk around and I am usually the one upping the heating at home.  The rooms in fairness were well air conditioned however with all of their arty attention to detail they appear to have not spent on comfortable beds.  So in summary, it's not a bad hotel, not in the least, it's modern, arty and a bit different and is of a stunning design but it won't be for everyone's taste and I could have done with a bit more on the service front, a comfy bed and the ability to get a drink in the bar.  I walked away thinking that this hotel relies almost solely on its decor and roof bar, which of course was also closed when I asked. Unfortunately also when arriving back in the room we found that there was no mini bar and no tea or coffee facilities. Room was clean, roomy, funky, well lit and had a nice shower and toiletries. The white leather walls were starting to show wear and tear.",3,2013,09,27
148,Amazing cool contemporary Hotel..Rooftop bar incredible,"I'm lucky to have stayed in some of the top hotels around the world and I now rank Me Hotel London up there as one of the top 3.  The contemporary interior is stunning as you would expect from a Norman Foster Design, and the rooms and suites are a combination of beautiful soft furnishings,opulent marble bathrooms and high tech gadgets.. I particularly liked the mood lighting panel with settings like 'sexy'!!  and huge faux fur throws..  As I only live 20 minutes away from the Hotel, it was going to have to be good for me to want to spend the money to stay there.. the experience was worth every penny.

The Radio rooftop bar is the coolest place to drink great cocktails in London at the moment ( make sure you book ahead) ,and it has the best view/terrace I have seen. We also found that the STK restaurant and bar was equally good and the atmosphere was just buzzing on a Friday night.

The staff are more than helpful and I found Ray,The Director of Rooms more than helpful when I had the tiny issue regarding some lost property. It was exactly the kind of service you would expect from a top Hotel... but rarely ever get.

so.. can't think of a bad thing to say about it. Pre book the rooftop bar or you will be disappointed..",5,2013,09,26
148,Lazer show is phenom,"For a fun night out this is the hotel to stay at ,incredible service with a comp bottle of champas,scenic room opposite somerset house(perfect for gigs)&a private lazer show whenever requested,this is a v inspiring hotel&i promptly went out&bought my own lazer maschines&have rigged them up ,such fun staying here,guaranteed goodnight out.",5,2013,09,25

148,Awesome architecture and design,"Really cool hotel with service minded staff. The roof top bar is worth a drink! Great ambiance, good barkeeping and a nice view overlondon. We had to walk a bit to get to the main shopping area, but it wasn't really a problem. 
      ",4,2013,09,24
148,Stunning experience!,This hotel had it all. Stunning design & impeccable staff.  Breakfast at Cucina Asellina was fresh and bright; dinner at STK was top notch in ambiance and food.  Every night should be capped off @ the Radio roof top bar.  Perfect place for our business trip.  Would come back in an instant.,5,2013,09,22
148,INCREDIBLE! It's an experience!,"I stay at a lot of hotels around the world, and I have to say that the ME London is now at the top of my list! Iwas there for 3 days, with 7 others on an exclusive business trip rewarding some of my top clients - we were all blown away!

The moment we walked in...
Greeted with a very helpful concierge team that tagged all of our luggage and directed us to reception. The reception area is where the magic begins - very quick to check in and since Fashion Week was taking place close by, you really got that feeling (see pic).

The room...
Just magical. Beautiful modern rooms, with a wall control panel that manages all of your lighting, with special ambiances. When I left for the day and came back in the evening, you walk into a room that is playing light music with a pink aura lighting up the room behind the tv and the wall - they refer to it as ""sexy"" on the control panel.

The people...
Concierge, reception, staff at the incredible Roof Top Bar, the staff at the STK steakhouse restaurant and of course the Hotel's Manager - consistent, above expectations service from all. If you stay at this hotel - you MUST get to the roof top bar...MUST!

I can go on and on - but it was incredible. It will always be my first and only pick next time I go to London.",5,2013,09,20
148,Terrible Service,"Used this hotel for our CEO for a business trip. The service was appalling, staff weren't bothered about guests. The building itself is very nice, unfortunately that is not enough to justify the cost. No one from our business will be staying there again - too many other options in London with far superier service and at better rates.",1,2013,09,20
148,London cool for 1 night!,"My husband and I stayed here for a night back in July as we were able to benefit from a fantastic promotion.
The hotel is perfectly located within reach of Covent Garden and embankment, so you are able to stroll and enjoy the surrounding area.
When you walk into the main reception area it is quite busy but once you reach the 1st floor where the hotel reception is located you are met by a cutting edge and contemporary interior (plus a glass of champagne), it is quite amazing.
We were shown to our room and the many controls for lighting and TV, as it was extremely high tech but very minimalistic.
We did try and enjoy the Radio rooftop bar but it doesn't just serve guests of the hotel and was extremely busy so we were forced to leave and find solace at Cucina Asselina, a rustic Italian restaurant on the ground floor.
Overall we enjoyed our stay at the ME and will definitely return as it has a chic ambience and very cool design.",5,2013,09,20
148,"Perfect locale, with near Vegas style coolness factor","Three night stay with no idea about the property- Picked it as I had been pleased w/ Melia Recoleta in Buenos Aires- My what a difference! Very modern w/ 8 story open pyramid reception area, all black granite- starkly modern lighting. My room was airy, open & well lit with one of the best solutions for the floor to ceiling windows I have even seen: sliding door type panels, one opaque, one translucent- Utterly brilliant. Service was excellent- Radio Bar- a trip with a view to die for. Breakfast was wonderful, not the usual buffet. Close to the Temple tube station, Covent Garden and Theaters are close by-right on the Strand--didn't try the fitness center.",5,2013,09,19
148,Afternoon Tea is A-MAZING here,"I highly recommend the afternoon tea at the ME Hotel. It is held in the Marconi bar and offers a very modern and contemporary spin on the traditional afternoon tea. The service was flawless, friendly and the waiters knowledge regarding the different teas on offer was impressive. I followed her recommendation and was not disapointed.

The finger sandwiches were divine and the cakes all represented different iconic locations in London. They were excellently put together and were too good to eat or destruct.

Overall, it was a wonderful afternoon in a beautiful and luxurious surrounding - felt like a total celebrity and I can't wait to go back. I am going to treat my mum for her 60th birthday.......",5,2013,09,19
148,V Cool for a price.,"One night stay excellent experience start to finish. Valet parking was a dream (quite an expensive one at ¬£49). All staff were right on their game, clothing did sometimes make it difficult to be sure who was staff, but attitude of all was brilliant. Radio bar was really cool. Breakfast marvellous and all the time staff seemed to really care that I was having a good time. Have to admit to getting back to room in the evening a little the worse for wear and struggling to switch the lights off, gave up and went to sleep with them on! In the morning worked out the little blank panel by the bed was a touch screen control with an 'everything off option"" Duh.............",5,2013,09,18
148,Fantastic stay!!!,"We just got back from our 6 night stay at ME London!  We absolutely loved the hotel and every experience we had there.  We chose the ME London because we got married at a ME property back in 2009...we were sold on the ME brand.

The hotel is in a GREAT location!  We only took cabs at night when I was in high heels and preferred not to walk.  Otherwise, we walked to ALL of the tourist sites and restaurants we cared to.  

The staff is superb from the moment you arrive on property.  The smell is lovely and the decor is very modern and pleasing.  Our room was much larger than I anticipated after having read some reviews on other sites.  The bathroom was large enough for 2 of us to get ready without bumping into each other.  The lighting was awesome and all functions of the room were easy to use.

During our stay, we ate at the Italian restaurant, STK, and room service...and frequented the Radio rooftop bar mutliple times.  Everything was phenomenal.  The night/morning we ordered room service we were a bit intoxicated and forgot to hang our phone up.  The room service guy came all the way to our room to clarify one portion of our order before placing it...he was so nice about it, too!!!

The few negatives:
1)  The paint on the bedroom walls at the entry was chipped in places and some spots were just poorly painted over...wouldn't expect that from a new hotel.
2)  The hallways are SOOOOO hot!  Probably not an issue in the winter months, but during our stay we had some warm days.
3)  The shower was a bit funky.  They floor boards in the shower slide to allow the water to flow underneath to the drain.  I don't think the underneath portion gets cleaned too often as you could sometimes see yucky stuff and there was a frequent smell of fish in the shower.

That's it, though!  Everything else was excellent!  I highly recommend the ME London when visiting London!!!",4,2013,09,17
148,"Great location, leaky shower, helpful concierge, boutique hotel","Conveniently located on the Strand, 5 minutes walk from Temple metro station.
Nice rooftop and lobby bars, great steak restaurant. Didn't try breakfast nor gym.
Reception on second floor is very impressive.
Shower leaked in bathroom, had to place a towel on the floor to soak up the water every morning of my stay. Cleaning staff must have noticed it, could have called a repair man and had it fixed but nothing was done during my stay of six nights.
Generous with free water and nespresso coffee capsules.
Concierge was friendly and very helpful with printing documents and making reservations.
Nice collection of free daily newspapers and magazines in the lobby.
Staff were all friendly.
Two drinks which I did not consume were added to the bill and promptly removed when I pointed this out. Makes you wonder what the cleaning staff get up to so keep your valuables locked away!
On one occasion, I set the room temperature just the way I wanted it, only to return to the room to see that it had been reset at a very uncomfortable temperature.",3,2013,09,17
148,ME Hotel London - Great Hotel....but a few small issues,"So I booked the Me Hotel on the Strand about a week ago for a surprise for my girlfriends bday. The booking went smoothly and the hotel was kind enough to accommodate a request to have my girlfriends bday present dropped off the day before so that it would be waiting for her in the room and that way not ruin the surprise of me having to carry it.

Upon entering the hotel my initial thought was wow, this place is really amazing, from the smell of the air inside which has been scented with some sort of perfume to the design of the hotel itself, its one of the most unique hotels i've ever stayed in. The reception area is awesome with complementary champagne and a lounge area while you are waiting to check in and there is also jelly fish projected on the walls.

We were greeted by a kind and helpful receptionist who kindly upgraded the room I had booked once she knew it was my girlfriends bday which was much appreciated by me. We were told of of a ¬£20 voucher which we could use on certain items such as room service which was attached to my printed out receipt. However I think I forgot it at the reception and then never bothered to go back to get it but it would have been nice for them to have dropped it to my room given it had my name and details all over it.

We walked to our room and our bags were carried by one of the people working in the hotel. The hallways are nice and low lit and everything is dark. This is def a high end hotel and you don;t need to worry about noisey kids or chavs lol. 

Anyways we got to the room, we had a vibe room which included a seating area with couch and table and a king size bed and both a bath big enough for two people and a waterfall shower. The room was great overall and everything could be controlled from an electronic switch on the wall that was touch screen.

The hotel has i believe 2 or 3 restaurants within it, one called STK which specializes in Steak and also Cucina Asellina which also serves as the place to go for breakfast. If you order room service like we did you will be pleased to find you can order any item from any restaurant in the hotel. There is also a roof top bar which you can go to with a great view of London. Although we did not go to it this time, we probably would have, had we known that there was free welcome drinks waiting for us which we did not find out until check out as we were failed to be told on check in.

One nice touch however was that the hotel sent us up a free bottle of champagne and strawberry's. Also when you speak to the concierge it is nice for them to great you with your name straight away as they must keep track of exactly who's staying in what room which is another nice touch.

We ordered room service from Cucina Ascelina, pizza, chips and salad. The pizza was more than well sized and very nice, so were the chips and the salad so could not fault the food. It would be good if the meat or some of the meat they served was halal to fulfill the diet requirements for fellow Muslims like me. Had it been halal i would have ordered from STK. Also i;m sure they may have a lot of wealthy middle eastern customers who's dietary requirements this would also fulfill.

Now to the bad points and I will reiterate a few already mentioned:
1. Not sent the ¬£20 voucher which i forgot at reception.
2. Not told about the complementary drinks at the roof top bar until checking out.
3. Would be nice to be offered a non alcoholic option when being given complementary drinks.
4. We were on the 7th floor, one of the vanity lights in the bathroom would flicker on and off
5. The toilet lid was broken
6. One of the bathrobes smelt of toilet water or something similar
7. After taking a shower the next day there was a strong odor of the drains beneath the flooring, like a fishy smell.

Some of the above are just things which you would not expect to have to come across when paying ¬£500 a night to stay in a top new 5 star hotel.

Overall our stay was great but the few problems we had really do need addressing especially based on the price you pay for the hotel. Also they should have made a dedicated Spa inside.",4,2013,09,16
148,Afternoon Tea,"Excellent Afternoon Tea. Cold bubbly and tasty sandwiches and cakes.  The entire experience was really enjoyable, and made even nicer by the friendly, attentive staff.  I Would go back without hesitation, next time I hope to stay the night!",4,2013,09,16
148,Afternoon Tea at ME London Hotel,"Recently I visited ME for afternoon tea with my daughters.We enjoyed a very welcome glass of champagne followed by a delightful array of sandwiches, scones with jam and cream ,thee most attractive cakes depicting London landmarks.Almost too nice to eat but I do  remember not being able to resist any of it! We sipped tea which was even poured for us by a very courteous waiter.
A very sincere thank you to Darren for looking after us so attentively.

148,Fabulous hotel in great location,"Really nice ultra modern hotel.  Check in is on the first floor which is a bit bizarre, but you do get a glass of fizz for your troubles!   Fabulous room which is a pretty good size for central London.  The lighting system in a bit complicated but very funky!   The radio bar on the top floor is amazing - the views over London are fabulous.  Overall I would highly recommend.",4,2013,09,14
148,My new favourite London hotel,"The ME London is definitely my new favourite London hotel. Having recommended it many times to clients I decided to try it out for myself. 

We had an energy river room, which was lovely. View was great and balcony was perfect for our room service breakfast in the morning. 

Staff were amazing and very attentive which made the stay even more pleasant. 

Loved STK and the Radio bar (brilliant when the weather is nice). The only thing I wasn't keen on was when we had come in from a night out, we were trying to get to the lifts to our room and had to fight through the queue/mess of people waiting to be let up to the Radio bar. 

Not entirely convinced by the event space - loved the break out rooms for small meetings but not a fan of the main room with no natural daylight, it felt quite dark and enclosed. 

I'll definitely be back again soon!",5,2013,09,13
148,wheels ok at me,I use  a wheelchair  so hotels can  be a  pain not this one.We  arrived     taken up to the   check in ask if we wanted a  drink and    half check as we only wanted to drop the  bags of   so that was ok very quick   service  .  We arrived  after the  show    same   smooth service all the way back up to check it   The aurua   host then  took up   to our room wow   we were at the  front    plenty of space for me wheels  to go round the room and a sink  that was my height also the shower could  not be turn up to hot which was    great as some  folks like me  can not feel    heat .   The  aura host  showed us how it all work  those sexy  lights you could  die for at home  shame i was  with  me  care  We were at the front on the    5 floor no noise coude be heard from outside or from the     roof top bar.   We  had dinner in the STK   great service  also  easy to get in with wheels.Back to room were  we found  tv on   water by the beds and  choclate with a little note nice thought.   Breakfast next morning   was  good no you   do not  get the  full meue  but  the choice  was  fine  We had the same  swift  check out as   in.     We drop  the  bags    and hit the    covent garden  market When we got  back to  pick up  our bags we went to the radio  bar if you pick your   time you get  great views and  can  sit   with ease they even chaged me chair,5,2013,09,13
148,An excellent option!!!,"This is a great place to stay !! Everything is perfect; very well located, very good service and an overwhelming decoration.  If it had a swimming pool it would be the paradise in the heart of London. The best thing i can say about this hotel is that i will come back on my next trip to London.",5,2013,09,12
148,"Lots of style, but rather less substance","There were some nice touches.   A glass of prosecco on arrival (though described by the receptionist as champagne).   First class bathroom amenities.   Excellent giant fluffy white towels.   

But I left ME London this morning feeling strangely disappointed.  

When the service was good, it was excellent.  The doorman carried my bag to the reception on the 1st floor and talked about the weather in a way that only people living in London can do.  He was brilliant.   But then, checkout was distinctly lacking in charm.     

My room was bright, airy and had a lighting control panel that should have graced the Starship Enterprise.  But when I woke in the middle of the night, I realised there was no single switch by the bed to turn in the light. I had to negotiate the touchscreen commands and decide on a 10% lighting intensity...

The double rainfall shower was delightful.   But there was no ""power"" option.

The air conditioning in my room was perfect.  But the public areas of the hotel were stuffy and ridiculously hot.

Now, of course these are relatively minor gripes.   But this is a 5 star hotel.   It's meant to get things exactly right.   And I'm afraid it didn't.",3,2013,09,12
148,London ME Hotel,A fantastic new hotel on the London scene. The roof terrace bar/restaurant is a hugh attraction but the rest of the hotel is amazing too. Little touches like the glass of champagne on arrival and the excellent unobtrusive service differentiate the hotel. Love it and will defiantly be returning.,5,2013,09,10
148,Now that's ME,"We stayed at ME London in April this year during it's soft opening and it would be fair to say that it was a work in progress ... we returned last weekend to celebrate a birthday in a Passion Suite on the 4th floor, from the greeting at the door the swift and efficient treatment at reception (not to mention the glass of champagne to chill you down) and arrival at the room, stunning room, stunning views the overall experience puts you firmly in the mood to have a good weekend.
Try the radio rooftop bar for views and ambiance... Conclusion a great place for a chilled out weekend and I'm sure a business event as well.. We will return xx",5,2013,09,10
148,real feedback,"ok so my wife and I decided to stay here for several nights when we visited the uk ( I was returning for the first time in 13 years!!).my first concern were some of the reviews...let me put you mind to rest. We had a blast its a perfect local ,the staff were awesome and the level of service was amazing.
but me being me , read a lot of reviews and would like to address some complaints
THE ROOM IS TOO LIGHT ..Every room has an unusual window shutter system ...its really not complicated if you just look..we had no problems with this.horizontal sliding blinds!!!.
THE NIGHT CLUB IS ELITEST ,Not true it is small so there is a limit to numbers you can allow up , but at no time did we feel restricted from entry ( in fact Charlie the door man /security was awesome!!! and highly accomadating, however if you have the funds you should book a table (100 pounds per person for two hours table charge .)
We had a really good expieriance and would lolve to revisit (Hint hint!!!!)
Also I have to single out certain staff ....Claudia , diargo , Charlie , and Jimmy on the front door , if you are booked to stay here have faith ignore bad reviews and trust me ........its worth it !!!!.
The only complaint I have is that you cant cycle the lighting setting in the rooms !!! (small complaint )and the big one!!!!!.....please put a shelf for toiletries in the shower , the only problem I could fing with my stay there..... GREAT PLACE !!!!, HAVE FUN!. thank you to all the staff and management , for an awesome stay.",5,2013,09,09
148,Lovely Stay,"I booked this hotel as a birthday treat for my boyfriend and what a treat it was! We were greeted on arrival and escorted to the reception which was on the first floor and offered and glass of champagne whilst we were waiting to check in. We stayed in the mode room which were located on floors 5 - 7 (we were on floor 7). The city view from the window was lovely! The room itself was a lot bigger than I expected and it was spotless! The bathroom had a toilet, sink, a 2 person bath and a seperate rain shower (which was lovely)! The only thing i noticed was there was not a normal socket for a hairdryer, etc in the bathroom where the mirror was but it wasn't a big deal. We also had a few glitches with the tv jumping but we were going to sleep anyway so it didn't really bother us. We went to see The Lion King at Lyceum Theatre that evening which was literally across the road! If you want to go to the radio rooftop bar then you have to go up via a seperate lift located on the ground floor. We were told to que outside by a lady waiting at the lift and the que was pretty big already and it was only 7pm so we went back through to the staff at the main entrance and enquired about going up there for a drink after the theatre and he said you probably won't be able to as it will be fully booked out tonight, as soon as I asked even if we are guests of the hotel he immediately asked for our room number and said ill put you on the list which was great. When we returned we were shown round to the seperate lift and escorted up there :) The views were absolutely fantastic and it had a really good vibe! The drinks were fairly expensive but it is a 5* hotel afterall so what do you expect. We only had the one drink and decided to call it a night and ordered room service. We waited no more than 15 minutes and the food was lovely! The evening turndown service was a nice touch, the mood lighting had been turned on and we had dressing gowns and chocolates on the bed. We didnt eat in any of the restaurants as we were tight on time but im sure they were just as nice as the food we ordered. Covent garden was about a 5 minute walk away and kings cross is about half hour. The staff were very friendly and could not help you enough. Overall we had a really nice stay and we would definately return! ",5,2013,09,09
148,Lovely and memorable,"Wow! This is a beautiful hotel , so stylish, so modern and very memorable. Certainly one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The staff were perfect, welcoming, relaxed, knowledgeable and helpful. The rooms were well designed and spacious. I would return to this hotel and look forward to it in a flash. 
A couple of small things would have been helpful during our stay. Some hotel information in the room, eg concierge number, restaurant number, opening times and menu perhaps. Further details of the other facilities available. I think the hotel had more to offer but I just was not aware of what was available. That was a shame as we need up going elsewhere for food and drinks etc. 
Nevertheless I loved this hotel, but more info in the room please.",5,2013,09,08
148,Brilliant,"Went to the new ME Hotel a couple of weeks ago with my partner and loved every minute. Very friendly staff, beautiful design and probably the coolest hotel in the capital at the moment. We arrived on a Friday and spent the whole weekend as a treat to celebrate my partners new job. The lobby bar downstairs was very relaxing with a beautiful design, but not quite as amazing the the checkin area... WOW! We were also given a glass of champagne as a welcome treat, which formed the perfect experience. Our room was on the 5th floor, good size, plenty of light and amazing bathroom with double shower which was interesting. We went to the rooftop bar on the Friday evening but it was very busy so decided to return on the Sunday afternoon when it was a little quieter - maybe not! There was however a brilliant atmosphere and we enjoyed it immensely, especially with the warm autumn sun shining and views of the river, what a treat.
The evening turndown service was very special, loved the 'sexy light' and the little cards they put on your bed with famous artist quotes, very different. Breakfast was good, although quite busy, but again, we probably just went at the wrong time. 
All in all a great experience, different from any other hotel I've stayed at.  I would use the word special to describe it.",5,2013,09,08
148,Sweat box,"I stayed at the ME hotel in August.  When I arrived, I went to the desk on the ground floor (I waited in a queue for 10mins).  I was told that it was concierge and the checkin was on 1st floor.  Nothing was signposted.  Waste of my time.  I then proceeded to 1st floor checkin where I had to queue for 15-20mins.  The room had no ventilation and it was one giant sweat box.  Staff were unfriendly and did not acknowledge the wait time.  

Lifts were rediculously slow as 1 out of 3 lifts was assigned to radio rooftop bar. 

Rooms didn't have air con on when we arrived.  We called for someone to help us switch it on and they couldn't figure it out.

I emailed hotel to say I was unhappy with my experience and they didn't even bother to reply....says it all really.

Oh and that radio rooftop bar, we weren't allowed in unless we paid ¬£100 per person for a table.

Save you money and go elsewhere.

Only positive is stk.  I would go back for the restaurant only next time.",2,2013,09,06
148,Lovely anniversary stay,"What I would call a ""modern 5 star"" - so not a grand hotel in the traditional sense but set itself as a modern classic. Really interesting use of space, beautiful atrium ,champagne on check in, very attentive service. Lovely friendly staff, didn't eat in but the roof terrace is fabulous - great cocktails and tapas. Lovely rooms with some really nice touches: lights,sound system. They found out it was our anniversary as flowers were being delivered - "" happy anniversary"" on check in and bottle of bubbly in room. Don't like aircon  prefer opening windows but it actually worked! Great service from getting out of cab on arrival to getting in cab on way home - top job guys!!",5,2013,09,05
148,Afternoon Tea was Immense,"Having been to many London venues for afternoon tea, this is probably one of the best. 

From the minute we arrived Darren and his team made us feel so welcome, a charming table with champagne on arrival was just what we needed. The selection of teas we were offered and the personal recommendations made us want to try them all, the selection of sandwiches, cakes and scones were aplenty with some modern twists on classic afternoon tea dishes. I would have no issues in recommending this to everyone I know. well done to Darren and his Team",5,2013,09,05
148,excellent stay,stayed one night at this hotel good service nice food friendley staff roof bar well worth a look hotel has good location covent garden and theartres views from the roof bar are better than the london eye,5,2013,09,04
148,LocationLocationLocation Plus 6Star Service,"We recently spent 5 nights at this exciting hotel and it is a real winner
The staff are well trained and very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful.
The rooms are very sexy and comfortable and the a/c worked very well in the summer like
Weather London was having
The location can't be best for touring most of the attractions and the West End theaters.
Turn down service at night is also very nice with the sexy lighting and candies on the bed
We had breakfast 4 of the mornings and although it was good if you have the included breakfast
There aren't a lot of choices in the menue.
Our waitress Marie was wonderful 
We did go up to see the Roof Top Bar and even took our guests with us.The staff  was very 
accommadating .Even though we are seniors we did not feel any resistance
The hotel is pricey but treat yourself to a real exciting life experience",5,2013,09,03
148,"Not for ""ME""","The best part about ME is the location - everything else has all the drawbacks of typical European hotels - rooms too small, overpriced, limited room service options. But at least it forces you to go out and explore ....",3,2013,09,03
148,EXCELLENT hospitality,"i loved ME LONDON.. we stayed there for 10 days, amazing service, great people working there.. everyone was smiling and ready to help out and give directions.. breakfast was great.. and beds were super comfortable. i would absoultely recommend this hotel for couples, even families!",5,2013,09,03
148,Almost Perfect,"I've stayed at the MR Hotel twice - once in April and then again the week before last. It has improved so much in that time that I can confidently give it a 5* review. The room was lovely - spotlessly clean and had a giant marshmallow bed which may be the comfiest I've ever slept in. The staff at the reception desk were lovely, particularly the Scottish lady who let us check in and go up to our room several hours early. 

All of the staff were attentive and polite but not intrusive at all. We had a free breakfast in the hotel restaurant every day which was huge and also delicious - I recommend the full English. The only think I didn't like was the melon scented air freshener in the corridors, but that's my own personal preference!

The location is flawless and perfect for strolling along Embankment, heading out to Soho or getting to any part of London.",5,2013,09,02
148,An amazing weekend,"Spent the weekend with my daughter at the 'Me'. On arrival the staff were very friendly and welcoming,while being super efficient too. We had a room on the 5th floor overlooking Drury Lane with no  traffic noise whatsoever. Utra modern room,an amazingly comfy bed,large double shower,well stocked mini bar, and a Nespresso machine that we used straight away. The Italian restaurant was excellent.  the food, atmosphere and service was superb.  Being guests at the  hotel we were given priority to the Radio Rooftop which is very popular with the London incrowd, you can see why because the views are amazing with a great atmosphere.  Saturday morning we had breakfast off the menu, I can highly recommend poached eggs and avocado on toast.  The hotel overall was fantastic, location perfect, restaurants fab, atmosphere and friendly staff were superb what more can I say.",5,2013,09,02
148,Amazing afternoon tea!,"Brought my friend for afternoon tea for her birthday and we weren't disappointed! Gorgeous setting, lovely staff and amazing cakes! You get a 3-tiered stand...each! The bottom two are fab sandwiches and scones, but the top had the added surprise, that the cakes were in the shape of London landmarks, really impressive! My mouth's still watering thinking about the Shard Opera Cake. And the Big Ben Battenburg was great (even though I normally hate battenburg). Can't wait to go back!",5,2013,09,02
148,ME loves it!,"I recently stayed at the ME in London with my fiancee. We were there for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed our time. It's location is impeccable - easy walking distance to a number of the major tourist sights around Trafalgar Square and a 5-minute walk to the Temple tube station so that you can get everywhere else. The rooms were clean, breakfast was included which was a huge money saver for an expensive city, and it's a cool destination in and of itself with the Radio Rooftop Bar. It's a 5-star property so it is not a place for travelers who are on a low budget, but the value you get in return is certainly worth it so I would definitely recommend it!",5,2013,09,02
148,A perfect match,"The ME attracted our attention by its modern design that we like and is even more overwhelming in the real. Absolutely stunning. The standard room was certainly a 5 star one, including nespresso machine, well filled (mini)bar and spheric lightning to get you in a zen mood. After reading previous comments on the access to the Radio rooftop bar we were a bit afraid this would spoil the moment, but on the contrary it proofed to be a great experience. The Hotel certainly learned from its critics. On friday night it is a ""hot spot"" for many in London, but as hotel guests, we did get priority access and an outside table. And that even after our name did not apear on the reservation list, despite we've asked for it during the afternoon.
Leaving the whole rooftop access controverse behind: the view is stunning, the staff very friendly and the Singapore lobster heavenly!
Put this in the mix with a great location nearby Covent Garden and the city centre and you have a perfect match for a great weekend in London.",4,2013,09,01
148,amazing hotel and staff,"I was looking for a modern hotel in London as I'm not a fan of the old musty hotels that make up the bulk of downtown London.  The ME appears to have been built a year ago or so and it looks like it.  VERY modern and euro sheikh.  When I showed up the entry staff was very helpful and got me up to the first floor where the check in is.  I got into the check in area and a glass of champagne appeared in my hands (a good start).  I got to the room and it was larger than your average London downtown room with this modern hotel which again made me really like it.  The location is on 'the strand' which is very convenient as I was able to walk almost everywhere.  I can't stress enough just how cool this hotel looks and feels.  Very very good.

The only downside to this property and why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was that one of the reasons I booked this hotel was so I could utilize the bar at the top.  I like to grab a drink and surf the net with my ipad before I hit the sack and I booked this hotel specifically so I could use the bar up top to do just that with a great view and good atmosphere.  Unfortunately despite showing them my room key and them knowing I was staying there, 2 of the 4 nights I was there I was refused entry and told to go wait in the lounge for a spot.  Apparently being a hotel guest doesn't entitle you to use the hotel radio bar.  They don't seem to save spots for hotel guests.",4,2013,08,31
148,The best hotel experience ever!,"From start to finish the whole experience was magnificent. The reception was most welcoming and service exemplary throughout our stay. I would recommend this hotel to anybody. If you want five star accommodation and amazing bars and restaurants then this is the place to be in London. The food was excellent! Champagne on arrival, perfect. The afternoon tea is exceptional. 
Radio is the best roof top bar in London, the view is something to be hold and surprisingly reasonably priced. 

The steak restaurant, STK, was phenomenal and the Italian on site superb. With location, food and room taken into account it is the best hotel in London by far. The continental breakfast is amazing by the way!
",5,2013,08,31
148,Perfect!,"We arrived very early in the morning from Australia and fully expected to drop our bags and walk the streets until check-in time.....early check-in - no problem!
Professional and super friendly staff.....any request - no problem!
The room was gorgeous - double shower, balcony, cool lighting, Nespresso coffee machine, the list goes on...
Perfect location for Covent Garden Theatres and shops.....
Having read previous reviews re the noise we were a little concerned, however we were on the 8th floor and could not hear a thing!
If you want a quaint and dusty old fashioned English hotel then ME is not for you,

We are in love with this hotel and ME will be where we stay in London from now on......",5,2013,08,30
148,My new fav hotel in London!,"Had a lovely stay there in May. Everything was perfect! You feel special but at the same time you are in a cool and relaxed atmosphere. The staff is always here on the ready but you just don't see them and that's great!
Everything is beautiful and well designed inside the hotel.
We had a room with balcony and it was fantastic! Not to mention the bar on the roof top!
What a view!
I am eager to come back and also to try the restaurant!",5,2013,08,29
148,Romantic in the Heart of London,"It was a cosmopolitan hotel with excellent service. Decor and gadets as expected. Surprise at no bath tub - only a wet room. Room was spacious, even with an extra bed for my son. Hall ways were very dark - a little off putting for a family, but can see it being atmospheric for a couple.
Stayed a Thursday night - was very noisey into the small hours. Probably 2am till it was all quiet. I would suggest asking for a higher floor (I was on 3rd).
Location is unbeatable - Covent Garden on your doorstep. A short walk from any where. Friendly staff.",4,2013,08,28
148,Star Port London,"There is lots to like to like about this dramatically stylish London, hot spot, hotel. we stayed for three days at the weekend. From the moment we stepped through over the threshold the concierge staff on the ground floor were pleasant and extremely helpful. This is useful as this is not a run of the mill hotel.
The decor is dramatic, lots of black marble and very subdued diffused lighting. The check-in is on the first floor and was quick and efficient, we even got an upgrade. Up to the room , again this was modern and minimalist but large and comfortable. The bed was terrific, large and firm which provided a good nights sleep. The lighting was controlled from a bedside touch screen control. There was a night light in the bathroom but as the room itself had sliding glass doors it allowed too much light into the bedroom to be useable. There are not enough drawers in the room and the ones that are there do not have sides or a back - style over substance.
The Radio roof bar is a very nice feature, well laid out with some terrific views over the splendid London skyline. We had a coffee when we first arrived on Thursday lunchtime; the coffee was overpriced but the view made up for it. We did think of having a bite for lunch but as every table in the bar was marked reserved, even though the vast majority were empty, we gave it a miss. We returned on Friday night and had a splendid couple of hours. The bar was busy and vibrant. It attracted a very smart mostly young crowd, the music was cool and we had a super time.  We tried to repeat the experience on Saturday but were effectively excluded by the DJ who had drum and bass at club volume. Not for the faint hearted or anyone much over twenty five (aka, most of the hotel guests).
We checked out the restaurants but did not eat there. The Italian looked okay, we did try to book the STK at 9pm Saturday night, were originally told we could get in for 9.30 but then we were called and told it would be 10 and when i want down to query this, it had moved to 10.30, so we did not bother. Incidentally when we retired around 11.45pm in our third floor room, we could still hear the thumping drum and bass from the STK so probably a happy cancellation.
We also had a drink in the lobby bar, nice bar but when we were there , Thursday 7pm, it was a bit business suits are us.
Taken as a whole this is a very smart hotel, well worth the visit. The hotel is new and is not quite worked up to a smooth running ship. It has some issues to sort out - is it a hotel or a nightclub? However give it a go, it's an experience and mostly a good one.",4,2013,08,28
148,"Cool, central, with a top-notch view from roof bar","My wife and I spent a weekend at Me London as a surprise birthday present in early August. It's an unabashedly modern hotel focused very firmly at the cooler, probably younger traveler. The public areas are very much style over comfort, though that's not to say they're uncomfortable! The reception is probably the most memorable space: a large triangular hall that extends to the roof in a pyramid shape. The downstairs lounge is a relaxed, peaceful area, even though it's the main entrance; because the entrance to the hotel is such a discreet one, there's no sense of a busy thoroughfare, just a quiet passageway, so you aren't interrupted from your morning coffee.
The rooms are contemporary in design, but very comfortable. Our bed was comfortable though the pillows were disappointingly firm. Shower was excellent and facilities couldn't be faulted - I won't criticise a room that has a Nespresso machine!
Despite being at the centre of some of the busiest roads in London, the soundproofing is more than adequate. Some of the touches (sliding panels of opaque glass rather than curtains) are probably unnecessary, but clearly they're part of the design ethic.
The detailing is sometimes a little hit-and-miss: it sometimes feels like the hotel was finished in a bit of a rush, and not enough attention was paid to the fit and finish of some elements. We found manufacturers' stickers still affixed to the sliding ""curtain"" panels, and the taps (faucets) in the bathroom weren't straight, but everything worked at the very least.
We sampled the Italian restaurant which was excellent, with friendly service, and the achingly cool rooftop bar. The bar was by far the busiest part of the hotel, populated by the brightest of the bright young things, and if I was 20 years younger it would definitely be a place to go. Cocktails were excellent, and the view over the riverside was terrific. You can look down on the crowds watching the open air cinema at Somerset House and the panorama over south and central London is quite something.
Me London would work very well as a business hotel - its central location is perfect, and as a tourist hotel it might not be quite family-friendly (or budget) enough, but it's certainly one to try out if you're feeling flush, or if someone else is paying!",4,2013,08,27
148,Afternoon tea a real treat,"Went to the ME for afternoon tea. Had a wonderful time. Overseen by Darren, we started off with an array of teas to choose from, explained by the helpful staff. A glass of champagne was a great way to help us decide! Then out came the offerings. A three tiered cake stand (EACH) with cute sandwiches on the bottom, two scones on the middle, and cakes on the top (I'll get back to them!). Sandwiches were lovely but not too heavy given that we had another two tiers to get through. Again the scones, not too big, but with jam and cream, very tasty. Then onto the delightful top tier. I shouldn't spoil the surprise, suffice to say that there was a generous helping of famous landmarks cleverly crafted into the most delicious of desserts. All this food coupled with a friendly environment, helpful staff, and fabulous designer setting made this an unforgettable experience, I would thoroughly recommend it to all!",5,2013,08,27
148,A new London experience making its mark,"To take on an iconic structure, designed by Foster & Partners, a statement building in the centre of London and deliver a hotel experience demands much from the hoteliers. Melia have risen to this challenge and are finding their feet in this wonderful building, adding their hotel experience to the architects, and builders.

This was the second time we had stayed in the ME, and it is certainly a hotel that delivers more each time you stay. The arrival, complete with Prosecco, was faultless. The room offered the latest in technological innovation - possibly requiring a little more explanation than that offered, and comfort, together with human service at the touch of a button.

Breakfast offered a wide range of options, served in the peace and calm of the restaurant, while the usual morning chaos reigned outside on Aldwych, and without having to fight other guests at a buffet table.

We were lucky enough to experience the much heralded top floor, Radio Bar, with its inside and out, views over London, on a sunny Sunday morning before anyone else arrived - an experience we can highly recommend - just like the whole stay. 

We look forward to coming back!",5,2013,08,27
148,"A special afternoon tea on Thursday August 22, 2013","Afternoon tea is always special, but the one that awaited us at ME London was really amazing: the selection of teas is what most impressed me to begin with, but the actual infusion and perfect presentation of the tea just made my day: no tea bags, no strainers, just a perfectly brewed pot of piping hot tea - irresistible. Naturally, the tastefully presented sandwiches, with interesting fillings and the fresh scones with lashings of cream and jam were delicious. The cakes too were a wonderful surprise - lined up were Big Ben, The Shard and the London Eye! 10 out of 10 for creativity. The staff did a wonderful job. Hospitality was high on their agenda. We got to meet Darren, General Manager Events and Banqueting. So all in all, I would definitely recommend TEA at ME! Enjoy - I did.",5,2013,08,27
148,romantic night in the city,"Last friday 23rd Aug , decided to surprise my wife and take her away for the eveing to the West End of London. Having loads of building work done in our house so thought it would be good to get away from all the inevitable dust and mess as we were beginning to get a little stressed.
i had heard of the ME and looked it up online and decided to book. 
The rooms may look a little small in the pictures but they are well proportioned and very cool with mood lighting and all the usual AV equipment etc We also had a small balcony overlooking the Strand.
The plan was to eat early in the STK restaurant downstairs and wander into town and find a few bars suitable for us slightly older folk ( who still think they are 30). Well that never happened as the STK was buzzing with great music and friendly people , we ended drinking cocktails there after our meal with a couple of barristers. Fantastic !!! 
I then arraged for a table upstairs at the Radio bar where we took our new found friends and continued to sip cocktails into the early hours before retiring back to our sumptious and dare I say it ""sexy"" room.
In short we had an absolutely wonderful time , mixed with some very friendly people and didn't have to even venture outside the front door. Highly recommended.
P.S. Chaps , definately one to impress the ladies even if you don't stay there.",5,2013,08,27
148,Wonderful stay!,"We stayed here for our Wedding Anniversary courtesy of Amex.  After a day out in London (Lunch at the Maze Grill and then a pub crawl through the West End) it was wonderful to spend the evening at ME.  It is a fantastic hotel, great location, very modern, beautifully designed and very oh so trendy.  The rooms are a little small and yet again no bath only a shower (which is a pet hate of mine), but they really are minor points.  We spent the evening at the Rooftop bar and watched the sun set over London on a beautiful summer evening while knocking back a few bottles of Rose.  (We even saw a UFO, but hey it could have been the wine!!).  A great hotel, great stay and highly recommended if you want a fun night out in London.",5,2013,08,26
148,Long weekend in London,"We stayed at the ME for a long weekend. It's very contemporary in style, very self-consciously cool. 
The concierge and reception staff were very helpful and professional throughout; in fact, al the staff we encountered were. 
The room echoes the rest of the hotel. When we booked in, we were told that we had been upgraded but from what to what was left as a mystery. The room was fine and well appointed.

We went up to the rooftop bar on Friday night and had a great time soaking up the atmosphere and enjoying the experience. We were told by some non-hotel guests that people were queuing up outside to get in but we just walked from one lift to the other and went straight up, identifying ourslves as hotel guests.  The dress code was smart - fine by us - and it was basically a very pleasant way to start your night out.
We also went up to the bar on Saturday night - accessed again with no problem - but found the atmosphere to be very different and not as much to our liking. The brunch had been on and there was a few bouncers floating about. Music was very loud, there were a few people the worse for wear and the atmosphere seemed more trashy. 
Good experience though, and I wouldn't have missed it.

We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on that but I was surprised that I could hear the music from STK into the early hours. We were on the third floor. This could perhaps do with sorting out.",4,2013,08,26
148,Great place to celebrate a birthday!,"A great two night stay to celebrate my birthday.  We used the Amex complimentary room for one night and we probably wouldn't have chosen this particular hotel without it. 

Location:  Absolutely perfect! Right opposite the Waldorf Hotel and also opposite the theatre where Mamma Mia is.  A few minutes walk to Covent Garden and at the end of the Strand.  Really an excellent location.

Lobby:  Cool and elegant from the hot sunshine outside.  We arrived early in the morning and the staff kindly took our luggage and when we arrived later, they took us up to Reception on the first floor.  The bar area was pleasant, hidden behind some large chrome designs, but noisy in the evening and very busy.  There was also a really strange smell, like cucumbers.  Couldn't really decide if we liked it or not!

Lifts:  There are lifts to bedrooms that require key cards.  You then have to come down to Ground floor to change lifts to get up to the Radio Bar.

Reception:  Being on the inside of a pyramid, we were greeted with Champagne, which was very welcome prior to checking in.  Easy check-in process.  We were not shown to our room which I was told afterwards that we should have been.  

Bedroom:  The corridor to the bedrooms is the outside of the pyramid, all very black but actually rather nice.  The bedroom was modern, elegant, had an interesting window with pleasant views and was also really quiet  - we couldn't hear any traffic noise below us.  We were welcomed with a bottle of wine which was a pleasant touch. The room is rather minimalist but that was fine. A few niggling things in our particular room, my dress was too long for the wardrobe, the few drawers that there were didn't have any sides or back to them, so clothes fell out.  The only place to use the hairdryer was by a table (probably used for a computer) and the lighting was really dull and poor.  The only place to put on make-up was by the mirror above the sinks.  Loved the mini bar selection, the nibbles and the stay awake kit - really nice touch.  The bed was very comfy too.  We were on the 4th floor and heard no noise.

Breakfast:  Good service, food was excellent but did feel that there was quite a few business meetings taking place around us.  Really loved the fact that you could have breakfast late - up to 10.30am.  Would have been even better, if hotel guests could be able to use the Radio Bar for breakfast - it's such a stunning location and would be perfect for a relaxing breakfast away from business meetings.

Radio Bar:  The days that we stayed, London was 30C - a really lovely hot summers evening, and the bar was crowded and certainly seemed to be 'the place to be'.  We were unable to sit outside and sat with friends on the inside.  I did feel that at the time that hotel guests appeared to be being treated less favourably than non-hotel guest who were there for the evening and willing to spend the ¬£100 per person per table and therefore got to sit outside.  Having complained to the Management, I was advised that unless there is a special event, guests do take priority at the moment.  Drink prices were pretty standard for this kind of venue.

Staff:  Everyone was so helpful and friendly - couldn't fault them at all.  Management response was prompt too.

Value:  Paying standard rack rate - it is expensive and there are some other excellent hotels in London that do have a pool and spa. 

Based on its location and its staff, it may well be a hotel to return to in future.",4,2013,08,25
148,Perfect for a sexy night out,"The Hotel is in the theatre area and we really enjoyed to have a vibrant night life around us.The spacious room is equipped with a ""stay awake kit"" to add pleasure to intimate moments and lights have the ""sexy mode"" settings.So this is a perfect place to show off and have a sexy night out: come here, go to theatre (10min walk, she can do it even with stilettos), come back in one of the 3 hotel's restaurant and after a good bottle of wine (I've appreciated the one I had) go straight in the room and ""Boom Boom"" until morning come.Now the bad part: despite the beauty of the room and the locations there're small things to fix.Our toilet had such a strong flush that a lot of water ends on the floor is neither hygienic nor nice to see.They also had a multimedia centre you can use to connect your devices to listen your music from the room's speakers but the USB port and Bluetooth didn't work.I told all of these to the manager and they will fix it but in the meanwhile I have to stand it.In general despite the price (a little bit to much) I'd come back to spice up a wonderful night",4,2013,08,24
148,Terrible Service,"I am currently staying in this hotel. Lobby staff, reception staff were amazing. However, the Radio bar and elevator girl are dreadful. The latter couldn't drag herself away from conversation. Upon reaching the radio bar, I was greeted by a blonde lady who obviously thought I was unworthy. Which is interesting given she was dressed like a hooker. No one bothered to offer service and tables were all busy with the ""friends and hanger on's"" of the staff. It is a shame that such a beautiful hotel is let down by what should be its greatest asset. I feel sorry for non Radio Bar staff as they must hear this all the time! ",3,2013,08,24
148,"Ultra-modern, cold and pretentious!","The entrance to this hotel is not welcoming, despite the efforts of trendy young men at the door. The reception area is on the first floor, not on the ground floor as one enters -most odd. Although the atrium-marble reception is spectacular, it is also not inviting and  lacks ventilation.  We stayed on the 7th floor and the corridors are dark and black because of the carpets and walls and modern lighting - struggled to see where to put in our key.  The bedroom had all the modern gadgets one could wish for, but no paintings, splash of colour or any warmth! Also, the room was quite small with no welcome/information brochure.   The shower and bathroom were lovely, but not soundproof as it's all 'glass' partitions. The rooftop bar is stunning, but access is only in 1 lift and we were almost accosted by another trendy young man when we wanted to go up.  Good location, expensive for what you get - a cold, rather impersonal stay.",3,2013,08,24
148,Do not stay here,"I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and tried all of their bars and restaurants. To start, they did not get my reservation correct and then said that I had to upgrade to a more expensive room type for the additional night that was not on the booking. I arrived at the hotel and a man in a casual jumper/sweater asked to take my bag. Not only did he look like a member of the public, he did not explain that he worked for the hotel immediately, resulting in a strange conversation exchange while I was trying to figure out if I was about to have my bag stolen or have it taken to my room - very strange uniform for this type of role. Once I got to reception (which is located in a strange place on the first floor with a melon smell everywhere) the receptionist was not welcoming (considering this is not an inexpensive hotel to stay in) and I had to get her to double check that the billing had been set up correctly, as she was about to charge my credit card unnecessarily.  Service was terrible and like that I would expect in a 2 star hotel, if that. Once in my room my telephone in the bedroom did not work and the white walls were full of scuff marks. The marble floor in the bathroom looked like it had never been cleaned and had circular stains in the polish. 

I tried the laundry service and they lost an expensive tshirt, even thoug it had been ticked on the laundry form to show it had been received and delivered. Thankfully it turned up - with no apology the following night. 

We also tried the radio bar on the top floor. Again, terrible service and rude staff - no eye contact and unfriendly, cold service. Would not go back there in a million years. 

On my final evening I returned to the hotel after being in the office all day to find my key did not work. After all of the fuss about correcting my reservation I was told that I had no reservation and that I now had to pay ¬£20 per hour for every hour that I had overran check out time (which is 12pm) - it was now 6pm meaning a ¬£120 bill!!  The woman that explained this was incredibly rude. I was in a full suit and had two large bags with me. She told me I had to pay the additional charge or find somewhere else to stay for the night. I was hot and sweaty at this stage and was not offered a seat or even a glass of water (which you would expect being a ""luxury hotel""). I was not allowed to retrieve my things from the room and was continuously told ""no you can't do that - you don't have a reservation"". Eventually after asking if I could use the hotel phone as I could not get signal (and wifi in the hotel is also terrible) I contacted my office who confirmed a restating had been made - but the hotel had not actually made the reservation!! After no apology for the mistake I got back into my room - an hour later!!!  Just terrible, insensitive service with no respect for what was being paid per night to stay there. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and would at all cost never stay here again. There are some great luxury hotels around here - definitely a lot better than this be and worth what you pay for them - unlike this ""hotel"".",1,2013,08,24
148,Ugh.,"Lovely hotel. Clean. Issues - horrible piped in melon smell in hallways. Disgusting, headache instigating, nasty smell. Not isolated to our preferences - ran into other guests with same complaint. No privacy in room - don't stay here on a romantic night as your partner will hear all your bathroom activities. Business travelers - Internet service is horrific. Concierge also acknowledged issues.  ",3,2013,08,19
148,Fantastic bar .Had amazing time!!,"Went to the radio bar to celebrate my friends 40th birthday and after reading the reviews was dreading what the outcome could have been.
But so surprised , yes it has an exclusive feel and why not its amazing but after the terrible reviews i read the staff could not have been more pleasant from the charming doormen who greeted us to the hostess , the managers walking the floor to one of the best bar girls I have ever been served by in london(Adriana who was just fantastic friendly and charming ) we had one of the best nights in London I have had for ages in a bar with great music , crowd and views and we have tried a lot of places.
The fact that it doesn't let all and sundry in made it feel even more special ,we are not millionaires or models but were made to feel like them in this amazing rooftop space, so much so we arrived at 6pm left at 3am so there doing something right.
I would definatley go again and would recommend it as an amazing venue for a night out .",5,2013,08,19
148,A unique experience!,"I was offered a free night at this hotel through American Express. I was a bit wary prior to my stay, after reading of a number of bad reviews (although most of those related to the rooftop bar rather than the hotel itself). Upon arrival at the hotel, we were escorted by a member of concierge to the reception area, which is one floor up. Complimentary champagne was provided while we waited for check-in. Once at the desk, we were given a friendly greeting and told we were being upgraded to a suite. Not a bad start, especially since the room was free to begin with!

The same member of concierge waited with us throughout check-in and then escorted us up to our ‚ÄòChic Suite‚Äô, which was on the third floor at the far end of the corridor. The suite was a very impressive area, with separate lounge and bedroom. I loved several design features, such as the leather lined walls and integrated TVs. There were digital panels at various places around the room from which you could control the lighting (including a choice of colours) and climate control. These were pretty self-intuitive, with an interface akin to a smartphone. There were some unusual accessories in the room, such as a very thick fur blanket near the sofa, and a hair straightener in the bathroom. The bathroom was long and narrow, with a little sitting area where women could apply their make-up, a double-headed shower, oversized bathtub and double basins. The toilet had a separate enclosure, which included a third basin. Even the minibar bar had an unusual assortment of food/drink items, and other non-food such as a ‚Äòhangover kit‚Äô as well as a goodie bag for those feeling amorous!!

We later visited the famed rooftop bar, for which there is a separate elevator, flanked by bouncers. All we were asked was whether we were residents, and upon confirming this, we were immediately sent up. There was no mention of reservations and/or minimum spends. This was a truly incredible bar (see separate review), and I can understand why access is so restricted, although I think it unfair that some hotel guests have failed to get access.

In response to the various negative comments I have seen about this hotel:

1) Service ‚Äì we received nothing but exemplary service throughout our stay (including at the rooftop bar). Everyone was polite and welcoming. We only made one request from the room (for an iron), which was dealt with very promptly. My only negative comment would be that the reception desk could do with another 1 or 2 members of staff (there are only 2 counters, and on checking out one of these was unmanned, resulting in a modest queue).

2) Noise ‚Äì it is true that the rooftop bar was playing music at a high volume, and I imagine this would have been audible in some rooms. In our room we heard no noise whatsoever, either from within the hotel or from outside (but note we were out at night, and didn‚Äôt return to the room until after 2am). I would suggest asking for a room in a middle floor of the hotel (as the music was fairly loud from the ground floor STK restaurant as well). Also ask for a room furthest away from the lift, as this will result in less foot traffic outside.

3) Design features ‚Äì I personally loved the dark, scented corridors, and had no problems with lighting in the room, etc. In fact, all major areas of the hotel (lobby, reception, etc) had a nice design which really appealed to my tastes. It was all very modern and trendy. There was the odd fault here and there (such as our room door and bathroom door scraping along the ground ‚Äì strange, given the hotel is only 5 months old!), but nothing to write home about.

To sum up, I think this hotel  would really appeal to certain tastes, but it certainly is not for everyone. Do your research and look at the pictures before you go to give you an idea of what to expect. Perhaps we were lucky with how things turned out on this very short stay, but I am already planning when to return here (even though I live in London). I would have happily paid the rack rate for this type of experience!",5,2013,08,19
148,"Love it, but...","I just completed my second stay at ME London. I am in London every 6 to 8 weeks and I have given up on the Hilton brand in the UK. Seeing ME open opposite the Hilton Waldorf I decided to give it a try and I have been so far very happy with the experience. The rooms are awesome - very well appointed and nicely sized for the London market. It definitely has a Gansevoort or Standard feel. A ""sexy"" button on the light switch is a nice touch. Expect to pay ¬£300 to ¬£500 a night for a nice room. I was upgraded to a suite this trip which was excellent. French champagne on arrival and really friendly staff is a plus. 

Now for the negative. The One Group is operating the STK and rooftop (Radio) bar at ME. STK is good, food menu is almost identical to other restaurants and I have not had an issue getting a reservation. However operating a swank lounge in a hotel is complex and requires some thought. Hotel guests should never be made to feel like they are inferior to the clientele attending the lounge. On several occasions I was asked if I was going to the lounge - said ""no"" - and was then told I would need to use another elevator. The doormen have not seemed to fully grasp how elevators work and I literally spent minutes each time waiting to get an elevator that would take me to my room. On Monday night it good to such a point of absurdity I totally lost it. Anyway the interference of the rooftop lounge in my accommodation experience has had me rethinking visiting ME again. Other that that I would recommend it.",4,2013,08,19
148,Luxurious but pricey,"I was only in this hotel for a few hours and found this to be a comfortable and luxurious experience. I loved the toiletries, bath robe, very comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, the view and the midday checkout. I was disappointed that I twice had to phone reception to ask for a toothbrush. Following the second call, someone did arrive with one but after 45 minutes. One of our bedside lamps did not work- I would have expected this to have been checked. We found that there was a little too much ambience in the corridor outside our room.  The smell of watermelon freshener was rather sickly and the lighting so dimmed we struggled to find our way. Nonetheless, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this impressive central London hotel.",4,2013,08,17
148,Great architecture but lacking seriously in a few basic areas,"Positives: Great location, architecture and okay design. Roof terrace was fun and we did get there with the 'I'm staying here' card. 
Negatives: checked in at 6.45pm - room was being cleaned. 20 mins later got the key. Is checkin not normally mid afternoon? Surely bits ridiculous not to have rooms ready by 6pm? Shampoo, shower gel and body lotion all half used. Eventually got some full ones from housekeeping. Dust/dirt behind toilet door. Asked to borrow iPhone charger - they said they couldn't lend but would charge at reception. Next morning phone completely dead so they lent me cable. Cable didn't work as was not genuine apple one I suspect.  I shouldn't expect a cable but when told they would charge up my phone and I left with them / borrowed a charger it was a bit disappointing it didn't work.",3,2013,08,16
148,Don't go by all the negatives!,"My husband booked us a night at the ME London for my 50th Birthday surprise, we stayed here on Tuesday August 6th, once he had told me on my birthday I came straight on here and looked at the reviews, needless to say I was a tad worried, we aren't young and trendy, noisy and want to be up until 3am! Without him knowing I contacted the hotel and expressed my concern about the reviews of noise etc, I received a lovely email back ensuring that we wouldn't be allocated a room on the first floor or top floors and she had made a note on our booking.
We arrived at the hotel early, just expecting to ask if we could offload our bags and then go sight seeing, we were met by very friendly and welcoming staff and was shown to reception where we were able to check in straight away, we were asked if we would like to upgrade for a minimal amount to which we did, while the receptionist was sorting all this out she offered us both a glass of champagne which was lovely. Within minutes we were on our way to our room and wow, what rooms they are. 
We finished our champagne in the room and then went to the rooftop bar for lunch, one tip, you cant get to the rooftop bar from all the lifts! You have to go to the bottom and get in another lift. 
We found a table fine and the staff were lovely and friendly, I was a little paranoid that we would be under dressed or look out of place but not at all. We had a lovely lunch of tapas and cocktails in the sunshine. Service was quick, food was gorgeous, first class, different and tasty. Service was excellent.
Each time we either went out or came in the hotel we were met with friendly faces and felt welcomed.
We slept perfect, I don't think I have ever slept on such a comfy bed or had such lovely soft pillows, there was no noise whatsoever and no problems at any time of the day in the lobby or lifts, we came back to the hotel at about 11.30 and I expected it to be a buzz of drunken young people but not at all. Maybe this is because it was a Tuesday and midweek and the party goers are out more at weekends?
If I have any negatives to say it would be the lifts, so temperamental and at one point I thought we were stuck, we just got into a habit of pressing ground floor and starting again and by the second day got used to them, I think maybe some information either in the lift, in the room or with your keycards would be beneficial. We couldn't find useful telephone numbers either in the rooms but this is only a minimal negative.
I loved this hotel and if I could afford it I wouldn't ever stay anywhere else when coming to London, we was able to walk to all the tourist points easily and Covent Garden was a stones throw away.",5,2013,08,15
148,Dreadful service & attitudes! NEVER AGAIN!,"Just like Actors & Performers, any Venue & Establishment is only as good as its' last performance & given what we experienced, the ME, London would have been booed off stage & slammed by the. critics! The service was generally dreadful, condescending, pompous, unhelpful & totally void of customer-focused service. The attitude was very much, take it or leave it & as though we should be grateful to be even be allowed in there; such approach & conduct is wholly unacceptable & highly disrespectful to Customers & Patrons alike! Needless to say we will not return and/or recommend & I am pursuing a direct complaint with Melia whom I'm absolutely horrified are endorsing & associating with such disgraceful & shameful conduct.",1,2013,08,14
148,Impressive design - service and attitude let this hotel down.,"I booked a one night stay at ME London, as part of a theatre weekend away with my husband for our anniversary.  

I will start with my pre-stay experience, as Melia sell this hotel as a ""full experience"". Unfortunately it starts with a gripe since it seems that this particular Melia hotel does not honour the benefits of their own Melia Rewards programme.  As a Gold member, I am usually entitled to early check in and late check out, but having emailed the hotel, was informed that this ""perk"" is not available at ME London.  Very disappointing.  

My hopes were raised a little when a week before my stay, I received an email fro the ""Aura"" team, inviting me to reply with any requests, or reservations required during my stay since, as they reiterated, staying at ME London is more than just a hotel stay, but a whole experience.  So I replied, with a request for a room in quiet are of the hotel, and asking for a reservation for an afternoon drink in the Radio roof top bar.  I received no response at all- further disappointment! 

Upon arrival at 3pm, we were escorted from the entrance to the 1st floor reception by a member of staff who barely managed a smile and mumbled a few words under his breath about the hotel whilst in the lift.  At check in, we were informed that despite it being past the hotel's check in time, our room was not ready, so we were given a offered a glass of champagne which the concierge suggested we enjoy in the rooftop bar.  He accompanied us to the lift which goes to the roof top bar. The lift was (quite literally) being ""guarded"" by two doormen.  I can understand that a hotel might look for a certain level of clientele, but we are a professional couple in our 30s and were smartly dressed.  The concierge proceeded to have an augment with them about whether or not we were ""allowed"" into the rooftop bar.  Once the doorman had given us a good look up and down, he eventually decided that we could go up, if we agreed to a ¬£100 minimum spend per person!!!! 

Looking at other reviews, it seems that our disappointment and issues with the Radio Bar are shared by many - it is not operated by the hotel and despite the hotel's responses to these reviews, it is clear that hotel guests are not welcome.  Setting a ¬£100 minimum spend per person in the middle of the afternoon is completely ridiculous and means that it is not accessible for any guest wanting anything less than to drink themselves under the table! If it is run as a separate concern, fine, but Melia need to remove the Radio Bar from their website, because they are offering something which is not available to the majority of guests.  

The hotel itself is quite spectacular - the room was great (apart from the fact that there is only a shower and no bath in the Aura rooms).  We were on the 2nd floor looking onto the Strand and could hear no noise at all, from the road or from the bars.  

However, the attitude of the staff left me with the overwhelming feeling of being unwelcome in a hotel which we had paid in excess of ¬£300 per night for.  We enjoyed a lovely meal over the road at One Aldwych and will be opting to stay there next time. ",3,2013,08,13
148,Disappointing,"I booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary total disaster, first impression was brilliant the appearance and architecture was amazing. But our story goes like this, after having a shower I got a knock on the door hotel staff telling me the shower was leaking into the room below. Reception asked us to move rooms I reluctantly agreed to this as we had thearte tickets for 7.30 pm the time was now about 7pm .explained this would be a massive inconvenience and did nt want to be late for the theatre, reception said don't worry we will move your belongings for you and we will give you the card for the room now so I could get to the thearte on time (which we still didn't thanks to this). Agreed with my wife we would forget about this and just try and carry on with our weekend. Returned to the our new room after our night out , we realised our room was better than our room before and our bags were there what was brilliant . Until I tried turning the lights on which were controlled by a touch screen panel on the wall . Which were really un user freindly and complicated to use ( I'm a electrician of 10 years of experience ) the lights would not stop flashing in the hall way ,rang reception maintenance came they could nt fix it and said it would need an engineer to come who be at least an hour!!! Time is now 2am suggested we wait in reception WTF! No rooms were available to move to so I demanded a taxi home (oxford)which they agreed to. Got home at 5am , when we unpacked in the morning it came clear that my work I phone was not in my bag, I left it in our original room rang the hotel to see if it was found in our 2nd room which it was not. When trying to get our belongings together which was made impossible because the lights wouldn't work in the bedroom I asked for a torch, the hotels answer was two candle lanterns to see in the dark. My phone is still missing lost or possibly stolen when our belongings were moved rooms? A really upsetting experience",1,2013,08,12
148,A real wow factor hotel - temple of cool and chillout,"I took the 'risk' of choosing this relatively hotel out of all the London 5 stars for my wife and I to celebrate our 40th Wedding anniversary, a 3 day break.  The overall experience was wonderful and my wife was highly complementary of my choice! 

The staff gave the best personal service that I have experienced in my many years of business and personal travel in 5* and 4* hotels.  Jamie from the concierge service made us feel special guests from the moment we stepped into the hotel, guiding us to reception and onward to our room with a complementary glass of bubbly ... not even knowing it was a special anniversary for us.  The reception in an internal pyramid is awesome. 

Our 'Mode' room was very comfortable and quiet with good AC - we loved the mood lighting and overall ambiance.  We ordered a room service lunch which was excellent and good value too.  Hotel is in a great location for theaters and site seeing.  Our stay was truly memorable - bubbly was flowing from check-in to check-out!",5,2013,08,12

On arrival I was escorted to the stylish reception room and offered a glass of Prosecco. A great start!
The room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. Nice view over The Strand.
Met a friend for drinks (Fri afternoon) and we had no trouble getting into the Radio Bar, though a later arrival did have to wait a bit. This had a great view, good cocktails and pleasant staff. In fact, the staff in the hotel were charming throughout the trip.
Great location too.
I`d certainly stay again.",4,2013,08,12
148,great. stylish. fancy,"A great stylish Hotel in the heart of a vibrant city. Big like for the desgin and style. Young and very friendly stuff, saw no one older as 30.

A hotel that's hired out hourly to the most awful London crowd of wannabes you could ever wish to avoid.
Everythings a franchise. Avoid.",2,2013,08,07
148,"Fantastic Hotel, let down by loud music and a poor Italian restaurant","This is a fantastic looking hotel, very attentive hotel staff, nice contemporary decor throughout. When we arrived we were given the option to upgrade our room (714) for a fee which we did, unfortunately we kept awake by the thumping beat of the music from the rooftop bar, which closed at 3am, brilliant bedroom but no sleep!!!
We had also booked dinner at the Cucina Asellina one of the hotels restaurants. We were greet very nicely by the staff, and seated at a well positioned table, again brilliant decor. We placed our orders, and our starters arrived, unfortunately somewhat tepid, we mentioned this to the server, who took my husbands starter away to replace the dish with a hot one,not a mega problem and it was rectified very quickly. However we had both ordered the Lobster Fettuccine, we were so disappointed with the quality of this dish, the lobster was inedible it was really tough and chewy. We again brought this to the attention of our server, who just listened and went away. Some ten minutes later the Maitre D' arrived our table to advise us that she had been informed of the situation and was apologetic, she offered us a dessert, but to be quite frank we were so disappointed at this point we refused, she then offered us some coffee which we accepted.
On the hand the Marconi bar was superb, good service, good music, very good staff.

148,Wow factor hotel but would not return,"My husband booked this 5 star hotel this weekend as a treat for my 40th birthday and I have such mixed feelings about it.

The location of this hotel is great and close to the Embankment, Covent Garden etc. We were going for a dinner cruise in the evening so it was perfect location for us. 

Arrival was great and very smooth ...we stopped outstide and our car was taken off us to be parked up and we were taken by a very friendly member of staff to the reception which is on the 1st floor.

This hotel really does have the wow factor ... I certainly felt overwhelmed!   The reception area is just amazing and found check in to be very smooth as well as being given a complimentary champagne which was really lovely. 

I think general information about the hotel facilties would have been beneficial but not received. 

Our room was on the 8th floor, and it took us about 5 minutes of trying to get the lift to move to find out that you have to put your room card in a slot first before the lift will go anywhere which would have been nice to have been told about on check in.

Our room was gorgeous and certainly exceeded our expectations.   King size bed, large bathroom with twin basins and lovely twin shower.     You can choose mood lighting in the room which we thought was very cool and lots to choose from with the mini bar.   There was no tea/coffee making facility which was a little bit frustrating first thing in the morning as I woke up about 2 hours before my husband and would have loved a coffee. 

Now this is where the experience goes downhill a little...

As we were out in the evening, we decided to get ready and go to the rooftop terrace for a drink before we went out for the evening and this was part of the attraction when my husband booked.  

We got in the lift at 5.30 and pressed for the 10th floor which is where the rooftop terrace is and subsequently spent the next 5 minutes in a lift that just kept going down!  Eventually another guest told us you had to go to the lobby and switch to another lift.   We were then faced with a security guard who we felt looked down on us (not trendy enough?!?!) and first of all asked if we had a reservation and I said no we are wanting to go to the rooftop for a pre dinner drink and I was then told it was closed for a private function.

There was a queue there (at 5.30) and I can't help but feel that this was not the truth and purely that we did not fit in with their pretentious and trendy clientel!  I have never been in a hotel before where I have not been able to simply go and have a drink in the bar. 

In the lobby there is the Marconi bar which is very nice too, and we sat and had a couple of cocktails there instead. 

Having had dinner out, we got back to the hotel at about 10.30 to a completely different ambience and felt like we had walked into a nightclub foyer rather than a 5 star hotel. 

We sat in the Marconi bar and had a drink, listening to music pumping out of the SLK bar which was situated right by the Marconi bar and thumped out even louder each time the door was opened.  The lobby was chaotic with people walking in and out for access to the bars in the hotel and we sat watching the staff approaching the groups of attractive girls to give them a 'pass' into the SLK bar/club (whatever it is).

Luckily, myself and my husband have a good sense of humour and we found it we found it quite entertaining but it all felt a little surreal too as I have never been to any hotel (let alone a 5 star) that seems to turn into a nightclub in the evening, and a pretentious one at that.

We certainly felt out of place and took our drinks to our room instead. 

Unable to review the breakfast as we didn't get up in time, but check out was smooth and our car bought round to the front of the hotel for us very swiftly.

I am confused by this 'hotel' ... it is a great location, the decor has the wow factor, but I didn't feel like it really put the hotel guests first and certainly very disappointed we couldn't have a drink on the rooftop terrace and felt like we weren't 'trendy' enough. 

I didn't have a terrible time, the experience was good but I can't see I would want to return because I didn't feel particularly valued as a guest.",3,2013,08,04
148,Never again,"My partner and I stayed for one Saturday night on a promotion through Amercian Express. The hotel looked fantastic on the website and we were excited to see the roof top bar as it was a hot and sunny day. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly concierge desk. The hotel is very new and modern. Rooms were decent size. We dropped off our bags and headed to the rooftop bar around 6pm just before dinner. The 'bouncer' refused us entry saying the rooftop was full. We were told by the hotel that guests did not need to make bookings. The bouncer let more people in as we were standing there in disbelief. Girls with mini skirts the size of hankerchiefs were all ushered in while us hotel guests were refused. One of the guys at the concierge overheard me saying how ridiculous this place was and came up to us and told us he would get us in. He went to talk to the bouncer and they made us sit another 5 mins before they told us to go upstairs. We stayed for 5 mins on this rooftop and left. The people seem to be transported from a Vegas party scene where girls were bleach blonde and wore dresses 2 sizes too small and guys who would wear sunglasses all night and buy magnums with their parent's credit cards. The rooftop bar was no where near full. My partner and I just didn't 'fit' the profile. 

We went back to the hotel after a late dinner and found our room freezing cold. even after turning off the air con, the temp stayed at 14c the entire night. We found in the morning that some of the shampoo and lotions were half used. The shower was nice and large and thank goodness for sufficient hot water as we needed to thaw out from sleeping in the Ice room. 

although location is great, I highly recommend that if it is a comfortable, classy 5 star hotel you are looking for, this is NOT the place. ",2,2013,08,04
148,More of an uber-hip [ie. full of preening wannabes] bar/club than a hotel,"Bit of a mixed bag this one. We had a free night there (on Amex promo) so thought we'd check it out as we wanted to try the roof terrace bar which is otherwise impossible to get into.

Very warm welcome from Ruairi, the concierge, who took us up to reception and gave us a prosecco. Check-in was okay - but lift system with key card slot a bit unpredictable and not explained by receptionist (and neither was the default safe code).

Room was nice, if a bit long and thin. Comtemporary, milimalist design that we like, but may not suit all. Nice view over the theatres opposite. Huge comfy bed. Nice double rain shower.

Touch screen controls for lights and aircon not properly connected and just fell out of the wall revealing the electrical connections... not very safe!  The controls themselves were good - choice of ambient lighting colours a nice touch - except for the aircon control. When we arrived, room felt freezing (was at 16 degrees according to the display) so I turned the aircon off and we went to check out the roof bar.

Got to lift and were told it was full and we could come back and try later. We pointed out we were guests and were told it made no difference as it was ""at capacity"" - with guests and [mainly] randoms.

We complained to Jamie, the other charming concierge, and he led us back to the lifts, had a word with the pretentious door staff (apparently the bar is run by a separate events company to the hotel... not a great idea, in my opinion... clear conflicts of interest). We were told we'd be let in ""soon - when they're ready"". 5 mins later we were granted access to the lift. Felt like the bad old days of queuing for hours for a crappy club to be told you were wearing the wrong shoes.

When we got up there, the bar and the view are lovely, but it was only about half full. I think ""at capacity"" can be roughly translated as ""we are keen to maintain an air of exclusivity by barring entry and keeping a long queue outside"". Also, it was full of the sort of people I'd happily push down a deep mine shaft and seal the entrance off forever. Basically, yer standard London ""cool crowd"" (as they would define themselves)... wall-to-wall vanity, pretension and labels, and not a lot of fun to be had. We didn't stay long.

Went out for dinner (at the exceptional Social Eating House on Poland Street) and returned to find the room even colder (now at 14 degrees!) despite the touch panel reporting the aircon as ""off"" and with a target temp of 30 degrees still showing!

In summary - excellent service from the two charming concierges, horrible service from the pretentious terrace bar team, some dodgy technical faults, and a pretty off-putting client√®le loitering around the lifts and preventing guests gaining access to the terrace.

If we'd paid for the experience, I'd be pretty angry. As it was free, I'm just going to warn others about it on TripAdvisor.",2,2013,08,04
148,style over substance,stayed a week on business - looks lovely but crucially for me internet speed woefull and noise from roof bar (i stayed on 8th floor) was really bad - you'd expect it from a hostel but a five star hotel? concierge even admitted that 9th and 8th floor blighted by the noise all the time. Another concierge also admitted that wi-fi famously crap despite claim on website..couldnt wait to get out. Myriad other sloppy staff/room issues but i can live with those.....,1,2013,08,04
148,More like a prison spaceship than a 5* hotel,"We recently stayed for free through an American Express promotion but I couldn't recommend that anyone pays to stay there.
It felt that the place wanted to be a trendy bar much more than it wanted to be a hotel. I'd read reviews from people saying that you could hear the noise from the roof bar on the higher floors and loud music from the bars below was clearly audible in our room on the first floor.
Access to our room was down a long all-black corridor, possibly very trendy but certainly claustrophobic.  The room itself was ok but quite small and felt a little oppressive.  There was only a small window which extended outwards in a triangle-shape and with the opaque blinds slid across it, it did feel like being in some kind of cell.  I woke up before 6am feeling a desperate need to go outside and get some fresh air.
The room was evidently intended to have a futuristic wow factor but was let down by a badly cracked bathroom mirror, blocks of wood slid under the glass wall in the toilet seemingly as a support and a broken slate floor tile in the shower.  The touch screen controls for the heating/lighting were a nice feature and the television had plenty of channels available in a multitude of different languages.
The nearest tube station is Covent Garden which isn't the best as it's often very busy and only has lifts and not escalators, additionally there are a lot of cobbled streets to bounce your case over en route to the hotel if you arrive that way.  The location next to Covent Garden does mean that there are plenty of places to eat nearby, including the newly opened Shake Shack and many of the theatres are close by too.
I was in the queue to check out for well over ten minutes in a stiflingly hot reception area, not a great last impression for guests to leave with.",2,2013,08,01
148,WOW!,"if you are looking to feel special, superstar-like then this is the hotel for you. We only stayed for one night but the experience was lovely from the meet & greet at front door, check-in (complimentary class of sparkling!) all the way through to the comfortable bed, spacious room, fabulous bathroom.
Do make sure that you take a drink in the rooftop bar, residents can usually manage this at least in the day and early evening (after that it is often fully booked). The views are superb. Drinks are expensive but no more than elsewhere in this part of London, so you may as well relax here and take in the views whilst you can.
Staff are friendly, nothing too much trouble.
Breakfast is a little unusual in that only a limited offering is included in your room rate, do check what you can order before you tuck in!",5,2013,07,30
148,ME ado about Nothing,"We were there Thursday to Sunday, 8th floor double room with balcony. Apart from the view, topographical given, our experience of a shady discotheque was most unpleasant and unexpected. Teens (young adults) and young-at-heart would flock the lobby and entrances, juiced up on drinks, stumble their way in and out of elevators, on multiple attempts in reaching the coveted top floor bar. Not only did the staff confuse guests with partygoers, but the elevators have an insanely intricate functioning system I would not trust an undergraduate with. Guests using their room cards and guests of the clubs would merge and mingle in the elevators and floors. 
The given: 3 lifts- one servicing the top floor bar, 2 for rooms. One may take any elevator from the ground floor up to their desired destination, according to the above clasification. If one needs to go to the Reception, that is on the ""reception"" floor, not ground floor, where the lobby is. From the reception floor, one may go up to their room, if the card is kind enough to assist them. Yes, the hotel floors can be accessed by card only. Card which unlocks the doors, after walking through black corridors with dungeon-like lighting and cheap budoir scent about them. Let's say a hotel guest, living on the 3rd floor would like to go to the rooftop bar (why? Unless you're craving tender marinated young meat). In order to do so, the guest must take any of the 2 elevators that service the hotel floors only, go to ground level and hop on the party elevator to the top floor. All 3 elevators are clearly marked with ""top floor club"" next to the number 10. Why? Confusion is fun, but drunk teenagers fumbling buttons are not the greatest company. In an attempt to explain the process to ""tired"" audiences I realized it has imprinted me as Kafka's trial. Thanks, ME. Not really. Naive receptionists, impossible light system in the room, a lot of elevator time to get anything done (as room phone only works with electricity and that is a fickle convenience). A waste of resources. We did not taste the food in the restaurants as it seemed a perpetual boom-boom party was under way. Bed was large and relaxing sleep would have been possible but for the noise. there was ONE wastebin in the room with bathroom being split up in 3 compartments. Had a really hard time understanding where the ""designer"" bit would go, but for 450GBP/night I don't think we landed one of ""those"" rooms. Nice to know you could dial for a 3AM pedicure, if the phone was working, but I'll do that over our next visit, as it seems the only urge the place can inspire.",1,2013,07,29
148,I don't enjoy being harsh but this hotel is marketed as a 5 star experience,"and it is, sadly, anything but. The modern design may or may not be to your liking, but the supercilious attitude of some staff members has no place in any hotel, never mind one aspiring to 5 star standards. We left two bags with the concierge a couple of hours before checking in; when we reached our room only one bag was delivered. We were promised the second bag straight away. Half an hour later my wife had to visit reception (as the phone was not being answered) to enquire as to the whereabouts of the bag, which appeared some 15 minutes later. The room was of a decent standard but contained no information regarding wifi or the complicated TV/sound system which required a lot of trial and error to persuade it to issue any noises. There was no ipod dock. There was an espresso machine with a grand total of two capsules of coffee - generosity is not a feature of this establishment. The oh-so-trendy dark (black) corridors are filled with loud music, even at 9 o'clock on a Sunday morning. To top the whole sorry tale off, we were kept awake by pounding music from the bar. I'll repeat that in case you think you misread - I was unable to sleep, in a 5 star hotel, because of noise from the hotel bar. Awful, truly awful. I was staying for free on an Amex offer and even then considered checking out and moving somewhere else.",2,2013,07,29
148,WOW,"Great weekend stay , well located , great design , friendly and efficient service . Room spacious and well laid out . Champagne on check in is a nice touch , we had no issues accessing the Rooftop bar before and after dinner  which is an amazing feature especially during current good weather, views fantastic, great music and plenty of 'people watching' entertainment  . We were on the 6th floor and had no issue with noise from restaurants or bar.  Only criticism of the stay was breakfast , the kitchen had a meltdown taking over an hour to produce any hot food , also the whole concept is odd , menu dishes very specific and any extra ie additional drinks are charged for, I would tend to avoid this element next time as plenty of alternative places nearby",5,2013,07,29
148,Wonderful staff and design ... but noisy party clientele upset the ambience,"We were escorted from the front door by a charming young man who offered champagne when we arrived in the amazing pyramidal space that is the reception.  You can see that this is serious architecture (designed by Foster+Partners).

Check in was efficient, but although the room we were given was on the better side of the hotel for views (Strand vs Aldwych) it had twin beds instead of one and was full of modifications to make it handicapped accessible.  A call quick saw us moved to another room.

Rooms are London and narrow (but not cramped) with a floor to ceiling v-shaped window.  This has opaque and translucent shutters to manage privacy and light and there's a coffee table and a couple of chairs just inside.

The large bathroom has a twin rainfall shower and twin basins.  Plentiful toiletries are by trendy Greek company Apivita.

The super king bed was not only huge but extremely comfortable.  Lighting and air conditioning ar managed from an adjacent touchscreen and there's a large flat screen TV.

So what's not to like?  In common with other trendy hotels in London, whether it seeks to attract the pretentious 'bling' crowd or not, it certainly doesn't do much to keep it at bay - so as the evening falls the noise level at STK and the rooftop Radio ratchets-up to thumping music accompanied by frenzied shrieking.  (Having read an hilarious review of STK in The Times, there was no way that I was going in the room; but I would question whether anyone in their right minds would want to eat in such an environment.  Most would surely turn back at the door.)  I can't really comment on the rooftop Radio bar because during the day - until 7pm - there was some kind of brunch for which a table could be booked - according to a flyer on reception - for ""a minimum of ¬£100 per person, not including food or drink"".  What, precisely, one was buying for the money was unclear; perhaps a variable rate short lease on the furniture?  In the 'evening' - which stretches to 3am - it was fully booked.  (And there's absolutely no preferential treatment for hotel guests - even at a minimum of ¬£340 a night for a room!)

After dinner we returned to the hotel around 11:30 for a drink at the ground floor Marconi bar.  This is cleverly designed, but the noise coming from the constantly opening and closing door of STK meant that there were few people at that end of the lobby and the few that could endure it gathered around the bar itself.  The three cocktails we ordered (at nearly ¬£40) were initially so bad that we sent them back.  The barman made new ones without demur, but the replacements at merely OK (consisting of way to much juice and insufficient alcohol) didn't tempt us to hang around for more.

Having read about the noise at the top and bottom of the hotel, we upgraded to a room on the fifth floor.  The rooms themselves are well insulated - at least for each other - but I wasn't happy to be woken at 5am by our neighbours shrieking (there's a theme here) in the hallway outside the room and going in-and-out of their room over-and-over again letting their door crash back onto the latch.

To be fair to the hotel they did send someone immediately, and it quietened down again, but this is what happens when you market your property to certain clientele.

Breakfast in the hotel's Italian restaurant was very good and reasonably priced (e.g. ¬£14 for a full English) and the service was friendly and impeccable.

Two staff working the midday checkout queue was ridiculously understaffed, but there were only two terminals for them to work at.  Perhaps some laptops and tablets can be drafted to alleviate this or they could allow in-room checkout or quick checkout just like other hotels have done for years.

Will we go back?  I'd love to for the great rooms and great staff, but on balance I'd probably avoid for all the reasons given above.",4,2013,07,29
148,Lovely place!,"When we arrived we went to the concierge desk and greeted by Kelvin who kindly took us up to reception. A glass of prosecco whilst checking in was a very nice touch. Daniel the aura host was very helpful and took us to our room where he explained to us where everything was. the room itself was a perfect size, very modern with a lovely layout. We especially liked the small control tablet which allowed us to control the lighting and air con in the room, particularly the 'sexy' setting! 

the two bars we went to in the hotel were very nice, especially the rooftop bar, where the views were spectacular and not to be missed, with many of Londons landmarks in sight. It had a good stylish vibe with good music and good service. 

the breakfast was worth the money with a wide range of food and drink available. 12pm checkout was perfect giving us time in the morning to relax! All in all I'd highly recommend this hotel. It's a lovely place with extremely helpful staff.",5,2013,07,28
148,Not for everyone,"My husband and I recently stayed here and were quite disappointed. If you are after a relaxing 5 star London experience, I would not recommend this hotel, for the following reasons:

- There is nowhere to relax. The lobby and reception are more nightclub and are sterile and unwelcoming.  In particular, after a 13 hour flight - pumping music and crowds were not what I expected on check-in.  
- The rooftop bar plays loud music until around 1am so be prepared to be kept up during the summer.
- The d√©cor and styling is ultra modern, dark, sterile and cold.
- We were confronted by security each time we entered the hotel who more questioned what you were doing there, rather than welcoming you. 
- Aside from 3 exceptions, the service was terrible during our stay - I tried to call reception several times but the phone rang out. I had the same experience when trying to call the roof top bar to reserve a table (though it was booked out solid for the entire week, even for guests). 
 
On the upside, the hotel is in a great location - less than 5 minutes walk to Covent Garden. Also, the views from the roof top bar are amazing and the room we had, though small, had some great technology (although the pink ""sexy"" light was an odd addition and more resembled a brothel than a 5 star hotel). The hotel was also kind enough to give us a late checkout.  

Overall, I do not think this hotel deserves a 5 star rating. I think it would suit someone looking for a big night out in London and for the novelty factor, rather than someone looking to stay at a 5 star hotel. Also, I think the hotel needs to focus more on its guests, rather than on the rooftop bar - we really felt that the priority for the hotel was on filling the bar, rather than looking after the guests.",3,2013,07,28
148,great experience but would not return!,"my boyfriend & i stayed here for 1 night on saturday 27th july to celebrate his birthday. 
The hotel really does have the wow factor, modern stylish and the gentleman who greeted us was extremely polite & helpful! he led us to reception and poured us both a glass of champagne! lovely touch. 
We arrived about 10.30am so just wanted to drop our bag so we could go out and shop/sightsee but checkin on my confirmation said noon but receptionist said room would not be ready until 3pm!! i can tell you after being out of the house since 7:30am on a boiling hot day i felt absolutely awful by the time 3pm came & we could freshen up! not good enough really, if checkin is at 3pm then state 3pm then we would have got a later train!! simple!
while we were waiting for our room we sat up on the roof top bar (radio) and had a few drinks..... erm dont really know what to make of this experience! great drinks, great views.... didnt like the atmosphere!! too many staff for starters..... some, i presume security guards, just hanging round with shades on, felt like you were being watched, not very relaxing!! it was explained to us that if we wanted a table it was a ¬£100 per person min spend!! we explained we just wanted a drink while we waited for our room to be ready so we were allowed to sit at the bar?!? weird!!? it was all a bit pretensious and snobby! couldnt wait to leave, hate to think what it would be like at night!
on finally entering our room we were impressed with the huge comfortable bed, clean modern bathroom & the most amazing rainfall shower which was hard to get out of it was so nice!!!! it was a pretty small room for the rate but loved playing with the lighting & the air con was most welcome on such a hot day! 2 bad points...tv jittered alot and desk and bathroom, although lovely were not good for doing makeup in, cant get close enough to mirror for presicion so ladies take a good hand mirror!
we ate at STK at night. this was fantastic, very expensive but worth every penny in my opinion! great relaxed atmosphere, unlike radio bar! staff were brilliant but not on top of you! couldnt have asked for better!! 
we had a fantastic night sleep & we ordered room service for breakfast in the morning. it was about half an hour later than ordered & there was an item missing but overall it was a very nice breakfast!! a great way to make the most of your room in the morning! 
overall a nice stay but i wouldnt return at this price. great location but ¬£306 is too much for such a small room however nice it is! it was an experience with some nice touches but 3pm checkin when it states noon when you book isnt good enough!

148,A little wedge of Madrid in London,"The ME London is a hotel of black marble walls, moody lighting and pumping house muzak in its communal areas, with artfully strewn Tatler magazines and handsome Madrilenos concierges. It's a little wedge of hippest Madrid hotel chic parachuted into its corner plot on the Strand. I can't not give it 5/5 even though the receptionist sniffily told me that the much vaunted rooftop terrace was not accessible to me as a mere mortal as it was full. What is the point of a rooftop bar if the hotel's residents can't use it to refresh at the end of a long day? A poor attitude.",5,2013,07,28
148,"Funky, Funky Place","What a great lobby - like being inside of a pyramid.  We were greeted at the door and escorted to reception and given a glass of champagne while we waited to check in (which wasn't long).  We had a nice room on the 9th floor with a terrace.  The only problem were the party people hanging over us shouting while they were on the 10th floor bar.  We didn't particularly like the room since it was handicap accessible and we didn't have a bathtub, but the lighting was incredible - you even have a switch for ""Sexy"". Breakfast was good and good value for the price.  Check out was slow - in such an upscale, modern place they should offer on-line checkout.",5,2013,07,26
148,ME London,"Very good location close to anywhere in the center of the city, excellent design, unlike any other hotel in London I've stayed so far. I'd really like to go there again. It is quite expensive but what isn't in London.",5,2013,07,25
148,Great Break in London,"Good hotel with a real vibe, well worth a visit. Great bars and restaurants with a can do attitude which are busy & fun places to eat. the view from the rooftop bar is not to be missed. It has a cool lobby too .",5,2013,07,24
148,Achingly Cool,"The architecture of this hotel is stunning and the experience from the moment you enter is hugely attentive.  We we greeted by the door man and passed on to some one who escorted us up to reception and poured us a glass of cava, we had a bit of a wait to check in but the conversation was polite to ensure the wait passed quickly, in fact I wish I had taken the name of the Italian gentleman as he also made an effort to recognise and talk to us throughout our stay.  We were equally impressed with the the 2nd person who helped him to accompany us to our room (quite why we needed 2 people I am not sure, but it was a lovely touch when the receptionist phoned him mentioning our name to say we had arrived - almost like he was expecting us!).  In fact of the whole welcoming experience it was the receptionist who probably let it down as she wasn't anywhere near as attentive as the others.

The rooms are fabulous and even though we stayed it the lowest level room we were impressed with the size (bigger than a similar rate room in The Sanderson), I have read several views commenting on noise but to be honest we had no issues at all, although having experienced the bars in the hotel I can believe this may be an issue on certain floors (we were on the 4th floor).

The bars and restaurants are designed to attract a young/young at heart crowd.  We went into Radio for a drink before heading out for dinner and there were huge queue's for non residents (probably not surprising given the gorgeous day and the stunning terrace & views - I think there were hardly any of the major London landmarks you couldn't see) although things were getting a little messy even at 7.30 - a result of too much drinking in the sunshine I think!  We wandered into STK on our way back which was also buzzing & there seemed to be a flash mob dance going on which virtually everyone in the restaurant was taking part in - it was brilliant to watch.  We also tried the bar in the lobby, but the service was a bit lacking here - although we were impressed with the price, ¬£9 for a glass of champagne in a central London hotel is pretty reasonable.

My only slight grumble would be despite contacting the ME reservation team before hand and mentioning to a couple of the guys who greeted us that we were there to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary there was no recognition of this during our stay.  As a comparison we also stayed in London for our first and second anniversaries both of which were recognised by the hotel's, now I appreciate you can't upgrade everyone (which is what happened at St Martins Lane) and this is down to availability, but equally a little touch like a bottle of wine and a note (as we had in The Sanderson) goes along way.  For a hotel that is clearly trying to differentiate itself on service little touches like that make a big difference.

However, I would absolutely recommend this hotel and in fact we just about to stay in the same chain in Barcelona so I hope we have as good an experience there.",5,2013,07,22
148,I'm sure the rooftop bar is great!,"We stayed here midweek, using avios points. When we checked in we were disappointed to hear the the rooftop bar was closed for a private function. Upon seeing my disappointment, we were offered champagne and our room was upgraded to a suite. This is a designer hotel with gloss black corridors which are a little disorientating! The room was great with the best stocked mini bar I've seen - you can even request a bartender to come and shake your cocktail! We drank in STK that had a great atmosphere and breakfast was excellent.",4,2013,07,22

148,No sleep before 1:30 am,"Beautiful hotel with a few major wrinkles. After spending long hours traveling to London it was a real treat to enter this hotel. The room was amazing, bed very comfortable - but there was so much noise coming from the roof top bar it was impossible to watch TV or go to sleep before 1:30am. Numerous complaints to the front desk did not alleviate the problem. I had an early morning train to catch the next day and felt awful in the morning. My daughters wedding was 2 hours outside of London and I arrived exhausted due o lack of sleep. Ruined my day!
The very least I expect from a hotel is a good nights sleep. ME FAILED MISERABLY in this regard.
The only other complaint was the lack of lighting in the hallways. Really creepy for a single woman looking for her room.
Definitely would not book here again.",1,2013,07,19
148,If you chose this hotel because of the Radio bar - book the bar first,"I've spent one night only in this hotel. I liked the idea of having a drink on a rooftop bar. However, the bar is not really meant for thd hotel guests. It's a popular spot and needs to be booked in advance. Check in time had been re-adjusted for 15.00, not 12.00 as written on my booking, which kept me tucked in business clothing all day. The hotel is lovely, but I do mind paying 400 ¬£ for 15 hours bed and room only, in my case without breakfast, of bar access. 
Otherwise no complaints. Lovely bathroom, cool design, but I won't be coming back. ",3,2013,07,16
148,Amazing place!,"From the minute you walk in to this spectacular hotel you are made to feel completely at ease and comfortable by the friendly, smiling staff who manage to be professional and helpful without being too much! 
We arrived a few hours before our check in time but the receptionist went out of her way to make sure that our room was ready for us asap.
In the meantime we went up to the amazing Radio Rooftop bar for a spot a lunch. It had a lovely relaxed vibe, a nice mix of people and of course fantastic views of London.
As we were finishing our lunch our host came up to let us know that our room was ready. While he accompanied us to our room he filled us in on all that the hotel had to offer and then, in our room, showed us how everything worked, which was nice (as there is nothing worse than not being able to switch off the air con etc.) 
The room was just what he had hoped it would be.... spacious with a really comfortable bed and amazing bathroom full of lovely products. They also left some great amenities and a personalized greeting and we also found our luggage waiting for us.
Service and food in Cucina Asellina was just perfect and we had a great breakfast there in the morning too!
I don't think that there was anything we didn't like about this hotel. The whole team is doing a great job here and I can't wait to come back and stay here again. 
Thank you to all the staff who went out of their way to make our stay so enjoyable. I will certainly recommended this hotel to everyone I know.",5,2013,07,14
148,Wow!!!,"What a fabulous 4 night stay we have just enjoyed at ME London.
On arrival we were greeted at the concierge desk, where we dropped our luggage.  Kelvin, the head concierge, who was extremely helpful throughout our stay, runs a slick team.  We were swiftly escorted to the 1st floor reception, given complimentary champagne and a warm welcome to this buzzing hotel.
We finished our fizz on the 10th floor at the Radio Rooftop bar, which has outstanding views over the river and City landmarks.  We ate twice at STK one the hotel restaurants, the steaks were amazing with a great selection of toppings/sauces, and imaginative sides. Friendly and attentive staff were happy to advise on menu options. This restaurant/bar really comes alive at the weekend, and, although noisy, had a brilliant vibrancy made even better by great music played by the resident DJ.
Our room, on the 8th floor was fabulous. Spacious and bright with funky lighting, superb bathroom and great amenities. It even had outdoor space - terrific!  There was NO noise from any other room or from traffic. The massive bed was so comfortable - perfect!
Breakfast in Cucina Asellina, was waiter service. Lucca and his young energetic staff attended to our every need.. Here an extensive choice of a la carte dishes was available.  The inclusive rate allowed for three options, all delicious. Our favourite was Continental. This consisted of fruit juices, cheeses, meats, eggs, toast and a selection of pastries, washed down with great coffee and a section of teas.  For us, this could have been an even better if served buffet style!
ME London enjoys a wonderful location, close to so many attractions. Throughout the hotel, and without exception, we found the staff genuinely keen to do everything they could to make our stay the best possible experience.  Thanks to all.
Try a stay at ME London and see for yourself!  We'll be staying again in the Autumn and can't wait!",5,2013,07,13
148,It's got some blemishes that need ironing out,"On arrival at the ME we were met by a very pleasant member of staff who unloaded our luggage and parked the car.

We went into the hotel and were informed by the concierge that reception was on an upper floor.
While we were booking in we noticed that other people (as mentioned in other reports) were being given lovely cold glasses of champagne, none was offered to us!!

Our room was on the second floor - as we got out of the lift the corridor to our room was very dimly lit - it was very atmospheric but not too practical when trying to locate signs for rooms.

The room we had been allocated was absolutely gorgeous - incredibly 21st century and spotlessly clean! It had an enormous bed,table and 2 chairs, a state of the art shower and bathroom with some delicious products and a wonderful view of The Aldwych area.

Then we started to notice the blemishes.

Although the concierge sent someone to the room to explain the TV console - the TV did not work but an engineer did come and fix it.
It was impossible to gain any internet access at all.
The windows do not have any curtains (which is fine if you dont mind sleeping in a very bright room)

Nowhere could we find any information that we could look at in our own time, giving us some background knowledge of the area. We did get a map from the concierge but it would have been nicer to have had it in the room - maybe its just not that sort of hotel?!?!

All through our stay the streaming on the TV was continually interupted.
Only coffee was offered in the room - tea would have been nice after a hard day sightseeing.

We bought from the mini bar a pack of licquorice sweets - they were still in date but quite clearly old!! And they were ¬£5.50!!

The rooftop bar was great - fabulous views and we were lucky enough to be there on a really hot day. 
It did seem a little odd though that ALL of the empty tables had reserved signs on, which were removed once you were taken to your seat by a server!!

I am sure that all of these 'blemishes' will be sorted out in time",3,2013,07,09
148,A 'trendy' 5 star hotel experience - not your usual!,"My girlfriend and I came here in February for Valentines day, shortly after the hotel opened. We were very impressed from the start by the incredible reception area 'inside a pyramid', where we were greeted with champagne. We were then led down very dark, watermelon infused corridors to our room. The room itself was nice, not enormous but with full amenities. We both had an in-room massage which was incredible and I'd highly recommend. We loved the fun room features-  from an innovative minibar selection, to the music available through the TV. 

We had pre-dinner cocktails at the Radio Rooftop bar, which has the best view of any rooftop bar in London from Big Ben to Tower Bridge (thanks to it's position at the bend in the river). It's a sexy bar which is very smart. We then had dinner at STK, where we had fun (even if the portions were a bit too big for us!).

Overall we had a really great time and I'd like to particularly thank our Irish ME+ Experience lady for helping to make everything run so smoothly- she was a star.

A word of warning however...while we had a great time (we're in our late twenties), this hotel might not work for people who are used to more traditional 5 star hotels. It is trendy, things are done a little differently and there is a buzz about the place. This makes it absolutely ideal for me but I know my parents would not find it relaxing.",5,2013,07,09
148,OK but need to concentrate on guests!,"We stayed here for the first time last weekend.  Having stayed at the One Aldwych across the road and watching the ME being built over the years, we were looking forward to giving it a go.

When we arrived there was no-one on the door to approach for Valet Parking.  We went into the hotel and spoke to the concierge who said he would find someone and to keep an eye on the car - which my husband did for 10 minutes.  Finally someone came and took it away.  

There are no signs to reception and had you not read the reviews on TA you would be hard pushed to find it.  Once in reception, we were seen to very efficiently, so efficiently in fact that we didn't get offered any of the complementary champagne I had read so much about!! 

 We weren't shown to our room, just pointed in the general direction, which was a little disappointing, but having a fairly good sense of direction, we found it - although the corridors are so dark (stylish I guess!) a guide (dog) would have been helpful.  

The room was large enough, narrow but long, with a great bathroom with rainfall shower, separate WC and his n hers sinks.  Lots of lovely Greek toiletries, which I have had before at The Blue Palace in Crete - very nice. 

The room is full of gadgets, again a little help on this would have been great, but if you can work an iPhone, then you should be OK to follow your nose a bit.  Mini Bar - brilliant everything you could want, including a Nespresso Machine.  Please note that as it provides hot water, tea bags would be nice rather than just coffee!  As has been mentioned here before the safe was locked - apparently you can get in with the hotel code but again, no directions so a long call to the ""team"" was needed to get it opened.

No ironing board and once we got through to the ""team"" (this took several goes, being engaged and then ringing out for ages) it turned up fairly quickly.

Cant comment on breakfast as we didn't have it but I can comment on the Radio Bar - very nice - trendy and absolutely full to brimming with non-residents.

This is where this hotel falls very very short - it spends sooooo much time concentrating on getting outsiders into its bars and restaurants that it completely forgets guests!  It is very disappointing when you walk into a bar in the hotel you are staying in only to be completely ignored by staff busy seeing to other people - this wasn't even at night, this was 2pm in the afternoon!  This hotel needs more staff if it wants to be more than just a destination bar with a hotel attached!

Wouldn't head back unless there is a really good deal available and it would have to be good.  

Such a shame that so much money has been spent on this hotel only for it to be so lacking.

Oh and it took nearly 25 minutes to retrieve our car when we left to - something about a barrier not working!!  Hey Ho!",4,2013,07,09
148,Me me me!,"An extremely pretentious, soulless environment. 
I've never felt more uncomfortable in a hotel! 
Besides its cold futuristic obelisk interior, the Stalinistic security guards would be far better placed in a 1930s gulag than a 21st century 5* central London hotel. The Devil Wears Prada hospitality combined with nuclear bunker corridors were a stark contrast to the seedy welcome of my brothel style room with its pink ""sexy"" lighting. 
The good central london location is let down by its busy Aldwich roundabout position.
Overall, Me London hotel has inflated prices matched only by its oversized ego !",2,2013,07,09
148,Mixed experience - good and bad,"It was a very mixed experience but overall very enjoyable. The stay was complementary - a free offer from my American Express Platinum card, which meant we didn't have to pay almost ¬£300 a night and that put me in a good frame of mind!

I arrived at 10.30am and the conceirge staff were delightful. They kept my luggage, and escorted me to the reception. It was, as others have said, stunning. A huge space like the inside of a very tall pyramid. The walls were marble, and projectors created a stunning display of moving jellyfish. I loved it. I was provided with a large flute of champagne, delicious and cool!

Came back at 5.00pm and got into my room. Asked for my luggage to be brought up to my room. Four calls later, and feeling frustrated, I went down to the conceirge and they took me to the luggage room, and found my stuff, which I decided to carry to my room. They were full of explanations for the problem, but honestly was not interested.

Later we went to the Radio Bar for cocktails. A really great vibe, trendy, young, and great music. Although we know London the views were unique and full of surprises. 

Then on to dinner. The Cucina Asellina is very large and relaxed. The service cheery and welcoming. However, they tried to serve a warm bottle of white wine, which they had dropped in a little ice. We refused it and they then found a properly chilled wine. Then they served delicious starters, followed by pasta dishes. Unfortunately mine was wrong, so they took them away and we waited , and waited. No apology. Bit disappointed, so didnt pay the service that was automatically added.

There was a light show in reception at 8.00pm with complementary champagne. Simple but relaxing and lovely.

Came back to the same restaurant for breakfast. Italian waitress served tea, in a cup rather than a pot, so again complained. put right quickly, so happy! Breakfast was tasty.

The room and the interior design was lovely. I liked the gadgets. I liked the window screens. I liked the bathrobes.

Overall memorable, but with too many little issues. Would not want to stay again, but would use the Radio Bar again.",4,2013,07,09
148,OK for twenty-somethings,"If you look at Google Earth, you can see this is an odd shaped building so it must have been quite a challenge to squeeze in as many rooms as possible. It didn‚Äôt work. My room was long and narrow with a bed at the end: very weird. Hardly any space to put things apart from a place to hang a few shirts. One feature, a touchpad to control the lights and air conditioning by the side of the bed, was unresponsive so was the TV remote. Not a hotel for peace and quiet. Loud music in the STK restaurant and the roof bar was very discomforting and made normal conversation impossible. I completed their feedback form saying why I was unhappy, they didn‚Äôt bother to reply. 
I am baffled why this is a five star hotel. Stars used to be awarded for comfort, practicality and customer care now it seems to be for shiny metal and marble.",2,2013,07,02
148,Superb Experience,Absolutely wonderful hotel. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. We were greeted by staff who unloaded our luggage and parked the car for us. Kelvin the head Concierge accompanied us to reception where we were given champagne whilst a very efficient lady on reception booked us in. We have stopped in many hotels and could not fault our room and any of the staff during our stay at all. It was a great change to have breakfast served to our table rather than having to queue for it like many hotels these days. The roof top bar was amazing as were all the other bars and restaurants in the hotel. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely return. Thanks to everyone at ME London for making our stay so special.,5,2013,07,01
148,Don't stay if you would like to sleep,"I've stayed in many 5* hotels I'm London at this is the worst I've have ever stayed in. The noise from the roof top bar will keep you awake.If your looking for a decent hotel in the same area then try One Aldwych

148,Fantastic,"Lovely hotel, brilliant service, super bar, and super chic rooms with everything you could wish for!  Check in was professional and efficient, the hotel ambience is relaxing, there is a fantastic view of London from their rooftop bar with a great atmosphere.  We stayed on a Thursday and it was really buzzing.  The concierge are very helpful and on hand to take your luggage from you if you wish to drop it off early and go and explore.  The room we had was beautiful, a huge comfy bed with pristine bedding, fantastic lighting to create any mood you want, the shower was excellent, toiletries galore and the mini bar was fab.  Full of every snack we could of wished for, even a coffee machine and cocktail shaker with glasses!  I would recommend this hotel.  Great quality and money well spent.",5,2013,06,30
148,Birthday treat,"After reading several reports on trip adviser we were a little sceptical but there was no reason to be from the moment we entered the hotel we were met by Kelvin  the concierge who was extremely polite and helpful .We were taken to reception were we both received a glass of champagne while we were checked in .The Hotel is ultra modern with so many amazing features that you spend most of your time in awe.We were given our room which was on the 3rd floor we had been upgraded to a vibe room again everything ultra modern the bathrooms were of hi tech and so were the bedrooms .We went to the roof top bar for lunch were again we were greeted by very polite and happy staff the atmosphere is fabulous .We ate in the STK restaurant which again was fantastic .My self and my husband had an incredible weekend at this hotel we ,are both over the age of 50 but this hotel is for all ages we came away feeling about 20 what a lovey birthday present .",5,2013,06,25
148,Great experience,"What an amazing hotel which blends great service, modern decor and trendy, happening catering areas. The staff are warm and friendly and offer truly professional service. The roof top bar is one of London's best bars and FAB music and ambience also great views across the river.",5,2013,06,24
148,The rooftop bar - Radio - is off the charts!!!,"ME Hotel is a brand new 5* hotel on the junction of the Strand and Aldwych in London. I have already reviewed the ground floor restaurant STK which is really fabulous.

However, the rooftop bar called Radio is absolutely stunning. On a warm summer evening, rare in London I know, this place is magical. It is a really cool place, the view is stunning and if you can get in there it is NOT TO BE MISSED!!!

I was lucky enough to be shown round by the wonderful Sharon Segal, Director at ONE Group which owns the hotel and I have already been back twice. 

Love it!!!",5,2013,06,24
148,Absolutely superb,"Just returned from 2 nights at this superb hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treated to some of the best service I have ever experienced. The hotel is a stunning piece of design, very cool and clever. The reception is incredible, the roof top bar amazing and the rooms so very comfortable. This hotel attracts quite a young clientele and at times we did feel a little old but this did not detract from what is essentially a beautifully run establishment. My only gripe, and it's a small one, is that the tea at breakfast was bad. A luke warm cup of water with a tea bag that took an age to infuse by which time it had gone cold. I highly recommend this hotel and would love to return soon. I do hope they keep up their standards as it is a credit to them all.",5,2013,06,24
148,All about the rooftop view,"Quite a strange hotel from the moment you enter - in some ways rather unconventional (i.e reception is not in the entrance- you need to travel to level 1 - but cannot operate the lifts without a room key - which obviously you don't have at pre-check in stage- so are escorted which was a little off putting). 

The black & white colour scheme is dramatic, but not particularly relaxing -something like entering a cavern? The staff appeared very helpful and tried extremely hard to please - Although I agree with a previous review about the 'bouncers' who hang about at the front door and elevators asking ""can I help you?"" in a strange tone.

Our room was very nice and ultra modern with slick lines, glass shutters and hidden cupboards (take some hangers as there are only 3) .  We loved the room control system (lights etc.) which worked perfectly and the bed was very large and comfortable.

The rooftop bar and lobby bar look great and the views in the evening amazing.  Make sure you reserve a table and try the tapa's menu which was great value. Service seemed to speed up after 5 pm when more employees clocked on but the experience in the afternoon and evening were memorable.

We were on the 3rd floor and had no issues with noise as noted by some other reviews (or was that due to the number of cocktails consumed in the bars ?)

Breakfast was not included in our rates but we were pleasantly surprised that the price was very reasonable - and food delicious.

The ME is a must stop for London and although more expensive you need to consider the night life which comes all inclusive (which otherwise is not cheap in London) ?? If you love ultra modern then you will love this hotel - we had a perfect stay and would love to stay again.",4,2013,06,24
148,weekend stay,"excellent hotel staff brilliant.. very clean very helpful. radio bar was kicking..
only let down was you couldnt play your own music in the hotel.. sysytem was complicated and the breakfast was awful...",4,2013,06,24
148,Amazing,"An amazing hotel with a chic and urban ambiance. The service was excellent and the facilities such as the rooftop bar Radio offered a fantastic meeting point for drinks with friends and Bussiness meetings, while STK made a memorable and fantastic supper.  I added an extra night to my stay so I could take in and enjoy the fantastic and spacious room with the quirky minibar. Highly recommendable for all types of stay. Needless to say I will book this for my next trip to London. Regards, Daniel, perfect noise, Sweden

148,Awesome,"Just stayed at this fantastic hotel, the service was amazing and STK delivered a memorable supper While the roof terrace Radio brought an very chic and urban feel to my stay. I could not recommend this enough. Needles to say I will only ever stay at ME every trip I do to London. Thank you for making my stay so enjoyable. Daniel/ Perfect Noise, Sweden ",5,2013,06,19
148,One of the most amazing hotel experiences...ever!,"ME London.....simply amazing!  From the moment you step into the hotel you are transported to a place which feels new, luxurious, timeless, tranquil, but at the same time (in the evening), it transforms in some areas to a hip & trendy experience with the likes of STK and Radio rooftop bar with stunning views of London. Simply wow!",5,2013,06,18
148,Stylish and contemporary with great service,"What a fabulous hotel with great design and great service.  The rooms are spacious, very contemporary and well appointed and we even had a terrace with a view over Covent Garden.  The roof terrace is fabulous and a great way to spend an evening with views over Somerset House and The Strand.  Staff couldn't have been more helpful and the overall vibe and experience made this a fantastic stay. Its nice to see something different in London in such a great location with such an emphasis on style combined with an excellent customer care ethic.  Chic but friendly.  We would definitely stay again.",5,2013,06,18
148,"The good, the bad, and the rooftop","This hotel may be the strangest I've stayed in yet - in many ways it should be perfect - and yet overall I found it annoying and anything but relaxing.
The black & white colour scheme is dramatic, but ultimately quite tiring and in the long run not very relaxing. The main staff seemed to be trying extremely hard to please - I can't say that about the sinister-looking 'bouncers' who hang about at the front door and elevators, sizing you up and occasionally asking ""can I help you?"" in a threatening tone.

The room - yes, some nice things going on at first, but then you realise there's the weird slitty window with the glass shutters that just become an annoyance - the electronic room control system (lights etc.) which again is fine until you have to keep prodding it and tapping it to just turn on a few lights. And at night, as you walk past the closet, the light inside automatically comes on and wakes the other occupant of the room - I could not find a way to stop it, and the door to the closet is glass.

Finally - the rooftop bar and lobby bar look great - but when I tried to sit at an empty table on the roof, someone veered over and said ""wait over there!"". Nice. Service then for 3 cocktails felt like it took hours...

Finally - the noise......I was somewhere in the middle of the hotel, but the noise from one of the bars was just SO loud - really unbelievable. If you need to actually sleep, this is not the hotel for you.

First impressions - good, even great in certain areas. Lasting impressions - won't stay again.

Pity.",3,2013,06,15
148,Noisy hotel,"The hotel is stylish but no space for hotel guest apart form our own room. The noise from the club on ground floor was so loud, we could not sleep as our room was on the 1st floor. Very disappointed as we chose this hotel specifically for our holiday in London. Apart from the noise, all were okay. The staff were friendly",3,2013,06,12
148,Very good - 5 * service,"All you would expect from a 5 * hotel, with a modern vibe. Its expensive, but worth it. Stayed in a suite for a special occasion.  Met by friendly staff who helped me check-in, and also delivered champagne to the room when my partner arrived. Great room, comfy beds, lots of space.  Great roof top bar that gets busy on the weekends, but easily accessible for hotel guests. Had Dinner in the restaurant, yes its probably a bit too loud, but nice staff and good quality food. Breakfast is also nice, the ¬£25 charge should include a full English, but when you've paid that much for the room, the ¬£5 supplement is not really a problem if you have already decided to stay. When I want to spend money for a good quality hotel in a great location, this is the place to be. ",5,2013,06,11
148,Amazing Building.....Over Priced!!!!!!!,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary for 1 night. We contacted the hotel regarding a possible upgrade and just to say it was a special occasion as you do and they did not even mention it on our arrival, paying what we did we expected a little extra. The staff are friendly and helpful , the room was small but more than comfortable ........The roof top bar is amazing and the staff are also friendly and more than helpful. Not being from London I have to say i was surprised at the cost of drinks so will just put that down to experience. We visited the Radio bar in daylight and darkness of which both were a brilliant experience the view is worth the visit. The location of the Hotel is first class everything is 5-10 mins away which was a plus for our short visit. When we travel to London again we will certainly look elsewhere when searching for Hotels as there are many better deals out there.",4,2013,06,10
148,A case of style over substance.....,"First impressions of the hotel were very good - impressive building, nice lobby, and handsomely appointed bedrooms. However, as time wore on, over a weekend stay, issues (mainly staff and service related), started to appear and annoy. At ¬£300 per night, things really should be better.
The room safe was locked on arrival - a phone call to ""ME for you info"" (I guess the service centre) went unanswered for 5 mins, before I gave up (this was at 1200 on a Sat lunchtime)
I visited the ""Radio"" roof bar on two occasions, and on both occasions was left hugely disappointed with the service - I did not visit on a Fri or Sat night, as I dread to think what that would be like (I witnessed the queue / bouncers, when I arrived back from a theatre show at 2200). I visited ""Radio"" at 1400 on a cloudy Sunday afternoon, when it was quiet - I sat outside for 10 minutes, without a menu, or any acknowledgement from the staff - in the end, I went in an ordered a drink, direct from the bar, which was empty (I had intended to eat, but guessed the omens weren't good).
ME London reminds me of some of the W Hotels I have stayed at - staff are attractive, and very well turned out, but are not customer focused and are not up to the job.
At this price, I will likely stay somewhere else next time.",3,2013,06,09
148,Wonderful evening buzzy place,"Six if us booked for dinner for my husbands birthday, The service we received was excellent. I had booked via Top Table with no special offers or set menu. However we were offered the 3 course set menu with cocktails for ¬£25.00 per head which was ideal. The food was excellent as was the service and the ambience. We will definitely go back. We would have like to visit the Radio roof bar prior to or after dinner but there were queues. This would have made his birthday. We will be back.",5,2013,06,07
148,superb hotel,"stayed at the ME hotel last weekend for my wifes birthday,got to say it was a very pleasant experience from the moment we enterd the hotel to the time we left,we were given a glass of champagne at check in and on being shown to our room which was amazing found they had left us with a complimentary bottle of wine and mixed olives.we had lunch in the roof top bar which was lovely and returned to the bar latter in the evening when it was very buzzy,the architecture of this hotel is worth a visit alone and would highly recomend it,staff were pleasant except for one guy at reception in the radio bar who seemed to have a bit of a attitude problem.",5,2013,06,07
148,"Building is great, staff less so","Positives:

(1) The rooms are beautiful (even better than they look on the website). My room (bottom of the range) is among my favourite hotel rooms ever. In fact, it may be my favourite of all time. (I like modern architecture but not cheaply-done W hotel style. This all feels like very good quality design and build.)

(2) Some of the common areas are stunning (check in), some are bling. The roof bar is very noisy.

(3) The location is excellent.

Negatives:

(1) Bouncers??!!

There are large, pushy men who hang around the entrance, intercepting guests and asking whether they can help you, but in a way which sounds designed to get rid of you. I am staying here for a week, and am offended at having to justify going back into the building, especially as I am paying over ¬£1,700 to stay. I've never encountered this before in any hotel anywhere, and dislike it very much.

(2) Check-in was very slow. Had a small issue (my TV alarm comes on at 645am), and staff did not handle it well.

(3) Some practical issues with room. It worked really well for me as a single businessman, but for a family space and storage isn't very good. Lights fiddly (why can't hotels just make their light switches easy to use?)

(4) GBP 300 per night is a lot of money.

148,A Nightclub and bar with hotel attached!,"Just stayed at ME London on a theatre break. Pretty amazing piece of architecture! Aayway, the review. 

hotel is situated on The Strand across from lyceum theatre and pretty much in the middle of Covent Garden so for location it gets 5 stars and 100%. The check in procedure was pretty seamless (although it is on 1st floor and you come in on ground level!) and we made it to our room safely. The room was decent size by london standards and was immaculately presented, although there was no bath there was a rainfall shower and plenty of clean towels. Didnt have any breakfast there because at the time of booking they wanted ¬£180 for the 2 of us for breakfast for 2 days!!!! Get real!!. Instead we went to Henry's Cafe Bar 2 mins away and it was excellent.  

The cost of drinks is incredible and although the service is fine the atmosphere is not what you expect. There are more patrons who come in to the hotel for its bars and nightclub than stay there. there is no real feeling of being a guest and being looked after personally because the staff dont know if you have simply came in off the street with friends for drinks or if you are a paying, staying guest. Why dont hotels like this have a ""patrons only"" lounge? the constant thumping music makes it very trendy and it does attract a healthy crowd (especially on a friday night) but not the place to go for a romantic weekend. It really did feel that the hotel was a bolt on and that as a hotel guest i was simply forgotten about! Would i stay againil ? No. Would i recommend it? Cautiously. What advice to hotel management? You are a hotel first and foremost.",3,2013,06,01
148,Flashy Presentation - Functionally Problematic,"The quick review - Splashy presentation, but not very functional.  Comfortable beds.   I would stay there again only because of the location near Theatres, London Eye, Whitehall, Covent Garden, Trafalgar Sq. - We could walk to almost anywhere all the way to Buckingham Palace easily.  I used my Choice Privileges points to stay there for free, so price was not an issue.  I would do so again.  For a more detailed review - read on...

This is an instance where form does not follow function.  The idea that everything should work easily was lost in designing a really cool hotel.  Color scheme is minimalist: black, white, gray and chrome. The ground floor is a restaurant and bar, both really eye-catching.  

The efficient/aggressive bellman quickly insist on scooping your bag and take you to the elevator to go up one level to the reception area.  The reception area is like being inside a 3 sided pyramid that is 8 stories tall.  Impressive.  Your bellman then escorts you to your room.  The hallways are all black with little spot lights along the way.  

Upon entering the room your first impression is WOW.  Really cool looking with magenta LED lights splashing on the white wall from behind a black stone surrounding the TV area.  Then you discover why you need the bellman. Everything is controlled by a little LCD pad next to the bed.  You would be hard pressed to figure this out on your own.  We never did figure out how to shut off the closet light.  It's on a timer of some sort, but ours was on for hours after we went to bed.  There is no dresser.  Only room for 1 bag in the tiny closet area.  Nice bathroom, but I would have sacrificed some of the size for a dresser.  The designer shower is another function/design issue.  As cool as it was with a rain shower overhead and a hand shower, I would have preferred a regular head where I didn't have to stand under the rain all the time.  The really bad part was that the shower leaked out into the bathroom, so a towel had to go on the floor by the door.

The view from the roof-top bar is really great, but we couldn't find a time when it wasn't either really crowded or blasting music so loud you couldn't converse or both. (Usually both)  We did have lunch up there our last day and even then the music was loud, but not really bad.  Lunch was good. We didn't eat in the restaurant downstairs.

For a place that's only a few months old, it's already showing some wear.   We noted lights not working (not just bulbs out) and stone walls cracked in hallway, 

One not to be missed thing is the presentation they have each night in the reception area.  Each night at 8 pm video projects light up the walls with a very impressive 8 min presentation.  You don't need to be staying there to experience it either.  The 2 nights we were there they were giving you a free glass of champagne during the experience.  This really cool element worked well,.",4,2013,05,28
148,"Great for business, Great for families!","I had previously been to ME London hotel for a business trip. But some weeks ago I had the chance to go back with my family.
We had 2 communicating rooms, and were treated extremely well. There were other familites travelling in the same dates.
Breakfast is gorgeous. This time I tried the Cucina Asselina restaurant and is also very good.

Highly recomendable hotel! Great for business trips. Great for couple trips. Great for family trips!!!",5,2013,05,28
148,Great Stay,"I stayed here for a business trip and it was a great base to stay very central.

The room was very clean and tidy and very modern. For a London hotel it was also very quiet. It also had some great touches in the room. Sweets, full bar and snacks.

I did not use the roof terrace as I out with clients in teh evening, although I wish I had had the opportunity.

Check in was fairly painless. The rooms are bright and airy. However, the passage ways were dark and stuffy.

I would definately return.",4,2013,05,26
148,"Extremely overpriced, all looks, little substance","This hotel really looks nice, nice style, great rooftop bar, pleasant lobby bar. all fine until you walk into your room. It wasn't the smallest hotel room I ever had, but it is a close second. At 300GBP per night for a room of less than 30sqm this hotel is really overpriced, especially because the rooms are nothing special. Again more time was spent on the looks of it than the practicality of it. I stayed here for 4 nights and I like to unpack and hang my shirts/jacket nicely in a wardrobe. That was a bit of a challenge given that the wardrobe is just 50cm wide. There is no space to stowe your suitcase away in the room which is really annoying as it always stands in your way. The TV set is another example of style over substance. Great flat screen, but apart from some sports and news channels, nothing to watch. On top, the TV doesn't work that well. The image stalls at regular intervals. Beds are fine and the bathroom was ok, but again for ¬£300 a night I would expect something larger than the shoebox size bathroom. The only two plus points of this hotel are its location just by Covent Garden and its rooftop bar which is indeed spectacular. The staff is friendly and helpful, but you may have to call them 4 or 5 times before anyone picks up the phone. Whilst it is an ok hotel, for that price I would have expected a spectacular hotel and the ME falls a long way short of that definition.",3,2013,05,24
148,Impresionante. Una experiencia que vale la pena,"After enjoying ME Cancun and ME Madrid, I was anxious to feel and taste what ME can offer in one of the most trendy and busy capitals of the world

It was even better than I expected!!

From the entrance, welcomed by Groove Armada, you can feel that you are in a different place. The Check In area is located inside a grey pyramid where jellyfishes are floating around, projected over the wall
The minimalistic white room is full of glamorous details, Sexy lights, Cocktails elements, LoveME tender kit (ready for love), HangOver kit (the morning after), etc.
I had dinner at STK restaurant, where tenderloin can compite with best Argentinian meets.
But the most fantastic experience at ME is the roof top bar and its incredible views of the city. I really felt that I was in the center of the Universe

ME London is a MUST!",5,2013,05,22
148,Crazily beautiful - the coolest hotel in London,"We checked into the hotel early last Saturday evening for a night of partying in the Big Smoke. Situated on the junction of The Strand/Aldwych, we wandered in the roomy and bright foyer looking for check-in and were directed to the first floor to book-in. Wow, weren't we in for a treat!

Imagine a ten story marble pyramid, fully enclosed albeit for a doorway leading into it from the lifts, with a check-in desk and champagne bar providing free glasses for people checking in. 

Then imagine beautiful images of blue jellyfish moving up the marble walls (projected). What an impression... when we heard that Britain's finest architect Lord Foster hads designed it, I was expecting something impressive but not quite this! Check-in took approx 15 minutes but we were kindly upgraded to a Junior Suite for the wait. The Junior Suites are located on the same floor (level 1) and our room was 111. The rooms are all located in the corridors around the outside of the stone pyramid. Room 111 was fabulous - it had a separate bedroom. living area and huge bathroom complete with separate toilet room, huge bath, 'his and hers' sinks and huge shower room. There were two huge TVs with various different ports on to connect the iPod. This was really fiddly - we had to ask reception to help connect it and the remotes were very tricky to master. There was a lighting panel which had a 'sexy' option which lit the room in pink and purple... fab! We had invited friends to join us for drinks in the room before and they were all well impressed - what a talking point the place was. Rooms are modern, very sexy and the choice of free toiletries and in the paid-for minibar was unbelievable.

We never had any problems with noise in the room. We had a drink in the bar downstairs before heading out - it has a fabulous atmosphere! It was too wet to head for the rooftop bar, which looks fab and we are disappointed to have missed it.

One niggle was reception just never seemed to answer the phone... we had rung the hotel before our arrival to get directions for parking, and when in the room, we needed help with the iPod set-up but the phone just rang-out. We did eventually get help though.

One other niggle was the sliding window blinds, which are frosted glass - they let in all the light so we were awoken early by this.

All-in-all, staying here was such an experience. It provided such a cool back-drop for our evening of partying - definitely recommended for trendy couples and groups of friends. We will return!",5,2013,05,21
148,Style over substance!,"We recently stayed at the ME London hotel for my partners 40th birthday. We were really looking forward to a relaxing weekend away to enjoy some shows and catch up on some much needed sleep after leaving our young baby at home with the grand parents.
On arrival the hotel staff were very obliging and the hotel looked exactly like we had seen on the Internet. The reception area with the ginormous pyramid was spectacular, and we had champagne on arrival, so we were off to a good start!
However when we were shown to our room (Energy River View) it was quite small with a very small bathroom and no bath (this is meant to be a 5* hotel)! The balcony was also very small and had absolutely no view of the river! I was told by the hotel staff that they would see if there was a different room available. 
At this point we were very disappointed as this hotel is by no means cheap! After waiting an 1hr 1/2 I tried to call reception to find out what was happening. Eventually after 5 attempts and 1/2hr later someone finally answered the phone (this is not 5* service). After this we were finally shown to another room (111 do not stay in this if you want a good nights sleep)! This was an upgraded to a junior suite which looked very nice. So we got ready and went to eat in the STK bar which was extremely busy. The food was good but the music was extremely loud, to the point where even the waitresses were having to shout to be heard!
After a nice but noisy meal we went back to our room for a good nights sleep. However you could hear the music from downstairs, the base was so loud that it was making the shutters on the windows shake! The music finally finished at 2am (was not impressed)! Then to add insult to injury we were woken early in the morning by the radiator banging like a train in the bathroom! When I phoned reception to tell them about this they did come straight away. We were then moved to anther room. Which considering this hotel has not been open vey long already showed signs of wear and tear. The floating marble floor in the shower had already been broken and stuck back together. This room was slightly better as far as the music was concerned but it could still be heard.
I'm afraid in my opinion this hotel is not up to the 5* standard that we expect and the price of the rooms is extortionate for a hard bed and shoddy sound proofing! After really looking forward to a lovely weekend away we were left very disappointed.
On the plus side the rooftop bar was very nice, the view and central location were great.",3,2013,05,20
148,"Five Weeks In Europe, Our Favorite Hotel","Absolutely adored this hotel and everything about it. Everyone was friendly, eager and happy to help. The rooms were incredibly comfortable (if a bit barren) and totally immune to the hustle of the noisy bar upstairs or the street below. There's many options and colors to adjust the room's mood to, including a mysterious ""sexy"" option. Sadly, our ""sexy"" button didn't work, which led to much disappointment and a few jokes about how to raise this issue with the front desk. ""Excuse me, Sir, my sexy button is broke!"" 

Also, Me London has by far one of the coolest check-in areas ever. Love the complimentary booze or beverages upon arrival. 

The bar upstairs is great and the hotel does a nice job, it seems, of regulating how many people can be up there at any one moment. You never feel like its too crowded and the view is amazing. My one complaint is that they have a pretty great cocktail list, but much of it involves mojito-type drinks, which require a lot of effort from the bartenders. Given that, it drastically slows down the amount of time it takes for the orders to be completed, leaving many people waiting upwards of five minutes to order their drinks, even when the bar is not that busy. They either need to revisit their specialty drink menu, limit it after a certain hour when it gets busy or hire a few more bartenders. It's also really weird that they remove the heaters from the patio area sometimes. No idea why. 

STK, downstairs, is a great fitting option for this hotel. However, the music gets so loud after 9PM it is hard to hear anything. Checking in with the hostess was a nightmare, it took me four attempts 
to even tell her we had a reservation before she understood what I was saying. There is no reason for it to be as loud as it is, even if they are trying to go for a ""club"" type atmosphere. The nightclub upstairs doesn't even have music that loud. So loud, in fact, that several of the speakers near our table had obviously broke and sounded horrible.

Even with a few minor imperfections, I'd definitely suggest this hotel to friends/family.",5,2013,05,19
148,You don't need to leave the hotel for a one night stay......,"We stayed here for one night to celebrate my wifes' birthday and generally thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience in this great location. Designed by Lord Foster, the whole place is uber trendy from the minute you walk in.......never seen a reception like it - just look up!  We stayed in a ""river energy"" room on the 9th floor with our own balcony and an amazing view, just a shame the sun was not shining.  The roof top Radio Bar was amazing, had a late lunch there and also post dinner drinks on the Friday night when it was well controlled and not too busy, great tunes and not as pricey as other central London establishments.  With the ground floor bar, the Radio Bar, the vibrant STK Bar / Restaurant and the Italian restaurant you really don't need to leave this hotel in 24hrs. My only criticisms being that when I booked the room the staff noted it was my wife's birthday and having read other reviews I thought we may have at least got a complimentary drink on checking in. Also the bed is not the most comfortable given the price you pay, a big dip in the middle, thankfully my wife and I were so boozed we could have slept on the balcony.....Finally, I paid for breakfast in my room rate and I thought it was a little mean having to pay for anything more than two eggs on the hot menu.....",4,2013,05,19
148,ME London for Business Travelers,"ME is a terrific hotel in the making.  The decor is striking, ultra modern, very hip.  The rooms are very, very comfortable.   Located in the theatre district, ME is in the middle of everything.  The staff work to meet your every request.  There seems to be a few kinks to iron out in their service.  For example, my bags were never brought to my room, and I had to chase them down.  This was just a small blip on the radar screen.  

Radio, the rooftop bar, had terrific views of the city sky line.  Be aware that the bar is very popular right now, and the clientele tend to be quite inebriated.",4,2013,05,18
148,Uber cool joint,"I've never seen a hotel this cool. We were greeted and relieved of our bags near the front door, then escorted to reception on the first floor. The bar area on the ground floor is funky with curvy laid back seating. The reception is a like being inside a pyramid with a sun roof. All the staff are genuinely  helpful and seem to enjoy their work. They could easily  grace the pages of a high end fashion magazine. I suspect the recruitment policy is ..don't hire them, if you don't fancy them.

The room is another uber modern architectural masterpiece. We were on the 9th floor, with a great balcony and views stretching from Tower Bridge to the London Eye and overlooking the Strand. Absolutely stunning. The similarily amazing bar on the 10th floor was just above us, so don't go to bed early on Saturday night as the music is pumping until 1 am. 

The location on the Strand is perfect. Comfortable dandering distance to Covent Garden for shopping and restaurants or to the Thames embankment and all those London Landmarks.

This is a great hotel in a fantastic location. We'll definitely return.",5,2013,05,17
148,Nice hotel,"I spent three nights here on trip to watch the FA cup final with my son. The rooms are very nice and very modern. Bathrooms are well set up and private from the room (sliding glass panels). The hotel is very trendy and attracts lots of people who don't mind lining up for the roof top bar. Note guests can go up there anytime. After 6PM children under 18 are not allowed up there (shame really). In rerospect probably not the best hotel for a family as everything seems to evolve around the bars. The concierge, Roland, was brilliant and went out of his way to make us feel at home. The sound proofing in the rooms is fantastic.",4,2013,05,17
148,"Some great things, some good, some not so good","The Great things:  Visually stunning interior, great architecture and decor.  The room was clean & quiet with a massive bed that gave us a great night's sleep (I am a light sleeper, so the sound proofing for London noise was excellent). Receptionist was friendly & we were given a complimentary glass of Champagne on arrival.

The Good things: Layout of the room (Aura) was spacious and ultra modern.  The lighting system was quite funky, if a bit gimmicky. 

The Not so good: The corridor to our room was dark with barely any signs to reception, lifts or fire exits. I get the style aspect of doing this minimal look, but I wouldn't like to try to get out of this hotel in an emergency.   The TV reception was very poor and why bother having channels listed if they are ""not available""?   The rooftop bar was impressive to look out, but seemingly full of ""london hipsters"" who are an acquired taste. 

The bad: Whilst waiting for a lift to arrive, a staff member ushered a group of what I presume were ""VIP's"" in front of us and proceeded to not let us enter the same lift as them (there was room). Leaving us to wait for the next lift without an apology!",4,2013,05,16
148,Cool place in a great location -- some edges to smooth out,"The interior of the hotel is very cool but comfortable and practical at the same time.  The check-in area is one of the most dramatic I've been in.  My room was the most basic but still luxuriously appointed with a very comfortable bed/bedding, small desk area, and flat screen tv.  The bathroom has a nice rain shower system (though no tub for those who care), comfy robe, and high quality toiletries.  The doors in this hotel are all very heavy, but they serve a purpose -- the room was one of the quietest I've ever been in.  It was like a bunker, which was great for sleeping.

I was able to use the small gym area, which is a nice perk in London.  It is a small space, but the equipment is all top notch and the free bottled water and plush towels were a nice touch.

Whether or not you stay at the hotel, the rooftop bar area is fantastic.  It's a cool vibe and offers great views of London.

The hotel is very new so I understand there are some growing pains, but the service here is inconsistent.  Check-in was a tad slow though very friendly and welcoming.  Breakfast was an absolute disaster.  While the food is good, the wait staff really need more experience and/or training.  Hint: if you have a bad memory, write things down!  Some issues included bringing the wrong toast, not bringing toast until done with everything else, bringing the wrong juice, the wrong coffee, overall being very slow, etc.

Also a huge annoyance was that wifi reception was spotty.  To me this is inexcusable in a hotel that opened in 2013.  What made it worse was that after calling the front desk, I had two technicians sent to my room.  They said they would follow up with me, but never did.  The front desk also called back and said they would follow up, but never did.  I can understand if there are technical issues, but don't tell me you're going to follow up and then don't do it.  In the end wifi in my room never worked.

Overall I would still consider returning to the hotel.  While there are definitely areas for improvement, it's in a fantastic location and has a cool yet still comfortable vibe.",4,2013,05,15
148,The Best Hotel in London,"This hotel is truly amazing. From the moment you walk in to the best reception area you are likely to find. While you check in you can enjoy a complimentary glass of champagne.  

We were lucky enough to get bumped up room grades twice and the roof top bar has greats views and cocktails. 

I've stayed in alot of hotels in London and around the world, but the ME London is the best! A truly awesome hotel .... and i'll be going back!",5,2013,05,15
148,Fabulous!,"I stayed here on a Saturday evening and despite the hotel being very busy, all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I loved the Aura room - very comfortable and stylish, the lighting was cool and the music choices within the TV were great so we were able to party on in our room after visiting the bar. The views from the bar were amazing and the DJ /music very cool. Overall, we had a fantastic stay and one I'll remember fondly.",5,2013,05,14
148,Excellent Hotel & Location Location Location!,"Stayed here for 8 days and would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat! Great, friendly staff. The hotel restaurants & room svce were surprisingly good. Loved the salads, chicken dish, halibut, pasta & broccolinis. Easy walk to the London Eye with a perfect view of the Parliaments, Big Ben. Walked to Westminster Abbey, National  & British Museums. Covent Garden is 5 min. walk. Great hood to walk around in and take in its wonderful vibe with many cool pubs, restaurants , bakeries, ice cream shops & sites. PAUL's cafe down the road is excellent for our daily fresh delish croissants, salads, sandwiches, pastries, coffee & hot chocolate. So cheap but high quality all around! I really appreciated the various stores around selling quality quick food like salads, fruit salads & sandwiches. All done pretty well & very reasonably priced. The Golden Dragon in Chinatown has awesome duck & noodles.  Rock & Sole Fish & chips 10 min walk, was very good. Must order mushy peas, so delish! SCOOP gelato shop at the corner of Rock & Sole is also a must. Highly recommend Petit Maison in 
Belgravia, the lamb chops was especially good! Amaya Indian restaurant in Belgravia was very good (black chicken tandoori & griddled foie gras were amazing)! 
Dishoom Indian restaurant in Covent Garden my husband really enjoyed! Tried to go back but was packed. Next time. Anyway London is amazing & beautiful! 
My 5 yr old loved Princess Diana's play ground the best & the others. 
Can't wait to come back! ",4,2013,05,12
148,Boom,"Cool and hip is hard to define but we know it when we see it. Unfortunately I didn't see it at the ME London. What I saw was a shallow attempt to pass off bling, dim lighting and BDSM undertones as cool. Well, it doesn't work at the ME London any more than it works in off-strip Las Vegas which was surely the ‚Äòinspiration‚Äô for Foster + Partners, the designers of the hotel. I hoped the claim that Foster + Partners designed the hotel was outright misrepresentation. I really like Norman Foster‚Äôs airports and his HSBC building in Hong Kong is a stunner so how could he be associated with this crassness? But, there it was, the ME London large as life on the Foster + Partners website. It took a while but eventually I understood why. 

But first, some practical comments. Don‚Äôt go there expecting a 5 Star hotel: it‚Äôs not. Solid 4 Star, I‚Äôd agree but not 5. Not even close. Take an electric jug because one is not in the room as standard. Take your own handcuffs because the pair supplied in the room is unlikely to last the distance. Load some movies onto your iPad because this hotel does not offer pay movies. Visit the bar on the top floor because it has quite a view but be modest in your expectations of the cocktails. Take a torch because the corridors are pitch black: black carpet, black stone walls, black ceiling, black doors and the lighting designer was on a budget. I got the hang of the darkness but then came overconfidence and inevitably I walked smack into one of those stone walls. ‚ÄòBoom‚Äô as my 10 year old says. Take an IT expert because the lighting and air-conditioning controller and the phone are as complex as a data centre. You might wonder why in the year 2013 it is necessary to have a phone in a hotel room with more than one button: the button to call reception for advice on how to operate the air-conditioning and the lighting, to ask where to plug in the hair dryer (you can‚Äôt) and quite possibly to ask for an early check-out‚Ä¶ Actually, what you really want to ask is how to use the phone but you can‚Äôt because amongst the 80 redundant buttons, the reception button is impossible to find.

Does this sound a bit negative? Well, the staff members I met were great and very committed to smoothing over the inadequacies of the place. So thumbs up there.

Initially I was bitter about being duped into staying at this silly hotel and deeply confused about the Foster + Partners association. But towards the end of our stay, the penny dropped. This wasn't a clueless attempt to create a cool hotel, it was a parody of cool and a mockery of the people who think cool is important. Good one, Sir Norman.

Eventually I felt safe in the corridors but there was another hazard to discover. As we departed, I ducked down to the bathroom in the basement. It was all black, of course but well lit and the wash basin was easy to find. The soap dispenser wasn't so easy but eventually I saw it right in front of my eyes, on a high shelf above the tap. What I didn't see was that this dispenser was different from any other in my experience: the nozzle did not curve down but aimed straight out. So when I pressed down, it spurted a jet of white, creamy liquid not into my waiting hand but onto my black jacket. Gotcha! The day before I would have been outraged but now I was in on the gag and laughing like a maniac. Then I saw my soap dispenser was one of eight in a row above the taps. This wasn't a bathroom but a cockwall, an uber-cool cockwall. 

I was still laughing as I went upstairs and then my wife was laughing too when I told her the story. We were both laughing as we went out the door and that was, in our experience, a unique and very pleasant way to leave a hotel.",3,2013,05,07
148,A perfect weekend...,"Due to a couple of complaints my wife and I had made after our first stay here a couple of months back, we were offered a two nights complimentary stay by the management to, in their words, '... provide us with a chance to show you what we are really about here at ME London.'

If the intention was to show us just what a first class hotel this is then they certainly didn't disappoint. The room was superb, as it was last time, with pretty much everything you'd want from plasma tv, to rain shower in the bathroom, and the window where you almost 'step out' into the street below a really nice feature giving you a unique view of the Aldwych. 

We had dinner at STK, and I would highly recommend it. Hawksmoor is our favourite steak restaurant in London, and in terms of quality of food this was at least on a par with it. Great atmosphere in there, with a unique almost pre-club feel to it. 

The rooftop bar Radio has a view over London's landmarks that would be difficult to beat anywhere. The cocktails are pricey but with a view like that...

We had the continental breakfast in Cucina Asselina, and again, couldn't fault it. Really pleasurable room to sit in with light streaming in from the arched windows overlooking the Aldwych. Food was delicious.

All in all, a pretty near perfect hotel experience. Will definitely be returning!
",5,2013,05,07
148,Some rooms in a night club,"Spend 5 night in this new hotel and it was nothing of a five star experience!

On arrival they started by telling me that my room was probably not ready at 14:00 then the rest was at the same rhythm!

They have no attention to details (Missing soap in my room 2 days in a row) and everybody is lost in their task from Concierge to Front office to housekeeping...

The room are ok but nothing great even in design (Black, White and Minimalism not well used) and the turn down service make your room goes pink which is not appealing for me.Their interactive system is even basic compare to the other hotels I usually choose when in London.

But the worst for me was the fact that I felt like entering a club every evening when coming back from my meeting! There is a queue at the elevator to access their roof top bar, heavy movement from their restaurant STK and the lobby bar had nothing appealing to me. So coming back is not really nice... There is no place where you can relax outside of your room.

Even the gym had no soul and was small when today it's a place I think more and more people like to spend time.

All in all I didn't feel in a hotel and really feel that for a new hotel nothing is provided to the guest to give him a good experience.

I can understand challenges in service when opening but the attitude of the staff and the lack of attention to details doesn't make it an address to remember...",2,2013,05,07
148,Super trendy,"Wow this place blew my mind, the architecture of the hotel is amazing especially the reception area.

We were welcomed by a very friendly doorman who walked us to the first floor reception and explained how to use the lifts, where we could find the bar and restaurants etc. In reception you are offered a glass of champagne. The staff are really nice and welcoming

The room was a really nice size, spotlessly clean and a great selection in the mini bar.
The icing on the cake has to be the roof top bar, wow what great views fab music and a really cool crowd, it gets busy but we still managed to get a table.

I would definitely come back again and have already recommended to many friends and family.",5,2013,05,07
148,The best hotel in London,"This hotel is definitely the definition of luxury, innovation and design but at the same time it stands for hospitality and amiability. The hotel itself is an absolute piece of art, but all the staff make you feel at home too which is very appreciated. 
In regards to the rooms, i must say i have been in the suites, superior and standard bedrooms and every single one of them are fantastic. The innovative style but at the same time the comfort they provide made the stay absolutely perfect.
In addition, the rooftop bar is not to be missed. It has a great nightlife and the views are absolutely fantastic which make it a place you must visit during your stay.
Whether it is for business or pleasure, ME London will be my only choice next time i visit london, as its location is also a great advantage in every sense.",5,2013,05,05

Nothing can describe how fantastic and professional the staff is and how incredible is the architecture of the Hotel.
I have stayed in quite a few luxurious hotels around the world in the past, but had never experienced such a friendly and unique atmosphere like the one in the ME London.
I celebrated my birthday with a few friends at Radio Bar and the view was simply mind blowing. 
I would give 100* to this Hotel! Perfect location, amazing people, incredible rooms and Radio Bar...well...speechless!",5,2013,04,29
148,"Brilliant Hotel, fantastic staff.","I visited the Me Hotel just over a month ago on business, first impressions are brilliant. A very friendly and attentive concierge team are there to help. The downstairs bar is cosy and super stylish, although it wasn't terribly busy, there only seemed to be one member of staff manning the whole area. I had lunch in Cucina asellina, the food was great, and the service was quick and friendly. 
The real gem of the place is the Radio rooftop bar, the views are stunning, and the staff are by far the best I've met in a long time. I was served by two lovely (very attractive) waitresses, Jenny and Lilly, they were genuinely friendly, hilarious and really made our night, they weren't over bearing either. The drinks are brilliant and a great value for money too. We didn't need to wait for anything. We came back to Radio the following evening and were greeted by all the staff like old friends. We were served again by Lilly and she remembered us by name and what drinks we ordered! Really brilliant service, everyone seems like they are having a great time, the staff seem happy to be there and the whole atmosphere is fantastic. 
Overall the hotel is brilliant, beautiful design and superb service to match it. I can't wait to come back and try STK.",5,2013,04,29
148,"What every hotel should be "" an experience""","My husband had booked for us to stay 2 nights a couple of weekends ago to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.  We had heard that this was the latest cool London hotel but we were wrong, it is ""Uber cool"".  As you step off busy London's streets opposite Waterloo Bridge you are welcomed by a member of staff who is dressed very smartly and obviously enjoys their job. We were then taken to the first floor to the main reception area which the hotel call the Atrium where we received another warm welcome and ""The WOW factor"".  We left our luggage & were taken to the lifts up to the fourth floor.  We were shown to our suite which is very modern and luxurious with small personal touches added such as a personalised message written on the bathroom message welcoming us together with a plate of delicious chocolates with happy first wedding anniversary written on the plate.  We have stayed at many luxury hotel before but we can honestly say they rooms take it to the next level. The large walk-in double shower, bath big enough for 2 and my husband was in his element with the iPad style remote control for lighting, heating & sound. We had turn down service each night where the lighting was turned to ""sexy"" mode.  
The bar on the top floor, Radio bar with its superb views across London is unfortunately TOO popular at certain times as it is the place to go, however as residents we were never turned away & they made sure we had a table within a few minutes. 
Before we had dinner we were invited to the atrium (reception area) for our arrival drink and to be amazed. They have a short light & laser show that blows your mind. My husband know his stuff as he works in audio & visual and it kept him very happy while we watched the show.
We had booked on the first night a table in the STK restaurant which is an AMAZING experience. If you are expecting a quiet candlelit meal for 2, then don't come here this is the exact opposite but my gosh the atmosphere is "" FANTASTIC"" with its pumping music from the live DJ and fabulous food it is a fun place to eat, drink & celebrity spot.
To sum up our weekend stay in the big city for our 1st wedding anniversary I'd say one word ""AMAZING"" an unforgettable experience.. I would also like to say the staff were fantastic. We were made to believe we were celebrities ourselves ( which we're not) that's who good there made us feel. We would especially like to thank the young professional manager who was always there for us. I think his name was Matt Culverhouse.
To answer the most important question of all "" Would we go back"". The answer is YES.",5,2013,04,29
148,Wowed on The Strand!,"Stayed at Me London early in March just after its official opening for my wife's birthday. From the moment  we entered the hotel we were wowed! Of course the architecture and the decor is stunning (Norman Foster designed inside and out) but what really struck us was the warmth of the service we received. The bell boy downstairs, the reception staff and the restaurant and top floor bar team were fantastic.Liked the bedrooms a lot (particularly the amenities) and the view from the bedroom.",5,2013,04,24
148,Great new hotel on the Strand,"I could not have picked a better location for my stay.  Right on the Strand, super modern and comfortable rooms, a fantastic roof bar and a great balcony over looking the Thames this was a wonderful experience.  Albeit there for business I was still able to take in a few sights right from the hotel.  The staff was very helpful and very engaged.  A definite recommendation for business or couple travel.  Not sure how kid friendly this venue might be.  ",5,2013,04,21
148,Possibly the coolest hotel I have ever stayed in.,"I'm just back from a quick overnight stay in the Me and I am pretty sure I will never stay anywhere else in London. The pictures don't do justice to how fantastic this hotel looks, there is a fantastic buzz as soon as you walk in to the lobby. I have stayed in numerous style hotels before and have always verb let down by the lack of service/attention to detail, not in the Me. The staff are extremely professional while remaining very friendly (very unusual for a trendy hotel) the attention to detail in the rooms is excellent, it's so good I'm just home and I'm booking again next month!",5,2013,04,19
148,"Very elegant, but the hotels needs more color.","We were received by a very friendly and helpful staff.

The hotel is very elegant and modern.  I loved the metal decoration in the bar area, but it would be nice to have other colors other than brown and black in the lobby and lifts areas, since it makes the atmosphere too dark.  Bright blues, silver and green for example would still make the hotel look modern, yet, elegant and fun.

Over all a very pleasent diner at the hotel restaurant.",5,2013,04,18
148,"""Hotel Manager?""","My boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel over 2 weeks ago and received excellent customer service from the minute we walked in. We were welcomed by really approachable concierge guys, who were extremely helpful and had answers to all of our questions and made excellent recommendations. Our room wasn't ready yet, which was a little disappointing but we offered a complimentary drink in the lobby bar and was promised it wouldn't be too long. We were served by a lovely girl Sarah who offered to take us on a tour of the hotel whilst we were waiting. I was amazed by the hotel especially the reception on the 1st floor. As soon as we returned to the lobby our room was ready. We were taken to the reception where our room was upgraded due to the wait. AMAZING!

The rooftop bar was amazing, the staff were so friendly, I felt as though we fitted in and we were all friends. 

Upon departure, we asked to leave our bags at the hotel so we could do some last minute sight seeing before our flights. We were offered an umbrella each as it was raining, which I thought was a really nice gesture! Before heading out we decided to have a coffee in the lobby as Sarah was working again and we wanted to say thank you and goodbye. There was a few other tables at the time and she was working alone, but we were served promptly and was excited to see us again, such genuine conversation and not robotic type questions like other hotel staff at other places we have stayed. She went to prepare our drinks in the back room, when our table was approached by a man who introduced himself as the 'hotel manager', dressed in jeans, trainers and a 'puffa' jacket. Asking if we had been served and how long we had been waiting, he was very blunt and rude and completely unprofessional as not wearing a suit or had any business cards. We weren't sure he was actually a member of staff at all. He asked us where we were from!?? When I replied France he didn't seemed to care.

He asked the table next to us the same questions and then his attitude changed and started speaking spanish to them. I felt as though because we weren't Spanish we weren't as welcomed or as important as the table next to us. This part ruined our experience at the hotel. And we felt as though he was undermining Sarah abilities as a waitress. 

Looking forward to returning to ME LONDON in the next few months and hopefully we will feel welcomed by EVERYONE at the hotel this time.",3,2013,04,16
148,The best hotel I have ever been to by a landslide!,"Myself and my girlfriend went over for her birthday. Since it was her first trip abroad I was really nervous to make sure everything went well and ME didn‚Äôt disappoint! We were greeted by the concierge team (great bunch of lads and really approachable!) who escorted us to reception where we were met by a member of the Aura team who brought us to our room, showed us the In‚Äôs and Outs and made us feel about as welcome as possible!

We were given complimentary champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries for her birthday, the room had loads of personal touches that made us feel looked after, the bed was huge and luxurious and despite the negative views on the lighting, I thought the lights were simple to figure out. Not exactly rocket science! The makeup remover was a lovely touch since I had left mine at home!

The turn down was a lovely touch, with bathrobes and slippers laid out, extra coffee for the nespresso machine was given and to the lights turned to ‚ÄúSexy‚Äù mode, which turned the lights pink. Had a chuckle at that!

We had room service mostly, food was beautiful and despite the business of the hotel it was fairly prompt! 

We didn‚Äôt get a chance to get to the rooftop bar as it was absolutely packed but it was a rainy week and I to be hones tthe rest of the hotel was so amazing I didn‚Äôt feel like I missed out on much!

I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel more, the best Ive ever been to!",5,2013,04,11
148,Fantastic hotel and great rooftop bar!!,"Amazing....From the ground floor to the rooftop bar this building is 5 star.
We were greeted at the door and showed around the ground floor, then taken up to the first floor reception and handed a glass of champagne. At reception we were told upon arrival that our room had been upgraded. When we got to our room we were really pleased with it, wouldn't of changed a thing. 
Later in the evening we visited the rooftop bar. we arrived there about 9 o'clock and were the last to leave. 
As soon as the lift doors opened the music hit us and we were off. we went straight to the bar and ordered a number of cocktails. The music was brilliant and the crowd was of mixed ages but that didn't matter. everyone mingled and had a great night.
the barmen were great, remembered our names even though the bar was packed and also remembered what we were drinking.
We will 100% return to the hotel and to the bar, The bar has a really great view of the London skyline that would be hard to beat.",5,2013,04,10
148,Truly fantastic - would definitely recommend,"Upon entering the hotel, we were treated like royalty. We were met by the Aura host Danniel who escorted us to our room where we found complimentary champagne and strawberries dipped in white chocolate. 

Throughout our stay, nothing was too much trouble and the hotel staff could not do enough for us.  Whenever we bumped into Danniel, we were addressed by name and observed him doing the same with other guests (how does he remember all the names?).  

The room was fantastic with mood lighting, massive bathroom, and surround sound TV (speakers in the celling). The food in their Italian restaurant was great quality and really good value for a central London hotel. 

I would definitely book again.

148,Amazing hotel!,Booked this on a whim when we decided to go back to London.  Hotel and staff was amazing.  Room was perfect with mood lighting and modern amenities. Shower was super huge along with a double sink and balcony patio.  Very modern and clean.  Loved the rooftop bar as well.,5,2013,04,08
148,Lovely,"We were invited to the rooftop bar and were also shown round the hotel. The building originally belonged to BBC Radio and has kept some features to preserve its heritsge but at the same time the rooms are ultra modern design. The rooms have adjustable lighting to suit your mood a low flat screen TV. The location is very convenient for Theatreland with the rooftop Radio Bar overlooking Mama Mia.  The lobby has a very unusual and striking design. The check in is done on the peaceful first floor atrium away from the somewhat noisy lobby where there is a bar and two restaurants. The restaurants are very open but excellent value with nice menus but they need to be prebooked. The roof bar and roof cabanas also need to be prebooked at least 48hours before as they have a strict capacity limit and no priority for guests. Capacity is to be extended but I would then have some concerns that it will become busy, noisy and less ambient. The canapes were imaginative, well presented and tasty.",5,2013,04,06
148,Amazing night!!,"Visited the hotel on the star deal last night and all I can say is WOW!  They give you a cocktail on the roof first which is beautiful and has the best view in London, followed by a 3 course dinner in Asellina all for ¬£25!!  The food and service were the best I've had in London.  Truly unbelievable!  I usually steer away from deals due to lack of good service when redeeming.  Sometimes it feels like when they know you are there for an offer they treat you like second class citizens.  Definitely not the case at Asellina.  An amazing night on the cheap!  I feel like I won something!!  Thank you!!",5,2013,04,06
148,"Very new, some way to go to iron out the glitches","Spent three nights here over Easter with my wife.  Firstly, they said they had a car park but in fact it wasn't yet open.  This meant we had fair walk with a suitcase! The hotel had been open one month and they are still trying to work it out.  The concierge people were good both helpful and competent.  Reception is on the first floor and is an extraordinary structure, several floors high in grey marble with light projections of moving stars?  On the Monday morning when we checked out however, there was only one receptionist on duty, so we had to wait whilst another client's travel needs were sorted out.  The evenings were a bit odd.  There is a very posh bar at the top and lots of people wanting to experience it.  This means that the security was a bit oppressive.  We just wanted to summon the lift and go up to our room but a strange character in one of those modern jackets that looks several sizes to small to an oldie like me, wasn't having that.  We had to wait for him to summon the lift and allow us in.  They need to decide whether they are a night club or a hotel.  The two don't go to well together through the one entrance and set of lifts.  The room was fine but no kettle, only an expresso machine with an insufficient number of coffee cartridges (1 real & 1 Decaf)).  A shame, I rather like a cup of tea.  No bath but a reasonable shower.  Big TV against a lot of black shiny plastic. Large but terribly soft bed equals a poor nights sleep and achy hips in the morning.  It had large dips in it and was quite uncomfortable.  There is a lot of black marble in the entrance, reception and the corridors and there always seemed to be someone polishing it!  Worst was the Italian restaurant on the first floor doing breakfast.  Food was OK but the service was really poor.  The staff including a managementy type spent their time chatting to each other and favoured guests whilst the rest of us struggled to attract attention to get more coffee.  The staff were pleasant without exception and I am sure they will get it right in time.",3,2013,04,04
148,Gilberto should run ME London Hotel!,"We stayed in an Aura room for 2 days over Easter. Yes, the rooms, hotel and general design have a wow factor- floating jellyfish in reception wall and the bar at the top. But....ME needs to decide if its a nightclub or a hotel. When we stayed the bar at the top was playing non stop techno music and mostly full of visitors not paying guests and we had to shout at each other to hold a conversation. The restaurant is the same- we had 4 speakers over our dinner table and asked the waitress repeatedly to turn the music down, to no avail. Whilst she was very sympathetic, her manager just ignored our request. Gilberto on the concierge desk is the best asset they have- welcoming, smiley, friendly and locked my camera in the concierge desk because it wouldnt fit in the hotel safe - it's only a strait forward digital SLR! Same complaint as few others about the 2 coffee capsules for guests and no more- why? This is meant to be 5 star!! And when we requested more and freshilk, we got several capsules of both coffee and UHT milk- despite repeating the order. Th Spanish staff are friendly but language problems exist....we felt like outsiders whilst we stayed there and have stayed in many other 5 star hotels and have been treated much better. The lines of club ers waiting to go up in the lift each evening indicated that ME hotel is trying to woo the hipsters in London rather than address the needs of their paying guests. Time will tell if they have learnt the lessons of complaints here on trip advisor as well as in house....and yes the staff do spend all their time cleaning the marble...one even wiped down the lift door before we entered it, which is all very tip top, but really, just change the wretched thumping techno music in the lift, bar and restaurants first?",3,2013,04,03
148,"Great location, great hotel","Very nice and new hotel, the location is perfect for restaurants and theaters, very close to Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly. Considering that is anew hotel service was good, specially the concierges, always helpful and with excellent suggestions. The only part that it should really improve is breakfast, always slow in the service and with just average quality. ",5,2013,04,02
148,Beautiful room and great service,"My husband and I spent three nights in the hotel in a room on the third floor overlooking The Strand.  We were both impressed with the bedroom, the bed was very spacious and comfortable.  The panel on the wall controlling the light and heat was also easy to use and allowed us to have fingertip control of everything.
The room was very clean, despite all the glass tables and the large panel on the wall it was well cleaned and dust free.
The bed turn down service was very nice, dressing gowns were laid out and chocolates were left on the bed.
The bathroom was also very clean and the towels were big, soft and fluffy.  My only slight issue is that the toilet did not have a lid which I found slightly unpleasant, I understand the room is equipped for disabled guests but there must be a solution.  The shower was lovely and spacious and I was glad there was a separate hose attachment as the rainfall head was a bit much for the mornings I did not want to wash my hair.
The reception is also very impressive and all staff that we encountered were very polite and helpful.
All in all it was a beautiful hotel that we would be happy to stay in again.",5,2013,04,01
148,Flash but needs to sort out a few things,"This is a brand new Melia Hotel on the Strand.  We booked it because we wanted to be in the centre of London and we wanted to take our car and park it at the hotel.  Okay so - good things about the hotel - lovely design, very flash, friendly staff welcome you and take you to reception which is just as well otherwise you might not be able to find it as it is on the first floor.  Lots of black marble everywhere which looks fab but they do have to have someone more or less full time cleaning it.  We had a birthday bottle of fizz in the room which was lovely when we arrived.  Free wi fi too.  AC and heating work really well and the lighting is excellent.  Now the not so good - only had breakfast once as it was so disappointing, poached eggs were stone cold, had to beg for coffee and no refill offered, no-one checked if things were okay and staff seemed to be very very hard to attract even though there were loads of them.  Gave up in the end.  Strange because the staff on the ground floor were lovely so friendly and chatty.  So went out after that for breakfasts.  No way to make a cup of tea in the room, then on the second day found out we should have had a coffee machine which did then appear later on that day, but no kettle, just wondered why not when you are paying at least ¬£200 a night is it too much to ask for the ability make a cup of tea??  They also only supply one coffee pod thing which is caffeinated so only one of us could have a cup of coffee, really odd and seems unnecessarily stingy for such a lovely hotel.  Could have done with instructions for the coffee machine too.  Would really have liked a bath, clearly not a standard in this hotel, were not upgraded like other reviewers so maybe that's why.  So overall this is a very lovely looking hotel with no car park as advertised if this matters to you then be aware the nearest one is about 10 minutes walk and you cannot even drop off outside the hotel.  They will valet park but they charge a lot for doing it, again a stingy attitude.  But other than these niggles it is lovely, modern and stylish, very well located for the theatre and getting to central attractions in London.",4,2013,04,01
148,Got upgraded - sexy experience!,"Beautiful contemporary sleek design, brand new hotel in London. They've thought of every little thing to make this place a luxurious yet super modern experience. We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the passion suite - they knew it was my partner's birthday - we had complimentary champagne and strawberries in the room & a special message in the mirror! I cannot tell you how beautiful & stylish this suite is. Huge bath, rain shower, two sinks, candles everywhere, massive wardrobes, amazing bed, living room, great furnishings from the comfy lounge chairs to the luxurious throws, huge mini bar with the most quirky and fun snacks, lighting & surround sound & playstation to keep any man entertained for hours, guest bathroom. The view from the Radio Bar was amazing..one of the best in London - can't wait to return for summer drinks (could improve the music though) Can go on and on. Service was also 5 star - thank you to the staff for making a special occasion so memorable. ",5,2013,03,31

148,sexy lighting!great staff! the best hotel,"Quite frankly I did not know what to expect but the place is just amazing.Head straight to reception have a glass of fizz,be amazed at the light show,head up to radio for the best view of London.Why Go up the shard for ¬£30 when you can have a drink here and impress your clients.the rooms are beautiful with fantastic lighting.There is an lcd pad by your bed to set the mood lighting and I kid you not, there is a 'sexy'button! (see my pictures),my misses attacked me and I almost put my back out.The mini bar is pure crack cocaine to a sugar junkie like me!
We had absoulutly the best nights sleep on the matresses also the toiletries are fantastic too.
I must just thank Gilberto and Kelvin on the Concierge desk who sorted me tickets for the theatre at the very last minute.We will definetly be back!",5,2013,03,29
148,"Pretentious, design-focused, customer forgotten","You arrive in the lobby to face a wall of tubes. But where do you go? No signs. No obvious reception. I saw a desk to the side, which had no signage and asked where my meeting was. They did not know, told me I was wrong, that there was no such meeting there. Then when I showed them the invitation, they said ""oh it must be upstairs"" and one of them then said he would take me. But he didn't he just walked away, then stopped and had a conversation with someone else. Eventually I found where to go by bumping into other delegates also trying to find the meeting room. When you get there - in the basement - it is covered in dark wood making it conducive to sleep rather than work. As one delegate said to me, ""I feel like I am inside a coffin"". The meeting was due to start at 8am, but the meeting room wasn't completely ready just 15 mins before. There were no visible staff from ME London and the organisers had to go and find someone to open up the cloakroom - which should have been open and ready for visitors well ahead of the meeting time, of course. 

This is shambolic for a supposedly high class, signature hotel. These are basics which ""ordinary"" hotels can get right. Having a fancy name, a fancy design and being quirky does not mean you should forget the customer, which appears to have happened. I couldn't recommend this hotel to any of my clients who want a London-based meeting venue.",2,2013,03,26
148,"Great hotel, Visually and Service","Stayed over on a saturday night, we were welcomed with a glass of cava at reception - nice touch, amazing decor, great staff - very friendly and accomodating. Got an upgrade which is always nice. Decent rooms, contemporary but still with character. Clearly a trendy place for drinks. Would reccomend.",5,2013,03,26
148,Amazing hotel,"Like many I'm quite lazy about writing reviews but after our stay at the ME London, I felt I had to write. From the moment we entered the hotel we were truly impressed. 
This isn't any typical London hotel, the hotel is contemporary and stylish, with incredible lighting that gave a feeling of calm and serenity.
The rooms are modern and extremely comfortable, the music selection and play back via surround  sound was a very nice touch. 
Service was excellent through out, from the moment we checked in, to the staff at STK, Cucina Asselina and the Marconi bar, all the staff were a credit to the hotel, customer service at its best .
We will definitely be back and highly recommend this hotel",5,2013,03,25
148,Excellent and Far Far better than we were expecting!,"So many good things to say about this hotel.

To start with the Norman Foster designed hotel is spectacular and unlike anything else you are likely to encounter in London. From its science-fiction 9 story cathedral like reception area through to the in room walkout windows, the design of this hotel hits the mark.

Rooms are of a good size for London as too are the suites, which was my choice on this visit.

Rooms and suites are incredibly well designed and appointed with everything you would need to hand for your stay including your own headed stationery (Not sure many people would use it in this digital age but its still a very nice touch) 

Whilst I would give this hotel 5* for the hotel alone it was not the only 5* thing here.  The staff at this hotel including its superb Restaurant STK and Radio Rooftop Bar seem staffed by something very rarely found‚Ä¶ staff that seem to love what they do and to serve guests needs wherever possible. Genuine smiles that don‚Äôt fade as soon as they think they are out of your sight and helpful and funny wait staff that made us laugh on numerous occasions. We are looking forward to trying the other restaurant and bar on the next visit.

Many other little touches took place throughout the stay that made you feel every bit a VIP, such as being greeted by our Host Daniel who took care of everything for us including outlet bookings and also by a Hotel manager Matt who it seemed had done his research as my partner was greeted with Birthday Wishes (Yes, this visit was part of a Birthday Celebration) even the bathroom mirror had a birthday greeting written on it. 

I can honestly say that there seemed no let up in customer service here as every time we bumped into Daniel and Matt we were greeted by name and asked if there was anything we needed, and not in a false and obtrusive way either.

I could go on and on about this hotel and its amenities which I have only just touched on here 

My Job as the CEO of a Management Consultancy specialising in the hotel industry and a CEO of a Media Company also specialising in the hotel and travel industry I‚Äôm not easily impressed and swayed by hotel blurb and promises‚Ä¶ this time my expectations were exceeded in spades.   

We left the hotel feeling both elated at how we had been treated but also slightly saddened that we had to return to the real world.  

Go for the Hotel, Stay for the Staff‚Ä¶",5,2013,03,25
148,Super Stylish and Excellent Service,"I stayed at the new ME Hotel last weekend, attending a birthday party in London.  This really is Londons best new 5 star hotel.  The hotel is so stylish and oozes contemporary cool.  The staff were very friendly and attentive without being overbearing, as in some more stuffy luxury hotels.  There was constant attendtion to detail such as the personal welcome to the room.  Lots of little touches that make you feel like you are really being looked after.   The fresh fruit platter on the table for breakfast was the perfect way to nibble on something healthy whilst reviewing the menu.  The room had a balcony with amazing views of the river and the city down to the west end.  
The roof top bar has amazing views too, a must go for a drink there even if you are heading on somewhere else.",5,2013,03,25
148,Out of this world!,"I stayed here for a trip to London for a friends 40th and wow what an amazing hotel!  despite being uber cool and high end the staff couldnt not have tried more to be friendly and make my short stay as easy as possible - much of what is provided complimentary would be highly priced extras from other hotel operators but not ""ME"" !! 

Couldnt fault it, bed was seriously big and comfortable, super lux bathroom experience too!  the roof top bar has some of the best views of London available and the breakfast was cooked to order and more than ample - all in all a 6 star experience!",5,2013,03,25
148,Amazing Hotel,"I went to London for the weekend as a treat for my sisters birthday and this has to be the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in.  The design was ultra modern but also extremely inviting, with every door you walked through came a unique and beautiful room - the reception itself was magnificent to view.  Out hotel room was equally stunning with all of your needs catered for including the best view of London's busy Covent Garden from a glass apex window. 
The shower and bathroom area was very plush and perfect for getting yourself pampered and ready for a night out.

The staff at the hotel were so welcoming and helpful and nothing was too much bother, you could tell they enjoyed were the worked and were proud to tell you all about the facilities and what the hotel had to offer. 

We booked the STK restaurant for dinner as recommended by the host at the hotel. The food was superb as was the atmosphere as there was a DJ playing and a busy bar perfect for a girls night out. Would recommend even dining out at STK if you are not staying at the hotel. After dinner we headed to the Radio rooftop bar for some cocktails. 

Overall we had a brilliant weekend and the hotel had so much to offer that we did not even have to leave the hotel with the restaurant and bar. 

Can't wait for my next visit.",5,2013,03,24

More was to follow in London; this is the place that London will be talking about.
2 great restaurants, stunning design and interiors, so quiet that you think that you are in the middle of nowhere, 
Top roof bar, needs bit more atmosphere, however when we visited only hotel guests were allowed.
Impeccably clean a nothing is problem, I needed a pen sharpener for my Lipstick and within 3 minutes of me contacting concierge desk I had sharpener in my hand!!!
Best thing is that you do not have to leave the front door as you have 2 fab restaurants and a Bar.

148,Well deserving of 5*,"I stayed at the ME London for a business trip for one night. I wish I could have stayed for longer, and I don't normally say that about hotels, especially in London.

My office is near Green Park, so wanted to stay somewhere close enough by tube.  I think I could have walked it within 20-30 minutes, but much preferred 3 stops from Covent Garden on the tube.  Lovely to find a tube station that isn't stupidly busy at 8:30am as well.

So, for the hotel.  First of all, the location is absolutely wonderful for the convenience of Covent Garden shops, bars and restaurants, 5 minutes walk to Leicester Square.

Then the hotel.  From the outside it looks nice, but inside it is simply stunning.  The reception area on the 1st floor is very impressive and efficient, with a drink served while you check in.  I stayed in a double room, the entry level and would not have needed more.  The room itself is very spacious, with a huge, extremely comfortable bed.  The gel pillows are a delight to sleep on, so comfortable.  The lighting in the room and the TV choices were fantastic.  There was a big bottle of water, olives and grissini sticks waiting for me when I got in.  The bathroom is fantastic, you walk in to a double sink, on the left hand side is a big rainfall shower and on the right is the toilet.  The toiletries provided were of very high organic standard, and lovely to see that mouthwash and face cleanser were also provided.

Breakfast included was continental, which was a meat and cheese platter, fruits, bread, tea and fresh juice as well as two eggs cooked to your choice.  Plenty enough and very high quality.  To upgrade to a full english it would have only cost an extra ¬£5.

All in all, so far the best hotel I have stayed at in London.  So modern and chic in its decor, great service and stunning, perfect rooms.  Very happy and can't wait to return.",5,2013,03,21
148,Totally blown away!,"Having stayed in a lot of London's top hotels, last night stay in the newly opened Me London totally surpassed them all. From the warm welcome to the beautifully designed interior this hotel ticked every box. We had a great nights sleep on a really comfy bed, I wanted to take the pillows home with me! The roof top bar was lively and had a really good vibe about it. Unfortunately for us the restaurant was fully booked but we had lunch in the Italian restaurant where the friendly chef from Genova created one of the best Italian meals I have had outside of Italy! Every member of staff we came in contact with were friendly, smartly presented (great uniforms!) and could not be more helpful! Going back to the room, the mini bar was the best stocked mini bar I have ever seen! The decor is modern and fresh and I have to say they have got it right! One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!",5,2013,03,17
148,"New Favorite in London..Modern, Classy, Cozy","Brand new hotel so everything is fresh and spotless.  Comfy bed, good service, fun light show with cava upon arrival.  This is an edgy, young, modern hotel so if you are not in to black on black corridors and stark white rooms this is not for you.

Great food brought to my room by lovely people.  The bar atop the hotel has some not so fabulous people serving there as they must believe that in order to work in a hip/edgy/modern space you must act entitled but they cant spoil the great view.

Ive been here 3 times now in the last month and will stay again.",5,2013,03,15
148,Has potential - still working things out,"I recently stayed at the ME London for one night when visiting friends in London. As such, the hotel is nicely designed and the rooms are well done. It is, however, obvious that they just opened - there are still some finishing touches missing to live up to what ME claims to offer.

In more detail:

Pros:
- Standard room quite big for London - including a very nice bathroom with a pleasant rain shower and two sinks;
- leather on the walls (!) - I loved touching it
- excellent sound isolation
- very efficient return service after I lost an item in my room - it reached me back home within days
- location is great

Cons:
- when arriving, only one receptionist was available - waiting time was quite long;
- no welcome drink offered (see other reviews) - felt a bit as a second class guest;
- instead, I found a bottle of wine in my room (which as such is good), but the accompanying letter was addressed to someone completely else - Mrs. Gaudry, should you read this, thanks a lot for letting me drink your wine :-)
- breakfast service extremely slow - very friendly people working in the restaurant, but they mixed orders up even though there were only a few customers and the waiting time was not acceptable;
- phones in room don't work - apparently, they have to be switched on, but this doesn't work without an instruction (which was not there);
- safe was closed and locked - but I couldn't use the phone to call the reception, as the phone didn't work (see above);
- window of standard room very small;
- price on the steep side for what it is - I stayed there on a corporate rate, but the regular ones are not justifiable until the ME has eradicated the flaws I mentioned.

Overall, I would consider staying there again, but only once they have trained their staff properly.

Having said that, every member of staff was very friendly and smiled all the time. Great! Keep the work up and you'll be getting there!",3,2013,03,15
148,Such friendly staff in such a swanky hotel,"On arrival you are greeted by an very welcoming concierge team; this welcome straddles all the staff though a 4pm check in (as the rooms weren't ready at 3pm) when you are in London for a night out certainly rankled with a few. 

My wife was speaking at a Design Conference in the hotel so our costs were met by the organisors and subject to a conference rate. That said the conference facilities are great and technical staff well informed and helpful. 

If you can cope with living in a twightlight zone in the loos and corridoors and walking around by touching the walls then the design of the interior is stunning even if to my untrained eye the reception area felt a bit like the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. 

Bedroom fixtures are space age (wasn't sure about the pink 'sexy' light settings - it really does say sexy) and they have provided both continental as well as UK plug sockets so if you are coming from Europe, no need for adapters.

The array of beautiful people who arrived for Saturday night cocktails suggests this is one of THE places to be.  

I'd heartily recommend it even though we baulked at ¬£25 per head for breakfast.",5,2013,03,11
148,"Incredible hotel , just sensational . This is a must experience .","This hotel is wonderful , it was a very special experience and was the perfect venue for my wife's birthday . The whole design is incredible , the bedrooms are just at the cutting edge of technology ,whilst at the same time with its Egyptian  cotton sheets , views across London and special touches really nice . Break fast room service was good and the staff in general could not have been more helpful, friendly or professional .
The hotel's bars were fun , although the upstairs bar very busy . The STK restaurant was really good , despite being a busy Saturday night the standard of rice and food was really top notch , it was also not expensive .
Will without doubt return .",5,2013,03,11
148,perfect hotel in a perfect location,"I stayed in this hotel last weekend -  one word WOW! the room was spectacular. Not sure why people are moaning about the hotels light switches because its pretty straight forward. The brakfast that was included was fantastic. No buffet, all brought to your table for you. the staff are so friendly and will do anything to make you comfortable. didnt head to rooftop bar as it had just opened and we knew it would be busy. 
there was work going on directly outside below our room, the hotel is so well soundproofed, we did not hear a thing!
location is perfect, right on the strand so within walking distance to everywhere really. 
i am very impressed with this hotel and will most definately be recommending this to my customers. Thank you once again for having us. Incredible Hotel!!!",5,2013,03,11
148,Stunning Hotel - Wonderful Staff,"I stayed here last week to celebrate my engagement. It was mind-blowing. The 7pm Light show is completely unique. The Staff are lovely and the room was brilliant. STK is a super restaurant downstairs - and the top vfloor bar is wonderful.
A great location and an amazing experience!. Wx",5,2013,03,10
148,Magical Stay,"My husband and I had a magical stay at the ME London this week. The hotel is beautifully designed, very well appointed and centrally located by Covent Garden, the theatres and the Thames. The view from the roof-top bar is breathtaking and a real treat. The staff were very welcoming and accommodating and clearly took pride in their role to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Highly recommended; we shall return.",5,2013,03,09
148,Impressive Hotel,Very impressive hotel in a very good location. Radio rooftop bar is a must - a unique London bar with spectacular views. The rooms were very modern and fresh. All staff were excellent and the service from the 'Aura team' was second to none. The ME hotel is a must try and I will certainly look at returning very soon. ,5,2013,03,06
148,Cool hotel and great service,"Stayed here last weekend and had a really lovely time.  I really liked the fact that the check in desk is not on the ground floor.  The concierges are all extremely helpful.

Everything is very triangular.  The reception is a pyramid going all the way up the centre of the hotel all the way to the rooftop bar and they have a light show in the evening, which I hear is very good (we didn't make it as were out at the time).  

The general styling of the hotel was really appealing to me.  Loved the high shine black marble.  Others may find the corridors too dark, but for me the styling worked.  

The corridors are all triangular to go around the central pyramid and the windows in the room were the same, they jut out and it was quite interesting to be able to stand in them.  My other half was more keen as I don't like heights.  We had a mode room and the mood lighting pad was a good touch.  The beds here are probably the most comfortable I have slept in for a long time, really excellent.  I want one! 

Our toilet door had dropped slightly but as this is a brand new hotel it was just a case of it needing to be snagged.  I am absolutely sure this will have been fixed by now.  

The general ambiance of this hotel is Mediterranean which I liked very much.  It was relaxed and all the staff seemed to me to be focused on service - even the housekeeping staff who were constantly polishing.  This is a very clean hotel!

Had breakfast in the Cuchina Asellina and I opted for continental style (great meat and cheeses) and my partner had an English breakfast.  Both were lovely and my fruit salad was excellent!  

The Marconi lounge bar on the ground floor has a lovely feel to it and a great atmosphere in the evening too, but the real star when it comes to the bars is the rooftop bar.  Visit, even if it is just for one drink and the opportunity to sit out on the roof terrace.  The views are excellent.  At ¬£10 I didn't think the cocktail costs were too high either for a nice hotel in London either - worth it for the view alone! You can also look down the top of the pyramid in the centre back down to reception (my partner tells me it was rather 'cool')

Great proximity to Covent Garden and the river.  Would definitely look at going back again!",5,2013,03,06
148,"Cucina Asellina, lovely food, excellent service, great cocktails",This is actually only a restaurant review as we did not stay in the hotel.  We ate here pre-theatre so the restaurant was fairly quiet.  Staff were very attentive and efficient and the food was well prepared and presented.  It's a relatively short menu but with some interesting offerings.  My pistachio crusted halibut was excellent as was my husband's tagliata of beef.  There is a small selection of wines by the glass as well as a full wine list.  The cocktails shoudn't be missed.,5,2013,03,05
148,"Great, friendly service and Stunning design!","I loved it!!! Great location, but even better hotel experience!! The rooms (I stayed in an Aura room) are stylish, bright, sophisticated and elegant, but still confortable and cozy. The members of the staff are relaxed, welcoming and kind..great athmosphere!
I think I'll visit again in the future",5,2013,03,05
148,'THE place to stay',"Wow, what can I say? This hotel blew me away. It is achingly hip. We were upgraded to the PASSION SUITE as it was my birthday. It was gorgeous with a separate lounge and floor to ceiling windows. You press the 'Sexy' button on the lighting panel and the room turns pink! The location is great as it is so close to Covent garden. The best thing for me was that STK restaurant is in the hotel. The Radio bar is worth a visit too. From the terrace you can see the Shard, The Guerkin and the courtyard of Somerset house. The website does not do the hotel justice, you have to go and see it for yourself.",5,2013,03,05
148,A Wonderful Hotel,"I cannot praise this hotel enough. We arrived prior to check-in time and wanted to just store our luggage as we were due to see the matinee performance of a West End Show. The Aura Host insisted on taking us to reception to enquire if the room was availaible. The very polite and prompt receptionist checked us in with no fuss and advised our room was indeed ready.
We were in a Vibe room which is quite simply stunning. The light control panel is very user friendly and a great way to control zone lighting, The lighting effect around the TV area is also a brilliant touch, 
As far as bathrooms go this has to be one of the best I have come accross. The rain Forest concept walk in wet room shower is fantastic and the double sinks are a great touch. 
I also strongly recommend you watch the daily light show which is held at 7pm in reception. Sit on the comfy sofas with a glass (or two !) of complementory champagne and be completly dazzled by the visual effects being projected onto the pyramid wall above your head.
We also enjoyed a drink on the 10th floor Radio bar where the views accross London are stunning. Even though this was the first night the bar was open to the public it was still very easy to be served and to find a seat to enjoy the views.
We ordered room service the next morning for breakfast which again was fantastic. All items were still hot and the food was excellent.
All in all if you wish to experience a new, modern, centrally located 5* delux hotel then ME London is well worth a visit.",5,2013,03,04
148,Stunning Hotel,"Work and social wise I use many of London's top hotels and put simply this hotel is stunning. The staff couldn't be more helpful and the rooms are amongst the best for their price in London. We went up to the rooftop Radio bar before dinner and the views are fabulous - if you want a cocktail in a great location head there.

The hotel is ideally placed for the West End and the rooms are trendy and work very well. 

The minute we walked through the door the staff were friendly and professional, checkin is swift and as a reception area just look all the way up the pyramid to the roof bar on the 10th floor. 

I suspect this hotel will do very well - we liked the 'Met' in it's first few years, this is better.",5,2013,03,03
148,Bring Some Ear Plugs...,"Booked for the Saturday following Valentine's Day as a treat for the wife. Wanted to find something special in a great location, and the images of the rooms and in particular, the rooftop bar looked perfect.

As this was a major part of why I decided to book the hotel, I was annoyed to be told when we were checking in that the rooftop bar was closed for a private function (Fashion Week Party). No information about this at the time of booking or before we arrived. Unacceptable.

The room was great however. We had one of the Aura rooms overlooking the Aldwych and the window where you almost step out of the hotel was a nice feature. However, the music from the hotel's downstairs restaurant (STK) where there was a DJ playing in the evening was at a ridiculous level until the early hours. Had to ring the reception at 1:30am to find out what was going on. You don't expect to pay ¬£300 a night for a room to be disturbed at ANY time of the day or night. They've spent a lot of money soundproofing the rooms but clearly not the restaurant/bar downstairs. The receptionist was very apologetic and gave me a few options: ear plugs (I kid you not), a change of room at half 1 in the morning with me and the missus in bed? Not exactly ideal. She eventually said she would try and get the music turned down, which did happen to be fair, but you could still hear it. 

I sent an email to the hotel to complain about these issues, but have yet to receive a reply. Not impressed. 

Oh, and if you like tea, bring your own tea bags and a kettle....",3,2013,02,28
148,It was certainly an experience,"I was met by a charming 'Aura host' and he welcomed me to the ME Experience. Yes it was an experience but one I never want to repeat. The room was gloomy not helped by the fact that many of the lights did not work. Electricity for lights and appliances went off frequently or just did their own thing. A journey down the dark corridors led me to a crowded desk where I waited a a long time to register my complaints. I could not point our my concerns to the Aura Host because my room phone didn't work and there was no reception for my mobile. Checkout involved a long slow queue again giving me concerns about getting to the airport in time. I was so looking forward to experiencing this new 5* hotel but it seems to struggle to reach 3* standards. However, a friend who recommended it to me stayed there 5 weeks ago and seemed to experience much better service.",1,2013,02,27
148,Fantastic London Hotel !!,What a fantastic stay at the new ME London..... the views from the roof top bar are amazing and the rooms are beautiful.    Location is great and we walked to the Tate Modern and over to Buckingham Palace.    One great thing is that the hotel is that it's a total renovation and really well done so you don't hear any street or hallway noise in the rooms.    We happened to be there during Fashion Week and the hotel was filled with models and a great vibe.,5,2013,02,24
148,Wow night out,"We had to pleasure of a birthday night out here for my hubbie.  From the moment we walked in the door we were looked after by really attentive, smiling staff who genuinely wanted to ensure we had a great stay.  The downstairs lounge bar is perfect for meeting friends to pre-dinner drinks, which we did.  We will definitely do this even is not staying overnight.  Service was excellent.  The room was very glam and the bathroom was huge, perfectly equipped and had the soft touches of welcoming messages from staff.  We hit the bar in STK late, but the diners were all still there having a great time.  Music was great.  We went from there to the roof top terrace which has amazing view in both directions on the Thames.  Not only that but the bar itself is a fab venue for late drinks and great views.  Again, staff were really making every effort.  Be careful: after a great night out the block out shutters in the rooms are exceptional so we slept until mid-day!!!  Overall, a great treat; amazing very glam hotel with real atmosphere.",5,2013,02,17
148,Still has teething problems to solve,"This brief stay didn't get off to a great start. Our confirmation email stated check-in after midday so we were disappointed that in fact it is 3pm. The (only) receptionist was apologetic and had no idea what their emails stated - I forwarded it to them.
We left our bags and headed out. They were safely in our room when we eventually got it - although the bell boys had thought they had lost them and after two hours of looking came up to the room to apologise only to be relieved- a School boy error but symptomatic of an establishment not running smoothly but still charging as if it was. The hotel itself is pretty cool, high quality fit out, staff largely friendly. The hotel was however a little overrun by London fashion week and they looked as if they were struggling to cope. Elevators were not running smoothly and it seemed party guests (on various floors) were being given priority over paying guests - this they really need to sort out and quickly.Hotel turn down service at 11.10pm probably a bit late for most! Overall a mixed stay - same receptionist friendly and apologetic at checkout (again on her own) - would probably wait until they bed down a bit more. Not as if London is short of well run high quality hotels.",3,2013,02,17
148,Needs to improve,"Here's summary of my pros and cons during our stay at the ME London Hotel 

Pros :
‚Ä¢	Location, location, location ! Great !
‚Ä¢	Very hip hotel, nice design
‚Ä¢	Comfy beds
‚Ä¢	Nice and very friendly staff members
‚Ä¢	Tasty breakfast 
‚Ä¢	Rooms are clean and silent

Cons :
‚Ä¢	We got first a room for guests with disability (tools for handicap in bathroom, wardrobe at wheelchair height, shower curtain etc‚Ä¶) 
After 1 night we asked for another room, which was no problem
‚Ä¢	The second room‚Ä¶ air conditioning didn't work, room temperature was always over 24¬∞, I could not sleep that night, I asked to change our room again‚Ä¶ 
‚Ä¢	The final and best room, I was sitting on the toilet and my partner was lying on the bed and there was someone who suddenly came in our room, without knocking first. 
She said there was a problem with the toilet, my boyfriend told the lady that there was no problem and that I was on the toilet, but she stayed at the door and asking if we would check it out‚Ä¶I called out again that I was sitting on the toilet and that I want to have my privacy. 
Later on she knocked again on our door, to apologize that it was the toilet in the room next to us. 
‚Ä¢	The breakfast is good, but you have to wait at least 20-30 minutes to get it. Also when you ask for a second coffee the waiting time is way too long.
‚Ä¢	We had no complimentary water (in each of the 3 rooms)
‚Ä¢	For my opinion the hotel and hotel service is not worth 5stars ‚Äòyet‚Äô
‚Ä¢	The price is not proportional to the quality of the hotel",3,2013,02,17
148,Out of this world,"I stayed here for a long weekend (Fri to Mon) with my best friend in a ""vibe"" room. I was met at the door by a very friendly young man who took me up to the reception area which is just amazing - you have to see it to believe it. It's a pyramid with smooth marble walls and a skylight at the top. Don't miss the light show at reception at 7pm every day - complete with comfy sofas and a glass of bubbly.

The room was immaculate, very modern with white leather walls and a touch-screen panel to control the lights and air conditioning. Playing around with the colours of the mood lighting is fun. The bathroom was spacious and very well equipped - hairdryer with a flat nozzle and a diffuser, quality products and an amazing walk-in shower. The beds are very comfortable and even though we were looking right out over the Strand there is absolutely no noise from the street which was great. 

Breakfast was good, although on the Saturday and Sunday the service for coffee and tea was a little chaotic. We also used the rooftop bar which has a terrace with amazing views of the city - a must if you are staying here. 

Location is great - a stone's throw from Covent Garden and a short walk from Charing Cross tube station. 

The staff were all super helpful and attentive to making our stay as good as possible. I was really impressed by this hotel which is definitely out of the ordinary and by the staff who go out of their way to make your stay perfect.",5,2013,02,16
148,IMPRESSIVE hotel. You'll love it! IMPRESIONANTE,"I had the chance to stay at ME London on February 13th. I have travelled to London several times to other hotels, but I must say that this hotel is a totally new and amazing experience.
The service is outstanding, either at reception, bar, restaurants... I was lucky and I could try the Radio Bar at the rooftop... Stunning views over the Thames, London Eye, OXO tower, etc. Great food and drinks. And I had dinner at STK. What to say... another incredible experience: waiters, food, cocktails, music,... Everything!
The room is lovely and the bathroom is gorgeous; I love their bath amenities and their shower. And also their bathrobes, towels (new, soft, big) and slippers.
TV and lighting needs some training! :) Nice wardrobe.
So I promise I will go back to ME London!
________
En resumen: Uno de los hoteles que m√°s me ha impresionado en los √∫ltimos a√±os. Las vistas √∫nicas de Londres, los restaurantes (STK es un restaurante-club nocturno que hay que disfrutar al menos una vez), el bar con terraza en la planta 10, el show de luces de la recepci√≥n (todos los d√≠as a las 7 PM; yo casi me lo pierdo y es indispensable). El servicio es increible. Y la habitaci√≥n y el ba√±o son maravillosos de dise√±o, equipamiento y espacio (me aloj√© en una habitaci√≥n Aura, la m√°s b√°sica; no puedo ni imaginar c√≥mo ser√°n las habitaciones de mayor categor√≠a!).",5,2013,02,15
148,"Perfect location, ultimate in cool !","Just returned from a weekend stay at the new Me London Hotel. Firstly the location--could not be better, on the Strand right in the centre of Covent Garden opposite Drury Lane within walking distance of all the theatres. This Norman Foster designed hotel is truly unique with a hollow pyramid the full height of the centre of the building and the rooms on the outside , try and stay as high as you can as the views are amazing,or you can go to the cocktail bar on the top floor to avail yourself of the fantastic London skyline---dusk is the best time. The rooms are perfect with everything you could wish for with relaxing light tones and pillows and beds that guarantee you a great nights sleep. The staff are not only there to help you but welcome you as a long lost friend with nothing too much trouble. The hotel offers a relaxed and chilled atmosphere without the 'stuffiness' of some of the other 5* hotels in London. A must is a meal at the STK restaurant. This restaurant served the finest steak I have ever eaten, there is also an Italian restaurant -but we didn't have time to try it .....maybe next time.     
All in all a perfect weekend, beautiful hotel with amazing views, fantastic, friendly and professional staff,great food and a perfect location, what more could you ask for!!!.",5,2013,02,15
148,The staff are great!,"Amazing hotel.  Made more amazing by the staff and the interior design.  I stayed one night.

On arrival you are taken to the first floor where you'll find reception.  You are standing inside a pyramid with projections on the walls, a skylight on the roof.  The staff uniform is modern and fits with the look of the hotel.  Everyone I came across in the hotel knew my name!

Initially put in a room on the first floor, I had some work to do.  The room has a desk but I constantly was getting static shocks from the table.  Wear long sleeves.  Looks great though.  In the end I had to be moved for other reasons, and got a larger room on the 7th floor.  Both were adequate but if I were to stay again I would probably pay for the larger size.

The bar on the roof has a great view.  The only slight negative was the security.  I met some friends at the hotel and took them upstairs to the bar.  The security man was very unwelcoming, verging on aggressive.  You need a room key to get there, so I was obviously a guest, yet before opening the door to the terrasse he demanded to see my room key.  Later, when one of my party tried to find the gents toilet, he shouted at them!

All in all, a great new addition to the London hotel scene.",5,2013,02,14
148,Me London Great Experience!,"El fin de semana del 9 al 11 de Febrero nos alojamos en el hotel con mi fam√≠lia. El hotel es precioso, nuevo, y su localizaci√≥n es simplemente INCRE√çBLE!. Todas las personas que trabajan en el hotel nos han atendido muy bien y las habitaciones, su limpieza y su preparaci√≥n ha sido tambi√©n excelente.El desayuno buffet muy rico, con alimentos de calidad y un trato muy atento por parte de todos los camareros/as. No os podeis perder el Rooftop bar, las vistas y sus cocteles.  Muy recomendable si viajais a Londres, no s√≥lo por su maravillosa localizaci√≥n, sin√≥ tambi√©n por el  EXCELENTE trato.

This last weekend my family and I stayed at ME LONDON. The hotel is gorgeous!, new and its location is PERFECT!. All the staff have been really helpfull and kind, rooms were very clean and always ready. Breakfast buffet was great with quality products and a very nice treatment by waitress. Don't miss the Rooftop bar! views and cocktels are great!. Highly recomended if you are travelling to London, incredible location and lovely staff!.

148,Charming Staff & Special Surroundings,"I have rarely been anywhere where the staff have been more helpful and charming.  To get such treatment in the centre of London, was a revelation.  The roof top bar has the most wonderful views over the Thames.  The room was very well appointed, the ensuite spotless.  I did not have dinner at the hotel during my stay, but the breakfasts were very good with a lot of choice.  My only gripe was the lack of carparking, which I believe has yet to be finished.  It would have been helpful if valet parking could have been offered in the interim.  Thank you ME London, I look forward to staying with you again.",5,2013,02,12
148,"Smart, central, easy going, cool, relaxed, modern hotel","We had a 200 person event here and then stayed the night along with other guests at the event. Very efficiently organised by Candice at the hotel. Two great restaurants STK and Italian. Excellent, relaxed, clean and well designed modern rooms. Central for London visits and Covent gdn and theatre land. ",5,2013,02,12
148,"Me, unique experience in the heart of London","Me London is a different concept in all aspects, really an experience where modernity seeks excellence and service. It has a young staff, excited in the project and very professional. Special mention to Ronan, Claire, Valentina and Raul, his attentions and recommendations were most helpful.
 Rooms are comfortable with excellent detail, high quality natural bath amenities, food tasting each evening. The breakfast area with great views from the Radio Bar, shame we could not enjoy the buffet, the attention and a la carte breakfast we received and the compensated for everything. 
Has two great restaurants, the Italian was correct missing enhance presentations extras like cocktails and drinks should be same level as restaurant menu. Stk London is the star restaurant, we chose not regret it. its modern and chic, made us feel that did not suit our profile more familiar, so we chose Italian. 
Traducci√≥n
highly recommended hotel for couples who want to give a treat, really worth purely Spanish style.
We back soon.",5,2013,02,10
148,Extremely Disappointing,"Unfortunately my recent stay at ME London was extremely disappointing! I am not usually posting reviews or  filling in questionnaires. I fully understand mistakes happen however staff need to be trained to deal with them in a quick and professional manner. There was a problem upon check out that they were totally unprepared to deal with. I am a MAS rewards card holder and have stayed at Melia hotels for years. From this point on I will seriously consider before booking them again. I was in a hurry to catch a plane and did not have time to wait for them forever, so they promised to sort it out additionally. My stay was around 20 Feb. and until this date there is NO feedback from them whatsoever!! Besides, I sent emails and spoke to them. All they said was they were looking into it and would get back. 

This is unacceptable for a 5 star establishment. Moreover, this is a new one that is expected to attract clients. And Service can make or break any client experience. At ME it is beyond unsatisfactory.

I would strongly advise against staying there until they get their act together.",2,2013,02,08
148,Irritating Hotel.....it reminded me of the kings new clothes story.....someone just has to say how silly this place is.,"Great design but not that practical.
Rooms are great size with really modern interior. Loved the views and the roof terrace. Light show in reception was fun.....but a bit pointless.
However.....the hotel has no soul , is dark , pretentious and just irritating! Why? Dark corridors, poor signage , no tea in our room, tv didn't work, radio didn't work. Getting the lights on in your room needs a science degree....what's wrong with just having switches? Being served breakfast by some guy dressed in black wearing headphones is just ludicrous. Still couldn't get a pot of tea at breakfast ..... What is wrong with a simple pot of tea....doesn't it fit with the fashion statement? 
Where do you expect to check out? Went with cases to front door desk. Told reception is on first floor.....back down dingy corridors, up lift , check out and then all the way back down again.....come on your having a laugh.
All in all, if you want to make a fashion statement ,stay here. If you just want an excellent hotel in London, I suggest there are many much better hotels.",3,2013,02,07
148,Stunning place.... Service to improve,"Have been recently for some drinks in the lobby lounge and loved the atmosphere and contemporary, hip but minimalistic design. Had cocktails of decent quality (nothing to brag about). Service was terribly slow, hope it will improve with time. Had the feeling the staff was more concerned on wiping our table (3 times) than serving guests. Looking forward to return once settled in and used to more than two occupied tables. Keep up the work, has stunning potential. ",3,2013,02,05
148,Highly recommended new hotel in London!,"I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend on the 26th January and the impression was excellent.
From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we experienced a 5 star service: very warm welcome by the staff at the front door. Since it was our anniversary, we got an upgrade to a lovely room with a balcony on the 9th floor with great views over London and also a complimentary bottle of cava in the room which was very much appreciated as well.
Spotless room, really comfi bed, spacious bathroom with a fantastic rain shower and modern and chic deco throughout the room and the public areas. The reception deco is so different to many other hotels, it really has the wow factor!
We dined at the STK Restaurant and the food was delicious together with the service‚Ä¶the atmosphere in the restaurant absolutely great and their cocktails are just amazing! Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt manage this time to try the Radio Bar at the roof top, good excuse to go back!
The location of the hotel is ideal for both tourism and business, very close to Trafalgar square and right on the Theatreland.
Definitely I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London, it won¬¥t disappoint.Thanks very much to the staff at the Me London for this wonderful experience :)

148,"ME London - what a cool hotel, fantastic location, it was well worth it","We stayed here on Saturday night. The hotel is great, the staff (Marsha and Salvatore) were especially great, made us feel most welcome and like nothing was too much effort to make our stay one to remember. I was impressed by the tv/music system in the room and the speakers in the room and bathroom. The rain shower was really good too, great water pressure. The lighting was cool, it has various settings to change the mood and style of the room. There was the biggest minibar selection I have ever seen. And one last thing, the towels are amazing! On the whole the whole experience is well thought out and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Im looking forward to my next opportunity to stay. ",5,2013,02,04
148,Amazing,"We have just spent the weekend at the new ME London hotel in the strand.  we were greeted by a very friendly member of staff who took us to the first floor reception, which is absolutely amazing.  If you look up you can see the sky (which is about 11 floors up).  after checking in we were escorted to our room on the 5th floor.  The corridors are all very dark with beautiful granite and gorgeous flowers.  Our room was lovely with a huge bed and because it was our anniversary a bottle of champagne and strawberries were laid out for us,  a really lovely thought.  
The shower in the bathroom was huge and could easily fit 4 people! we heard no noise from the traffic outside even though it was saturday night and the streets were really busy.  We had cocktails in the radio bar and would have loved to have sat outside to appreciate the view but it was too cold even though we were offered blankets.  we have vowed to go back in the summer.  we then had a meal in the Italian restaurant on the ground floor which had a really lovely lively atmosphere, our waitress was very friendly and efficient. All in all a wonderful experience and i defy anyone not to have a good time while they are there.  The location is superb and a wonderful place to stay if you are going to the theatre. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make our stay a memorable one.",5,2013,02,04
148,Needs time to improve,"I went there for a one night stay. Got there and no parking. It hasnt opened the car park yet but the consierge guided us to a car park. The hotel is beautiful- the rooms, food and drink also good. However the service wasnt good enough for a 5*.  It seems as if the staff dont fully understand english and dont take in what you ask for as i had to ask for toast 4 times before i got any. Also staff just walked in the room without knocking first. On a good note, when we left the room they had been in and replaced things, and also of an evening they had laid out the slippers and dressing gowns. It is a lovely hotel and wouldnt like to put anyone off, i just hope the service improves for the future",4,2013,02,03
148,"Expected 5 star service, felt more as if I stayed at Faulty Towers.","Where should I start? TV not working, problems with water, swipe card not working in the lifts, unhelpful staff, no wifi. No phone reception (got o2 and 3) and ohh, pitch black corridors, mine (8th was boiling hot).
The list is long. Personally I would describe it as disaster and disappointment.
Was expectinh more from reading the reviews but they are clearly biased or flawed.
On the plus side:
Location, love the theatre district

Great restaurants in the immediate area
Close to Charing Cross",2,2013,02,01
148,Stunning place.... Service to improve,"Have been recently for some drinks and loved the atmosphere and contemporary, hip but minimalistic design. Had cocktails of decent quality (nothing to brag about). Service was terribly slow, hope it will improve with time. Had the feeling the staff was more concerned on wiping our table (3 times) than serving guests. Looking forward to return once settled in and used to more than two occupied tables. Keep up the work, has stunning potential.",3,2013,01,30
148,"New, hip, great design","Newly opened. Entrance was overwhelming with a party going on in the lobby. A bit too much for a tired traveller but it was a great athomsphere. Reception area is impressive. If you are in the neighbourhood, just have a look. Rooms are great, towels are still very  soft, bathrobe had artificial fur. Really fluffy, great feeling. Great red wine from the wine bar. I'm a fan of the W hotels but this hotel can match it. Service of the porter was a bit over the top, more or less grabbing your luggage out of your hands. Probably some learning and experience is needed. 

Only the gym was a dissappointment. Limited room and equipment. No water in the gym available, and no clock. Tv screens on the tredmills didn't work.",4,2013,01,30
148,i just went for drinks and a meal and found it amazing,"The roof top bar will become a destination bar in no time, with the view and the pleasant staff they have a winning combination.  The Atrium is AMAZING and the light show something special.

When he was in the room, he left us several details of the size of a great luxury hotel worker, such as a bottle of champagne and a personalized letter.

We would like to make a special mention of Paula (Aura team), who made it possible for us to feel at home‚Ä¶ a charming and super professional person.
We stayed for a few days in December in a beautiful, modern and very spacious room. The entire hotel is full of details. It appears to be a hotel for adults but children are very welcome! They were delighted (and so were we).
The buffet breakfast is great, varied and quality.
As for restaurants, we had a chance to try Italian and we really had the best carbonara of our lives (although everything we ordered was good).

Additionally, we were pleasantly surprised to find a Dyson hairdryer in the room, which was a much appreciated touch. The suite was perfect for my husband, young daughter and I as we had all the space we needed to be comfortable.

But what really made us feel special was the surprise of the balloons that were waiting for us upon arrival. It was a lovely gesture on the part of Jaime, one of the managers, which made our daughter feel excited and welcome.

148,What a great stay,"We have been staying at the Melia London almost since it opened, and the service continues to improve. The room booked on the 6th floor was quite spacious with a large shower and views of the theater.

Javier was attentive to the entire experience during the stay and Claudia was in charge of facilitating our check out. Luciano, the duty manager, made sure that nothing was missing. The concierge experience is unbeatable, Victor prepared a plan so that the short time was made the most of, with suggestions for everything.

The reason: Claudia Farrona, Front Office Shift Leader, at Hotel Me London. For us, attention in Spanish is essential when we go to a Spanish chain like Meli√°. Furthermore, Claudia stood out for her treatment, professionalism, seriousness and empathy. She made our stay better and was always there when we needed her. In this review I cannot ignore Jaime Evora, Aura Manager of the Hotel, who was in charge of improving our stay in an exceptional way.

I want to highlight the attention of Luciano, he has made my stay at this hotel superior thanks to his instructions and advice.

You can see that he is a great professional, always with a smile on his face and willing to help, congratulations to the company for being able to have a person like that.",5,2023,12,04
148,Lack of maintenance in the rooms,"My experience at the 5-star hotel was generally satisfactory, although there are some aspects that I would like to highlight. The maintenance of the sink left a lot to be desired, as the water was not draining properly, causing discomfort when using it. Additionally, the shower pressure was quite low, making it difficult to have a relaxing and revitalizing shower. As for the sunlight in the room, it would be preferable to have curtains that would allow it to be regulated, since on certain occasions the room was too bright. Mention that when you enter the room, the smell of drains is horrible.

Despite these drawbacks, I must mention that the service and attention of the staff was excellent, especially Viktor who helped us book several tours. Thanks to him, the experience at this hotel was not so affected and for that, we are very grateful.
However, to maintain its 5-star status, the hotel should pay more attention to room maintenance and consider options to improve water pressure in showers and sunlight control.",3,2023,09,05
148,Safe bet ! Amazing hotel! I recommend it 200%,"I recommend the Meli√° London Me for several reasons: unbeatable location. You can do London walking from east to west. Tourist bus stop with three different lines included. Private parking. Excellent level of service, both in reception and restoration. Stunning views from the roof are worth the brunch. Opting for paying a little more at the hotel level undoubtedly has its compensation. The views from Waterloo Bridge next door are worth it during the day and at night. We will return without a doubt. Highlighting the very original decoration of the building, Foster took a gamble and won. The staff serves you with great affection and is very qualified. You can see the difference in all kinds of details. Mahou present in the mini bar! A complete success.",5,2023,08,11
148,Me + MeLondon quality guarantee,"MeLondon's Aura team is spectacular. They pamper the client at all times, especially their Manager, Jaime.
The hotel is a spectacle starting with its entrance, continuing through its reception which is impressive. Our room that was an extra Me+. A real luxury.
We didn't try the hotel restaurants because we like to walk around the city so we eat wherever the walk is convenient for us. But if we tried the breakfast, it was superior. Special mention to Diego and his attention at breakfast. And both breakfast and the last drink with the most spectacular view that I think a hotel in London has, on its ""Radio"" rooftop.
By the way, they have a cocktail that we loved, we order it every night, ""revelations"" if I'm not mistaken is what it's called.
In short, I will return for sure!
Thank you very much MeLondon

148,Durchwachsener Aufenthalt.,"Nachdem wir schon √∂fter in diesem Hotel zu Gast waren und sonst immer, nicht nur von dem Ambiente und dem Service begeistert waren, erlebten wir bei unserem letzten Aufenthalt ein durchwachsenes Erlebnis.
Beim Check-In bekamen wir zun√§chst Zimmerkarten f√ºr unser vorab gebuchtes Wunschzimmer. Jedoch mussten wir beim Betreten des Zimmer feststellen, dass hier schon ein anderer Gast eingecheckt war und unser Gep√§ck zun√§chst verschollen war. Nach R√ºcksprache mit der Rezeption erhielten wir dann, nach l√§ngerer Zeit des Wartens ein Ersatzzimmer, was wirklich sch√∂n war, jedoch an der gewohnten Sauberkeit, vor allem im Bad zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig lies. 
In der ersten Nacht kam es dann zu einem Fehlalarm des Feuermelders, wobei sich in der Lobby vom Personal nicht wirklich jemand f√ºr die  dadurch geweckten G√§ste zust√§ndig f√ºhlte.
An unserem 2ten Tag wollten wir dann abends auf dem Zimmer essen. Dieses gestaltete sich jedoch als sehr Zeitaufw√§ndig. Bis wir unsere Essen erhielten und die Modalit√§ten des Bezahlens gekl√§rt waren, dauerte es sage und schreibe 1,5 Stunden. Am Folgetag wurden wir dann abends  3 mal innerhalb 15 Minuten angerufen und an unserer T√ºr geklopft, ob wir noch einen Room-Service ben√∂tigen.
Beim Check out wurde dann erneut unser Gep√§ck mit dem Gep√§ck eines anderen Gastes verwechselt und man bekam nicht wirklich an der Rezeption das Gef√ºhl vermittelt, dass es irgend jemand interessieren w√ºrde, wie einem sein diesmaliger Aufenthalt gefallen hat.
Insgesamt ist das Hotel f√ºr uns immer wieder eine Reise wert, jedoch hatten wir schon deutlich bessere Aufenthalte, in dem wir vor allem von dem Service begeistert waren.

148,Londres en familia,"Perfecto hotel para disfrutar de Londres. Ubicaci√≥n inmejorable con todos los principales sitios a distancia de paseo.

El hotel tiene una decoraci√≥n elegante y sofisticada y las habitaciones perfectas. Nosotros nos alojamos en dos habitaciones Vibe room conectadas lo que es genial para un viaje de familia.

Pero lo mejor del hotel ha sido la atenci√≥n del personal, desde la entrada haci√©ndose cargo de nuestro equipaje para que pudi√©semos disfrutar de Londres mientras la habitaci√≥n estaba disponible (llegamos temprano), al checkin y el servicio de desayuno.

Destacar la calidad del desayuno y su servicio as√≠ como las vistas desde el Rooftop!

Para el check-in nos atendi√≥ Jaime, jefe del departamento de Guest Experience del hotel, que nos hizo un Upgrade debido a la ocasi√≥n especial por la que viaj√°bamos (cumplea√±os de mi hermana peque√±a).
Al llegar a la habitaci√≥n, el maravilloso equipo de Aura le ten√≠a preparada una gran sopresa: una botella de cava, una caja de bombones y toda la habitaci√≥n decorada con globos. Muy detallistas, ¬°simplemente encantadores!
Disfrutamos de un rico y abundante desayuno en el Radio Bar con vistas maravillosas a la ciudad.

Das Housekeeping vergisst Dinge im Bad zu ersetzen, der Pflege der Einrichtung wird zu wenig Beachtung geschenkt, W√ºnsche (ein Shoehorn... ) werden nicht erf√ºllt. Fehlalarm in der Nacht ohne zu informieren √ºber Ursache, beim check out wurde die Karten deaktiviert, trotz ausdr√ºcklicher Best√§tigung dass wir noch mit dem Lift ins Zimmer hoch fahren k√∂nnen...

148,Amazing service!!,"Fuy al hotel 1 dia solo, y me encant√≥. Debo destacarte a un empleado llamado Fernando, espa√±ol en recepci√≥n que fue super amable, profesional y muy efectivo. Se necesitan trabajadores as√≠.

Si debo calificar algo negativamente es que pedi por la ma√±ana leche para hacer el cafe en la maquina de cafe de la habitaci√≥n ( es que ponen tres mini bolsas de leche y queria hacer un cafe con leche) y literalmente tardaron 30 min. Y la azotea la esperaba abierta como en la fotos y era cerrada lo cual no tenia mucha gracia.

Alle waren immer sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. F√ºr uns wurde bestens gesorgt. ",5,2020,10,27
148,Bello ma mi aspettavo di pi√π,L'hotel gode di una posizione invidiabile. Avevo prenotato in un altro hotel l√¨ accanto sullo Strand e successivamente ho modificato la mia prenotazione spostandomi al Melia pensando in un soggiorno davvero a 5 stelle. Il prezzo √® abbastanza alto e non rispecchia la qualit√†: personale molto giovane e non particolarmente preparato (decisamente non all'altezza di un'hotel che potremmo definire quasi di lusso); arredamento della hall vecchio e rovinato; palestra molto piccola e con pochi attrezzi; difficile regolazione della temperatura in camera (non ho dormito molto bene a causa dell'eccessivo caldo e del continuo reset del sistema di riscaldamento della camera); stanza abbastanza piccola e bagno non isolato.,4,2020,10,21

148,SOY CLIENTE MELI√Å,"El personal del ME, es excelente. Y sus instalaciones fenomenales. Pero en este hotel en concreto, no dejan de entrar al restaurante, a menores, a partir de las 5pm. Se han enfocado, seg√∫n mi criterio, a adultos con ganas de fiesta, y esto lo vas a sufrir luego en tu habitaci√≥n, ya que el ruido y las juergas, las vas a tener en la habitaciones contiguas.",3,2020,03,04
148,Excelente hotel en el centro de la ciudad,"Nuestra estancia en el hotel fue excepcional, desde la llegada hasta el √∫ltimo d√≠a. El personal es muy atento en los detalles y te ofrece ayuda en lo que necesites. 

Muy recomendable el desayuno, con gran variedad de platos en el bufete y la carta, adem√°s de que cuenta con unas vistas espectaculares del skyline de Londres. 

Por √∫ltimo, a√±adir que el hotel est√° muy c√©ntrico, a tan solo 15 minutos a pie del Big Ben o 20 min del Palacio de Buckingham.",5,2020,03,03
148,Rozando el sobresaliente ,"Es un hotelazo donde se mezclan la arquitectura, el arte y el dise√±o. Y cuando vas hacer check in a la primera planta, ya te da algo. Es uno de los espacios m√°s de impactantes que he visto arquitect√≥nicamente hablando.
La situaci√≥n es ideal. En pleno centro, Coven Garden, con paradas de metro y autob√∫s al lado. Rodeado de todo tipo de restaurantes, comercios, teatros. Si te gusta pasear, desde aqu√≠ podr√°s ir a muchos sitios andando.
Las habitaciones grandes, luminosas, muy c√≥modas. Al menos la Mode Room.

√çbamos con un ni√±o nos montaron una cama adicional.

Pegas: nos decepcion√≥ la TV, que no hay acceso a plataformas digitales de contenido tipo Netflix, etc. O alg√∫n sistema para lanzar el contenido desde nuestros dispositivos m√≥viles a la TV.  La habitaci√≥n respira innovaci√≥n y en este sentido deber√≠an actualizarse.
La limpieza en nuestro caso... muy justa. Quiz√°s debimos de llamar para mejorar algunos detalles, as√≠ que tampoco lo voy a dar m√°s importancia.
Los desayunos incluidos espectaculares. De verdad, un lujo. Puedes incluso pedir cosas calientes de carta.
Tambi√©n felicitar al equipo por su gesti√≥n. Tuvimos un problema y es que nos cargaron de una fiesta en el hotel unos 400‚Ç¨ de bebidas a la habitaci√≥n. Nos libr√≥ entre otras cosas que √≠bamos con ni√±o y no ten√≠amos acceso a esos sitios... pero nos lo cancelaron sin poner ni un pero y es de agradecer.
Volveremos sin dudarlo y lo haremos.

148,Viaje entre amigos ,"Solemos viajar mucho con La cadena Melia, esta vez √©ramos 3 habitaciones, entre amigos. Me gustar√≠a plasmar aqu√≠ en c√≥mo el trato hace la diferencia, el hotel en si a nivel instalaciones, era una verdadera pasada, pero la parte humana es lo que en realidad cuenta, y hace uno volver. 
Ese desayuno en el Rooftop con esas vistas tan bonitas de Londres, las camareras siempre tan amables, y ese camarero, que estaba en la barra, creo que era de Bali, y nos hac√≠a los mejores caf√©s del mundo!!! No podr√≠a dejar de mencionar a Antonio, de Gex, que nos hizo sentirnos acogidos y como si estuvi√©ramos en nuestra misma casa, da gusto tener un anfitri√≥n de esa categor√≠a! 
Resumiendo, un gran hotel, excelente ubicaci√≥n y calidad humana, a nivel experiencia, diria que de las mejores! Enhorabuena! ",5,2020,02,26

Las camareras que nos atendieran en el desayuno, una pena que no me acuerde de sus nombres, han sido especialmente amables y encantadoras.
Otra pena es no acordarme del nombre del conserje que ha estado el lunes 24/02 por la ma√±ana, muy atento d√°ndonos indicaciones de lugares.

148,Incre√≠ble estancia en ME London,"Nos alojamos en el hotel dos noches (17 de Diciembre-19 de Diciembre)  fu√© corto pero muy intenso, en el mejor sentido de la palabra. Desde el minuto uno en el que entramos, nos enamoramos de √©l y no s√≥lo por la arquitectura y decoraci√≥n, sino tambi√©n por el personal que est√° detr√°s de cada outlet trabajando duro para que tengas una grata experiencia, es por ello que queremos dar las gracias a Antonio (Assistant Aura Manager),  Ana (de Burgos),  Mercedes (de M√°laga) y al Jefe de Recepci√≥n y Housekeeping (los cuales no recordamos sus nombres), pero que fueron muy amables y simp√°ticos con nosotras.
Lo que m√°s nos gust√≥ fu√© el Rooftop es espectacular, es simplemente un lujo poder empezar el d√≠a almorzando con esas vistas y esos desayunos de campeones, sin duda alguna, volveremos!!",5,2019,12,21
148,Non un 5 stelle,"Hotel al di sotto degli standard ME, qualit√† prezzo inadeguati. Colazione non vasta e prezzi alti, ma non giustificabili. Attrazioni e ristoranti suggeriti solo nei dintorni.

148,Demasiado moderno y oscuro,"En principio, deber√≠a de ser un cinco estrellas, caro, bien ubicado, moderno y estupendo.
En realidad, es un hotel con un mantenimiento regular, demasiado oscuro (necesitas la linterna del m√≥vil para meter la llave en la habitaci√≥n) y m√°s volcado en los eventos que en el hospedaje. Al final, defrauda.
El primer d√≠a, no pudimos entrar por la puerta  principal (jarreaba) porque estaban filmando una pel√≠cula. Y los d√≠as sucesivos, ten√≠an sendas fiestas que hac√≠an el lobby intransitable y tremendamente inc√≥modo.
Las habitaciones est√°n bien, los ba√±os buenos, pero todo defectuoso: la cisterna bajo carga,  el kettle para calentar el agua caus√≥ un cortocircuito que nos dej√≥ sin luz y, lo que es peor, sin poder comunicarlo porque el tel√©fono no ten√≠a pilas y no funcionaba... toco salir al pasillo con el pelo mojado, a la caza  de una camarera de piso...diez minutos largos de frustraci√≥n.
Las camas c√≥modas, la habitaci√≥n hermosa, la climatizaci√≥n complicada y lo m√°s horrible de todo es una luz rosa alrededor de la zona de televisi√≥n que convierte el lugar en  chabacano y un poco hotel de carretera.
La estaci√≥n de metro m√°s cercana estaba m√°s de siete minutos andando... 
total, para mi, un lugar al que no volver√© porque resulta muy caro y no tiene las prestaciones que esperas.
El personal amable, especialmente Emiliano, un conserje encantador y muy servicial.

Positivo:Magnifico hotel, con una inmejorable ubicaci√≥n y con una decoraci√≥n moderna y relajante, es un lugar en que el personal est√° seleccionado de una manera impecable, profesional, atento y dispuesto a hacerte sentir en casa y sobre todo para nosotros que no hablamos Ingl√©s ninguno de los dos, fue gratificante encontrarnos con personal de habla espa√±ol. Nada m√°s entrar en la conserjer√≠a se encuentra Emiliano que nos ayud√≥ en todo y que fue la primera se√±al de que no nos hab√≠amos equivocado en la elecci√≥n pues nos Indic√≥ todo lo que ten√≠amos que hacer y nos ayud√≥ desde el minuto 1, ya en la recepci√≥n tambi√©n nos encontramos con Mafalda que tambi√©n hablaba espa√±ol y nos hizo el check-in muy amablemente y nos ofreci√≥ una copa de cava mientras lo realizaba, todo esto de una manera impecable, camino de los ascensores apareci√≥ Lidia ( de Granada) y nos invit√≥ a tomar una copa en bar restaurante de la azotea que desde all√≠ se disfruta de unas vistas impresionantes. Y lo mejor de este hotel estaba por aparecer ya que a los pocos minutos llego Adriana Rosell√≥ perteneciente al Aura Team del hotel y debo decir que este hotel roza la excelencia pero la alcanza gracias a su personal pero en especial a Adriana pues fue la persona que hizo que nuestra estancia fuese un sue√±o ayud√°ndonos en todo momento y colmando esos momentos de detalles y atenciones que jam√°s pensamos en vivir en nuestro viaje.

148,Nicht zu toppen,"Wir haben eine Woche im Hotel verbracht und waren von dem Service, die Freundlichkeit und die Professionalit√§t vom gesamten absolut Team begeistert. Sollte unser Weg irgendwann wieder nach London f√ºhren werden wir auf jedem Fall wieder im ME wohnen wollen.",5,2019,11,26
148,Meglio tardi che mai!!!,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo splendido hotel mesi fa in occasione delle nostre vacanze natalizie! Ci ritroviamo solo ora a scrivere questa recensione... in ritardo ma a pieni voti! 
Il personale attento e molto professionale.
Camere super: dalla nostra abbiamo goduto su una meravigliosa vista sulla London Eye! 
Un particolare ma dovuto apprezzamento va a Marco Z.: ci ha accolti e coccolati, regalandoci non solo una soggiorno degno di ‚ÄúS‚Äù maiuscola all‚Äôinterno delle mura dell‚Äôhotel, ma anche dandoci molti consigli per vivere al meglio una Londra non solo turistica!
Grazie Marco e grazie e a tutto lo staff de Me London!

148,Excelente hotel,"Mi estancia de 3 noches en el hotel Me London ha estado a la altura con creces de mis expectativas con el hotel. Muy bien ubicado para ir pr√°cticamente andando a todos los lados ( solo usamos el metro para llegar a Candem). 

Si bien la entrada y acceso a la recepcion es algo confusa, cuando llegas a la misma es todo maravilloso. Un poco oscuro en sus pasillos, pero por poner una pega, porque de verdad que es realmente magnifico tanto el hotel, como las instalaciones, las habitaciones y sobretodo el servicio. A veces nos olvidamos que cuando viajamos y llegamos al hotel nos gusta sentirnos como en casa, y este hotel lo ofrece, pues tanto la habitacion como el propio personal se encargan de hacerte sentir asi. 

La habitacion Aura es muy amplia, con un ba√±o enorme bien separado de la zona de descanso. esta zona, con una cama inmensa y muy comoda, llena de almohadas sin necesidad de pedir otras porque estas ya eran muy comodas. la habitacion tiene de todo, no creo que echase nada en falta, pues el botones se encarg√≥ de ense√±arnos cualquier cosa que pudieramos necesitar en ella. 

el desayuno se realiza en el rooftop y las vistas son realmente maravillosas haga el tiempo que haga. El desayuno no es buffet, cosa que me sorprendi√≥ y entristeci√≥ a la vez, pues siempre deseas un buen desayuno, pero la carta que te ofrecen est√° mas que a la altura del deseado buffet, ya que todos los productos son de alta calidad ( dificil en Londres) y tienes una grandisima variedad, incluso de platos que en el deseado buffet ni te hubieses imaginado. 

el edificio tienen en su planta baja a nivel de la calle un restaurante / discoteca ( no llegue a quedarme bien con lo que era) que por poner una pega si seria conveniente por imagen del hotel un acceso distinto, pues cuando llegabamos por la noche, debido a la decoracion de la planta era todo un shooting de jovenes ingleses haciendose fotos luciendo sus outfits... no es malo, es curioso. Nosotros no nos encontramos con ningun episodio ""complicado"" y aunque imagino que tendran seguridad, todos sabemos como se nos puede ir un poquito de las manos mezclar alcohol y fiesta ;), aun asi , esta perfectamente insonorizado. 

en fin, la valoracion es mucho mas que positiva, sin duda si puedo volver√© y espero que vosotros tambien lo hagais ;-) de verdad que merece la pena.",5,2019,11,18
148,Tolle Lage,"Das Hotel ME London befindet sich an einer hervorragender Lage und ist sehr zu empfehlen!

Die Zimmer waren sehr sauber und die Betten bequem. 
Das Personal war sehr zuvorkommend, wir hatten ein Problem mit dem Zimmer und das wurde sofort sehr freundlich und kompetent geregelt.

148,Vere 5 stelle. Concierge (Emiliano in primis) super. Peccato solo per...,"Premetto che negli ultimi 5 anni abbiamo soggiornato spesso a Londra, che tra le citt√† europee resta la nostra preferita. Indubbiamente al ME LONDON abbiamo trovato, oltre a ci√≤ che ci si aspetta di trovare in un hotel a 5 stelle, qualcosa in pi√π: la cordialit√†, l'attenzione e l'impegno del personale (dal cameriere di sala al Direttore), che fa veramente di tutto per non deludere le aspettative di quel particolare (e rognoso) tipo di cliente che frequenta gli hotel a 5 stelle, sempre pronto a storcere il naso anche per questioni di lana caprina.  
Tra i membri dello staff, una particolare menzione la merita senz'altro Emiliano della concierge, una vera macchina da guerra, un mix di garbatezza inglese e praticit√† italiana.. provare per credere.. 
Detto questo, da buon cliente rognoso quale sono anch'io, ho trovato  una piccola pecca. In particolare l'armadio √® (inspiegabilmente) minuscolo, per cui se prendete uno standard, regolatevi con i bagagli..",4,2019,11,16
148,Das schlechteste Melia Hotel das wir kennen!,"Wir hatten die Junior-Suite im 7. Stock... diese verf√ºgt √ºber 2 Fenster (nicht zum √ñffnen) von ja 1 Quadratmeter... die tolle Aussicht beschr√§nkte sich auf den Anblick des Hauses nebenan! Die ""Suite"" war sonst OK, aber nicht mehr! Das Personal soweit OK mit Ausnahme beim Fr√ºhst√ºck, da schlicht unkompetent und frech! Auf der Toilette fehlt eine B√ºrste... Der Strom fiel einmal aus, die Panne wurde umgehend repariert, Das Fr√ºhst√ºck das hier geboten wird empfinde ich / wir als Frechheit!",3,2019,11,11
148,St√§dte-Trip,"Das Hotel verf√ºgt √ºber eine perfekte Lage, hat sehr aufmerksames Personal und ist sehr stylisch und trendy - absolute Empfehlung f√ºr einen St√§dtetrip nach London!

148,Brutal! De 10!,"Mi primera experiencia en un hotel ME

Las expectativas eran muy altas y sin lugar a dudas la experiencia no me defraud√≥, lo mejor: la excelente atenci√≥n recibida, especialmente por parte de Antonio. Cercano, atento y con una capacidad de transmitir una peculiar esencia como la que tiene Me. Era un viaje que yo hac√≠a solo a Londres, y como novato en la ciudad, Antonio supo entender perfectamente cuales eran mis necesidades y me hizo recomendaciones fabulosas como el rooftop.. incre√≠ble, adem√°s de otras recomendaciones que me hizo para saborear el verdadero encanto londinense.

Le camere sono spaziose, pulite e hanno uno stile del tutto originale, anche la colazione ha superato le nostre aspettative ma la vera punta di diamante √® stato lo staff, Marco √® il ragazzo che ci ha accolti e si √® dimostrato molto competente e preparato oltre che incredibilmente gentile.
Ritengo che il prezzo sia adeguato al servizio offerto. Consigliato senza ombra di dubbio!",5,2019,10,30
148,Esperienza di classe prezzo onesto ,"Ho soggiornato con la mia ragazza 3 notti. L‚Äôhotel ha una hall a cono impressionante dove si trova anche la reception. Con mia grande sorpresa mi sono interfacciato con Marco, un ragazzo italiano che vive a Londra. Competente e gentilissimo ci ha regalato un‚Äôesperienza difficile da replicare.  L‚Äôhotel per la posizione e la qualit√† del sevizio √® proposto a prezzi ottimi (forse anche per il periodo strano della nostra visita). Unico neo i corridoi un po‚Äô consumati ma con tutto il traffico della City non avrebbe potuto essere diversamente. Consigliatissimo! ",5,2019,10,30
148,Un weekend fantastico ,"Sono stato al ME London il weekend passato ed il servizio √® di gran lunga il migliore che abbia mai provato in un hotel 5 stelle, un'esperienza incredibile anche grazie al Concierge che mi ha dato molte indicazioni visto che era la prima volta a Londra. La terrazza panoramica √® un posto speciale per fare colazione o per un aperitivo la sera. Consiglio quest'hotel vivamente a tutti.",5,2019,10,30
148,Ganz okay,"Freundlicher Empfang. 
Rezeption befindet sich in 1.OG 
man wird freundlich dorthin gef√ºhrt. 
Man sollte wissen, dass es ein dunkles Hotel ist die G√§nge zu den Zimmern haben schwarze B√∂den, W√§nde und Decken, ist nat√ºrlich alles leicht beleuchtet. Uns hat es nicht gest√∂rt. Die Zimmer sind sehr ordentlich und sauber und hell. Nur leider war unser Bett nicht bequem, k√∂nnte leider nicht gut schlafen. Die Matratzen war zu hart und sind durchgelegen. Was auch noch sehr merkw√ºrdig war, die Toilette war ziemlich niedrig und ich bin gerade mal 1,60 gro√ü :))
Die Zimmer werden 2. mal am Tag gereinigt.

Alcune amenities non sono di ottima qualit√† come gli accappatoi mancano inoltre alcuni punti d‚Äôappoggio e l‚Äôaccensione touch delle luci non √® sempre agevole. 

Aria condizionata di difficile regolazione.

148,Fantastisch,"Waren f√ºr 4 N√§chte im ME. Von Anfang an alles super. Sehr freundliches Personal. √Ñu√üerst zuvorkommend. Waren immer f√ºr einen kleinen Plausch zu haben.
Wir hatten ein Zimmer im neunten Stock mit Balkon. Nicht ganz billig, war uns aber den Luxus wert. Wenn verreisen, dann ordentlich. Hatten nur √úbernachtung. Zimmer war sauber die Chillout Music passte perfekt. Beleuchtung konnte frei gew√§hlt werden. Es gab sogar jemanden am sp√§ten Nachmittag der kostenlos Wasser vorbei brachte. Wenn man wollte konnte man sogar ein belegtes Baguette haben. Die Lage des Hotels ist perfekt. Haben vieles mit dem Doppeldecker-Bus erkundet der unmittelbar am Hotel h√§lt. So sieht man wenigstens was vom Hotel. 
Die Radio Rooftop Bar sollte man wirklich besuchen. Blick zum London Eye einfach toll. Ja man bezahlt daf√ºr, aber mal ganz ehrlich, man befindet sich in London, in einer der teuersten St√§dten der Welt, dann sollte man auch nicht auf jeden Cent schauen.
Ein wundervolles Hotel. Eine wundervolle Stadt. Wir kommen wieder und werden wieder im ME buchen.Das Einzige was zu bem√§ngeln w√§re ist: Das Bett ist etwas hart. Aber man √ºberlebt es:).

Con lo cual imposible descansar, los pasillos oscuros y, para mi gusto, muy alta la m√∫sica en las instalaciones del hotel: halls, ascensor,..

148,Fantastico ,"Sono stata in questo bellissimo hotel con due amiche per un fine settimana a Londra. Beh che dire ..... staff gentilissimo, Emiliano ed Edward veramente bravi.

Assolutamente consigliato e se torno a Londra torno sicuramente in questo hotel. ",4,2019,03,17
148,Luci e ombre ,"Che peccato ! L‚Äôhotel posizionato benissimo, sito nel quartiere Covent Garden. Buon servizio , bello l‚Äôhotel , cortesia e gentilezza garantiti ... non guardiamo i prezzi di un 5 stelle a Londra , si sa‚Äô che sono cari ! Ma la funzionalit√† delle camere ? Nella mia camera , la 404, penetrava luce dalle finestre mal ideate , non c‚Äô√® la possibilit√† di aprire una finestra , √® tutto sigillato , sei un prigioniero dell hotel ... il bagno poco funzionale , cos√¨ come la cassaforte sita in un cassetto che rende difficile (e pericolosa) aprirla in sicurezza (rischio amputazione delle dita) .... anche l‚Äôarmadio (unico) tutto open piccolo e scomodo , poi la moquette (üò¨) Gli ascensori , difficile comprenderli , vanno a scheda e orario uno sale solo un bar , l‚Äôaltro va solo alla Lobby e cos√¨ via ....

El hotel es espectacular, las instalaciones son muy modernas con un estilo propio de esta marca tan especial dentro del grupo hotelero MHI. La ubicaci√≥n es inmejorable, puedes ir andando a todos los puntos tur√≠sticos de la ciudad, rodeado de interesantes restaurantes y cercano a varias paradas de metro.
Nosotros nos quedamos en una Chic Suite y son preciosas.
Tambi√©n me gustar√≠a resaltar el equipo que tiene el hotel, todos muy atentos a todas las necesidades que te van surgiendo, especialmente Vittoria del equipo Aura, qui√©n nos dio una fabulosa bienvenida.

148,Non il mio hotel preferito a Londra,"In viaggio di lavoro ho trascorso 2 notti in questo hotel in ottima posizione ma che non mi ha colpito positivamente nel suo insieme. La lobby √® ubicata al piano terra con il desk dei concierges, al primo piano si trova la reception, indubbiamente di grande impatto visivo (minimalista e modernissima, tutto marmo e luci basse), check in rapido ed efficiente. Prendo l'ascensore per andare in camera (la 714) e mi trovo in un freddo corridoio con aria condizionata al massimo, veramente molto buio (non c'erano problemi con le luci, era voluto), cosa che, personalmente, non ho trovato per niente trendy ma solo fastidiosa. La camera (categoria Vibe) era di ottma dimensione ma un p√≤ carente dal punto di vista della pulizia; in bagno le grandi vetrate in vetro satinato della doccia erano piene di ditate e la doccia stessa aveva la pedana di acciaio non proprio impeccabile... Asciugamani e lenzuola puliti, per fortuna. 
Una chicca: la prima sera avevo lasciato intatta l'acqua ed il cioccolatino forniti dal turndown seral, la sera dopo invece di aggiungerne di nuovi li hanno riutilizzati...senza parole. Per quanto riguarda la colazione (non a buffet ma individuale) √® servita in una sala gradevole, al piano terra, piuttosto luminosa (a differenza del resto dell'hotel) ma a mio gusto non di buon livello (omelette fatta al momento ma di ridotta dimensione e poco gustosa, quasi secca, la mattina dopo ho provato un altro tipo di colazione e hanno servito un muffin decente ma brioches mignon semi-crude). Non ho provato altro (palestra etc.) ma nell'insieme questo hotel non mi ha soddisfatto. ",2,2019,01,29
148,"Leider nicht so, wie erwartet","Zun√§chst einmal m√∂chte ich festhalten, dass die Lage des Hotels sehr gut ist, das Personal freundlich und zuvorkommend ohne aufdringlich zu sein und insbesondere die Architektur der Rezeption beeindruckend ist. Unser Zimmer war modern eingerichtet und sah schick aus, wir haben gut geschlafen. Leider gab es Ausrutscher bei der Sauberkeit, die in einem 5-Sterne Hotel nicht passieren d√ºrfen. Zum einen war der √úberlauf des Waschbeckens im Badezimmer nicht gereinigt (wir haben dr√ºber hinweggesehen), zum anderen, viel schwerwiegender, habe ich einen alten Schminkpinsel des vorherigen Gasts im Badezimmer gefunden. Das Personal hat sich entschuldigt, ihn entfernt und uns wurde zur Entsch√§digung ein Obstteller und eine kleine Flasche Champagner auf das Zimmer gestellt. In einer email des Hotels wurde nach Feedback gefragt um ""[...] weiterhin g√∂ttliche Erfahrungen zu erschaffen [...]"" und dies habe ich zum Anlass genommen, diese Bewertung zu schreiben. Fazit: Sch√∂nes Hotel und auch prinzipiell empfehlenswert, mein Aufenthalt/Zimmer war leider nicht erwartungsgem√§√ü.",2,2019,01,29

Menci√≥n especial de nuevo al personal del hotel y en concreto Francisco, Ana, Nuria, Noelia y a los chicos de la entrada cuyo nombre no recuerdo en este momento. Volvimos a celebrar el cumplea√±os de mi hija y no tengo palabras de agradecimiento por todos los detalles que tuvieron a nuestra llegada. Las habitaciones maravillosas, y muy bien ubicadas. Quiz√°s el cambio que hemos notado de un a√±o a otro es el desayuno. Este a√±o en la terraza, con vistas √∫nicas pero no tan variado el buffet, ya que los platos calientes hab√≠a que pedirlos a parte, pero ning√∫n problema. Todo perfecto, sin duda repetiremos el a√±o que viene. See you soon !!!!",5,2018,09,18

148,M√°s que perfecto,"Da gusto hacer un viaje y que al llegar al hotel donde vas a estar alojado al menos unas cuantas noches sientas que has acertado. Y eso es lo que nos pas√≥ no al llegar al ME LONDON, sino nada m√°s hacer la reserva y empezar a cruzarme ciertos emails con el hotel por dudas diversas: SERVICIO en may√∫sculas ante todo.
Pero lo bueno estaba por llegar. Cuando vimos la localizaci√≥n exacta, en pleno Covent Garden, no nos lo podiamos creer... cuando entras en el hotel, y respiras ese aroma m√°gico que impregna todos sus estancias, a√∫n te convences m√°s del acierto. Cuando subes a la 1¬™ planta donde tienen una recepci√≥n espectacular, ya te caes redondo y si encima tienes la suerte de estar en una suite...
Bar, restaurante en la azotea espectacular, el servicio (muchos de espa√±oles) a la altura de las estrellas del hotel.

Es un hotel con todas las prestaciones de un hotel 5 estrellas; pero con el agregado de la cordialidad , esmero y simpat√≠a de todo el personal que ah√≠ trabaja . Cada vez que solicit√© algo , siempre tuve una respuesta muy amable( y en espa√±ol).
El desayuno es muy rico y variado; de excelente calidad y se sirve en una terraza desde la cual hay unas muy lindas vistas de Londres.
Cenamos en el restaurante de la planta baja y la comida estuvo riqu√≠sima.
La ubicaci√≥n es excelente, cerca de Covent garden y de muchas atracciones tur√≠sticas.
Sin lugar a dudas, un hotel al que volver√© en un pr√≥ximo viaje a Londres !  Y qu√© voy a recomendar a mis amigos.
Debo destacar ( aunque todo el personal fue s√∫per amable) la esmerada atenci√≥n de Yesenia en el desayuno y la de Ana Poley a qui√©n tuve el gusto de conocer al solicitar ayuda en la recepci√≥n.",5,2018,08,14

148,Meraviglioso compleanno!!!!!!,"Prima volta a Londra soggiornando in questo splendido hotel, esperienza veramente pi√π che ottima. Posizione fantastica, centralissima e ideale per vedere tutte le maggiori attrazioni muovendosi a piedi. Accoglienza perfetta da parte di tutto lo staff, che ci ha coccolato e fatto sentire a casa. Un particolare ringraziamento a Emiliano che ci ha organizzato una graditissima sorpresa di compleanno in camera e ci ha suggerito itinerari ed eventi interessanti. Hotel pulitissimo e colazione sul rooftop con vista incredibile e prodotti freschissimi, ottima anche la cena presso il ristorante STK. Davvero un grazie di cuore ancora a tutti e speriamo di rivederci presto!!!",5,2018,08,12

148,Definitiv keine 5 Sterne,"Das Hotel ist stylish und chic eingerichtet. Die Zimmer sind ok, modern und sauber aber nicht allzu gro√ü. Die G√§nge sind extrem dunkel. Bei Check in wurde uns keine Infos √ºber die Hotelausstattung gegeben - keine Infos zum Gym, zum Restaurant oder zur Bar. Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption tun sich auch mit der englischen Sprache etwas schwer. Jeden Tag betritt gegen 19:00 eine Dame das Zimmer um Wasser zu bringen - allerdings ohne vorher anzuklopfen oder nachzufragen. Die Rooftop Bar ist keine Bar, sondern eher eine Disko zu der auch nicht-Hotelg√§ste Zutritt habe. Die Musik ist so laut, dass man sich nicht unterhalten kann. Es ist kein 5 Sterne Hotel, dazu teuer. Ich w√ºrde es nicht nochmal buchen",3,2018,08,02
148,¬°Mejor ubicaci√≥n imposible!,"¬°Este hotel es espectacular! Se encuentra justo en unas de las principales zonas tur√≠sticas y comerciales de la ciudad. A sus alrededores encontrar√°s much√≠simos restaurantes de especialidad, museos, edificios hist√≥riicos, y lo principal es que est√° a una cuadra del r√≠o T√°mesis y como a 10-15 minutos caminando al Palace of Westminster/Big Ben. 

Hay muchas estaciones de metro cerca, as√≠ como del transporte p√∫blico. Si eres de las personas que gusta explorar una ciudad caminando, sin duda este hotel es tu mejor opci√≥n.

Cuenta con un restaurante en el primer piso fabuloso y delicioso, y por la noche no puedes dejar de visitar su rooftop con incre√≠bles vista y el mejor ambiente. 

Las habitaciones son muy amplias y coloridas; todo lo puedes controlar autom√°ticamente y la decoraci√≥n del hotel es muy vangaurdista. Al llegar a la recepci√≥n, ser√°s recibido con un fascinante mapping de ""la creaci√≥n"".

La mejor tarifa podr√°s encontrarla directamente en la p√°gina web del hotel.",5,2018,07,15

International and modern environment, with spacious and very welcoming rooms. Accurate design, with use of black marble in the corrodors and minimal furniture in the rooms.

Est√° perfecto para familias, para parejas, para ir solo y hasta con el perro porq tienen room service para mascotas ;)La decoraci√≥n y ambientaci√≥n moderna nos encant√≥, todo el personal s√∫per amable, me di√≥ gusto ver que varios eran espa√±oles. Lo s√∫per recomiendo!",5,2018,07,10
148,Ya toca renovarse,"El hotel no est√° mal pero demasiado caro para unas habitaciones que son peque√±as (nosotros pagamos las de balc√≥n y supuestamente m√°s grandes) y el mantenimiento deja algo que desear, ya est√° un poco desgastado, la puerta de la ducha se atascaba y tambi√©n costaba sacar el telefonillo de la ducha, adem√°s hay unas cuantas rozaduras y roturas en general por la habitaci√≥n que hay que reparar y el armario demasiado peque√±o",3,2018,07,09
148,Mal atenci√≥n al hu√©sped,"El hotel est√° muy bien ubicado con posibilidades de caminar a todos lados, est√° muy limpio y moderno.

Tuvimos una muy mala experiencia por 2 situaciones: 

1. Nuestra habitaci√≥n #102 ten√≠a un corto el√©ctrico, en la madrugada se encend√≠an las luces del cuarto (Todo es Electrico) y las bocinas truenan. Notificamos la situaci√≥n en el Front Desk y supuestamente iban a enviar a alguien a repararlo, nunca se repar√≥ las 3 noches que estuvimos ah√≠ nos despertamos varias veces en la madrugada por el sonido de la bocina y por las luces de la habitaci√≥n.

2. Solicitamos apoyo al Consierge para realizar una reservaci√≥n a una empresa de transporte para llegar a Heathrow, esta persona nos ofreci√≥ el servicio del hotel por ¬£110.00 , nosotros ya hab√≠amos seleccionado el servicio privado que quer√≠amos utilizar (Por cierto nos cost√≥ ¬£34.00, ‚ÄúSimply Airports‚Äù llegaron puntuales y muy buen servicio) solo necesitamos apoyo para informaci√≥n para la reserva y la herramienta ya para hacerlo, el Consierge de mal modo nos dio la tarjeta del hotel para que lo resolvi√©ramos solos. Me imagino no le pareci√≥ que no acept√°ramos el servicio del hotel. 

No pensamos regresar NUNCA.",2,2018,07,07

148,Hotel moderno y bien situado,"El hotel est√° situado en un lugar estupendo y es moderno y est√° bien cuidado. La terraza de arriba es estupenda, la verdad, aunque a partir de determinada hora priman los usuarios de fuera del hotel frente a los que estamos alojados en √©l para accede a la terraza. El personal, atento y diligente, aunque me sorprendi√≥ mucho que cuando entramos se equivocaron al darnos las habitaciones y entramos en unas que estaban ya ocupadas. Todo el mundo puede equivocarse, pero podr√≠an haber tenido alg√∫n tipo de detalle por la verg√ºenza que tuvimos que pasar (los ocupantes de las habitaciones y nosotros) y por la p√©rdida de tiempo",4,2018,07,01

Hemos viajado por medio mundo conociendo diversas cadenas hoteleras. Podemos asegurar con satisfacci√≥n, que nuestra mejor experiencia ha sido en Me London. El Hotel en su conjunto y sobre todo la atenci√≥n personal han sido excepcionales.
La ubicaci√≥n del Hotel es perfecta, cerca de las principales visitas obligadas, atracciones, espect√°culos, etc.
El edificio es fant√°stico en todo su dise√±o, desde el espectacular lobby, la deslumbrante recepci√≥n, los relajantes pasillos, las magn√≠ficas habitaciones, el vistoso roof-restaurante bar,...todo.
La gastronom√≠a muy cuidada y variada. Exquisita.
Si todo lo anterior es excelente, la atenci√≥n personal de todo el equipo humano es insuperable, desde el primer contacto con el Hotel, hasta la despedida. La amabilidad, simpat√≠a, dedicaci√≥n, profesionalidad en suma, son sensacionales.
Las atenciones que tuvieron con nosotros en todo momento y fundamentalmente con motivo de nuestras Bodas de Oro, fueron tan fant√°sticas que no tenemos palabras suficientes para agradecerlas. Quedan en nuestro coraz√≥n para recordarlas toda la vida.
Much√≠simas gracias a Sara, Mar√≠a, Marco, Aitor, David, Eduardo... y a tantas/os otras/os cuyos nombres no conocemos, pero que contribuisteis a que nuestra estancia fuese a√∫n m√°s feliz . Sois un equipazo estupendo.

Las.dos cosas que tengo que decir que no me gustaron es el.precio de los productos del.mini bar muy caros no lo siguiente creo que se equivocan con esos precios as√≠ vo consume nadie pues te duele pagar 4 libras por una coca cola 
Y la otra cosa que no.me gust√≥ absolutamente  nada es.que no pongan los folletos.y los libros explicativos  de los servicios del.hotel en espa√±ol

Habitaciones impecables y silencioso por dentro a pesar de estar en plena zona de los teatros! Volver√≠a a repetir. Un 10 sin duda para este hotel! ",5,2018,05,21
148,Hotel de dise√±o muy bien situado.,"Magn√≠fico hotel de arquitectura impresionante (la recepci√≥n sobre todo) muy bien situado, personal muy amable (muchos de ellos son espa√±oles), con un bar en la √∫ltima planta con unas vistas magn√≠ficas de la ciudad y muy animado.
La habitaci√≥n es muy c√≥moda, moderna y, por supuesto, limpia. La nuestra ten√≠a balc√≥n con muy buenas vistas.
Cuando llegas te reciben con una copa de espumoso aunque, en nuestro caso, tardaron en poder atendernos y tampoco (como hubiera sido esperable en un hotel de este nivel) nos acompa√±aron para ense√±arnos la habitaci√≥n y explicarnos c√≥mo funcionan luces y aire acondicionado que se gobierna desde una pantalla no muy f√°cil de entender al principio.
La habitaci√≥n inicialmente elegida ten√≠a un armario demasiado peque√±o para una estancia algo prolongada. A la ma√±ana siguiente tuvimos la suerte de encontrarnos con la sevillana Ana a la que le comentamos el problema y nos lo resolvi√≥ r√°pidamente con un cambio a otra habitaci√≥n con un armario algo mayor.
El desayuno est√° muy bien atendido por personal muy amable y es bastante variado aunque, en nuestra opini√≥n, deber√≠a serlo a√∫n m√°s dado su precio.

Adem√°s, la habitaci√≥n dispone de un amplio mini bar, snacks gourmet y de una cafetera Nespresso con c√°psulas de caf√© (el uso de la cafetera es gratuito). Destaco los amenities del ba√±o, son de gran calidad y todos ellos con una composici√≥n natural. El √∫nico inconveniente es que no hay prioridad para los hu√©spedes del hotel a la hora de reservar en Radio, local con m√∫sica en la azotea del hotel con vistas a la ciudad abierto al p√∫blico, y en el Restaurante.

148,Me for ever!,"Ha sido una escapada de un fin de semana largo a Londres y escog√≠ el Me London por ser un Meli√° que di por si es una garant√≠a y por estar ubicado en el centro y cerca de una parada de la Piccadilly Line que nos hacia falta coger nada mas llegar por una cita footbolistica que ten√≠amos y que fue la principal raz√≥n del viaje.
El hotel es muy muy bonito,confortable,limpio y perfectamente ubicado para quien le gusta las zonas c√©ntricas.El personal nos ha atendido bien aunque he enviado por correo una petici√≥n especial y no ha sido atendida ni siquiera me respondieron.
Seguramente lo elegir√≠a otra vez. ",4,2018,03,18
148,Kurz Urlaub,Wir waren f√ºr 3 N√§chte im Me London . Personal ist super nett und wir durften schon viel fr√ºher in unser Zimmer. Leider ein sehr hellh√∂riges Zimmer. Die Disco hat unter uns gewummert und es war schwierig zu schlafen. Zimmer sind modern und sauber. Das Putz Personal ist nicht so berauschend. Wir waren den ganzen Tag unterwegs und trotzdem hatten sie es nicht geschafft das Zimmer zu machen.. viele Sachen kosten zus√§tzlich ist bei den Preis schon krass. ,3,2018,03,03
148,Iper moderno a Covent Garden,"Hotel modernissimo, la reception si trova all'interno di una piramide di marmo nero alta dieci piani. La nostra camera era grande e confortevole, con un piccolo balcone al nono piano, le luci colorate, un letto comodissimo, bar fornitissimo e set da bagno eccellente (spazzolino, dentifricio, colluttorio, struccante, oltre al resto), ciabattine, accappatoio, macchina per il caff√® espresso, acqua e cioccolatini di cortesia ogni sera, cassaforte orizzontale per un laptop anche grande. A noi √® piaciuto tutto, e la posizione a due passi da Covent Garden e dai teatri √® ottima. Costoso, ma per Londra nemmeno troppo.",5,2018,03,03
148,"Hotel ottimo, personale dovrebbe essere pi√π attento!",Al check in mi √® stato fatto un upgrade dalla camera aura a quella di livello superiore ... per√≤ quella di livello superiore era per disabili e quindi c'erano tutte le attrezzature per disabili nel bagno che ingombravano e rendevano la doccia scomoda da utilizzare. Noi non siamo disabili !!! Arrivato stanco e dovendo fermarmi solo una notte ho evitato di protestare.,3,2018,02,26
148,TRAVEL OF LONDON 2018,"Un gran trato por parte de Maria y Ana , que en todo momento consiguieron que estuvi√©ramos en un para√≠so dentro de una ciudad como Londres.La limpieza y el servicio baste correcto.
Se echa de menos la ausencia de un Spa en un hotel de este calibre.
Una pena tambi√©n no poder disponer de m√°s alternativas para la cena al ir con ni√±os.
La chica que nos atendi√≥ en los desayunaos fue espectacular , creo que era de Malaga.
Gracias tambi√©n a Aitor,Omar y Andrea , por tratarnos espectacularmente desde el primer d√≠a .

148,INOLVIDABLE,"El ME LONDON refleja cristalinamente la excelencia de MELIA, es un hotel inmejorable.
Est√° ubicado cerca de lugares emblem√°ticos de la ciudad como Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square o Picadilly Circus, se llega andando en escasos minutos a cualquiera de estas maravillosas zonas londinenses.
Nada m√°s llegar al hotel el personal se encarga de las maletas, en la planta baja, donde igualmente est√° ubicado su restaurante el STK London, lugar de moda de la ciudad.
La recepci√≥n est√° en la planta primera, en una maravillosa sala con un espect√°culo lum√≠nico increible y diferente a todo lo conocido, en donde te obsequian con una copa de cava.
Las habitaciones est√°n insonorizadas y son muy lujosas, con amenities de alta calidad, con un mini bar equipado con todo de tipo de bebidas (con coste). A trav√©s de un panel controlas el sistema de iluminaci√≥n asi como la temperatura logrando un confort digno de menci√≥n. Dispones de una cafetera Nexpresso totalmente gratuita, en donde preparar el primer caf√© de la ma√±ana.
Las camas son muy c√≥modas y las s√°banas son de algod√≥n egipcio, el mejor descanso para una jornada de turismo. 
El personal es muy amable y atentos a cualquier necesidad, muchos son espa√±oles, a destacar Ana, Mar√≠a, Aitor y David. Cualquier cosa que necesitabas estaban ah√≠.
Los desayunos son de primer nivel, zumos naturales, buffet muy variado (salado y dulce), cocinero a la carta, caf√© reci√©n hecho, en unas instalaciones c√≥modas y sin masificaciones. Un lujo.
Indicar que aparte del servicio de habitaciones tambi√©n puedes encargar comida directamente al restaurante del hotel el STK London.
En la terraza tienen un bar de moda, s√≥lo para clientes, llamado RADIO donde tienes unas vistas panor√°micas de la ciudad y un ambiente divertido y elegante.
No se trata de un hotel adults only, pero a determinadas horas s√≠ lo es.
El hotel no dispone de SPA, pero s√≠ de servicios de tratamientos con personal especializado prestados directamente en la habitaci√≥n si asi lo solicita el cliente.
En resumen, es un hotelazo, con todas las letras, altamente recomendable y acogedor, nosotros volveremos con los ojos cerrados.",5,2018,02,21

Fui para darle una sorpresa de cumplea√±os a mi pareja y nos sorprendieron tanto a ella como a mi. El Radio Bar -  rooftop en la ultima planta esta genial con musica chillout y dj en directo. Especial atencion al Jefe de Recepcion italiano Marco y a Maria y Pedro del departamento de Aura (guest Experience team)",5,2018,01,17
148,Amazing,"Desde el primer momento impresiona. Lo primero que te encuentras no es la recepci√≥n, sino personal que te coge las maletas para m√°s tarde llev√°rtelas a la habitaci√≥n. Te indican d√≥nde est√° la recepci√≥n, coges el ascensor y cuando llegas te encuentras con una impresionante sala que es simplemente indescriptible... la sensaci√≥n es de estar dentro de una pir√°mide. 
El personal que all√≠ me atendi√≥ para realizar el check-in fue muy amable y atento. 
Al llegar a la habitaci√≥n volv√≠ a quedarme sin palabras. Al minuto llam√≥ a la puerta el chico que me llev√≥ las maletas. Un instante despu√©s volvi√≥ a llamar una chica que muy amable me dio la bienvenida y dej√≥ agua con un par de macarons de obsequio. Me pareci√≥ un bonito detalle por parte del hotel. 
La habitaci√≥n no pod√≠a haber estado mejor equipada; desde el equipo de sonido (dos altavoces en el techo de la habitaci√≥n y uno en el ba√±o com opci√≥n de controlarlo por separado) hasta la iluminaci√≥n, limpieza o el aire acondicionado. Todo incre√≠ble. 
Si hay que extra√±√© fue un kit de afeitado. Dos d√≠as antes de mi visita estuve en el Melia White House, que al ser de la misma cadena esperaba encontrarme los mismos accesorios en el ba√±o. 
El resto de cosas para el ba√±o me gustaron mucho.
Tambi√©n prepararon la cama al anochecer y dejaron toallas nuevas. Adem√°s un par de botellas de agua y un par de bombones encima de la cama ‚ù§Ô∏è

Este hotel es espectacular por la modernidad de sus instalaciones tanto en las habitaciones como en el resto del hotel. La recepci√≥n en el primer piso es una pir√°mide con apertura en la √∫ltima planta y con proyecciones en los muros que te dejan impresionado. En las habitacones adem√°s de un servicio estupendo de Wifi y de television (aunque faltan m√°s cadenas espa√±olas, solo est√° la 1). El ba√±o es muy c√≥modo y moderno como el resto de la habitaci√≥n. Hay dos atracciones m√°s en el Hotel. El resturante con m√∫sica STK (creo que se llama as√≠) famoso en Londres por su m√∫sica y porque animan a los clientes a bailar y a vestir espectacular. Estuvimos un sabado noche all√≠ y se form√≥ una fiesta que no puedo describir. En el tejado hay un pub muy moderno y tambi√©n muy conocido con vistas  a todo Londres. En cuanto a la ubicaci√≥n solo hay que mirar un mapa y no hay sitio mejor. El desayuno es muy correcto, pero no el mejor de esta categor√≠a de Hoteles. Tienen unos huevos Benedictine riqu√≠simos.

148,"De nuevo, otra experiencia inolvidable","Una vez m√°s, volvimos a Londres y nos alejamos en el hotel ME y una vez m√°s nuestra estancia supero todas nuestras expectativas. 
La primera experiencia fue el coche que el hotel prepar√≥ para nuestro traslado, un impresionante Jaguar con todo lujo de detalles. La llegada, un viernes por la noche, coincidi√≥ con enormes atascos y un par de accidentes dentro de la ciudad. Afortunadamente nuestro ch√≥fer tuvo la pericia suficiente como para zafarse de las adversidades que nos iban surgiendo de un modo bastante, bastante elegante y conseguimos evitar buena parte de las calles cerradas y atascadas que nos iban apareciendo. Muy bien. Algo parecido ocurri√≥ a nuestra salida. Una gran tormenta sobre Londres con el consiguiente caos circulatorio que nuestro ch√≥fer supo evitar estupendamente.
La llegada, nuestro check-in, como siempre, r√°pida y efectiva. Esta vez la fant√°stica estructura interior no nos sorprendi√≥....tanto. Es genial. Aparte, el usual ofrecimiento de una copa de prosecco que siempre se agradece.
Advertidos de que se nos hab√≠a ofrecido un upgrade de habitaci√≥n, se nos asigno una Chic Suite: habitaci√≥n 610. Im-presionante. L√≠mpia, perfectamente aromatizada, la ropa de cama de un blanco n√≠veo, la m√∫sica ambiental, el incre√≠ble sistema de luces, la instalaci√≥n de sonido para poder conectar tus propios aparatos electr√≥nicos. Es decir, nada nuevo: Tan perfecto como siempre. En este caso, adem√°s con unas frutas realmente deliciosas y una botella a nuestra disposici√≥n cortes√≠a del equipo Aura.
La estancia, por lo dem√°s, perfecta y agradable con un servicio de habitaciones impecable.
La salida, una vez m√°s, √°gil y r√°pida con ofrecimiento de un vaso de zumo de naranja reci√©n exprimido que tambi√©n fue muy de agradecer por parte de Beatriz, que nos atendi√≥ estupendamente y sirva nuestro agradecimiento personalizado a ella de reconocimiento y gratitud hacia todos los que componen el staff del hotel porque, realmente, te hacen sentir alguien muy especial. Muchas gracias. Volveremos!!!",5,2017,09,16
148,Stylisch ,"Sicherlich ein stylisches Hotel, moderne und gro√üz√ºgige Zimmer. Rezeption im 1. Stock, nervig, da man oft lange auf Aufz√ºge warten muss. Die Akustik ist ein Albtraum, die Damen und Herren an der Rezeption sind kaum zu verstehen, English ist auch nicht selbstverst√§ndlich! Das Hotel ist sehr dunkel ausgeleuchtet und verwinkelt, f√ºr Hipster sicher cool. Ich empfinde es als unpers√∂nlich und un√ºbersichtlich. Wartezeiten beim Check out unmotiviertes Personal einkalkulieren. Restaurant STK bietet gro√üartiges Essen, aber genie√üen ist schwierig bei dem hohen L√§rmpegel und dem st√§ndigen kommen und gehen diverser in-People. Aufzugsystem ist bei guter Auslastung eine Katastrophe. W√ºrde das Hotel nicht nochmal buchen, da hat London definitiv bessere Alternativen in dieser Preiskategorie.

Pero sin duda lo que hizo de nuestra escapada una experiencia √∫nica fue la incre√≠ble calidad de su personal. Desde la recepcionista que nos atendi√≥ a la entrada y salida, Beatriz, pasando por cada uno de ellos que no dejaron escapar ni un detalle.

148,Fantasia dell'infinito,"ME London √® una emozione sconvolgente. Un viaggio che non ha ritorno. Dove una fantasia trova coerenza nel mondo della realt√†. Vanta una locazione strategica nel cuore della cultura e dello spettacolo: partenza da The Strand per toccare con mano Covent Graden; Trafalgare square; St James Park. Da altra direzione London Eye. Oppure in poltronissima a Teatro. L‚Äôatmosfera di ME London √® alla insegna del buon gusto e della ricerca dello stile e della regalit√† dei tratti, vuoi anche per il profumo prelibato che ovunque nella struttura si respira. Uno staff attento a cogliere le esigenze del cliente per il piacere di una accoglienza. Una Terrazza panoramica che si affaccia con prepotenza e con determinazione per uno sguardi di Londra dall‚Äôalto. Cos√¨ gli occhi sono avvolti da una vista mozzafiato.

Service und  Sauberkeit sind hervorragend. Die Rooftop Bar bietet einen herrlichen Ausblick √ºber die Stadt. Insgesamt ist das Hotel sehr stylisch. 
Kritikpunkte: Im Zimmer gibt es zwar eine gro√üe Bar, daf√ºr aber leider zu wenig Schrankplatz, sodass wir einen Teil unserer W√§sche im Koffer lassen mussten. Im Bad fehlt der Schminkspiegel. Die Flure sind sehr schlecht beleuchtet.",5,2017,06,19

Per qualunque richiesta come ad esempio un'adattatore per la presa di corrente o un termometro per il bambino il personale √® stato rapidissimo e cordiale come sempre.
Qualunque membro del personale molto preparato e disponibile, abbiamo trovato concierge italiani che si alternavano a seconda dei turni, entrambe molto disponibili e gentili.
Abbiamo cenato presso il ristorante dell' Hotel, cucina sublime!
Come posizione non dista molto dalla metropolitana, vari autobus, nelle vicinanze starbucks e Tesco.
Consiglio vivamente!",5,2017,05,31

La verdad que merece la pena conociendo el nivel de los hoteles ingleses esta es una opci√≥n buenisima para Londres. Como nota quizas un poco menos atractiva, desde mi punto de vista, es el tema de que en general el hotel tiene un ambiente chill out con poca iluminaci√≥n, o muy tenue, que es un rollo para el que le guste, muy modernito. La iluminaci√≥n en las habitaciones es correcta, luz natural.",4,2017,05,25

Siamo stati ricevuti dalla signorina Ilaria, che, previa autorizzazione, ci ha accompagnato e mostrato la struttura. Io e la mia compagna siamo rimasti molto colpiti dal design moderno dei corridoi, delle sale e delle stanze. I marmi neri e le luci soffuse davano un tocco molto originale.
Le camere erano perfettamente pulite e il personale molto cordiale; siamo stati anche nella zona ristorante, e nella zona del lounge bar da cui si pu√≤ godere di un ottimo panorama della citt√†.

El dise√±o es el protagonista, aunque pueden pecar de oscuros los pasillos de m√°rmol negro y luz indirecta. Tuve una habitaci√≥n Vibe, que dir√≠a correcta en todo, pero algo impersonal y sin nada que llame la atenci√≥n especialmente, salvo quiz√°s el juego de luces de colores controlado por domotica.

El desayuno tambi√©n ha bajado de calidad, antes era a la carta todo( recuerdo que tome unas tostadas de aguacate espectaculares y ya no las tienen) aunque siguen teniendo una carta con 4 cosas que te hacen al momento.
En el bufett del desayuno el √∫ltimo d√≠a no hab√≠a productos que otros d√≠as si ( salm√≥n ahumado, jam√≥n serrano) y ese d√≠a pusieron mortadela.

El lujo del hotel se nota a cada paso tanto en el staff como en el dise√±o de toda la arquitectura del edificio.

Tambi√©n subimos a la terraza Radio, a tomar una copa, las vistas de Londres desde esa terraza son preciosas, se ve todo Londres. La m√∫sica nos gust√≥ mucho, pinchaba una DJ y los cocktails muy buenos. Sin duda alguna volver√© y lo recomiendo.",5,2017,02,15

148,Experiencia inolvidable ,"Impresionante entrada con un hall sorprendente que no deja a nadie indiferente. Habitaciones muy amplias y camas s√∫per c√≥modas . Tiene una terraza para tomar una copa impresionante, con un ambiente selecto. Probamos tambi√©n el steak , una cena muy rica pero poco apto para familias.
Destacar la atenci√≥n de Omar en recepci√≥n y de Mercedes en los desayunos, s√∫per atentos. Hotel superlativo.",5,2017,01,21
148,Eccellente esperienza,Abbiamo soggiornato in questo splendido hotel per quattro notti insieme ad altri amici e devo dire che sin dall'arrivo ci siamo sentiti come a casa. L'hotel si trova in una posizione centralissima a pochi minuti a piedi dalle principali attrazioni. Le stanze sono spaziose e pulite. Ma la cosa che pi√π mi ha colpito √® stata la professionalit√† del personale che ci hanno seguiti e coccolati per tutto il soggiorno. Staff veramente eccellente. ,5,2017,01,18
148,Gran estancia,"Agradecer en especial a Mercedes del restaurante donde sirven los desayunos  por su gran profesionalidad y amabilidad.
No tan profesionales nos parecieron los empleados de la terraza Radio que nos pusieron inconvenientes para subir a visitarla diciendo que no habia sitio. Siendo clientes del hotel entendemos que tenemos prioridad a la hora de decidir si subimos a visitarla o no. Parece que te perdonan la vida y si no llevas un mini vestido no eres bienvenida.
El personal del hotel fant√°stico.
Sin duda repetiremos",5,2017,01,16
148,Cumpli√≥ con las expectativas,"La ubicaci√≥n del hotel fue perfecta, no tuvimos que coger metro/autob√∫s para movernos por la ciudad. Cabe destacar la amabilidad del personal, especialmente en el check-in y la atenci√≥n prestada durante los desayunos. La habitaci√≥n muy limpia y con todos los detalles que puedes esperar de un hotel de 5 estrellas.",5,2017,01,15
148,UN DISE√ëO QUE FUNCIONA,"Por fin un hotel de dise√±o que funciona. Acostumbrados a viajar por hoteles buscando funcionalidad y belleza, cuando no se sale el agua de la ducha, una puerta no cierra y cuando no falta luz y si no, falla todo a la vez. En el ME es diferente. Comienza con la recepci√≥n. Te acompa√±an hasta ella en un recorrido, al menos la primera vez, que te hace preguntar ""uhmmm, a d√≥nde vamos?"", hasta que ya en la primera planta ""sufres"" el primer impacto. Esa sensaci√≥n es incre√≠ble. Si adem√°s coincide tu llegada con un video mapping sobre las paredes de la recepci√≥n, te das cuenta de que ese hotel tiene algo diferente. El check-in fue r√°pido, amable y eficaz, acompa√±ada de una invitaci√≥n a un prosecco que contribuy√≥ a completar la experiencia. Una vez en nuestra planta, las primeras buenas impresiones se confirmaron. Discreto, elegante... precioso. Y tras el rellano/pasillo de la planta, la habitaci√≥n. Contraste total: moderna y funcional. Genial. Aparte, aunque inicialmente la sensaci√≥n es extra√±a/curiosa por aquello de que buena parte de los empleados llevan pinganillo en la oreja y sospechas, quiz√°s, que su trato sea altivo y prepotente, al contrario, todos fueron muy amables, dispuestos y serviciales. Menci√≥n aparte merece la persona que nos atendi√≥ a nuestra llegada en la recepci√≥n, Andrea creo que se llamaba, Emiliano en la conserjer√≠a ech√°ndonos una mano para nuestras entradas a los musicales y nuestro ch√≥fer Fernando. A ellos, en representaci√≥n de todos los dem√°s, muchas gracias por hacer nuestra estancia inolvidable. Estancia que ""nos tememos"" que no ser√° la √∫ltima.",5,2017,01,09
148,Me non delude mai,"Ottimo albergo confortevole con personale educato  ed efficiente. Purtroppo ho avuto un problema con l'acqua calda in una delle due camere d occupate dalla mia famiglia ( la n.903). Per due giorni in alcune ore del giorno non c'era una goccia di acqua calda, impossibile anche lavarsi le mani. Il giorno 28 alle ore 19 ho dovuto rinunciare a fare la doccia per assenza di acqua . Il  gentilissimo tecnico che √® intervenuto ha risolto il problema  dopo un paio di interventi. Se non fosse stato per questo problema, che tuttavia considero grave per una struttura del livello del Me, il soggiorno sarebbe stato perfetto. Aggiungo che si dovrebbe fare della manutenzione alle guarnizioni delle finestre perch√® in alcuni punti lasciano filtrare il rumore esterno.",4,2017,01,03
148,Experiencia inolvidable,"Nuestra segunda estancia en el ME London y todav√≠a mejor que la primera. Es de destacar la profesionalidad,amabilidad y sincera preocupaci√≥n de todo el equipo por hacer de nuestra estancia una experiencia inolvidable. Luis, Emiliano, Andrea, todos se volcaron para que todo fuera perfecto y lo consiguieron. Las pr√≥ximas navidades, si no antes, volveremos. Las habitaciones tienen todo lo que uno pueda desear y, si echas algo en falta, llamas y procuran tra√©rtelo. La ubicaci√≥n del hotel es extraordinaria, muy cerca de Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, y con muchos y buenos restaurantes alrededor. Muy recomendable",5,2017,01,02
148,Experiencia estancia ME London,"Hemos pasado las navidades en el hotel ME London de una manera fant√°stica.
Hotel moderno enfocado claramente hacia un perfil mas joven.
A nosotros personalmente nos encanto no solo por la localizaci√≥n ya que estas a tiro de piedra de cualquier lugar m√≠tico de Londres, sino tambi√©n por el servicio siempre atento y amable con nosotros. Nos indicaron sitios donde comer o cenar puesto que a mi pareja y a mi nos gusta comer bien y ya sabemos que en Londres es algo mas complicado. Gracias a Emiliano por la atenci√≥n que tuvo con nosotros.
Podr√≠a destacar muchas cosas del hotel pero mejor lo que mejor que puedo decir, es que vay√°is y lo comprob√©is vosotros mismos. Acierto seguro.",4,2017,01,02
148,Todo lo que puedes pedirle a un hotel,"Recientemente hemos tenido la suerte de celebrar nuestro aniversario con un viaje a Londres, y decidimos alojarnos en el emblem√°tico hotel ‚ÄúMe London‚Äù, de la cadena Meli√°. El hotel se encuentra estrat√©gicamente situado en el centro de Londres, cerca Covent Garden. Es un hotel moderno, de forma piramidal, en el que predomina el color negro y la luz tenue, creando un ambiente sereno y relajado. La recepci√≥n, que se encuentra en el primer piso, es impactante, con una original decoraci√≥n basada en proyecciones animadas de diversos motivos sobre sus paredes.

El trato fue exquisito desde el primer momento, tanto por parte de los ‚Äúconcierges‚Äù, como por el equipo de Auras (Mar√≠a, Simona, Alex y Luis) que estuvieron atentos en todo momento a nuestras necesidades y nos proporcionaron numerosas muestras de cari√±o.

La ‚Äúhabitaci√≥n‚Äù, por supuesto climatizada, insonorizada y con m√∫sica ambiental a demanda, contaba con hall, un saloncito con sof√° y pantalla plana de televisi√≥n de gran tama√±o, dormitorio con cama ‚Äúking size‚Äù y otra televisi√≥n de iguales dimensiones, y un magn√≠fico cuarto de ba√±o del que me llam√≥ especialmente la atenci√≥n la ducha, pues era de gran tama√±o, con dos grandes alcachofas que posibilitan que puedan ducharse dos personas al mismo tiempo.

El d√≠a que llegamos la habitaci√≥n estaba decorada con p√©talos de rosa, con una felicitaci√≥n y tarta de aniversario acompa√±ada de una botella de Mo√´t Chandon. El equipo de ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù mantuvo siempre la habitaci√≥n en perfectas condiciones.

En el √∫ltimo piso se encuentra la ‚Äúroof terrace‚Äù, para tomar unas copas y pasar un buen rato, con un ambiente animado y unas vistas espectaculares de la ciudad.
El desayuno, que es de tipo buffet, cuenta con la asistencia de personal cualificado y amable, tales como Mercedes o Ana. Los croissants y las tartas son exquisitas pero me sorprendieron especialmente los huevos benedictinos, magistralmente preparados por Juanan, el cocinero, encantador y detallista.

Y por √∫ltimo quiero agradecer la deferencia del Director y Subdirector, Mr. Marley y Mr. Moretti, que tuvieron la gentileza de saludarnos y felicitarnos.",5,2016,12,17
148,Hotel Muy recomendable para visitar Londres,Hotel muy limpio con un dise√±o muy actual y comodo de sus habitaciones. Muy cerca de Covent Garden y de los teatros Musicales. rodeado de restaurantes y Pub.  Muy bonitas vistas desde el bar de la terraza.,5,2016,12,14
148,Experiencia ME en el centro de Londres,"ME London es un hotel ubicado en el centro de londres, con facil acceso a pie a covent garden o trafalgar square asi como el big ben.
Es un hotel muy enfocado para publico joven y tal vez con ganas de fiesta, asi que realmente no lo recomiendo para publico familiar.
Justo en el lobby hay un bar-discoteca que tiene la musica muy alta, sorprende un poco nada mas llegar ver un ambiente de discoteca en una recepcion de un hotel.
En la primera planta hay la recepcion de lo que es propiamente el hotel, algo mas tranquila pero con mucho ruido si pasas por la noche, dado que las cristaleras del bar de la terraza hacen que todo la musica retumbe en la recepcion.
El trato por todo el personal es excelente, siempre estan alli para lo que necesites e incluso nos ofrecieron una copa de champagne justo al llegar, todo un detalle.
Si bien el ruido y musica se escuchan en la recepcion y lobby, en lo que son habitaciones y pasillos es todo lo contrario, hay mucha tranqulidad y silencio.
La habitacion, perfectamente limpia y muy comfortable, esta a la altura de lo esperado, camas muy comodas, dise√±o practico y funcional y un ba√±o con ducha efecto lluvia espectacular, es todo un placer sentir caer el agua desde el techo.
Me encant√≥ la domotica y luces ambientales de la habitacion que puedes poner segunla hora del dia o tu estado de animo, es un super detalle.
Nuestra habitacion tenia vistas a la calle Aldwych y pese a estar concurrida, los cristales silencian mucho el ambiente de la calle.
Por las noches siempre pasaron a realizar el servicio de turnwdown para refrescar la habitacion y dejarnos chocolates y agua.
El servicio de desayunos tambien es muy bueno, el personal excelente y la comida de calidad, no os espereis un enorme surtido de comida, pero la verdad es que creo que esta perfecto para lo que necesitas para empezar el dia.
No baje al gimnasio pero creo que no tiene piscina, algo que estaria muy bien.
Por ultimo, en la terraza del hotel hay otro bar discoteca o club que esta abierto hasta tarde donde hay un perfil de cliente joven que hace comvertir esa zona en toda una discoteca, lo bueno es que como cliente alojado no tienes que esperar la cola de gente para subir, vi por la calle largas filas de gente queriendo entrar, eso es de agradecer.
Resumiendo es un hotel excelente en todos los sentidos, simpelmente tener presente el concepto juvenil del establecimiento. Espero volver muy pronto!",4,2016,12,14
148,Todo lo que le puedes pedir a un hotel ,"Hemos llegado esta ma√±ana a ME LONDON y desde que hemos entrado por la puerta el concepto de hotel ciudad ha dado un giro de 180 grados.
La entrada ya es digna de visitar as√≠ ,sin m√°s... las paredes inclinadas y el separador de estancia formado por una estructura de cilindros en metal dan la sensaci√≥n de que est√°s entrando en una galer√≠a m√°s que en un hotel.
Me quedo sin palabras al describir la recepci√≥n , de hecho creo que no deber√≠a llamarse as√≠ ... porque esta recepci√≥n es otra historia.
Al estar en el centro de esta estancia y mirar hacia arriba adviertes que las paredes forman una especia de pir√°mide que termina en una c√∫spide trasparente que te permite ver el cielo mientras por sus paredes escalan unas medusas en tonos azules gracias a unos proyectores situados a cada lado de la entrada.
El personal , como ya es habitual en este tipo de hoteles, muy atento y profesional.
Nos han servido agua fresca mientras hac√≠amos el check in ( puedes elegir lo que desees pero en esta ocasi√≥n ven√≠amos sedientos üòâ)

Hemos preguntado por servicio de taxis y teatro y de momento nos han dado precios y posibilidad de reservar lo que necesitemos a lo largo de nuestra estancia.

Ya sub√≠amos contentos para la habitaci√≥n cuando nos hemos ENAMORADO definitivamente del lugar .
La habitaci√≥n en la que nos alojamos es espectacular.

Un recibidor muy espacioso ,una sala de estar con todo lo que puedas desear en el servicio de minibar y un aseo es lo primero que vemos al entrar.

En esta ocasi√≥n tenemos un ba√±o ( en este caso me ocurre como con la recepci√≥n .... el nombre de ba√±o no es adecuado para esta estancia , spa?? Tal vez esto ser√≠a m√°s correcto y fiel a la realidad ) con una ba√±era triangular donde mi hija se ha dado un ba√±o ( como dice ella ) "" de puro lujo"" tambi√©n cuenta con una ducha efecto lluvia y al otro lado del pasillo un tocador con doble seno y toooodooooo lo que puedas necesitar ( hombre o mujer ) para tu cuidado personal. Los productos con los que trabajan siempre naturales y de muy buena calidad incluye secador y plancha para el pelo de primeras marcas. 

El dormitorio espacioso y con unas vistas de infarto es sin duda lo mejor de toda la suite. 
Melia Hotels International es conocido por tener camas de muy buena calidad y es que al final ,no hay nada como dormir bien en cama ajena ( es un plus y algo realmente dif√≠cil de conseguir ) en este caso lo bordan !! 

Ma√±ana probaremos el desayuno pero ya os digo por experiencias anteriores que s√© lo que me espera y lo pienso DISFRUTAR !!!
La localizaci√≥n ideal para unos d√≠as en la cuidad.
Muy muy cerca de los mejores teatros ( desde mi habitaci√≥n veo el teatro  donde representan Mamma M√≠a ) , Convent Garden a 4 minutos andando y muchos restaurantes y tiendas de todo tipo...
Esta noche hemos cenado en un restaurante llamado Canela , relaci√≥n calidad precio muy bueno donde hemos disfrutado de un buen vino y una selecci√≥n de quesos y embutidos t√≠picos portugueses.

Mil gracias al equipo de ME LONDON por su amabilidad y la cantidad de detalles que han tenido con nosotros y nuestra hija, nos hab√©is enamorado a los tres y esto significa que volveremos seguro. Os doy un 10!",5,2016,12,13
148,"Hotel esnob que no cumple con los est√°ndares m√≠nimos de un hotel normal (ruido, luminosidad, trato)","Hotel esnob con atenci√≥n fr√≠a en recepci√≥n. 

En caso de que os digan que os ofrecen una habitaci√≥n de lo mejor en vuestra categor√≠a desconfiad si es en primera planta. En mi caso la habitaci√≥n estaba justo encima de un restaurante que luego pasa a ser ""club"". El ruido y vibraciones impide descansar hasta bien tarde.

Aconsejo que lleveis antifaces ya que hay habitaciones que no tienen paneles para evitar la entrada de luz.

Si vais a ir en familia, sobre todo con ni√±os no es aconsejable que vayais al hotel ya que el minibar, abierto a la vista de todos contiene productos como tangas, bebidas tipo ""shot"" en las que dice literalemente que son para personas con una vida social muy activa y que sirven para tomar si has bebido mucho y quieres continuar con la fiesta, etc...

En mi caso, lo √∫nico que ped√≠ a cambio del precio de un hotel de este tipo fue que me cambiasen de habitaci√≥n la segunda noche porque no soportaba el ruido. Me dijeron que hasta el d√≠a siguiente nada de nada, que todo estaba completo (en booking no era el caso)

En resumen, creo que es un hotel para gente pija que va a la terraza o al restaurante ""club"" a echar el rato con las innumerables chicas que rondan solas a ver que cae y tener una habitaci√≥n cerca, para eso es un hotel de 10. Para todo lo dem√°s mejor no.

El a√±o pasado estuvimos en el level white house y excepto por ubicaci√≥n me gusto mucho mas sobre todo por que pagamos menos y obtuvimos mucho mas en cuanto desayunos y algunas bebidas que van incluidas en el precio.",4,2016,12,05

Siempre habia so√±ado con dormir en este hotel y fue todo una decepcion.  Por la noche la habitacion no ha sido refrescada ni nada, conozco hoteles de 5 estrellas y desde luego este no lo deberia ser. Al dia siguiente me fui al hotel Pullman St Pancras y el servicio ha sido mil veces mejor, he sido recibido y todo el mundo me felicit√≥ por mi cumplea√±os, incluso me habian hecho una peque√±a sorpresa en la habitacion! Y el precio del hotel es mucho mas barato. Quizas no es tan bonito como el me london, pero el servicio es lo que hace la diferencia. Lo siento pero no recomiendo para nada este hotel! Lo unico bonito que tiene son los espacios publicos y los podeis visitar sin reservar una habitacion que no merece la pena! Un saludo",2,2016,11,22

Puedes elegir entre dos tipos de desayuno si no lo llevas contratado, nosotros elegimos el tipo continental de  precio por persona 20 libras, incluye zumos, bolleria, fiambre, fruta y bebida caliente; para nosotros era mas que suficiente, si acaso, se echa en falta un poco mas de variedad en el tipo de fiambres.Por 10 libras mas, se puede tomar el full english breakfast, que inlcuye huevos, bacon, salchichas, etc.  al que le guste ese tipo de desayunos pues ya sabe, aunque por la zona hay gran variedad de sitios donde desayunar, aunque nosotros lo hicimos siempre en el hotel. Personal muy agradable, han estado siempre predispuestos a solucionar rapida y eficazmente cualquier necesidad que les planteabamos, incluso nos ayudaron en la Conserjeria con un problemilla que tuvimos por el retraso del vehiculo que tenia que venir a recogernos para llevarnos al aeropuerto, realizando ellos las gestiones con la empresa del transfer.

Die Einstellung des Personals sowohl beim Check-In als auch im Restaurant ist nicht besonders freundlich und effizient. Dies ist leider oft bei ME-Hotels der Fall (ich kenne dieses Problem bereits aus Madrid).",3,2016,10,20

148,Hotel con encanto ,"Las √∫ltimas veces que he ido a Londres me he alojado en este hotel.  Con su toque modernista (un poco oscura por cierto), est√° muy nuevo.  Las habitaciones, si bien no son muy grandes (es Londres), son suficientemente espaciosas y bien equipadas. Muy recomendable y bien ubicado (en la zona de los teatros).

148,centrico y moderno,"El hotel es espectacular. C√©ntrico y muy moderno. La √∫nica pega fue que no nos ayudaron con las maletas en el check in. El d√≠a antes me llamaron por tel√©fono, una chica espa√±ola, para ver si necesit√°bamos algo. Gran detalle. Tambi√©n en el check in nos ayud√≥ una chiva espa√±ola.
La terraza espectacular. Un poco caro pero vale la pena",5,2016,09,14
148,Excelente ,"Un hotel que no decepciona. El primer punto a destacar es la ubicaci√≥n. Covent Garden es hoy uno de los barrios m√°s bonitos y activos de la Ciudad y el hotel est√° a 200 m del coraz√≥n. Rodeado tanto de restaurantes para todos los presupuestos y minisupermercados abiertos hasta despu√©s de medianoche si el plan es comer algo en la habitaci√≥n del hotel.

El hotel en s√≠ tiene una arquitectura y decoraci√≥n ultramoderna y las habitaciones est√°n cargadas de tecnolog√≠a.  Todas tiene vista a la calle. La atenci√≥n es impecable con un servicio de apoyo para cuestiones como sacar entradas de teatro y dem√°s. 

El desayuno es muy bueno y en un ambiente tranquilo y relajado. Vale la pena antes de salir a caminar.",5,2016,09,13
148,Buena opci√≥n en Londres ,"Olvide s√© de los hoteles mega HIPER triple costosos de Londres. Esta es una muy buena alternativa para un hotel muy interesante con precios realistas. Las habitaciones son c√≥modas, los restaurantes buenos y la terraza para unos tragos Espectacular. Es un hotel para gente menos mandara ( hasta 60 a√±os ) buen localizado y con muchas cosas por hacer caminando en el distrito de teatros ",5,2016,09,11
148,¬øHotel?,"Despu√©s de leer las criticas favorables de tripadvisor, nos decidimos a ir a este hotel, para una estancia de seis d√≠as, en Londres. En principio, tiene una ubicaci√≥n inmejorable, es nuevo, y tenia muy buena pinta. A veces se confunde el concepto de modernidad y de est√©tica con torpes intentos de destacar, y eso pasa en este sitio. Desde la originalidad de colocar la recepci√≥n en la planta 1¬™, la oscuridad extrema de los pasillos, el mobiliario contempor√°neo, pero poco practico para su utilizaci√≥n.... En fin, que si, hay dise√±o, hay modernidad, pero hay incomodidad. Lo importante es la funcionalidad y comodidad, no las exageraciones como la poca iluminaci√≥n del pasillo, el ba√±o incorporado a la habitaci√≥n, la escasez de armario....
Si fuera un hotel mas barato, seria aceptable, pero en a un hotel caro, de 5 estrellas, hay que exigirle mas, y el Melia ME no cumple con estas expectativas.
Pongo con interrogaci√≥n la palabra ¬øhotel?, porque lo que mas destaca es la abarrotada terraza que tiene, con muchisima afluencia que se confunde y confunde a los huespedes del hotel, y la discoteca de la planta baja, tambien de gran afluencia, que tambien confunde, al igual que el publico femenino solitario que suele ocupar el bar del hotel.
En resumen, una buena discoteca, una buena terraza con musica y excelentes vistas, que en las plantas intermedias tiene un hotel intercalado. Me parece exagerado calificar a esto con cinco estrellas, a no ser por el precio que cobran.
Servicio mediocre, intentan ser atentos, pero no lo consiguen, solo el personal de puerta se muestra amable. La recepci√≥n flojita, muy flojita, con pocas atenciones y ning√∫n esfuerzo por hablar espa√±ol. El desayuno, vulgar, muy mal atendido, buffet y un camarero que tarda horas en llevarte un caf√©... desde luego, carisimo para lo que es (se desayuna bastante mejor en otros sitios de las inmediaciones).
En resumen, si tuviera menos estrellas y fuera mucho mas barato, se le pueden pasar estos defectos, pero a un hotel de cinco estrellas y muy caro, no se le pueden perdonar, solo por el hecho de que tenga una ubicaci√≥n excelente.
Desde luego no es un hotel para viajar en familia, tiene un ambiente nocturno, que se mezcla con el hotel, muy peculiar.",2,2016,09,08
148,Me London Gran Experiencia,"Excelente hotel, ubicaci√≥n, servicio, atenci√≥n. No dejar de visitar la terraza, vistas incre√≠bles. Pendientes en todo momento. Gran atenci√≥n llevando a ni√±os ( eso nos gusta a todos los padres ). En el desayuno prestan mucha atenci√≥n e incluso ofrecen cosas especiales a los ni√±os ",5,2016,09,05
148,Hotel snob en todo los conceptos.,"Debo decir que visito Londres 3-4 veces al a√±o, siempre me alojo en hoteles similares y quer√≠a probar este por ser espa√±ol y nuevo.
Gran decepci√≥n.
Llegamos en Taxi desde Paddington y el empleado del hotel que estaba en la puerta se qued√≥ mir√°ndonos mientras baj√°bamos el equipaje. Ni ayuda, ni intenci√≥n.
Entramos al hotel, a la entrada hay una escultura pero no hay m√°s luz que un led simb√≥lico en el techo, y nos dirigimos a un mostrador a la derecha. Error. La recepci√≥n est√° en la primera planta. Llegamos y hay dos personas para atender toda la recepci√≥n, consecuencia, gran cola y espera. La recepci√≥n es una pir√°mide hueca que ocupa todo el centro del hotel y que pretende iluminarse con un lucernario en su punto superior, como todo el mundo sabe Londres es una ciudad con la misma luz que Valencia.
Al salir de recepci√≥n nos dirigimos a la Terrace Room asignada. Se necesita un casco de minero para andar por el hotel, la luz es inexistente. Primera habitaci√≥n y gran fiasco. La habitaci√≥n est√° sucia. El edred√≥n con manchas de fluidos extra√±os y la terraza simplemente no vale para usar. Las sillas presentan incontables quemaduras y est√°n negras de suciedad, hay varios chicles pegados en la mesa y pared. Para colmo la puerta de la terraza no cierra lo que convierte la habitaci√≥n en insegura.
Nos cambian a la 815. La puerta de la terraza tampoco ajusta, el ruido de la calle es ensordecedor, y el armario tendr√° unos 50 cent√≠metros. Como queremos irnos a cenar, optamos por comprar unos tapones para los o√≠dos y olvidarlo. Para acomodar la ropa en el armario agradecimos nuestras pr√°cticas juveniles en tetris. Los tapones resultaron especialmente pertinentes por cuanto en la √∫ltima planta tienen una discoteca que a las seis de la ma√±ana todav√≠a se oye en las habitaciones. 
En los tres d√≠as que all√≠ estuvimos nadie se dirigi√≥ a nosotros nunca, ni al entrar ni al salir para darnos las buenas tardes  o buenos d√≠as, o simplemente saludar.
Me parece especialmente vergonzoso la falta de luz en la entrada y pasillos, pero sobre todo en la entrada.
Llevaba la habitaci√≥n prepagada y aun as√≠, se me retuvo en la tarjeta 300 GBP, circunstancia de la que no se avisa en ninguna cl√°usula de la reserva ni de la web, y me ser√° devuelta, no el d√≠a del check out, sino tres o cuatro d√≠as despu√©s, seg√∫n me dicen. Gracias que, de Meli√°, ya no me sorprende nada.

Hoy en el check out la cola en recepci√≥n es importante y hay dos personas para atendernos.
Por supuesto al hacer el check out no se me pregunta si necesito que suban a buscar el equipaje. Bajamos para irnos y justo cuando estamos ya en la puerta se nos acerca un mozo, con su pertinente pinganillo y me dice que si me lleva la maleta. Le indico que lleve la de mi esposa, que es lo que procede, mientras otros tres miran desde el mostrador del conserje.
Mal dise√±ado, mal cuidado y muy pobre hosteler√≠a. Decepcionante. Gracias que el Mayfair, Sofitel, Brown'S o One Aldwych siguen representando otro standard.",1,2016,09,04

148,Di nuovo al ME London,"√â la seconda volta che scegliamo questo albergo per una vacanza a Londra, ed √© stata un'ottima scelta. L'hotel si trova sullo Strand, quindi nel centro della zona dei teatri, da dove √® possibile raggiungere a piedi molti punti interessanti della citt√†, come Covent Garden, National Gallery e British Museum. L'offerta di un aperitivo all'arrivo √® veramente un gesto carino e gradito, il tutto in una reception che dal punto di vista architettonico √® uno spettacolo. Le stanze (compreso il bagno) sono ampie, comode, ben fornite ed estremamente pulite, e vengono regolarmente sistemate anche alla sera. La colazione comprende un'ampia scelta di dolce e salato, tutto di ottima qualit√†. All'ultimo piano c'√® un bar con vista panoramica (molto alla moda e molto apprezzato anche da chi non soggiorna in albergo) dove gustare aperitivi, dessert e tapas. Infine, ma non per importanza, un voto al personale: 10 e lode! gentilissimi, molto attenti alle esigenze dei clienti, pronti a venire incontro alle nostre richieste, e in grado di fornire indicazioni e suggerimenti utili su luoghi da visitare anche a chi, come noi, conosce gi√† le principali attrazioni di Londra.

148,Fant√°stica experiencia,"La experiencia en el ME London ha sido gratamente buena y ha superado mis expectativas. Aunque el exterior no dice nada, una vez dentro el hotel no deja de sorprenderte: una recepci√≥n diferente, un maravilloso olor que te embriaga al pasar, personal muy amable y agradable, instalaciones y habitaciones impolutas y cuidadas al detalle, insonorizaci√≥n del exterior, amenities fabulosos (que bien huele todo!)... Todo lo que esperas de un 5 estrellas. Adem√°s, la ubicaci√≥n es estupenda al estar al lado de convent garden y pr√≥ximo a parada de autobuses y metro.

Me gustar√≠a destacar el servicio de la recepci√≥n y conserjer√≠a que me ayudaron a resolver un problema con la recepci√≥n de un paquete. Se preocuparon y me ayudaron en todo momento. As√≠ mismo a una de las camareras en el desayuno que me ayud√≥ y se preocup√≥ por m√≠ todos los d√≠as para que no tuviese problemas con mi celiaqu√≠a y pudiese disfrutar al m√°ximo de mis desayunos (una pena no recordar su nombre) 

Por √∫ltimo, agradecer una vez m√°s al manager que me atendi√≥ (soy horrible con los nombres,lo siento) su actuaci√≥n. Gracias por escuchar y entender una situaci√≥n que se hab√≠a convertido en amarga y convertirla en una experiencia inmejorable.",5,2016,08,15
148,"Un gran hotel, una gran ubicaci√≥n.","Hac√≠a tiempo que no visitaba la cadena Melia y la estancia en el Me London fue genial. En primer lugar excelente ubicaci√≥n, muy cerca de covent garden y con acceso a su parada de metro muy pr√≥xima.
La habitaci√≥n moderna y con detalles muy buenos como los bombones. Nosotros nos alojamos con nuestra hija en una habitaci√≥n enorme, con un ba√±o en el que nos pod√≠amos duchar los tres a la vez.
El desayuno excelente con un buen buffet y la posibilidad de pedir que te hagan al momento varios platos.
Un pero y por eso el no dar la categor√≠a excelente; el hotel tiene un problema con los ascensores, escasos para el tama√±o del hotel y adem√°s en ocasiones uno lo bloquean para la radio.

En fin muy recomendable y seguro repetiremos.",4,2016,08,08
148,Maravilloso.,"He estado en dos ocasiones en este hotel. En la primera en agosto de 2015 de cuya habitaci√≥n son las fotos que adjunto, y que era la habitaci√≥n tipo vibe room y en la segunda ocasi√≥n este a√±o 2016 en el tipo de habitaci√≥n mode room, que era un poco m√°s grande y ten√≠a una ducha doble. El hotel es fant√°stico, lleno de atenciones, te dejan un par de bombones todas las noches encima de la almohada, tambi√©n un par de botellas de agua mineral todos los d√≠as y a la llegada te ponen un detallito y una tarjeta de bienvenida que se agradece mucho por la personalizaci√≥n que ves intentan dar a tu visita. Buscan en el hu√©sped una experiencia, m√°s que ofrecer simplemente un sitio donde dormir, as√≠ por ej tienen un aroma personalizado en todo el hotel y que luego puedes comprar si lo deseas y as√≠ cuando est√©s en tu casa puedes evocar tu visita etc. Los amenities son de la marca apivita, una marca de calidad , y nunca he estado en un hotel que dejen un surtido tan completo, desde leche desmaquilladora a un colutorio bucal etc El dise√±o de las habitaciones y del hotel es fant√°stico, obra de Norman Foster y a quienes disfrutamos del dise√±o no nos defrauda. Las habitaciones son muy amplias, las camas comodisimas  y la ropa de cama de mucha calidad, todo una experiencia agradable el dormir en estas habitaciones.
Como punto de mejora los desayunos. De hecho en este segundo viaje no lo contratamos. Demasiados platos a base de huevos en todas sus versiones, est√° bien hacer un gui√±o a la comida local, pero el hotel es espa√±ol y los viajeros multinacionales, necesita urgentemente una mayor variedad.  Mas tipos de dulces, de frutas, de embutidos, de quesos... El personal todo muy atento. El √∫nico punto negativo que yo dar√≠a ser√≠a a los recepcionistas. En el primer viaje el recepcionista se olvido liberar mi tarjeta de cr√©dito al marcharnos del hotel, pues aunque el viaje iba ya pagado nos coment√≥ como hacen en otros hoteles que ten√≠a que dejar en dep√≥sito una cantidad para posibles extras que adem√°s era elevada pues √≠bamos a estar diez d√≠as, y no nos liberaron esa cantidad de dinero al dejar el hotel y aunque luego el director del hotel se preocup√≥ mucho por solucionar la incidencia llam√°ndome a Espa√±a en varias ocasiones etc lo cierto es que durante un mes tuve retenida esa cantidad y no pude utilizar mi tarjeta. De todos modos el detalle que menos me gust√≥ fue que nos hab√≠an dado unos tickets para consumir algo en alguno de sus bares, no pudimos utilizarlos en el primer viaje  y el recepcionista nos dijo que los guard√°ramos para nuestra siguiente visita, y despu√©s de estar casi un a√±o con los vales en mi cartera cuando intente este a√±o utilizarlos y se lo coment√© a la chica de recepci√≥n me dijo que no era posible. Que manera mas tonta de quedar mal con un cliente por algo tan sencillo de arreglar y en un hotel de esta categor√≠a...",5,2016,07,24

Dentro del hotel destacar la amabilidad de todos quienes nos recibieron, a la entrada un joven Brasilero con un muy buen espa√±ol facilita todo. Todo expedito y f√°cil. Desayuno muy bueno sin una gran variedad de cosas pero de muy buena calidad, los muffins son espectaculares. 
En los pasillos falta luz es todo muy oscuro pero en la habitaci√≥n el tema se soluciona, lo √∫nico que nos falto en la habitaci√≥n fue mas espacio para deja la ropa. Gran disposici√≥n de todos por hacernos sentir bien y facilitar todo",5,2016,07,22

La tarjeta de la habitaci√≥n se nos descodific√≥ en un par de ocasiones y nos lo solucionaron r√°pidamente en recepci√≥n.
Por otro lado, fuimos a tomar una copa al Radio Bar y aunque quiz√°s me esperaba un ambiente algo m√°s ""chill-out"", no estuvo mal. El precio de las copas lo encontramos algo excesivo, pero bueno, las vistas y la situaci√≥n del hotel, imagino que lo valen.

Un sitio que seg√∫n dicen ""est√° de moda"" en Londres, lleno de gente hortera de bolera y que mas bien parece un bar de carretera (con todo mi respeto a los bares de carretera).

148,"Super Lage, nettes Personal","√úber das Interior m√∂chte ich hier nicht viel sagen, am Ende ist immer alles Geschmacksache, ich pers√∂nlich fand es super. Das Hotel liegt ausgesprochen gut um alle Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten per Fu√ü erreichen zu k√∂nnen. Die Zimmergr√∂sse ist okay f√ºr ein Stadthotel in dem man nur ein paar wenige N√§chte verbringt. Was mich etwas gest√∂rt hat, ist das es praktisch keinen Platz gibt um Kleider wegzur√§umen. Es hat ein paar B√ºgel auf die man  Sachen h√§ngen kann, aber ansonsten mussten wir aus ""aus dem Koffer leben'. Das Personal im Hotel war ausgesprochen nett und hilfsbereit. Man wurde immer freundlich begr√º√üt und bei Fragen wurde einem sofort geholfen. Im Gro√üen und Ganzen w√ºrde ich diese Hotel durchaus Freunden weiterempfehlen, w√ºrde aber einfach den Punkt mit dem Platz f√ºr Kleider und ggf etwas L√§rm aufmerksam machen.

A la vez dispone de tres restaurantes: uno con vistas y tapas (Radio) muy frecuentado los fines de semana, dj en directo. Un steak restaurante, est√° bastante de moda, los fines de semana muy lleno.

Noi abbiamo alloggiato in una suite al quinto piano, dotata di ogni confort. La vista era stupenda e la posizione dell'Hotel assolutamente idonea per visitare il centro della citt√†.

Insomma, ci torneremo sicuramente.",5,2016,03,27
148,fant√°stico,"Estuve con mi pareja tres noches hace unos d√≠as.
Empezar√© desde la llegada al hotel. Ya en la acera del hotel un chico nos cogi√≥ las maletas. Justo despu√©s subimos a la planta 1 donde hicimos la entrada. Todo muy r√°pido, personal muy atento y con copa de bienvenida. La recepci√≥n espectacular, para verla.
La habitaci√≥n nos la dieron un poco m√°s tarde ya que llegamos muy pronto. 
Uno de los chicos, Emiliano, se ofreci√≥ a ense√±arnos el radio, que es la cafeter√≠a que est√° en la √∫ltima planta del hotel y desde donde se ve todo Londres, unas vistas incre√≠bles!!
Fuimos a comer y a la vuelta estaba todo en la habitaci√≥n.
Hotel espectacular en todos los sentidos.La amabilidad de todo el personal es insuperable, desde los que te reciben al llegar, hasta el del personal de limpieza, que por cierto te hacen  la habitaci√≥n dos veces al dia. 
El hotel esta muy bien situado, tanto para visitar Londres como para comer. Hay sitios muy recomendables y a buen precio justo a la espalda del hotel.
Desayuno impresionante, todo hecho al momento.
Cenamos una vez en el italiano que tiene el hotel  y mi valoraci√≥n calidad precio no es mala pero considero que dada la calidad  del hotel podr√≠an destacar un poco m√°s. Lo digo porque las raciones son muy justas, en concreto el t√°rtaro de salm√≥n es muy escaso. Lo dicho para este hotel creo que podr√≠an mejorarlo.
En el otro restaurante no com√≠ pero la verdad que ten√≠a buena pinta.
Me gustar√≠a hacer una menci√≥n especial a Emiliano, el concierge. Si el Me london es una experiencia excelente, Emiliano la ha multiplicado exponencialmente.Un profesional en todos los sentidos. Trato inmejorable, amabilidad, todo lo que nos aconsej√≥ fue un acierto tras otro. Tuvimos  desgraciadamente problemas con vuelos y nos ayudo en todo. Hac√≠a tiempo que no encontraba a un profesional en un hotel de la categor√≠a de Emiliano.
Lo dicho todo el personal excepcional, pero si vais os recomiendo preguntar por √©l. Habla espa√±ol, ingles e italiano.
Gracias",5,2016,03,24

148,Maravilloso,"Excelente hotel. Dise√±o cuidadisimo, de alto nivel, lleno de detalles ( un bomb√≥n todas las noches en  cada lado de la cama, amenities completisimos, incluido colutorio bucal o leche desmaquillante, todo de la marca apivita, que es una marca premium en productos de higiene personal),decoraci√≥n armoniosa, equilibrada, es un gran trabajo el hecho por Norman Foster. Habitaciones ampl√≠simas y luminosas. Zonas comunes, restaurantes, hall etc maravillosas. Aunque no se puede decir que sea un hotel econ√≥mico , teniendo en cuenta el precio de los hoteles ingleses, y la perfecta estancia que consiguen al hu√©sped, la relaci√≥n calidad precio es buen√≠sima. El concepto aura me gusta, apela a los sentidos y a las emociones con sus detalles , con el aroma del hotel etc pero por decir algo menos positivo, creo que el detalle de abrirte la cama todos los d√≠as la cama a las 8 de la noche es demasiado rebuscado. El desayuno tambi√©n es mejorable. Para unos pocos d√≠as puede que est√© bien pero si tu estancia son 10 d√≠as como fue mi caso tiene poca variedad y lo que es peor, est√° demasiado basado en platos a la carta donde lo que prima son platos que giran en torno al huevo y sus mil maneras de prepararlo al estilo ingl√©s , con lo que se acaba haciendo pesado e indigesto a lo largo de los d√≠as. La gente que lo atend√≠a  era encantadora,salvo una chica rubia, que era encargada adem√°s , que era poco amable, era la √∫nica que no te dejaba escoger sitio aunque estuviera vac√≠o el local, que por cierto era demasiado estrecho. Adem√°s un plus el director del hotel . Hubo un problema con mi tarjeta de cr√©dito y tuve una vez hecho el pago un dinero retenido durante un mes, y se volc√≥ en solucionarme el problema, incluso me llam√≥ por tfno varias veces estando yo ya en Espa√±a para interesarse por la resoluci√≥n del mismo. Encantador y eficiente. Repetir√© sin duda y lo recomiendo a todo el mundo.",5,2016,03,22

148,Per coloro che non cercano lo charme,"Albergo centralissimo in zona Covent Garden adatto anche ai frequentatori di teatri. Si tratta di una struttura molto moderna e come tale anche fredda; manca totalmente lo charme londinese dei vecchi palazzi vittoriani. Camere abbastanza ampie e curate, tecnologicamente top. Malgrado sia centralissimo il rumore dall'esterno √® praticamente nullo. Ottimo per coloro che amano la vita notturna e intendono frequentare i bar alla moda dell'albergo.
Siamo stati nel periodo dell'avvento ed in albergo non abbiamo visto neppure una decorazione o una luce natalizia. Inoltre per essere un 5 stelle manca attenzione nella pulizia della stanza e nella cura delle cose. Cavatappi nel minibar sporco di cioccolata (?) e tazza del water che si muove.

Top Lage mitten drin: 5 Minuten zu Covent Garden, 5 Minuten zur Themse und London Eye, 10 Minuten zum Trafalgar Square.Hotel stylisch, die Rezeption ist eines Blickes wert. Wir hatten Zimmer der Klasse Aura (Standardzimmer) gebucht und bekamen kostenloses Upgrade auf ein Zimmer der Kategorie Vibe: f√ºr Londoner Verh√§ltnisse gro√ü, stylisch mit viel technischen Elementen und super Ausblick auf die Stadt. Service ausgezeichnet, von der Rezeption bis zu den Zimmerm√§dchen mit Ausnahme einer bestimmten Dame am Empfang des STK Restaurants: es gab ein kleines Problem mit unserer Reservierung im STK und diese Dame zeigte keinerlei Interesse das Problem zu l√∂sen. Die Mitarbeiter der Hotelrezeption bem√ºhten sich und konnten das Problem aufkl√§ren. Dinner im STK ist ausgezeichnet, das Fr√ºhst√ºck ebenso. Die Radio Bar ist ein Besuch wert, als Hotelgast gibt es keinen minimum spend.

Las habitaciones son de buen tama√±o y muy limpias, tuvimos el desayuno incluido el cual es de muy buena calidad y el personal muy amable,  lo mejor de este hotel sin duda fue el servicio. Trabajo para  hoteles tambi√©n y eso, considero, me hace m√°s exigente en cuanto al servicio. En la ciudad la gente es muy fr√≠a, en pocos lugares tur√≠sticos encontramos personas amables, estar en Me, era como estar en otro lugar muy diferente a Londres.

148,Hotelazo en el centro del meollo,"Sin duda el mejor hotel de Londres. Situado en The Strand, en todo el centro, a 5 minutos (a pie) de Trafalgar Sq o Covent Garden y rodeado de teatros, bares, restaurantes y todo lo que puedas necesitar, LA UBICACI√ìN NO PUEDE SER MEJOR!

El desayuno de primer√≠sima calidad, si te tomas el buffet te ahorras comer a medio d√≠a, porque te vas a poner las botas. Si optas por la carta, os recomiendo las Canadian Pancakes, deliciosas.

Radio, su terraza, es un lugar perfecto para tomarte un cocktail con las mejores vistas de Londres. No me acuerdo del nombre de lo que me tom√©, pero era algo as√≠ como un Martini con ginger ale que estaba que se te va la olla. Vamos, que tuve que repetir!

Las habitaciones son muy grandes, todas exteriores y con una limpieza exquisita, algo muy de agradecer en la capital inglesa cuyos hoteles no son precisamente famosos por eso...

Y el personal, pues encantador como en todos los ME! Menci√≥n especial merecen Mat√≠as, su subdirector, que nos cuid√≥ como si fu√©semos sus amigos, y Ronan de Conserjer√≠a, que nos consigui√≥ entradas para un musical apenas levantando el tel√©fono, y a un precio m√°s competitivo que el de la propia web del teatro.

Personal: Excelente. Te hablan en espa√±ol.

Habitaciones: modernas y funcionales. Quiz√°s el √∫nico pero es q son un poco peque√±as, aunque m√°s grandes q las de las cadenas nativas. El armario peque√±o.

Comida: Buen desayuno. De los pocos hoteles en Londres donde te dan buena fruta y cortada .

Ein herzlicher Empfang in der Beeindruckenden Rezeption, die wie eine Pyramide gestaltet ist- Beeindruckend. Das Team aus jungen, engagierten, lebensfrohen, herzlichen, h√∂flichen, mond√§nen, hinrei√üenden Menschen! Ganz besonders hervorzuheben ist Nicky Heath- sie machte unseren Aufenthalt so perfekt, dank Ihrer Hilfe und Organisation war der Geburtstag einfach unvergesslich! Aber auch Concierge Curtis- Hilfsbereit, bem√ºht, freundlich, dynamisch jung- Das ganze Team gibt einem den Eindruck besonders wichtig zu sein und alle W√ºnsche werden versucht umzusetzen. Es war eine reine Freude! Es ist wirklich eine Besonderheit und kaum noch zu treffen- Dies in einem grandiosen, atemberaubenden Hotel- sauber, modern, stylisch, luxuri√∂s, erstklassig mit einzigartigem herzlichen Service.
Hotelg√§nge sehr dunkel- Steakhaus dunkel und laut- voller lebenslustiger Menschen. Ein Hot Spot in London.

Tuvimos una experiencia negativa en la ciudad ( no en el hotel!) y ellos nos ayudaron much√≠simo y demostraron una gran empat√≠a, en especial el equipo de conserjeria y recepci√≥n.
No se si podre volver a este hotel alg√∫n dia , ya que tuve la suerte de encontrar una muy buena oferta, pero me al menos me ha quedado el grato recuerdo de una experiencia inolvidable en el mejor de los sentidos ya que este hotel ha superado con creces mis expectativas. 
Como descripci√≥n practica dir√© que las habitaciones son espaciosas (para ser Londres) completamente insonorizadas, colchones super comodos, ba√±o bonito y practico , con albornoces incluidos!
Lo dicho una experiencia fantastica!!",5,2015,05,20

148,Hotel moderno en el centro de Londres,"Nos alojamos para celebrar mi cumplea√±os durante 3 noches. Hay que reconocer que el hotel es caro, pero teniendo en cuenta el precio medio en Londres, merece la pena. Est√° situado a unos pasos de Covent Garden. La zona es fantastica, rodeada de restaurantes y con mucho movimiento.  Casi pegando hay un Pret a Manger y un supermercado Tesco. El metro m√°s cercando es la estaci√≥n de Temple que queda a 5 minutos andando.

El trato por parte del personal fu√© muy bueno. La habitaci√≥n Aura es moderna, limpia y de buen tama√±o. El wifi en las habitaciones es gratuito y funciona bien. No necesitas adaptador para la corriente ya que dispone de enchufes tipo espa√±ol. 
El detalle de la notita cada noche y los bombones sobre la cama me encant√≥.

Lo que m√°s me gust√≥ fue sin duda el ambiente que hay en el bar de la azotea los viernes y s√°bados, m√∫sica y gente muy cool. Las vistas son espectaculares. Muy recomendable para tomar una copa antes de cenar o simplemente una cerveza por la tarde. 

Quiz√°s el desayuno es lo que fall√≥ un poco. Pero en general un hotel fant√°stico y s√∫per recomendable!!!",4,2015,05,07

En el desayuno quiz√°s un poco de desorden, la habitaci√≥n muy confortable. La recepci√≥n es un espacio incre√≠ble, digno de visitar. La cena en el STK todo un acierto y la terraza con unas vistas impresionantes y un ambiente moderno y con clase.",4,2015,04,28

148,Hotel fantastico e personale superlativo,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 5 giorni durante le vacanze di Pasqua. Siamo arrivati il giorno dopo l'inizio del black out provocato da un incendio nella zona di Holborn, motivo per cui l'albergo era completamente al buio. Il personale alla reception ci ha spiegato immediatamente qual era il problema, e ci ha messo a scegliere tra rimanere in hotel o spostarci in un'altra struttura, specificando che in questo secondo caso si sarebbero occupati di tutto loro. Considerato che, nonostante il black out, le camere erano dotate di acqua calda, abbiamo deciso di rimanere, e non ce ne siamo assolutamente pentiti! L'illuminazione era comunque garantita da una pi√π che adeguata dotazione di candele, e dopo due notti la situazione √® tornata alla normalit√†. In una situazione di potenziale disagio la carta vincente dell'albergo √® stata senza dubbio l'estrema cortesia e professionalit√† dello staff: sono stati veramente gentilissimi, disponibilissimi, estremamente attenti alle esigenze del cliente. Insomma, uno staff eccezionale, a iniziare dal manager Andrew, continuando con Simona, Antonella e tutti i loro colleghi di cui purtroppo non ricordiamo il nome. La seconda sera, quando hanno avuto la possibilit√† di utilizzare le cucine, ci hanno anche offerto la cena!
La struttura √® molto bella: moderna, elegante, molto curata, le camere sono spaziose e ben organizzate e il letto √® molto comodo, il bagno √® grande e, soprattutto, la pulizia √® molto accurata.
La colazione √® abbondante e varia, con ampia scelta sia per il dolce che per il salato.
La posizione √® ottima, nel cuore dello Strand, vicinissimo alla maggior parte dei teatri e a molti luoghi di interesse (Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly...).
Una gradita sorpresa √® arrivata al momento del check out, quando siamo stati informati che delle cinque notti che avevamo prenotato ce ne sarebbero state rimborsate tre, ovvero una in pi√π rispetto alle due notti che avevamo trascorso 'a lume di candela'. Cosa dire: fantastici!
Ci torneremo? decisamente s√¨!",5,2015,04,25

Pese a todo, nuestra estancia fue muy agradable y el personal del hotel fue muy atento y nos ayud√≥ en todo lo posible.

148,ME LONDON es mucho MELI√Å ME.,"√âsta ha sido mi tercera estancia en el ME LONDON desde su apertura (hace dos a√±os), y por supuesto en el pr√≥ximo viaje volver√© al ME LONDON. No es s√≥lo por su ubicaci√≥n que es simplemente perfecta, en Covent Garden y a 8' andando de Trafalgar Square o de las estupendas vistas del Waterloo Bridge.
Lo que m√°s destaca en el ME LONDON es la atenci√≥n personalizada que te dan, desde que llegas hasta que te vas...y esa personalizaci√≥n tambi√©n se da en los fant√°sticos desayunos con un personal atento y amable. Todo el personal desborda profesionalidad.
Las habitaciones son impecables con dom√≥tica que puedes controlar, luces, climatizaci√≥n...con camas muy amplias y tremendamente c√≥modas y muy silenciosas a pesar de estar en una calle de tr√°fico.
La terraza (RADIO), es un lugar excelente para tomarte una copa antes de dormir disfrutando del "" skyline"" de Londres, as√≠ como el bar MARCONI a la entrada, es un rinc√≥n muy agradable y tranquilo. 
Y no hay que dejar de ver el programa de luz y sonido que diariamente ponen en la recepci√≥n a las 8 de la tarde.

La reception, in particolare, √® un ambiente da togliere il fiato per l'ardita concezione architettonica. Ah, e la connessione Wi Fi √® perfetta, veloce e immediata. E gratis. 
Deludente rispetto alle aspettative il bar sul tetto che, in mancanza della vista data la stagione, si √® rivelato un tantino banale con personale abbastanza incompetente, ma √® un neo trascurabile. Non costa poco ma neanche uno sproposito dati gli standard inglesi.

La cama es increiblemente c√≥moda, nos ha costado salir de la misma todos los d√≠as! El mini-bar es uno de los m√°s completos y diferentes que he visto, y se agradece mucho.

El hotel est√° muy bien situado, un paseo y estas en la catedral y el Millenium bridge. Otro paseo y Big Ben, London Eye....

Tambi√©n hace inolvidable la experiencia la buena predisposici√≥n del equipo del hotel, la velocidad de respuesta y amabilidad.
El √∫nico inconveniente que tuve fue, la primer noche, con la limpieza de la habitaci√≥n, las s√°banas ten√≠an manchas como si alguien hubiera caminado sobre ellas con zapatos!

Es una pena que para llegar a la recepci√≥n haya 3 ascensores y 2 estuviesen estropeados con lo que optamos por subir por la escalera, que desmerece completamente la calidad del resto, se rompe el espectaculo creado por el arquitecto.

La camera era dotata di ogni confort, pulita ed accogliente, il frigo bar fornito di molte variet√† di cibo, ogni sera ci coccolavano con cioccolatini, pensieri di celebrit√† e acqua per la notte.
Tutto il personale gentilissimo, in particolare ci ha fatto piacere trovare molti impiegati italiani con i quali √® stato possibile avere un ottimo contatto per le informazioni.
La colazione del mattino deliziosa e ricca ci ha donato l'energia per affrontare la citt√† con tutte le sue attrazioni.
Fantastico il roof garden (a parte la musica davvero troppo alta per noi uomini e donne di mezza et√†!!!) Ci siamo accorti troppo tardi che era possibile avere l'afternoon tea, ci sarebbe senz'altro piaciuto tanto vista la preparazione accurata dei tavoli ed il menu invitante.
Non vediamo l'ora di poter ritornare. Bravi tutti!",5,2014,11,24

148,"Ist ganz ok, mehr aber auch nicht","Meine Mutter hatte meiner Oma anl√§sslich ihres Geburtstags eine Reise nach London geschenkt und auch mich dazu eingeladen. Zun√§chst einmal muss man festhalten, dass London nun einmal wahnsinnig teuer ist und Hotels da keine Ausnahme bilden. Trotzdem hatte ich f√ºr den hohen Preis etwas mehr erwartet. 

Das Zimmer war sehr modern und cool, sehr sauber und nette Aussicht. Die Matratze war au√üergew√∂hnlich bequem und ich habe sehr gut geschlafen. 

Was ich als st√∂rend empfand waren die sehr d√ºsteren G√§nge. Was hat man sich dabei blo√ü gedacht? Architektonisch ist das Hotel sonst sehr modern, sehr ""durchdesignt"". 

Den Service fand ich okay, aber weder besonders freundlich noch herzlich. Wenn man hereinkommt, stehen mehrere Mitarbeiter in komischen Pullis herum (kann man die nicht mal ordentlich einkleiden?). Auf jeden Fall sehen sie gar nicht aus wie Hotelmitarbeiter und ich war daher zun√§chst verwirrt, als ich angesprochen wurde. 

Eine absolute Frechheit war der Preis f√ºr das Fr√ºhst√ºck. Meine Oma, meine Mutter und ich hatten jeweils einen O-Saft, einen Kaffee und Br√∂tchen (also nichts besonderes) und haben daf√ºr sage und schreibe 70 Pfund hingebl√§ttert!

El restaurante de desayunos, Cuccina Asellina, buen√≠simo tanto en calidad de servicio como en productos.
Desde el bar de la azotea, Radio Rooftop Bar, espectaculares vistas de Londres, mucho mejor de noche y no hace fr√≠o gracias a las estufas. Hay un gasto m√≠nimo, pero al estar alojados en el hotel no s√© si es obligatorio, mejor preguntar porque depender√° de la ocupaci√≥n.

148,Hotel de dise√±o muy bien situado,"Es un hotel con un dise√±o espectacular, muy bien situado en el centro de Londres. Muy c√≥modo. La plantilla es muy amable. La habitaci√≥n era bonita, pero no tiene suficiente espacio de armario si la estancia no va a ser s√≥lo de fin de semana. Y como defecto, creo que la limpieza en la habitaci√≥n no era suficiente. En fin de semana, algunas habitaciones pueden tener problemas de ruidos, al estar situadas encima del restaurante que tambi√©n funciona como club.

148,LA ELEGANCIA DE LOS DETALLES,"Acabamos de llegar de Londres y nuestra estancia en el ME  ha sido genial. La atenci√≥n del personal exquisita , las habitaciones formidables y el edificio en su conjunto de una elegancia exquisita , propia de su arquitecto Norman Foster . Es un orgullo como arquitecto haberme hospedado y disfrutar de los detalles y confort del hotel y que pertenezca a la cadena MELIA , que por supuesto en todas las ciudades que he podido visitar , son referencias de lo mejor .
Muchas gracias de parte m√≠a y de mi familia por vuestra amabilidad para con nosotros ..han contribuido a que las vacaciones fueran m√°s inolvidables.

148,HOTEL MODERNO E TRENDY,"Suggestiva e soddisfacente esperienza, dopo essere stato in altri Hotel 5 stelle o un po' troppo ovattati o un po' troppo business, in un Hotel moderno e di design, tecnologico, dinamico e soprattutto vivo. Entrati, dopo essere stato accolti con gentilezza da Carlos, veniamo accompagnati al primo piano dove si trova il ricevimento in una sala a dir poco incredibile, la base di una piramide, nella quale ci viene offerto del prosecco e ci vengono fornite pi√π' informazioni possibili sul nostro soggiorno cos√¨' dopo un primo ospitale e caloroso impatto, veniamo accompagnati in camera che era una Terrazza Energy River . Camera di media grandezza con tutti i confort possibili tra cui luci di diverso colore per rendere  il soggiorno ancora piu' di tendenza, cos√¨' come e' del resto tutto l'Hotel, e con un balconcino dal quale si poteva gustare un primo assaggio di Londra. Bagno accogliente con splendida doccia e varie amenity. Colazione di qualit√†' con prodotti freschi e ben serviti e gestione del personale in tutti gli ambienti veramente impeccabile e sempre a nostra disposizione. Nei dintorni si vive la vera Londra con teatri, locali e luoghi di interesse vario. Attraente il Roof Bar Radio  situato all'ultimo piano aperto anche agli ospiti. Per concludere un Hotel veramente da scoprire e da amare. Complimenti a chi ha saputo rendere tutto cio' un vero paradiso.",5,2014,08,11
148,Modernidad en el centro de Londres,"Hotel nuevo y moderno, en el que disfrutar de habitaciones acogedoras en el centro de la ciudad, a unos minutos a pie de Covent Garden, London Eye, Trafalgar...
Dos 'peros', luz excesivamente tenue, con pasillos casi oscuros (parte del estilo innovador del hotel), y excesivo volumen de la m√∫sica del bar de la planta baja que puede llegar a molestar.
La extra≈Ña llegada al hotel deriva de que la planta baja cuenta  on conserjer√≠a, bar, hall y pasillo hasta los ascensores, donde seg√∫n si eres cliente del hotel o no, te dejan acceder a unos u otro, ya que en la azotea se encuentra uno de los restaurantes de  oda de la ciudad.
Si te alojas en el hotel, a la llegada los conserjes te acompa√±an a recepci√≥n, en la primera planta, donde te reciben con champ√°n.
Trato agradable, inter√©s del personal por agradar, y la facilidadd de que en Londres te atiendan en espa√±ol.
El desayuno algo flojo, no acorde a lo esperado, con suplemento en el coste para acceder a muchos de los platos. Nos atendi√≥ una chica de Lanzarote a la que queremos agradecer el trato y su amabilidad.
RESUMEN: moderno, tal vez en exceso (no me veo un perfil de cliente de 50/60 a√±os en el hotel) a la par de acogedor en las habitaciones (no las zonas comunes), algo ruidoso, de desayuno pobre y muy bien situado.",4,2014,08,09
148,Fant√°stico.,"Es un hotel con una situaci√≥ excelente, si bien lo que m√°s nos gustaria destacar fue el trato recibido por el personal del hotel.
El servicio result√≥ excepcional.
Adem√°s en muchos momentos nos atendieron en espa√±ol.
Nos gustaria destacar a Marcela y Gilberto. 
En el desayuno nos atendi√≥ con gran amabilidad Natalia  siempre pendiente de  nuestras demandas.
Sin ninguna duda una experiencia 100% recomendable.",5,2014,08,03
148,Estupendo,"Muy c√©ntrico. Puedes ir andando a todas partes: British, a la Tate a  Trafalgar, al Soho,... S√≥lo tuvimos que coger el metro para ir a Canden Town.

Las habitaciones muy c√≥modas y silenciosas y los restaurantes del hotel muy recomendables. ",5,2014,07,25
148,Gran ubicaci√≥n y servicio,"Muy bien situado al lado de Covent Garden, delante del puente de Waterloo, muy cerca del London eye,adem√°s hay 3  paradas de metro entre 5 y 10 min andando Temple, Covent Garden y Holborn. El servicio muy atento, gran parte del personal habla espa√±ol. No se si han cambiado la pol√≠tica pero nosotros no tuvimos que pagar ning√∫n extra en el desayuno.",5,2014,07,02
148,Muy buena experiencia,"Estuve en el Me de Londres en el mes de Junio. El hotel es espectacular, una arquitectura futurista de Norman Foster. Llama la atenci√≥n la recepci√≥n en el primer piso, nunca vi nada igual. Con im√°genes 3D en las paredes de la recepci√≥n.. Como s√≠ estuvieras en Star Trek. Cuando haces el check in te dan una copa de cava, los recepcionistas amabil√≠simos. Marta y Marcela, las ""Auroras"" del hotel son simpatiqu√≠simas y profesionales. Viajo por trabajo bastante y nunca encontr√© un servicio tan diferente como el de estas muchachas, me ayudaron en todo lo que necesite y encima en espa√±ol!

El hotel est√° en el lugar perfecto para ir de compras, teatro o en mi cas√≥ la oficina donde trabajo cuando en Londres.

La habitaci√≥n est√° muy bien equipada y s√∫per limpia, que las ventanas no se abran es un tanto extra√±o pero como son amplias y de color blanco no tienes sensaci√≥n de cerrado. Me aloje en una habitaci√≥n en la 6a planta tipo Mode, genial!

La terraza de arriba tiene vistas espectaculares, la chica del ascensor un poco abrupta pero los barman muy simp√°ticos. La comida  es espa√±ola pero no del todo como en casa, ser√° el producto.. Los c√≥cteles muy muy buenos.

Desayuno muy bien los 3 d√≠as, una chica irlandesa muy amable es la jefa y me pareci√≥ encantadora.

S√≥lo una pega, internet es un poco lento.

En general un 10! Ya tengo nuevo hotel en Londres!",5,2014,06,27
148,"Arquitectura, dise√±o y servicio","El hotel esta muy bien ubicado, cerca de covent garden. Muy cerca del subway (temple o charing cross). La recepcion en el 1er piso genera intimidad y un cuidado extra con los clientes porque se evita la masificacion que hay en PB a causa de la terraza/restaurante nocturna.
El hotel en si mismo es hermoso, bastante eclectico y moderno pero eso no lo hace frio, gana calidez con la atencion y servicio. Todo el personal es muy amable y eficiente, y tratan a cada huesped como si fuera unico. La habitaci√≥n tiene una cama muy comoda y grande, el ba√±o tiene ameneties varias, la tv esta conectada a una consola con varios puertos que permite reproducir lo que tienes en tu iphone.
Frente al hotel tienen parada los buses turisticos de Londres. El room service es muy bueno.
En general un hotel de 10 para volver.",5,2014,06,14
148,"Buona posizione, hotel moderno e confortevole","Hotel a pochi passi da Covent Garden, comodo anche per la tube e gli spostamenti a piedi.
Arredamento minimalista, chic e d'effetto, reception imponente e accoglienza calorosa con un bicchiere di prosecco o champagne.
La nostra camera, Energy Uban Terrace, non era molto spaziosa (quasi un corridoio) e l'armadio aveva poco posto per gli abiti. 
Bella la sala da bagno con doccia doppia e servizi igienici separati. 
Accappatoi e ciabattine forniti, come la linea beauty.
Fornitissimo minibar, macchina Nespresso per il primo caff√® della giornata e due bottigliette d'acqua per la notte.
La colazione era ripetitiva, tre colazioni con le stesse identiche pietanze. 
Servizio bar non all'altezza di un hotel di questa categoria, i cocktail lasciavano a desiderare. La pulizia non era curata a dovere malgrado la camera venisse risistemata sia il pomeriggio che la sera. Anche tazze e bicchieri non erano in numero sufficiente e abbiamo dovuto farlo notare.
Connessione wireless altalenante, soprattutto in serata.",3,2014,06,12
148,Un hotel nuevo y con un servicio excelente,"Un acierto de hotel, su localizaci√≥n en plena zona de teatros y junto a Coven Garden, es ideal. El servicio es esmerado y siempre atento. Los restaurantes muy buenos, tanto el de carnes como el italiano. Tiene un Bar terraza estupendo, con unas vistas fant√°sticas, los c√≥cteles muy bien. La habitaciones son correctas con espacio suficiente para ser Londres. Si tengo que ponerle una pega es que como que los restaurantes y las terrazas tienen tanto √©xito, el hotel siempre tiene movimiento, es decir, no es un hotel tranquilo. Si vas no te pierdas la galer√≠a Courtaulds, est√° justo enfrente y tiene una colecci√≥n de pintura peque√±a pero interesante ( tienen el autorretrato que Van Gogh se hizo despu√©s de cortarse la oreja, pero sin sangre, con vendas)",5,2014,06,12

148,Esperienza sale riunioni e roof bar...,"Iniziamo con dire che √® un albergo dove avrei sicuramente voluto soggiornare.
Non fatico a credere alle recensioni che ho visto su Trip Advisor.
Purtroppo posso offrire la mia esperienza solo per quando riguarda la sala riunioni ed il roof bar che peraltro che credo abbia un accesso anche diretto ma credo solo su prenotazione.
Entrata proprio bella dove architettura diventa arte.
Le sale riunioni comode e bel servite, unica pecca il cellulare quasi non riceve.
Roof bar incredibile con vista bellissima. 
Nell'insieme lo credo costoso ma visto che nel centro di londra costano tutti... forse qui si spende qualche sterlina in pi√π ma ben spesa.",4,2014,06,08

148,Hotel de 5 estrellas con matices,"Bueno, esta es mi primera opinion sobre los hoteles en los que me he alojado por el mundo, en mi caso considero este hotel, como hotel innovador,tecnologico, y muy clasista.

Para empezar, el recibimiento al hotel es de los mas curiosos que he tenido, pues al entrar nos recibe el personal, que nos recoge las maletas nos pregunta que que tal el vuelo y nos acompa√±a a la recepcion que se encuentra en la primera planta, la recepcion era una maravilla no nos daba la sensacion de estar haciendo el check in y teniamos a nuestra disposicion cualquier bebida que nos apeteciese como detalle de bienvenida.

La habitacion que nos ofrecieron nos era mas que suficiente y tenia todos los detalles posibles, amenities tanto de ba√±o como comestibles, y un detalle era el tema de la luz en la habitacion que podias modificarla a tu antojo e incluso cambiarle los colores, el ba√±o tenia ducha balinesa y apartado con una puerta el wc, la ducha era magnifica pero quizas la unica pega que pondr√≠a a la habitaci√≥n, es el olor de las ca√±erias y debajo de las baldosas de la ducha.

Las habitaciones no est√°n insonorizadas.

El personal, muy amable y educado, se esforzaban por hablar en tu idioma, salvo alguno de personal que tenia cara de tener pocos amigos. 

Un detalle que no nos gusto es que todas las noches nos llamaban a la habitaci√≥n o se escuchaban ruidos raros en la ranura de la tarjeta de nuestra puerta, parecia que te tenian controlado en todo momento.

Por otra parte y esto si que es el detalle mas vergonzoso del hotel, era la subida a la terraza, una de las noches nos dijeron que ya estaba cerrada y que sin dni no podiamos acceder a ella, cuando clientes de fuera del hotel sin necesidad de acreditacion subian sin ningun problema.
La siguiente noche fuimos dispuestos con el dni y nos dijeron lo mismo que estaban a punto de cerrar y conseguimos despues de pelotear un rato subir solo para visitarla, y cual fue nuestra sorpresa que cuando salimos del ascensor la terraza estaba llena y la gente seguia pidiendose cocteles por todos los lados, nos salimos a fuera para poder contemplar las vistas, y nos avisaron que solo podiamos estar un rato, cosa que me molesto.

Problemas a un lado, el hotel arquitectonicamente hablando, es una maravilla, su zona de check in es de las mas impresionantes en las que he estado,

¬øVolveria al hotel?  NO

Mis estancias hoteleras siempre las valorare con un 10 por la compa√±ia porque no podria ser mejor pero los detalles que he dado siempre dan para pensar.

Mi recomendaci√≥n: Visitenlo y den su opini√≥n..",4,2014,06,01
148,Inmejorable!!!,"Nuestra primera experiencia en este hotel fue de Septiembre del a√±o pasado y ten√≠amos muy claro que si volv√≠amos a Londres repetir√≠amos. Por supuesto lo hemos hecho y estamos encantados de haber estado de nuevo en el ME la semana pasada. Es ideal por su ubicaci√≥n, Londres se encuentra a tus pies, y a la hora del descanso te encuentras en el mejor hotel, habitaciones dotadas de la √∫ltima tecnolog√≠a, camas muy c√≥modas, todo cuidado con un mont√≥n de detalles, flores, velas......sin olvidarme del r√≠quisimo desayuno. Dar las gracias a todo el personal que ha sido muy profesionales. Pero sobre todo a Nicol√°s que como la ultima vez nos ayudo en todo lo necesario d√°ndonos un trato muy cercano.",5,2014,05,29
148,Mala Experiencia,"Despu√©s de pagar 1.200.-  por una estancia de 4 d√≠as, con desayuno incluido, no te pueden cobrar un caf√© de m√°quina solicitado en el propio desayuno. Es cutre y refleja poco inter√©s en que el cliente tenga una buena experiencia en el Hotel.",2,2014,05,25
148,Ubicaci√≥n perfecta,"La ubicaci√≥n es excelente, instalaciones modernas y originales, habitaciones bien equipadas y camas muy c√≥modas, desayuno correcto y personal muy agradable, siempre dispuestos a ayudar, en nuestro caso N√©stor nos resolvi√≥ las dudas y atendi√≥ nuestras peticiones muy amablemente.",5,2014,05,20

Tutte le maggiori attrazioni sono raggiungibili a piedi.",4,2014,05,18
148,bellissimo hotel,"ho soggiornato in questo splendido hotel nei primi giorni di maggio. L'hotel √® modernissimo con un arredo di gran gusto e un tono molto soft  che accresce l' atmosfera di gran classe che vi si respira . Appena entrati si nota che √® un albergo diverso dal solito forse per il piacevole profumo, l'arredamento , la luce soffusa e anche per la gentilezza del personale, ragazzi giovani semplicemente meravigliosi , disponibili , gentili e sempre sorridenti ; uno dei ragazzi della conciergerie ti accompagna al primo piano per il check-in e nel breve tempo del disbrigo delle formalit√† ti offre un bicchiere di champagne. Dopo sei accompagnato in camera e nel percorso sei informato sul funzionamento dell'hotel, delle varie opzioni ecc. giunti in camera ti viene spiegato anche qui il funzionamento del pannello di comando delle luci e del condizionatore, della tv, del wi-fi gratuito, della macchina per il caff√® nespresso ( capsule di caff√® gratuite ).  Le camere sono dotate di tutti i confort, ben isonorizzate, doccia stupenda e biancheria di classe. le camere vengono rifatte nel pomeriggio e la sera vengono di nuovo risistemate dotandole di bottigliette di acqua gratuite , cioccolatino e bigliettino con un  aforisma. La colazione seppur costosa √® allineata allo standard dell'hotel : ottima e varia dal dolce al salato ( muffin meravigliosi e marmellate Wilkin & Sons ), unico appunto √® il pagamento extra per cioccolata e cappuccino, cosa non consona alla classe dell'hotel e al costo della colazione, certe politiche lasciano perplessi. Al bar ""Radio ""  con la bellissima  terrazza con vista su Londra si accede da un ascensore diverso da quello per le camere ed √® fruibile dagli esterni ( e naturalmente senza difficolt√† dagli ospiti dell'hotel ). Unica pecca dell'hotel √® la mancanza di computer e stampanti per gli ospiti anche se devo dire che il personale ha risolto brillantemente il problema mettendomi a disposizione un laptop Apple e la stampante della concierge. Una nota in pi√π oltre alla gentilezza e disponibilit√†  del personale √® che molti dei ragazzi sono italiani o parlano italiano. Grazie a tutto lo staff per il meraviglioso soggiorno.",5,2014,05,13
148,ESPECTACULAR,"Fantastico hotel, la cadena Melia vuelve a abrir un hotel de la linea Me, digno de los mejores de Europa. Situado en la mejor zona de Londres en medio del distrito de los teatros a 5 minutos de Trafalgar Square y Picadilly Circus. Decoracion exclusiva y moderna, todo cuidado de manera exquisita. Las habitaciones muy amplias y perfectamente ambientadas, cama fantastica 2 x 2 mts. El min bar completisimo asi como una serie de detalles muy originales. El ba√±o muy amplio y comodo. Tienen una terraza en el atico del hotel que esta super de moda con una musica y un ambiente de lo mas In. Si estas hospedado en el hotel no tienes que hacer ninguna cola y te dejan pasar sobre la marcha, sino las colas son de aburrirte.
El personal magnifico, gente joven que casi todos hablan espa√±ol y siempre solicitos a todo lo que necesites. Este hotel en Londres tendra muchas cosas que decir. Lo recomiendo 100 % me quede encantado con todo. MAGNIFICO. Lo unico que no esta a la altura de este hotel que se merece un sobresaliente es su desayuno, que es un poco flojito.
FELICIDADES Me London , Felicidades Melia.",5,2014,05,12
148,splendido soggiorno londinese,"Abbiamo scelto questo hotel per la posizione che si √® rivelata decisamente formidabile, si pu√≤ accedere al centro e ad altri quartieri molto conosciuti a piedi. La metropolitana √® comodissima.
La stanza era confortevole e il bagno bello ma solo con la doccia e non con la vasca. La colazione al buffet era  buona con scelta tra dolce e salato. Il servizio per un hotel a 5 stelle forse non era appropriato ma in ogni caso il personale si √® dimostrato molto gentile ed educato.
Da provare!",5,2014,05,12
148,Sus mejores bazas su personal y su ubicaci√≥n,"Estaba como loca por volver, hace un a√±o me pareci√≥ incre√≠ble e insuperable, lo dif√≠cil ser√≠a mantener ese nivel, y efectivamente, no se ha mantenido.
La situaci√≥n es excelente, es por esto por lo que m√°s merece la pena alojarse en el.
Su personal est√° formado por grandes profesionales dispuestos a todo por complacer a sus clientes, todos son encantadores y amables, destaco a Gilber y Emiliano en conserjer√≠a, a la chica asturiana en los desayunos, y a Lucia y Emma en recepci√≥n, todos ellos un encanto de personas y muy buenos en su trabajo.
Despu√©s de estar todo el d√≠a fuera y llegar muy cansada y tarde al hotel, no dejaba de pensar, mientras hacia el check,  en el ba√±o que me iba a pegar en la maravillosa ba√±era que tuve el a√±o anterior, cual fue mi sorpresa y tremendo chasco cuando al subir a la habitaci√≥n vi que no hab√≠a ba√±era y solo ducha, culpa m√≠a por no fijarme en la reserva, os recomiendo una habitaci√≥n con ba√±era...qu√© gustazo ba√±era...no pude cambiar porque estaban completos.
La habitaci√≥n estupenda e impoluta, las camas una gozada, super c√≥modas, el ba√±o completo, (sin ba√±era) y la ducha el mism√≠simo infierno, tal cual suena, el agua sale ardiendo, no se puede poner fr√≠a, el termostato tiene o ardiendo o super ardiendo, aunque la pusieses al m√≠nimo te escaldabas como un huevo.
Ech√© de menos que no tenga hierbe-aguas en la habitaci√≥n para hacerte infusiones, siempre te queda la ducha o pedirla a recepci√≥n y enseguida la traen.
Lo que m√°s me ha decepcionado esta vez y lo que ha hecho que baje mi puntuaci√≥n ha sido el  desayuno.
El a√±o pasado cuando llegabas a la sala de desayunos te sentaban en una mesa y te serv√≠an un magnifico desayuno al que no le faltaba absolutamente nada, y si le faltaba lo ped√≠as y enseguida lo ten√≠as, era una gozada, y la calidad excelente.
Este a√±o, han puesto dos mesas de unos dos metros cada una con platos en una esquina de la sala para hacerlo tipo bufete, sin tener en cuenta que es un espacio rid√≠culamente peque√±o para tanta gente y donde aunque no parasen de reponer comida, enseguida los platos se vaciaban y tenias que andar levant√°ndote mil veces para coger lo que quer√≠as porque siempre faltaba algo, en la esquina de esas mesas hab√≠a una mesa con gente lo que hacia muy incomoda la situaci√≥n, ya que te sientes mal por molestar constantemente a los pobres a los que les adjudican esa mesa.
A parte me parece fatal que por ejemplo una tortilla francesa est√© incluida en el precio pero si le quieres poner tomate y jam√≥n te lo cobren, me parece un detalle horrible y cutre en un hotel de esa categor√≠a.
Lo que se echa mucho de menos es un restaurante donde no tengas que gritar o hablar a voces por culpa de la m√∫sica, el STK es imposible, la carne es una pasada pero no entiendo el concepto de restaurante/discoteca, no le veo la gracia...el italiano tambi√©n muy bueno y aunque la m√∫sica est√° m√°s bajita y es m√°s tranquila, a veces te toca vocear para poder seguir una conversaci√≥n.
Seg√∫n mi opini√≥n, creo que con la insuperable terraza tienen cubierto el cupo de lugar de ambiente para tomar copas en el hotel, es una gozada si te apetece marcha, aunque no s√© de donde sacan tanto alcohol para abastecer a tanto borracho...
Insisto en que ech√© mucho de menos un lugar tranquilo donde cenar relajadamente despu√©s de una jornada agotadora.
En definitiva me chifla este hotel y se lo recomiendo encarecidamente a todo el mundo, pero deben volver a cuidar esos detalles que le hacia ser excelente.",3,2014,05,05
148,Buen hotel con una ubicaci√≥n excelente,"La ubicaci√≥n es excelente y el servicio es muy bueno. Las habitaciones no son muy grandes, pero tampoco peque√±as, est√°n bien equipadas y las camas son muy c√≥modas.  La ducha es excelente. La decoraci√≥n es moderna, pero quiz√°s un poco fr√≠a. Las vistas de la terraza del Roof Bar son inmejorables. El desayuno buffet es correcto, pero caro y hay que tener cuidado con los extras... Nosotros escogimos una tarifa que inclu√≠a el desayuno buffet, el primer d√≠a, al poco de sentarnos se acerc√≥ una camera y nos pregunto si dese√°bamos algo, pedimos dos cortados y una tortilla, y nuestra sorpresa fue may√∫scula cuando al irnos, nos trajeron un ticket para firmarlo, ya que todo aquello que no est√° expuesto, es considerado un extra.",4,2014,05,03

      ",5,2014,05,01
148,Esperaba mas,"En general me esperaba mas de este hotel categoria especial y de estilo boutique. El servicio fue bueno, pero la comida del hotel tanto el desayuno como el room service era sin chiste y de mal sabor para el precio q era. Los cuartos se ve√≠an espectaculares, pero unos defectos hicieron mermar nuestra estancia. El tel√©fono del cuarto no funcionaba. El dise√±o del ba√±o era bonito pero resulto impracto, al solo poner un gancho para colgar una toalla, siendo q √©ramos dos personas y aparte us√°bamos bata. Todo lo ten√≠amos q amontonar. La caja fuerte tambi√©n fue un problema, por q resultaba incomoda y peligrosa para abrir, por como esta ubicada como caj√≥n en el closet. Para abrir la regadera su dise√±o ""moderno"" resulto impracto y nada gen√©rico considerando que los q nos hospedamos queremos llegar y tomar una ducha de agua caliente sin tanto fastidio en ingeniarnos como abrir esa ""modernidad"" de llave.
El olor del bar en la entrada del hotel era pesimo, muy hediondo y mareaba, aparte dolio la cabeza por q resultaba muy empalagoso. 
 El staff del concierge y del front desk muy profeionales y amables, fue lo mejor del hotel. Lo peor fueron algunas de sus instalaciones. 

Habiendo tantos otros hoteles en Londres, no vuelvo a quedarme en ese hotel.",3,2014,04,28

Einfach irre der Blick √ºber London. Preise sind echt in Ordnung f√ºr Londoner Verh√§ltnisse. Immer wieder gerne !,5,2014,04,23
148,A Pasqua...Che Sorpresa!!!,"Ciao a tutti, ho soggiornato presso il Me London dal 18/04 al 22/04 e cosa dire...Eccezionale Veramente! Arredamento completamente in stile moderno, a partire dagli ascensori allestiti con schermi che visualizzano di continuo i video musicali del momento. Le camere veramente minimal ma stilose, e che dire del bagno... figo! Pulizia ottima ! Ci√≤ che fa veramente la differenza √® il personale, cordiale e disponibile ma non invadente.Un caro saluto v√† particolarmente a Mub√† (che mi scuser√† se non ho scritto bene il suo nome ) che √® stata la prima ad accoglierci e si √® resa da subito disponibilissima;  a Emiliano che abbiamo tartassato di richieste e informazioni ; a Ludovica che ci ha fatto salire in terrazza ad un party anche se non avevamo l'abbigliamneto adatto alla situation. E per ultimo salutiamo Roberto, Francesco e Carlo. 
L'hotel √® a pochi minuti a piedi  dalle mete pi√π importanti da vedere come Buckingam Palace, Big Ben, ruota panoramica, St James Park, Trafalgar Square, National Gallery e quant'altro. Nelle immediate vicinanze ci sono pi√π  stazioni  underground per gli spostamenti pi√π lontani e per i pi√π pigri. 
Giudizio finale: eccellente!
Un caro saluto da Stefania, Fabiana, Christian e Antonio.",5,2014,04,23
148,COMO SI FUERAS DE LA FAMILIA,"Lo elegimos por ser Hotel muy,muy centrico, moderno y de la cadena Melia. La recepcion, la habitaciones, la atencion, todo de 10, Con gente como Tomas, Cosmin o Gilberto, tiene un monton de espa√±oles trabajando alli, pero da lo mismo de donde sean, Polacos, Rumanos, muchos hablan espa√±ol y si no, su ingles es perfectamente entendible y super amables. el mejor recurso que tienen es sin duda su personal, ademas la recepcion tiene un espectaculo de luz sobre las 8 de la tarde que no habia forma de poder verlo y que tuvieron la amabilidad de mostrarnolo solo para nosotros que quita el hipo, no se puede describir con palabras. Este hotel esta cerca de todo, las habitaciones espaciosas y supercomodas. En la entrada tienen un restaurante y en la terraza un local de copas con unas vistas impresionantes de Londres por la noche. y el personal del restaurante italiano donde se desayuna son igualmente amables.
No hemos podido sacarle ninguna pega al hotel y menos al personal.

Si vas de viaje de pareja y tu bolsillo te lo permite lo recomiendo por enciama de otros hoteles que tendran mas nombre pero no se yo si ..... 

En fin solo puedo dar las gracias a ese personal que tuvo hasta el detalle de darle a mi mujer una mantita de ganchillo porque tenia frio mientras tomabamos una copa, te hacen sentir como en casa.

Estas a tiro de piedra de ""TODO"", Cover garden ,Sojo, London Eye, Wendmister, Trafalgar , Big Ben, 

se pude decir que es ¬°UN GRAN HOTEL¬°",5,2014,04,22
148,Un cinque stelle alternativo,"L'hotel esprime un concetto di comfort e lusso molto particolare e molto diverso dai ""classici"" cinque stelle: il design della struttura e dell'arredamento, sia delle parti comuni che delle stanze, sono di altissimo livello, i servizi sono molto curati ed efficienti, eppure l'approccio del cortesissimo personale ( et√† media sotto i trenta ) √® piacevolmente informale. 
Posizione perfetta: cinque minuti a piedi da Covent Garden, un quarto d'ora scarso per Trafalgar Square, come per il London Eye; venti minuti per Soho; zona strapiena di teatri, locali, pubs, ristoranti e cocktail bar di ogni tipo.
Reception di grande impatto.
Stanza ben insonorizzata ( terzo piano ), con servizio di pulizia bigiornaliero, ma la regolazione della climatizzazione √® pressoch√© ininfluente sulla temperatura.
Colazione a buffet completa e di ottima qualit√†.
Ottimi cocktails sia al bar panoramico dell'attico ( frequentato, a dire il vero, da clientela abbondantemente sopra le righe ) che nell'elegantissimo bar del piano terra. 
Abbiamo trovato una matrimoniale a prezzo quasi dimezzato: la tariffa piena la ritengo eccessiva, anche per Londra...",4,2014,04,22
148,Chaos,"Es sollte ein besonderes Geburtstagsgeschenk f√ºr meine Frau werden. Ihr ‚Äúrunder Geburtstag‚Äú sollte in einem entsprechenden Hotel stattfinden. Daf√ºr hatten wir uns das sehr zentral gelegene ME ausgesucht. √úber die architektonische Au√üen-innengestaltung wurde schon mehrfach und ausf√ºhrlich geschrieben. Was sehr unangenehm auffiel,waren die extrem dunklen Hotelg√§nge.
Das Check inn eine Zumutung. In einem n i c h t klimatisiertem Raum durften wir 35 Minuten auf die Zimmerzuweisung warten. Total durchgeschwitzt erfuhren wir dann,dass unser Raum noch fertig war. Wir w√ºrden √ºber unser Handy informiert werden,wann das Zimmer bezugsfertig sei. Leider haben wir nie einen Anruf erhalten. Das von zu Hause bestellte und best√§tigte Arrangement f√ºr den Geburtstag meiner Frau wurde total vergessen. Die kostenlose Ersatzlieferung war nicht das Ziel unserer W√ºnsche. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war jeden Tag ein besonderes Erlebnis der besonderen Art. Das offenbar billig importierte Servicepersonal hatte sehr schlechte Englischkenntnisse. Die Merkf√§higkeit war auch nicht besonders stark ausgepr√§gt. √ñfter wurden georderte Speisen an andere Tische geliefert. Wof√ºr 5 Sterne?????",1,2014,04,14
148,TE CUIDAN,"El hotel tiene un objetivo claro: ""La excelencia"" y mi familia y yo podemos asegurar, sin equivocarnos, que si no lo consiguen estan muy muy cerca. Aparte de la magnifica ubicacion, lo que realmente hace que un lugar tenga ""algo"" es el entorno en el que te desenvuelves y el ME LONDON lo tiene; habitaciones, ba√±os ,restaurantes, recepcion, conserjeria... pero sobretodo personas. Estan ahi para ayudarte en todo lo que necesites. Mencion especial para Ronald, Emiliano y Alicia.ANECDOTA: se nos olvid√≥ la camara de fotos en la habitaci√≥n, llamamos por telefono, y al dia siguiente por DHL la camara estaba en nuestro poder. Todo un detalle de eficacia.
Volveremos.

148,Mejor que en casa,"Es un hotel incre√≠ble en todos los sentidos. Su √∫nica pega: CREA ADICCI√ìN. 

UBICACI√ìN: inmejorable. Se puede ir andando a casi todas partes: A dos minutos de Covent Garden, a cinco del London Eye a diez de Trafalgar Square y de la National Gallery. Estuvimos cuatro d√≠as y apenas cogimos transporte p√∫blico. Tambi√©n est√° cerqu√≠sima de los teatros y los musicales. Durante nuestra estancia pon√≠an Mamma M√≠a justo enfrente del hotel y El Rey Le√≥n a 150 metros. 

HABITACIONES: Comod√≠simas y muy silenciosas, con camas enormes y confortables. Puedes transformar el ambiente a tu medida gracias a un panel de control desde el que puedes personalizar la luz, la m√∫sica y la temperatura. En el ba√±o, todo tipo de amenities, secador y hasta plancha para el pelo. Si echas de menos cualquier cosa, p√≠dela‚Ä¶

M√ÅS ARUMENTOS: El desayuno y los restaurantes del hotel son fant√°sticos. El asador STK, con carnes y ensaladas riqu√≠simas y una carta de vinos corta pero muy interesante. D√©jate aconsejar!!! Reserva hueco para una copa y sube a la √∫ltima planta del hotel. En el Radio bar, podr√°s disfrutar unas vistas fabulosas rodeado de la gente m√°s guapa de la ciudad. 

CONSEJO: Si llegas a Londres por Gatwick toma el tren r√°pido hasta Blackfriars, es m√°s barato que el de Victoria y ,adem√°s, te deja a un paseo del hotel. Deja las maletas y sal a caminar: cruza el puente de Waterloo y, nada m√°s pasar, a tu derecha, ver√°s el London Eye. Pasea por las orillas del T√°mesis y vuelve a cruzarlo hacia Wetsminister. Una primera toma de contacto con la ciudad, espectacular. 

RESUMEN: Un hotel fant√°stico con un personal que se desvive por hacer de nuestra estancia una experiencia inolvidable. El equipo ‚ÄúAura‚Äù, con Nicol√°s Matilla al frente se encarga de convertir todo el confort del hotel en sensaciones: flores frescas en las habitaciones, velas encendidas cuando llegas por la noche. S√≥lo les falta esperar escondidos en un rinc√≥n a que nos quedemos dormidos y arroparnos si hace fr√≠o. Claro‚Ä¶ que igual lo hacen sin que nos demos cuenta‚Ä¶ ;-)",5,2014,03,29
148,Excelente ubicacion y hotel,"Muy moderno, excelente ubicaci√≥n para ir andando a multitud de sitios, en el centro! El restaurante del √°tico es flipante, especialmente por la noche. Con buena oferta, volveria sin dudarlo. Muy recomendable!!",5,2014,03,26
148,"Si quieres ser bien atendido, √©ste es tu hotel","Nos alojamos con mi esposa en ME London en la primera semana de Marzo. Este hotel de calidad superlativa tiene su punto m√°s alto en la esmerada atenci√≥n de todo su personal, solo por nombrar algunos me detengo en la recepci√≥n y en el profesionalismo de las se√±oritas que all√≠ atienden, Marta, Alicia y Lucia. Los maleteros Ignacio y Nestor, siempre dispuestos a dar respuesta a las inquietudes y resolviendo satisfactoriamente todas las preguntas sobre ubicaci√≥n de sitios en la ciudad. En cuanto a las instalaciones son de gran calidad, sus habitaciones son muy c√≥modas y completas y su estrat√©gica ubicaci√≥n lo hacen m√°s valorado a√∫n. El desayuno es de gran calidad y magnifica atenci√≥n de sus camareros. 
Londres es una ciudad maravillosa y aloj√°ndonos en ME London, nos dieron ganas de volver pronto.",5,2014,03,24
148,Ottimo soggiorno: chic ed accogliente,"Ci sono stato con mamma e due figli (16 e 17 anni) dal 2 al 9 marzo scorso.
Mi sono trovato molto bene. Concierge molto gentile ed efficente, soprattutto i due ragazzi italiani (Emiliano e l'altro ragazzo romano). Stanze  pulitissime e nuove, forse un p√≤ troppo minimaliste (p.e. armadio insufficente per un qualsiasi soggiorno superiore ai due gg). Ottima dotazione in bagno. Bellissimo il bar all'ultimo piano. Prima colazione molto buona: purtroppo pur con english brackfast alcune cose erano con sovraprezzo (p.e. la cioccolata); poi parlando con la caposala abbiamo sostanzialmente risolto il problema. In un cinque stelle per√≤ direi che non si fa.
Per il resto lo consiglierei a tutti i miei amici.",4,2014,03,20
148,5 giorni indimenticabili,"In posizione centralissima, comodo a piedi per gran parte delle mete pi√π importanti, Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, Westminster, Tate Modern, St. Paul Cathedral e molto altro, √® inoltre situato nella vivacissima zona dei teatri. Stanze silenziosissime e molto pulite, roof bar con terrazza e vista mozzafiato, due ristoranti ottimi, √® decisamente uno degli alberghi pi√π cool del momento. Nel weekend √® molto probabile incrociare cantanti o personaggi dello spettacolo. Ma se non siete interessati alla vita notturna, nessun problema, niente turber√† il vostro soggiorno, noi ci siamo stati coi bambini e siamo stati benissimo. Colazione eccellente soprattutto per la qualit√† dei prodotti. L' accoglienza del personale √® decisamente notevolissima, sempre deliziosi e disponibili per qualsiasi cosa, la maggior parte di loro parla italiano, se ce ne fosse bisogno. Ricordiamo in particolare Roberto, Emiliano e Guilberto!! Complimenti ragazzi! Che dire ancora?.. Siamo stati veramente coccolati. Approfittate dei teatri, offrono spettacoli indimenticabili. Ultima cosa‚Ä¶ se non avete bambini con voi, non dimenticate un tacco 12!!!! Alessandra - Venezia",5,2014,03,18
148,Kann nur Gutes berichten,"Ein architektonisch sch√∂nes Hotel, mindestens sobald man drin ist. Jede Ecke im Hause h√§lt eine positive √úberraschung bereit. Das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend und bei jeder kurzen Wartezeit, Gep√§ckabnahme und Rezeption, wird ein Prosecco serviert. Die Zimmer sind grossz√ºgig und die Badekomposition nachahmenswert. Absolute Wohltat war die Nespressomaschine im Zimmer und der Balkon im zweitletztem Stock, hier war leider die ‚ÄûBumm bumm‚Äú Ger√§uschkulisse der Diskothek im letzten Stock bis in die fr√ºhen Morgenstunden zu h√∂ren.",5,2014,03,17

148,Magn√≠fico hotel!,"Hemos pasado un fin de semana largo en este hotel y la experiencia ha sido fant√°stica. Situado en plena zona centro hemos ido caminando a todos los sitios: british museum, national gallery, london eye,  big ben, coven garden, picadilly... La zona es zona de teatros y restaurantes, y tambi√©n de tiendas caras. El hotel en s√≠ es una pasada, bonito, elegante, limpio, eficiente... y la atenci√≥n ha sido muy muy buena, adem√°s muchos de los trabajadores son espa√±oles y el idioma no supone un problema pues hemos visto camareros atendiendo en varios idiomas.
En definitva, si volvemos a Londres no cambiamos de hotel.",5,2014,03,02
148,Excelente ubicaci√≥n y servicio,"Busc√°bamos un hotel c√©ntrico y cien comunicado de calidad asegurada y lo encontramos !!!!

El precio var√≥n pero
merece la pena. La cercan√≠a a Covent Garden me pareci√≥ estupenda y la disfrute mucho",5,2014,02,13
148,PERFECTO,"Espectacular Hotel. Inexplicable, no se trata del dise√±o de las habitaciones, de sus juegos de colores, de su amplitud, de sus vistas, de su impresionante cama, ni de lo espectacular que es su recepci√≥n, diferente a cualquiera que hayas visto hasta ahora, de la originalidad de su arquitectura, de su innovador concepto de hoteler√≠a, de su ALUCINANTE terraza -pub/discoteca- con el que creo que es el mejor ambiente de toda la ciudad, ni de como te miran, como te hablan y como te atiende su staff, de una manera -por fin- cercana, respetuosa y sabiendo qu√© es lo que necesitas en cada momento antes de hablar con ellos. Tampoco se trata de los detalles, de la tecnolog√≠a, de la m√∫sica en la habitaci√≥n, del recibimiento a la llegada, de la inmejorable ubicaci√≥n, del cuidado con el que atienden en los restaurantes..... Se trata de SENSACIONES, de algo que no se puede explicar, del ambiente de FELICIDAD que te trasmite tanto el personal como el resto de clientes, de la energ√≠a positiva que te contagia el simple hecho de ver al resto de clientes disfrutando, d√°ndose cuenta de que esos d√≠as de estancia con vosotros su vida esta siendo tal y como la so√±aron alg√∫n d√≠a. Es algo mas, algo diferente. Es un estado de √°nimo. Y yo quiero volver a sentirlo de nuevo lo antes posible. Gracias por todo.",5,2014,02,11

Il bar sulla terrazza all'ultimo piano ha una vista mozzafiato!

Non prendete il club sandwich... Immangiabile!

Discreta la colazione; non siamo riusciti a provare il ristorante di carne ma sembra interessante.

Nel complesso esperienza molto positiva!",4,2014,02,07
148,Dif√≠cil de mejorar,"Sorprende extraordinariamente todo desde que llegas. Arquitectura y dise√±o espectacular. Trato excelente y profesional. Hasta el olor ambiental tiene su personalidad.
Habitaciones preciosas, con un dise√±o moderno y exquisito, e infinidad de detalles que se agradecen, como sus comod√≠simas camas y almohadas, sus toallas, flores, velas encendidas,  controles de √∫ltima tecnolog√≠a...
La idea de la recepci√≥n es √∫nica por su originalidad. No te puedes perder el restaurante STK. ¬°¬°Qu√© ambientazo todos los d√≠as!! Recomiendo los ceviches y la carne ¬°¬°Increibles!!. Y terminas la noche con unos c√≥cteles en el RADIO BAR, otro ambientazo en el √°tico del Hotel con una terraza y unas vistas excepcionales.
 A esto hay que a√±adir su situaci√≥n, cerqu√≠sima de Covent Garden, de Picadilly, de la zona de los teatros ... 
De verdad ... Dif√≠cil de mejorar",5,2014,02,03
148,SIN PALABRAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ya promet√≠ que volver√≠a y lo vuelvo a prometer. Sin duda el hotel mejor situado de la ciudad, pegado a Coven Garden y a 5 minutos caminando de Trafalgar Square, Picadilly ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Mi primera visita a este hotel fue reci√©n abierto y ya fue espectacular pero ahora que est√° rodado es absolutamente INCREIBLE en todos los sentidos, el trato del personal, los detalles, el ambiente. No tengo palabras para describirlo lo √∫nico que puedo decir es que quien est√© pensando en viajar a Londres no puede dejar pasar la oportunidad de disfrutar de este hotelazo.
Ahhhhhhh se me olvidaba lo que hace que la experiencia ya sea irrepetible, parte del espect√°culo en el ME London es su restaurante STK y el bar de copas Radio en su azotea.",5,2014,02,03
148,"Me London, el mejor hotel de Londres","Es la segunda vez que voy al Me London y sin duda alguna, la pr√≥xima vez volver√° a ser mi mejor elecci√≥n.
Estuve el fin de semana pasado con mi marido y ¬°¬°¬°no pudimos disfrutar m√°s!!! . Es un hotel incre√≠ble en todos los sentidos: La ubicaci√≥n es inmejorable( cerca de Coven Garden y de la zona de teatros), las habitaciones con camas muy c√≥modas y con lo √∫ltimo en tecnolog√≠a ( desde un cuadro de mandos donde pod√≠as personalizar el ambiente de tu habitaci√≥n con m√∫sica, luces...etc, hasta plancha para el pelo). El personal del hotel ¬°¬°¬°impecable!!!. Pendientes en todo momento en que nuestra estancia fuera perfecta.
Todo esto, unido a su dise√±o exquisito, su profesionalidad en cuidar hasta el √∫ltimo detalle ( flores frescas por todo el hotel y en las habitaciones, aroma que  te envuelve nada m√°s llegar, velas encendidas en tu habitaci√≥n cuando llegas por la noche....) y su riqu√≠simo desayuno, hacen que recomiende el Me London y espero que ayude a otras personas a decidirse por este hotel y tener una experiencia √∫nica.
Otro plus es, dentro del hotel, cenar en STK , incre√≠ble la comida y el ambiente y luego subir a la √∫ltima planta,  Radio bar, donde tienen las mejores vistas de todo Londres y tomarse una copa. ¬°¬°¬°Mejor viaje imposible!!!",5,2014,01,30
148,I LOVE ME!!!!,"Todo espectacular. El hotel es precioso, moderno, funcional...y muy acogedor. Tiene una situaci√≥n excelente. El dise√±o de N Foster se nota en cada detalle.

El ba√±o tiene de todo (hab√≠a hasta plancha de pelo!). El desayuno exquisito. La cena en el STK es un espect√°culo: la carne es incre√≠ble, los c√≥cteles deliciosos y DJ crea un ambiente sensacional.

El equipo del ME se portaron de maravilla, y nos hicieron pasar un fin de semana muy especial. Muchas gracias.",5,2014,01,19
148,IMPRESIONANTE!!!,"Estuvimos el fin de semana pasado en Londres en este hotel que ya desde su fachada impresiona, cuando entras en √©l, su aroma penetrante a fresco que dura todo el d√≠a se mezcla con el moderno e innovador interior, la recepci√≥n es la m√°s original y alucinante que hemos visto nunca.... Las habitaciones muy confortables, dignas de un hotel de esta categor√≠a y son tal cual a las fotos de la web.
Ante todo dar las gracias al impresionante equipo de profesionales que trabaja en el, que nos hizo la estancia m√°s c√≥moda, f√°cil y agradable en especial al coserje Emiliano del Pizzo y Luc√≠a (recepci√≥n) que nos aguantaron en todo momento solucinando todas nuestras dudas con gran profesionalidad al igual que todos sus compa√±eros, especialmente los que hablaban en castellano, haciendo que te sintieras como en casa.

I camerieri gentili ed efficienti, i drink forse un po cari ma considerando il luogo √® normale (15 pound), ambiente molto riscaldato, atmosfera soft, persone selezionate (fascia d'et√† dai 30 ai 40 per lo pi√π). Ma la vera sorpresa √® la terrazza: grande e con meravigliosa vista su tutta Londra! Una meraviglia! Vale la pena andare solo x quello. Inoltre √® riscaldati sisma con stufe da esterno.

148,La modernidad de una gran marca y de un gran hotel.,"La marca ‚ÄúME‚Äù de Meli√° es una apuesta decidida y arriesgada de esta hist√≥rica cadena por la modernidad y el servicio.
En este caso realmente supera las expectativas, y es que desde que entras en el hotel notas que la experiencia puede ser buena, el caso es que va superando lo previsto y las sensaciones son exponencialmente positivas. 
Tengamos en cuenta que es un hotel abierto en el 2013 con algunas cosas a√∫n por pulir y mejorar.
Sigamos el recorrido:‚Ä®‚Ä®

RECEPCI√ìN, PRIMERAS IMPRESIONES: 
El hotel tiene 157 habitaciones por ello esperas amplitud y cierta impersonalidad. Al contrario lo primero que llama la atenci√≥n es la calidez de la acogida por parte de todo el personal (Ignacio en la misma puerta, y la excelente conserjer√≠a con Gilberto Alvarez y Emiliano del Pizzo para que no te falte de nada en reservas, excursiones etc.). Por cierto se agradece la facilidad de hablar en espa√±ol por parte de todo el personal. Es un valor a√±adido para nosotros.
El olor (realmente llamativo por su elegancia) y la sensaci√≥n de que est√°s en un hotel moderno pero con encanto. 
A ello contribuye la propia arquitectura, de este edificio que fue teatro, banco y donde Marconi (8¬™ planta) invent√≥ la radio. Totalmente reconstru√≠do por el estudio de Norman Foster que se ha encargado de todos los detalles, inclu√≠do el interiorismo de las habitaciones.
Es imposible no valorar la recepci√≥n, situada en la primera planta con una decoraci√≥n moderna y  una impresionante c√∫pula di√°fana al z√©nit . Pero todo esto no ser√≠a m√°s que una an√©cdota sin su personal c√°lido (estamos en un lugar de puro dise√±o lo habitual ser√≠a frialdad) y diligente. Aqu√≠ no puedo olvidarme de Luc√≠a Herrera espa√±ola, malague√±a y con un saber hacer pese a su juventud que mezclado con la gracia habitual es pura dinamita. Gracias por tus cont√≠nuos esfuerzos por satisfacer al cliente. En general la recepci√≥n es personal y diligente a la vez, continuamente pendientes de todos los detallles para hacer tu entrada f√°cil y cercana, huyendo de la ""tirantez"" de algunos hoteles 5 GL esta diferencia es la base de la buena hosteler√≠a.‚Ä®‚Ä®

HABITACIONES: 
Decoraci√≥n moderna, minimalista pero con calidez. Destacar las suites, realmente espectaculares.‚Ä®La habitaci√≥n est√°ndar tambi√©n tiene un gran nivel. Con una dotaci√≥n audiovisual en todas ellas muy buena pero que necesita cierta explicaci√≥n por su complejidad.
RESTAURACI√ìN:
Desayuno excelente, no falta de nada.
Restaurantes: prob√© la ‚ÄúCucina Asellina‚Äù italiana de muy buen nivel en ambiente moderno. No fuimos al STK (carnes) no dudo de su modernidad en la m√°s pura influencia neoyorkina pero el volumen de la m√∫sica para mi gusto excesivo.
Bares: ‚ÄúMarconi‚Äù en el hall del hotel agradable, y el ‚ÄúRadio Rooftop‚Äù, en la 8¬™ planta donde puedes tomar tapas, copas y ver casi todo Londres.
UBICACI√ìN:
Perfecta, en The Strand el coraz√≥n art√≠stico y cultural de Londres y a dos minutos escasos de Covent Garden distrito espectacular por restaurantes, teatros, bares, market y ambiente chic en general.
MAS COSAS: Aura es una ‚Äúfigura‚Äù de la marca ME que viene a ser la de Royal Service en Paradisus o Red Level en Gran Meli√°. Hacen que a tu estancia no le falte el m√°s m√≠nimo detalle. Aqu√≠ es donde Nico Matilla (manager de Aura) y Marta Tocabens (Aura Host) se desviven junto con su equipo porque la estancia resulte casi inolvidable. Con m√°s presencia y recorrido en un futuro cercano seguro que consiguen igualar o mejorar a Royal Service y Red Level.
RESUMEN: un gran hotel de reciente apertura con recorrido espectacular a pesar de su juventud. Con un personal eficaz, cercano a pesar de la modernidad y ante todo profesional y un grupo de trabajo desde Conserjer√≠a (Gilberto, Emiliano), Recepci√≥n (Luc√≠a Herrera) hasta Aura (Marta, Nico) EXCELENTES. ABSOLUTAMENTE RECOMENDABLE, HOSTELER√çA  MODERNA AL M√ÅS ALTO NIVEL CON UN PERSONAL EXCELENTE.",5,2013,12,15
148,IMPRESIONANTE,"Estuve con mi marido a finales de noviembre y he de decir que el hotel super√≥ con creces nuestras expectativas!! La est√©tica del hotel, su inmejorable ubicaci√≥n, sus habitaciones con todo lo que se puede necesitar....aderezado con un servicio impecable y atento, la verdad que as√≠ da gusto!! Menci√≥n especial al desayuno....todos los d√≠as tomaba un plato de fruta (fresas, moras, kiwi, pi√±a, mel√≥n...) que estaba en su punto, cosa rara, sobre todo porque estuvimos 6 d√≠as y los 6 estaba buen√≠sima!!!

148,Molto confortevole ma prezzi un poco eccessivi,"Posizione strategica per Londra: sullo Strand e vicino alla zona dei teatri. Albergo modernissimo (forse troppo) con camere molto spaziose e luminose. Servizio accurato. Prezzi decisamente cari, anche per Londra.",4,2013,12,01
148,Meraviglioso...,"Sono stata al Me London per un breve soggiorno con il mio ragazzo. La struttura nuovissima e molto moderna potrebbe apparire ad un primo impatto un po' fredda, ma la gentilezza e professionalit√† del personale fanno presto dimenticare questa prima impressione. 
Durante il check-in ci √® stato dato il benvenuto con un bicchiere di prosecco che abbiamo finito di sorseggiare in camera.
La camera davvero molto bella, rilassante e pulitissima con la 
possibilit√† di creare giochi di luce  e di gestire la musica direttamente da un piccolo monitor vicino al letto consente di creare l'atmosfera che di preferisce.
Posizione molto comoda ad un passo da covent garden.
Abbiamo cenato nel ristorante italiano dell'hotel, Cucina Asellina, da segnalare gli ottimi antipasti!
Bellissima esperienza, se si passa da Londra e si cerca un hotel cool ma elegante consiglio assolutamente di soggiornare qui.
Concludo ringraziando il doorman Jamie che ci ha accolto con un caloroso benvenuto!

Stanze spaziose per gli standard londinesi, letto supercomfort, ottimo bar/ristorante anche colazione, servizi curati, buonissima qualit√† prezzo considerando il livello dell'hotel.

Stra consigliato.",5,2013,11,14
148,Una gran estancia,"Estuve durante el puente del primero de noviembre con mi marido y mis suegros y la verdad es que el personal del hotel en todo momento fue muy atento con nosotros.

A pesar de que llegamos muy temprano el primer d√≠a (antes de las 10 de la ma√±ana), pudimos entrar ya a la habitaci√≥n y tuvieron la amabilidad de hacernos un upgrade. Las habitaciones eran muy amplias y c√≥modas y contaban con amenities de toda clase de gran calidad. Por poner una pega a las habitaciones, es muy raro que los secadores de pelo disponibles no se pueden enchufar en el ba√±o (el secador es un enchufe de tipo G y las tomas de la pared no) de forma que al final me ten√≠a que secar el pelo en la cama.

El hotel est√° en pleno Covent Garden con lo que resulta muy f√°cil desplazarse a cualquier sitio: est√° en pleno centro de forma que es posible ir andando a los puntos m√°s importantes y, en caso de necesitar tomar un taxi, siempre hay alguno en la puerta.

El desayuno del hotel tambi√©n fue fant√°stico con toda clase de frutas, bollos, quesos, etc. Por poner una pega al desayuno, no entiendo muy bien por qu√© el agua con gas no est√° incluida en el desayuno... 

Cenamos en los dos restaurantes del hotel: Cucina Asellina y STK. En Cucina Asellina comimos muy bien y hab√≠a un ambiente muy agradable, mientras que en STK de√©moslo simplemente en que comimos muy bien. La verdad es que el ambiente en STK es bastante peculiar: la m√∫sica est√° alt√≠sima y la gente grita, come y baila a la vez que come o toma copas. Entiendo que esa es la base de STK (m√∫sica, comida y copas) pero la verdad es que el aspecto y comportamiento de la mayor√≠a de las personas que estaban all√≠, era muy muy vulgar... 

Tambi√©n subimos en un par de ocasiones al Radio Rooftop Bar, por la noche a tomar unas copas y al mediod√≠a a comer algo. Recomiendo a todo el mundo subir porque las vistas son fant√°sticas, aunque el ambiente en s√°bado por la noche, en mi opini√≥n, tampoco es demasiado agradable: mucho postureo y mucha Essex girl (una incluso se dedicaba a desabrocharse la camiseta para ense√±ar los pechos a todo el mundo...)",5,2013,11,06
148,Un hotel al que volver,"Mi tercera vez en Londres y esta vez s√≠ que elegimos bien. Todo un acierto.
El hotel est√° genialmente ubicado; a un par de minutos a pie de Covent Garden, en frente de numerosos teatros y restaurantes, y a un peque√±o paseo de Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus o incluso el famoso London Eye.
Habitaciones c√≥modas, perfectamente equipadas y con todo lujo de detalles: amenities de ingredientes naturales, cafetera nespresso, minibar muy completo,...Digno de menci√≥n el detalle de ""servicio de puesta de sol"" para cuando llegas a la habitaci√≥n por la tarde; m√∫sica y luz c√°lida, cama abierta, un par de botellas de agua y bomb√≥n.
A destacar el dise√±o del hotel y sobre todo la atenci√≥n y hospitalidad del personal. En todo momento estuvieron pendientes del m√°s m√≠nimo detalle, eso s√≠, sin la rigidez en el trato que a veces encontramos en hoteles de esta categor√≠a y que resulta en ocasiones algo inc√≥moda.",5,2013,11,05
148,Wonderful experience!,"Magn√≠fico hotel. Buen dise√±o, confortable, servicio excelente, desde los conserjes a los camareros en el desayuno. Estuvimos 7 d√≠as y fue fant√°stico. Perfecta ubicaci√≥n, cerca de todo, y gran comodidad. Una pega: pongan un enchufe en el cuarto de ba√±o.
Muy recomendable y buenos recuerdos de Lucca (Jefe de sala), Guacimara (camarera) y James (conserje).",5,2013,10,30

148,Me London: notevole,"Sono andata recentemente al Me London invitata da amici inglesi. Volevano farmi una sorpresa in questo nuovo posto, molto trendy: avevo letto qualcosa qui e l√†. 
Debbo dire che non avevo particolari aspettative.
L'hotel ha una sua anima, un suo carattere. Grande cordialit√† all'ingresso da parte del giovane body guard. Mi ha colpito moltissimo l'area reception dove √® stato necessario risolvere un problema tecnico: inaspettata, cosi diversa, davvero siderale!
Al bar, Radio bar se non ricordo male, dove eravamo diretti, siamo stati accolti da ragazzi e ragazze giovani, gentili, sorridenti e molto professionali: un bel bagno di sana giovent√π.
Vista davvero superlativa sulla citt√†, ottimo servizio. Personalmente, per problemi miei, sono stata un po scortese con Ludovica, a cui ho poi chiesto scusa,  che avrebbe avuto tutto il diritto di mandarmi al diavolo ma che con grande classe mi ha sorriso e mi ha compreso. Difetti? Li scoprir√≤ visto che a fine mese il mio capo, che √® molto esigente, mi far√† pelo e contropelo.",5,2013,10,22
148,Simplemente Incre√≠ble,"La verdad que el hotel est√° completamente nuevo. El dise√±o es incre√≠ble y las habitaciones est√°n a la √∫ltima en tecnolog√≠a. Tienen un Media Hub donde puedes conectar los aparatos para reproducir el sonido en la TV.

El ba√±o, incre√≠ble con doble ducha .... En fin, este hotel es una autentica pasada... Al lado de Covent Garden, te permite ir a un mont√≥n de restaurantes de la zona.

En la parte del √°tico del hotel est√° el Radio, un sitio de copas con camas tipo Chill-out donde os pod√©is tomar una copa y algo de comida, con unas vistas muy buenas. Los s√°bados se llena de gente por la noche, ya que es un sitio de copas de moda... Muy chic...... 

En la parte baja del hotel esta Steakhouse, donde la carne es muy buena (un poco caro, pero que no es caro en Londr√©s???). Tambi√©n hay un Italiano, pero no tuve tiempo de probarlo...

En definitiva, si vuelvo a Londr√©s, volver√© all√≠ sin duda alguna.",5,2013,10,15
148,"Design, posizione, comfort..ottimo!","Abbiamo avuto il piacere di soggiornare al ME London due notti. L'hotel si trova in una posizione invidiabile, sullo Strand ossia nella zona dei teatri, e vicinissimo a Covent Garden. Sul design e l'architettura dell'hotel non si pu√≤ dire niente, essendo stato ridisegnato dallo studio di Norman Foster; la Reception √® unica, uno spazio piramidale dalla cima del quale filtra la luce che proviene dal Radio rooftop Bar al'ultimo piano. Si viene accolti nella Lobby al piano terra, per essere poi portati al primo piano nella quale si trova la Reception per le operazioni di check-in;la reception al primo piano crea un p√≤ di confusione, ma √® per separare la parte ""aperta"", e dal quale si pu√≤ accedere al rooftop e ai due ristoranti (STK e Cucina Asellina), da quella riservata all'albergo. Qui nell'attesa di avere la camera vi viene offerto dell'ottimo prosecco o drink; un punto dolente per quanto ci riguarda √® stata l'attesa della camera, che dalle 15 ora in cui sarebbe in teoria disponibile, ci √® stata consegnata un'ora e mezza dopo. Peccato per il tempo perso, ma abbiamo potuto riposarci con un altro drink; inoltre ci √® stato offerto un upgrade nella camera ""Mode"", 30 e pi√π metri quadrati al quarto piano, una finestra dal pavimento al soffitto, un letto grande e il pi√π comodo che abbia provato, e un grande bagno rifornito di prodotti naturali (Apivita) fantastici. Da un pannello era possibile regolare temperatura e luce, con la possibilit√† di creare effetti luminosi soffusi e di differenti  colori. Dalla grande tv a schermo piatto era possibile controllare il proprio conto, leggere le notizie, vedere moltissimi canali anche italiani, nonch√® ascoltare la selezione di musica per diverso genere. Il minibar era rifornitissimo di prodotti (una parte anche in vista, magari si potrebbe nascondere o chiudere). La colazione della domenica si ordina dal men√π, in quanto √® aperto anche a gente esterna all'albergo; il luned√¨ invece era a buffet, nella sala del ristorante Cucina Asellina. Il personale era principalmente italiano e spagnolo; tutti disponibili e amichevoli, come il concierge Nicola ed Emiliano. Consigliatissimo un salto all'ultimo piano, al Radio Rooftop Bar, dal quale si gode una bellissima vista su Londra, frequentatissimo il sabato sera. Un punto dolente √® stato il wi-fi che non andava, un problema che credo abbiano risolto ma che ci ha creato qualche disagio. Un hotel bellissimo, moderno (aperto solo da marzo 2013), un cinque stelle e si vede, dal design unico, che forse pu√≤ un po' intimidire al primo impatto, ma che poi vi accoglier√†. Ottimo per accoglienza, posizione e design",5,2013,10,03

148,poca coordinaci√≥n del personal,"muy bien situado,original en su dise√±o,aunque despu√©s de tres d√≠as de tanta oscuridad cansa, demasiado ruido, mal insonorizadas las habitaciones, el personal muy amable pero muy mal coordinado sobre todo en el desayuno, acabamos desayunando fuera y eso que lo ten√≠amos pagado. las habitaciones muy peque√±as, armario ancho unos escasos 70cm. Baldosa ba√±o,ducha rotas. Dan m√°s prioridad a la terraza que funciona a modo de disco todas las noches que a los que estamos all√≠ alojados. No me alojar√≠a de nuevo, necesito mas tranquilidad y orden.Imposible tomar algo relajado en su sal√≥n por que siempre hay alg√∫n evento.La comida del restaurante italiano muy buena y gracias a una camarera llamada Claudia nos atendieron muy bien ,que pena, el desayuno,estresante y eso que hab√≠a much√≠simo personal pero fatal coordinado. He de decir que nos dejaron una botella de champan en la habitaci√≥n por las molestias del desayuno y una nota de disculpas, pero llegamos de visitar londres bastante tarde y estaba caliente, as√≠ que all√≠ se quedo, Al d√≠a siguiente pasamos de desayunar all√≠ no quer√≠amos empezar mal el d√≠a",3,2013,09,28
148,PRATICAMENTE PERFETTO !!!,"Cosa fa la differenza in un hotel? IL PERSONALE!
Siamo andati a Londra per festeggiare una ricorrenza e tutto il personale dell'hotel ha reso ancora pi√π particolare ed intenso il nostro soggiorno. Siamo arrivati e ci hanno fatto trovare una bottiglia di vino con le fragole e cioccolato,senza chiedere e senza pagare prezzi aggiuntivi ci hanno assegnato una stanza di livello superiore con la terrazza all'ottavo piano la n. 801.....insomma ci hanno coccolato in tutto e per tutto.
Sono quelle piccole cose che non ti aspetti e che fanno la differenza.
Le camere sono bellissime , la doccia √® immensa per due ed √® ultra confortevole......quando siamo tornati a casa ci mancava il gioco di colori che puoi creare in camera e rilassarti con  la tua musica preferita.
Il personale √® tutto giovane e per chi, come noi, non parlava benissimo l'inglese c'era sempre qualcuno che parlava italiano e che ti spiega tutto.
Un ringraziamento speciale a Simona del Radio (la vista √® meravigliosa ) che √® riuscita , in una serata molto movimentata, a soddisfare una nostra richiesta quasi impossibile.
Grazie anche a Nicola che con la sua gentilezza ci ha dato ottimi consigli.
Insomma √® inutile dire che l'hotel √® bellissimo, moderno,in ottima posizione a solo 1 minuto da Covent Garden perch√© lo scrivono tutti....io vi consiglio di ""godervi"" l'hotel ,di solito almeno noi preferiamo sempre cenare o uscire dall'hotel per vivere la citt√†, ma in questo caso non vedevamo l'ora di rientrare...vi consiglio la  STK dove abbiamo mangiato benissimo ed una sera dedicatela al Radio per godervi la vista mozzafiato mangiando Tapas.....insomma noi sicuramente ci ritorneremo.
Volete che trovo un difetto? Quando qualcuno delle camere vicine chiudeva la porta la nostra creava come un rumore che sembrava che qualcuno volesse entrare .....ma per il resto √® un hotel impeccabile! Grazie ancora a tutto il personale per aver reso indimenticabile il nostro soggiorno.",5,2013,09,27

148,Un hotel da sogno in una zona molto centrale di Londra,"Ottima posizione nel centro di Londra letteralmente a pochi passi da covent garden. Palazzo ultra moderno e interni dalle linee essenziali e minimaliste giocate sulla bicromia nero delle parti comuni e bianco delle stanze. Ultra pulito ma non mi aspettavo nulla di diverso da un hotel a 5 stelle e personale estremamente gentile. Le camere sono dotate di ogni comfort anche se non spaziosissime. Ottimi i prodotti da bagno lasciati a disposizione dell'ospite. Da favola la comodit√† del letto e dei guanciali. Ho apprezzato soprattutto la possibilit√† di regolare l'intensit√† della luce e la temperatura da un piccolo pannello sopra al comodino. Silenziosissimo nonostante la posizione molto centrale. Se proprio devo trovare un neo, la colazione mi √® parsa scarsa in variet√†.",4,2013,09,25
148,el hotel mas moderno y chic de londres,"Hemos estado 3 noches en el Me London y ha sido genial, no conozco otro hotel mejor situado, se puede ir andando a todos sitios, en pleno Covent Garden, con su animaci√≥n, perfecta situacion para conocer Londres.
El hotel es increiblemente moderno,y comodo, nos ha recordado a los hoteles de New York, a traves de la planta baja se accede a dos restaurantes muy buenos y con mucha animaci√≥n y ambiente, uno italiano y otro de carnes, en el segundo se forma una fiesta muy ambientada los fines de semana, y comida muy buena, tengo que decir en contra de otras opiniones que he le√≠do, que el servicio tanto en el desayuno, que por cierto es estupendo, como en las cenas, fue fenomenal, nos atendieron perfectamente, nos tenian nuestra mesa guardada y todo muy correcto, nos explicaron si no entendiamos algo, en fin, todo muy bonito decorado y muy bien.
tambien a traves de la planta baja se sube en un ascensor, utilizado solo para eso, a una terraza fant√°stica, la vimos de d√≠a y las vistas eran incre√≠bles, se ve todo Londres y se esta muy a gusto, y por la noche se puede cenar y tomar copas, tambien en plan fiesta.
Todo esto hace que la recepcion este en la primera planta, para  no molestar a los clientes, la verdad que dormimos en la septima y no escuchamos absolutamente ningun ruido,
La habitacion tambien muy comoda, sobre todo la cama, puedes elegir la intensidad de la luz, de los distintos tipos de m√∫sica, las almohadas estupendas.
La decoracion de hotel en su conjunto es preciosa, muy a la altura de los tiempos que estamos,
Todo nos gusto much√≠simo., la atencion de su conserjer√≠a, nos ayudaron en todo,

El personal de recepci√≥n y del hotel en general muy amables y dispuestos. LA situaci√≥n estupenda, todo muy cerca. Pero el fallo en el servicio de los desayunos es una pena. El primer d√≠a el desayuno fue en mesa y nos sirvieron. La comida estupenda pero el servicio pesimo. No guardan ning√∫n orden a la hora de servir a unos u otros por lo que hay gente que tuvo que esperar hasta 25 minutos sin que les llevaran nada mientras servian a otros que acababan de sentarse, el 2¬∫ d√≠a igual 30 minutos para unas tostadas que reclamamos m√°s de 3 veces, mientras se las ponian a otros que se acababan de sentarse.

148,4 Tage rundum zufrieden,"Au√üergew√∂hnliches Hotel, mit  futuristischem Design. 
Meine Frau und Ich waren f√ºr ein verl√§ngertes Wochenede mal wieder in London und anstelle von alttraditionellen und verstaubt angehauchten 5 Sterne Unterk√ºnften, wollten wir diesmal etwas anderes erleben und das hatten wir schlu√üendlich auch. Schon die Wandprojektionen an der Rezeption sowie die Dachterasse und das Design der Flure etc. sind sehr sch√∂n gelungen. Der Service wirkt teilweise, aber selten, etwas konfus, was aber wohl eher dem jungen Personal zuzuschreiben ist. 
Das Hotelzimmer selbst (8 Stock mit Terasse) entsprach unseren Vorstellungen. Uns uns pers√∂nlich gefiehl es auch , dass man nachts  auf der Terasse (bei geschlossener T√ºr nicht) teilweise die Musik der Dach-Lounge im Hintergrund h√∂hrte (Erinnerte mich ein bischen an Ibiza fealing).
Alles in Allem 4 gelungene Tage, sehr gute Lage, jedoch glaub ich nicht, dass meine Eltern (>70 Jahre) bei dem vorwiegend j√ºngeren Hotelg√§sten sich so wohl gef√ºhlt h√§tten wie wir. Unser n√§chster Aufenthalt in London wird 100%ig wieder in diesem Hotel sein.
Es gab doch was negatives, der Fitnessraum war sehr klein und von der Qualit√§t der Ger√§te hab ich schon bessere Gesehen, aber eigentlich ist dieser Punkt irrelevant, denn wozu soll man sich auf das Laufband in einen Raum stellen, wenn man an der Themse daneben eine viel sch√∂nere Aussicht beim Laufen hat.",5,2013,07,24
148,Muy buen hotel con un servicio que esta a su altura,"Hemos estado alojados en ese hotel durante 4 dias, el Hotel en si es impresionante, las habitaciones son muy buenas, muy modernas (tanto que resulta complicado adaptarse a los mandos de las luces).
El servicio del hotel es francamente bueno, por ejemplo en la habitacion teniamos un paraguas, cortesia del hotel y de gran utilidad en Londres, cuando saliamos del hotel, un trabajador del mismo nos vio que saliamos dos personas con un paraguas y nos ofrecio otro para poder estar mas comodos.
Es un tipo de hotel diferente, creo que muy oriendado a personas jovenes o con mentalidad joven.
El desayuno es muy muy bueno, no es el tipico buffet en el que uno se sirve, pero sorprende.
Los bares estan bien, sobre todo el superior con sus impresioantes vistas.",5,2013,07,22
148,Entre el descanso y la diversion,"Hotel moderno, pocos meses de inaugurado, muy bien ubicado en la zona de Westminster, cerca de estaciones del underground, ofrece una excelente opci√≥n para los que quieren tener un descanso adecuado(c√≤modas habitaciones con todas las comodidades) y un momento de relax en el bar del primer piso o en la terraza del ultimo con una muy buena vista de Londres. Para los que somos hispano - hablantes el hecho de que sea  parte de la cadena Melia nos facilita mucho la estad√¨a pues siempre encontraremos varias personas que hablen espa√±ol dentro del personal.

148,"Wow, wow, wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Es muy dif√≠cil encontrar adjetivos para describir la experiencia de nuestra estancia en el Me London, desde el momento en que entras en el hotel hasta que sales de el no para de sorprenderte. Est√° ubicado al lado de Convent Garden, zona ideal para pasear y hacer compras sin tener que coger un taxi.
El bar del lobby muy animado, cosa rara en los hoteles puesto que siempre parecen lugares de paso y la recepci√≥n es simplemente IMPRESIONANTE, ubicada en la primera planta es una pir√°mide hueca sobre cuyas paredes proyectan im√°genes, es digna de ver.
El resto del hotel dise√±ado por Norman Foster es una pasada, las habitaciones amplias, modernas, funcionales y bonitas. Me encanta la ducha con doble alcachofa, los audiovisuales y el control de la iluminaci√≥n.
El bar de la azotea es un aut√©ntico esc√°ndalo, tiene unas vistas tan impresionantes que parece que est√°s en una foto panor√°mica.
Por √∫ltimo los restaurantes, el famoso STK es digno de su nombre por la calidad de la comida tanto por el ambiente que se va calentando a medida que avanza la noche. El restaurante italiano tambi√©n es digo de ser ""catado"".

148,Gran Hotel en la mejor ubicacion de Londres,"A finales del mes de abril he estado 5 noches en el hotel ME London y la estancia ha sido muy agradable. Es un hotel nuevo, dise√±ado por Norman Foster y con un estilo moderno y vanguardista. Las habitaciones no son demasiado grandes, pero son c√≥modas y disponen de la √∫ltima tecnolog√≠a, incluida cafetera Nespresso. En las plantas superiores se dispone de terraza, algo excepcional en Londres. En el √∫ltimo piso del hotel hay un bar con terraza, buenos cokteles y unas vistas espectaculares del rio Tamesis: desde el London Eye al Tower Bridge, pasando por el Big Ben. El desayuno se sirve en mesa y no es bufete, por lo que resulta un poco aburrido para 5 d√≠as. No obstante, los productos son de muy buena calidad. Dispone de varios bares de copas que est√°n de moda entre la gente guapa de Londres. En mi opini√≥n, la localizaci√≥n del hotel es excelente, la mejor de todo Londres: a 1 minuto andando de Covent Garden y la zona de teatros, a 5 minutos de Trafalgar Square, a unos 10 de Picadilly Circus, a unos 12 minutos del British Museum, etc. Sin duda, volver√© a este hotel. Muy recomendable.",5,2013,05,15

Durante el checkout, s√≥lo habia una recepcionista que no hablaba espa√±ol, algo imprescindible en una cadena melia. Al llegar m√°s gente, vino otro recepcionista muy agradable que nos ayud√≥ (era espa√±ol). Personal muy atento y detallista. En el italiano se come bien, aunque echamos de menos alg√∫n plato tipo lasa√±a. En el steakhouse se come muy bien, pero mejor ir entre semana cuando no tienen DJ ni m√∫sica.",5,2013,05,14

Ottima la proposta della colazione servita al tavola nel ristorante Cucina Asellina.

148,"impacta, sorprende, dudas..... pero te gusta mucho","Hotel nuevo y terriblemente  innnovador en su est√©tica. Gran ambietazo para quien le guste lo m√°s inn . Musica  de altos decibelios al entrar de noche.... luego  pasas a areas para huespedes y reina silencio absoluto.... contraste.
Servicio muy atento, gente joven, din√°mica y con ganas de atender  al cliente. Area de recepci√≥n  .....lo siento tendreis que ir a verla, no os lo quierop explicar.
Pasillos todo negro , habitacion toda blanca.  Habitaciones  correctas en espacio ( alguna me parecio  algo peque√±a) , ventana de techo a suelo , colgada al exterior.Ba√±o comodo.En planta 10 existe un restauraqnte, bar terraza FANTASTICO.... ammbiente  de lo m√°s  cool , con unas vistas maravillosas de lOndres; fui  en mayo  y pude disfrutar de un tiempo excelente. Una comida al sol fantastica y por la noche es un bar de copas y musica en que estas muy a gustito.
tres  cosas a corregir: armario de la habitaci√≥n excesivamente por no decir MUY,  PEQUE√ëO, demasiada poca capacidad para dos persones . No penseis que viajo con todo el armario a cuestas, pero estuve 3 noches y no  tenia espacio comodo. SEgunda cosa , m√°s f√°cil de corregir  es el desayuno; preferimos sin lugar a dudas un buffet, del nivel que se merece el hotel pero buffet sin duda. Yo volver√©, voy con frecuencia, me gustar√≠a que  se cambiar√°.
Tercera cosa: a las 16:00 no estaba la habitaci√≥n arreglada...grrrr
Os lo recomiendo a todos los que os guste  ambiente  diferente, rompedor, el polo opuesto a cl√°sico. Abstenerse  los que buscais edificios  con historia , aqu√≠ toda la historia esta por escribir....",4,2013,05,11
148,Uno de los mejores hoteles de Londres,"En el oto√±o de 2012 abri√≥ por fin el ME en Londres. Fue un largu√≠simo camino, desde que el edificio Marconi, donde estuvieron algunas instalaciones de la BBC, se proyect√≥ como hotel. Cuando arranc√≥ el proyecto eran los tiempos de las vacas gordas en Espa√±a y Melia, la cadena de hoteles originaria de Espa√±a, contrat√≥ al estudio de Norman Forster para llevar a cabo el proyecto de rehabilitaci√≥n del edificio. Con los a√±os el proyecto tuvo varios incidentes pero al final consigui√≥ abrir y se ha convertido desde su inauguraci√≥n en una referencia de hotel en Londres: contempor√°neo, sofisticado dentro de su minimalismo, moderno 5*, alejado del estilo pomposo y excesivo de los hoteles de lujo londinenses para apostar por la simplicidad y el cuidado en los detalles. Todo es incre√≠ble: la recepci√≥n probablemente es la m√°s impactante que he conocido nunca, merece la pena verla, es incre√≠ble por su limpieza, sobriedad pero un resultado teatral, sobre todo de noche (no desvelo el misterio pero hay que verlo!)

Las habitaciones son amplias, magn√≠ficas, todo perfecto: colch√≥n, almohadas, toallas, presi√≥n de la ducha... detalles que me encantaron: tienen enchufes para conexi√≥n europea, amenities de Apitiva, la ducha es potente y c√≥moda, el silencio es impresionante (tiene doble ventana con doble rotura t√©rmica, no se oye nada y eso que est√° en pleno centro), el blackout de la ventana es una doble cristalera muy eficaz... 

el desayuno incluido es un men√∫ (no tienen buffet) de carnes, quesos, fruta fresca, zumo de naranja, boller√≠a, huevos... y camareros espa√±oles que saben ya c√≥mo es el ""caf√© con leche espa√±ol""

En la azotea hay una terraza para tomar algo imprescindible, y el gimnasio, aunque muy bien surtido, es peque√±o y es una pena que no aprovechasen las vistas para instalarlo en otro sitio que no fuera la planta s√≥tano.

el hotel es caro, es la √∫nica pena. Pero merece la pena absolutamente. Todo lo dem√°s es magn√≠fico!",5,2013,05,10
148,"Excelente,inmejorable situaci√≥n y personal, un hotel diferente y vanguardista.","Todo en este hotel es perfecto, destaco la situaci√≥n que es inmejorable y el trato de su personal, chicos amables y serviciales que lo dan todo en su trabajo, enhorabuena por ellos.
Las habitaciones son de dise√±o pero muy c√≥modas y amplias, lo √∫nico que ech√© de menos fue un espejo en el dormitorio para poder peinarme porque en el ba√±o no se pueden enchufar el secador y la plancha de pelo.
Al minibar no le falta ni un detalle, la m√∫sica es excelente, hay para todos los gustos y estados de animo. Lo que menos me gusto fue que desde mi habitaci√≥n en la 7¬™ planta  se o√≠a la m√∫sica de la terraza y para dormir es incomodo.
Los desayuno son muy completos y variados y recomiendo encarecidamente cenar en el restaurante italiano, es buen√≠simo, nos encanto y repetimos varios d√≠as.

148,UNA MARAVILLOSA EXPERIENCIA!,"Fin de semana espectacular en Londres!!!

Para empezar, el edificio de Foster no deja indiferente, y tanto el dise√±o como la cuidada decoraci√≥n de las habitaciones y las zonas comunes (la recepci√≥n es...stunning!) son muestra de un exquisito gusto a la hora de construir y decorar. Es simplemente precioso, muy moderno, pero usando algunos materiales cl√°sicos como el m√°rmol, que hacen de este lugar un espacio actual y elegante a la vez, donde apetece pasar tiempo. 

Cuando uno llega agotado de patear la ciudad todo el d√≠a, no hay nada que apetezca m√°s que darse una relajante ducha de lluvia, ponerse un suave albornoz y descansar con buena m√∫sica y luz ambiental (que adem√°s puedes regular con los tonos que quieras) antes de dormir en una de las mejores camas que he probado nunca: enorme y comod√≠sima!!! Y despu√©s de un sue√±o reparador nada mejor para terminar de cargar las pilas para el nuevo d√≠a que un riqu√≠simo desayuno: BUEN√çSIMO!!!!

La atenci√≥n al cliente es inmejorable, desde que entras por primera vez al hotel hasta que te marchas (y te marchas con mucha pena!). Agradezco especialmente su atenci√≥n a Nicol√°s, de recepci√≥n, que se port√≥ maravillosamente y nos cuid√≥ much√≠simo, al igual que todo el equipo de Aura, que nos llenaron la habitaci√≥n de detalles especiales (ipad, m√∫sica, mensajes, etc.).

En definitiva, un sitio para recomendar sin ninguna duda. Su excelente ubicaci√≥n, las preciosas vistas, el espectacular edificio y el servicio inmejorable hacen que la estancia en ME London sea una experiencia que verdaderamente va m√°s all√° del alojamiento!!",5,2013,04,30
148,Hotel moderno y con mucho ambiente,"Hemos estado en este hotel este fin de semana. Me ha encantado !!! Lleva solo tres meses en funcionamiento y se ha convertido en un lugar de encuentro de gente que busca algo moderno y diferente. Las vistas desde el bar restaurante de la azotea son impresionantes.
La ubicaci√≥n, las habitaciones, el personal.........todo ha sido perfecto.",5,2013,04,29
148,design hotel,"In una posizione centrale ma non caotica da dove √® possibile raggiungere quasi tutto a piedi. 
L'hotel √® nuovissimo e quindi tutto all'interno √® praticamente perfetto e bellissimo. Pareti di marmo ovunque, acciaio e arredamento di design rendono il Me Londo un'esperienza assolutamente da fare. Le camere non sono grandissime (noi abbiamo preso una energy con vista sul tamigi ... anche se si vede veramente poco e non so se vale la pena!!) ma sono bellissime con marmo scuro nei bagni e pareti in pelle bianca (finta) nella stanza da letto con un effetto molto moto elegante. Poi per√≤ bisogna soprassedere a piccoli disservizi come la macchina nesperesso che non funzionava o le luci che non si coloravano (per carit√† la cosa non √® basilare... ma se lo mettono tra le opzioni di illuminazione mi aspetto che funzioni!).
Ma ripeto l'hotel √® cos√¨ bello che ci si passa sopra. Consiglio vivamente di farsi un giro alla reception alla sera quando sulle pareti vengono proiettare delle medeuse in movimento e sembra di essere immersi in 10 mt d'acqua..
Il servizio √® ineccepibile come la puliza sia delle stanze che delle aree comuni. Una cosa per√≤ non mi ha particolarmente entusiamsto: la colazione. Non essendoci un buffet devi aspettare al tavolo e qui si perdono un po'...  quando finalmente mangi direi nulla di entusiasmante, non c'√® pane fresco ma solo alcune fettine di pane in cassetta tostate, nessuna spremuta fresca ma solo succo d'arancia, 3 brioches al tavolo e nessuna torta, muffin o biscotti...insomma credo che un 5 stelle potrebbe fare di meglio e a dire la verit√† averlo saputo prima avrei fatto colazione nei tanti bar appena fuori l'hotel.
Il roof garden invece merita una visita, noi abbiamo pranzato in un giorno di bel sole e devo dire si stava veramente bene, bella vista, buon cibo, bella musica e bella gente. Come aperitivo e dopo cena nulla di che... anche se pare sia uno dei posti pi√π trendy di Londra in questo momento, vista anche la gente super tirata che attendeva in coda di salire al 10¬∞ piano. Abbiamo anche cenato all'STK, uno dei due ristoranti (l'atro √® l'Asselina con cucina italiana, lo stesso dive si fa colazione). L'STK √® un'elegante steak house, la carne era buonissima, ma anche questo √® un posto molto trendy con musica altissima (i camerieri dovevano urlare) e c'√® una quantit√† di gente (non turisti) impressionate. Quindi bisogna andare preparati al fatto che non potr√† essere una cena romantica o rilassante..
Per concludere direi che se si ha la possibilit√†, a parit√† di costo con altri ottimi hotel a 5 stelle londinesi, la scelta del Me London non deluder√† affatto... difficile trovare altri posti cos√¨!",5,2013,04,29
148,Caro y un poco impersonal,"Este hotel de la cadena Sol Melia esta muy bien ubicado y cerca de todos los sitios turisticos de Londres (Piccadilly, Strand, Leicester Square etc...), He estado en muchos hoteles modernos pero este me parece que se pasa... me dio una impresion un poco impersonal. Las habitaciones son mimimalistas todo blanco, pero me dio una sensacion de agobio y claustrofobia (igual porque es una habitacion alargada y estrecha con una ventana bastante peque√±a). Una noche, el servicio de habitaciones (turndown service) entro en nuestra habitacion sin avisar, me parecio muy poco profesional. Luego un azulejo que sostiene la base de la ba√±era se caio y los azulejos de la duca estaban rotos... por un hotel recen estrenado, me parece que aun le falta algunos meses de rodaje....
Eso si, quiero destacar la calidad de la comida del room service y la originalidad de los platos. En resumen, me esperaba mas para un hotel de este precio/categoria.",3,2013,04,14
148,Inmejorable,"Esto no es un hotel: es una experiencia; una inolvidable y maravillosa experiencia. Escribo estas l√≠neas reci√©n llegado de Londres, despu√©s de pasar una semana en el Me London. Para empezar, la ubicaci√≥n es perfecta: a dos minutos (cronometrados) andando de Covent Garden y al mismo tiempo, tambi√©n caminando, del T√°mesis. El edificio es imponente. Lleva la firma de Norman Foster, lo que ya me hab√≠a producido de antemano una enorme curiosidad. La realidad no defrauda: una aut√©ntica obra de arte contempor√°neo. Es una construcci√≥n s√≥lida y hermosa con un sentido est√©tico y funcional del lujo que se aparta, afortunadamente, de otros establecimientos de cinco estrellas. Esto es pura vanguardia: desde la zona de recepci√≥n, con una impresionante c√∫pula a partir de una estructura piramidal, a los distintos servicios y habitaciones. Sobrio y elegante, este Me es un recorrido por una l√≠nea arquitect√≥nica absolutamente renovadora e impecable, donde cada espacio y cada detalle parece medido al mil√≠metro y al servicio del cliente. Mi habitaci√≥n, en una octava planta, ofrec√≠a unas vistas espectaculares y muy cercanas sobre el T√°mesis. El ba√±o es amplio y con unas calidades de primera, al igual que el resto de la pieza, en la que el dise√±o cobra una absoluta importancia acorde con su comodidad: no han dejado nada al azar, ni nada se escapa al buen gusto. No me he sentido como en mi casa, no; me he sentido como en la casa que me gustar√≠a tener. El hall de entrada ya da pistas de lo que te vas a encontrar, con una decoraci√≥n exquisita. En el √∫ltimo piso un restaurante con una terraza desde la que divisas pr√°cticamente toda la ciudad. Hay dos restaurantes m√°s: un italiano y un steak americano, con una carta generosa en su oferta y en sus deliciosas raciones (muy recomendables las carnes). Y algo imprescindible para quien se aloja en un hotel: el personal. Su trato es insuperable. Todos los empleados son eficaces y extremadamente amables. As√≠ tiene que ser en un hotel de estas caracter√≠sticas, pero aqu√≠, adem√°s, las cinco estrellas no suponen envaramiento ni afectaci√≥n: tanto su imagen como sus modales resultan relajados y pr√≥ximos. Para quienes, desgraciadamente, no nos desenvolvemos con soltura en un idioma extranjero, muchos de ellos son espa√±oles, lo que hace m√°s f√°cil la comunicaci√≥n. Pese a que llevaba s√≥lo un mes abierto, durante mi estancia me pareci√≥ apreciar una notable ocupaci√≥n, se√±al de que ya ha empezado a correr la mejor de las publicidades: el boca a boca. Dentro de dos meses regresar√© a Londres. No tengo ninguna duda de que ir√© al Me London. Por fin, all√≠, he encontrado mi sitio. R. Lorenzo",5,2013,04,08
148,PURO DISE√ëO Y NUEVO A ESTRENAR,"Hotel de 5 estrellas a 100 metros de Covent Garden , y muy cerca de Trafalgar Square . Ha inaugurado hace 3 meses por lo que todo est√° reci√©n estrenado. Hotel  muy moderno  y minimalistas en colores blanco y negro. La recepci√≥n es un espect√°culo: todo en m√°rmol negro con poca luz y techo alt√≠simo hasta la 10¬∫ planta.  El trato en recepci√≥n de la Srta. Marta fue estupendo y en espa√±ol . Las habitaciones son un poco estrechas, muy modernas tambi√©n y disponen hasta de luz especial  sexy en tonos morado-rosa (Le ha hecho mucha gracia a mi hijo). Cama excelente de 2 x 2 con s√°banas de calidad. No hemos escuchado ni un ruido en toda nuestra estancia. Menci√≥n muy especial tiene el desayuno: Se sirve en el restaurante de la planta baja , Cucina Asellina, con acceso directo desde el  hotel y que  en la comida y cena es un local italiano con muy buena pinta. Dispone de entrada desde la calle. No es de buffet, te lo sirven en mesa y su encargada es una muy agradable y simp√°tica asturiana llamada Montse. Te van agasajando con zumo de naranja, tabla de embutidos y quesos, tostadas, huevos a tu gusto, selecci√≥n de dulces, caf√© ...... . Un 10 para el desayuno. 
El personal es joven y din√°mico con ganas de facilitar las cosas y agradar. 
El hotel tiene una terraza-bar en la azotea que est√° muy de moda. Tiene unas excelentes vistas panor√°micas de todo lo rese√±able de Londr√©s.

148,Un hotel de dise√±o en el coraz√≥n de Londres,"Despu√©s de varios a√±os reservando el Meli√° White House este invierno optamos por el reci√©n inaugurado ME London.
El hotel est√° a cinco minutos andando de Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden y de los principales teatros de la ciudad. La  ubicaci√≥n es inmejorable, sobre todo para el turista ya que te permite ir a pie a pr√°cticamente todas las atracciones de inter√©s de la ciudad (Parlamento, westminster, st Paul Cathedral.
Hay numerosas estaciones de metro cerca que puedes coger: Temple, Charing Cross, Embankment...
Por fuera no se aprecia lo moderno que es pero una vez dentro se distingue a la primera el aire futurista de Norman Foster. En la planta de baja se encuentra el bar Marconi y la Cucina Arsellina, donde se sirve el desayuno (es de carta, incluye el t√≠pico desayuno ingl√©s y todo es de primera categor√≠a. Dedicado a los gourmets).
Lo que m√°s llama la atenci√≥n es que la recepci√≥n est√° en la primera planta. Aprovecha todo el hueco central del edificio para crear una especia de pir√°mide interior de m√°rmol sobre la que se proyectan im√°genes. Verdaderamente incre√≠ble la recepci√≥n. El personal, elegantemente vestido, es bastante atento.
Nosotros estuvimos en la habitaci√≥n ENERGY URBAN TERRACE, con vistas al t√°mesis y a todo londres. Lo mejor sin duda.
La habitaci√≥n es muy moderna y funcional y todo funciona con dom√≥tica. Tanto que incluso te permite cambiar el color de las luces de la estancia (verde, rosa, azul..).
Entre los servicios que se ofrecen se encuentra la Nespreso, todo tipo de golosinas, pienso y juguetes para perros, minibar de primeras marcas, kit para el cansancio, juguetes er√≥ticos, wifi gratis, amenities de calidad...
Otro de los atractivos del hotel es el pub acristalado que tiene en la azotea -que cuenta con una terraza chill out- y que ofrece una vista de 180 grados sobre la ciudad.

Die Suite war sehr ger√§umig und modern, zweckm√§√üig eingerichtet an alles wurde gedacht. Das sehr sch√∂ne Badezimmer mit einer Riesendusche war sehr angenehm, leider hat die Technik noch nicht so richtig funktioniert aber wenn dann kann man Licht, Heizung und vieles mehr mit einem Touchpad bedienen. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck am Dach des Hotels war spitze und sehr hochwertig, alle Mitarbeiter waren sehr bem√ºht und nach dem ersten Tag auch ein wenig lockerer ;-) der Rundumblick √ºber London von der Terrasse ist atemberaubend und wenn man Gl√ºck hat und es ist sch√∂nes Wetter kann man sehr weit sehen.

La cucina offre piatti dal tocco mediterraneo con utilizzo di materie prime di stagione. Il roof garden √® location spettacolare da dove ti si apre una vista incredibile su tutta Londra. Il bar √® molto ben frequentato con ampia scelta di cocktail e con piatti veloci da gustare. Lo consiglio vivamente anche perch√® ben posizionato: a breve distanza da Covent Garden e da tutti i migliori teatri di Londra.",5,2013,03,17
148,Muy moderno pero les falta experiencia,"El hotel tiene una situaci√≥n magnifica justo en Covent Garden,por lo que puedes ir a muchos puntos de inter√©s de Londres andando.El metro a unos 10 minutos andando.
El dise√±o del hotel es muy moderno, la decoraci√≥n me gust√≥ y el bar de la azotea tiene unas vistas muy bonitas.
Al personal se nota que le falta experiencia,son casi todos jovenes y para los espa√±oles que vayan,practicamente ninguno habla espa√±ol y aunque sepan que tu lo eres no se molestan en decir un simple ""hola"" o intentar chapurrear algo.
Iba muy ilusionada con la reserva en este hotel y me fui bastante decepcionada,supongo que con el tiempo iran corrigiendo errores,pero tienen que tener en cuenta que los clientes pagan un precio elevado por noche,por lo que la exigencia es m√°xima.
El primer dia no funcionaban las llaves,por lo que cada vez que queria entrar en la habitaci√≥n tenia que acudir a recepci√≥n para que me abrieran.No tienen distintas almohadas a las que ponen en la habitaci√≥n(por lo menos cuando yo estuve que llevaba abierto poco tiempo).La almohada era muy gorda y me destrozaba el cuello,cuando pedi en recepcion una almohada m√°s fina no me supieron decir si tenian otra diferente,se llegaron a mi habitaci√≥n para ver las almohadas que tenia y me dijeron que intentarian encontrar una...nunca obtuve respuesta.Mi habitaci√≥n estaba en la planta de recepci√≥n y por las noches tenian la m√∫sica del hotel muy  alta,parecia que dormia pared con pared con una discoteca,y eso hasta la una o las dos de la madrugada..IMPOSIBLE dormir.
El desayuno,es mi humilde opini√≥n,es el peor que he visto en un hotel.Poquisima variedad hasta limites que no imaginaba,y m√°s a√∫n cuando no te ponen buffet y tienes que pedir a la carta..servicio lentisimo,prometo que no exagero cuando pedi unas tostadas (si hubiera en el ""buffet"" me hubiera servido yo misma) y tardaron 40 minutos en servirmelas...como se explica esto?el restaurante no estaba lleno,solo unas pocas mesas,y tenian personal suficiente.Y a mi que no me gusta el cafe,pedi un hot chocolat (o algo parecido con cacao,me daba igual) y me dicen que no tienen..
Para los que nunca han viajado a Londres,y creo que esto suelen hacerlo muchos hoteles,os digo que el hotel os bloquea de vuestra tarjeta una cantidad de garantia (en mi caso 470 euros)para que lo tengais en cuenta,porque yo no lo sabia y es una cantidad significativa con la que no puedes contar,y no te la devuelven hasta un par de dias despu√©s de haber dejado el hotel.
En fin,desde mi llegada a mi salida me senti mal tratada por este hotel,una pena,tiene mucho potencial.",2,2013,03,14
148,Una gran experiencia,"Mi primer viaje a London no ha podido resultar mejor gracias a este hotel. Desde que entre por la puerta fui atendido de una forma muy especial, todos sus empleados me han trasmitido una sensacion de bienestar, servicio de cinco esrellas pero muy cercano. La habitacion muy comoda y las vistas desde el bar de arriba espectaculares. Gracias al equipo de aura por cuidarnos y hacerlo aun mejor. Respecto a nuestra ubicacion no ha podido ser mejor a 2 minutos de Covent Garden en el centro de Londres, Geniallllllllll!!",5,2013,03,10
148,Todo magn√≠fico.,"Hemos estado cuatro d√≠as en Londres en familia y el hotel ME London ha sido un gran descubrimiento. La ubicaci√≥n del hotel es inmejorable. Su dise√±o es fabuloso: un hotel moderno a la par que confortable. Y el trato del personal ha sido exquisito en todo momento. La √∫nica pega es que el sistema del desayuno inclu√≠do no nos ha parecido demasiado acertado. En resumen, todo magn√≠fico.",4,2013,03,06
148,hotel fant√°stico en Londres,"Estuvimos en el Me London en Febrero, la situaci√≥n del hotel es muy buena. Hotel espl√©ndido, moderno de dise√±o y muy confortable. Lo mejor del Me London su capital humano.
Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo que visite Londres. Es como un sue√±o.",5,2013,02,24
148,Hotel Espectacular... Oasis en Londres,"Fant√°stico Hotel situado en pleno centro de Londres. Moderno pero con una atenci√≥n por parte de los trabajadores que hace que te sientas como en tu casa.
Excelente comida. Si tienes que ir a Londres no puedes perd√©rtelo, vale la pena.",5,2013,02,20
148,Modernidad y lujo en el coraz√≥n de Londres,"Fui a Londres a pasar un fin de semana, y decid√≠ alojarme en el nuevo hotel de Londres. Soy arquitecto, y ten√≠a mucha curiosidad por verlo bien, y no me decepcion√≥. El dise√±o es impresionante, desde el mobiliario del marconi Lounge y la recepci√≥n hasta el √∫ltimo detalle de las habitaciones.. La habitaci√≥n que nos dieron era de un tama√±o m√°s que aceptable y funcional. Para mi la ubicaci√≥n es inmejorable, en pleno Covent Garden pero sin estar en pleno alboroto, a un paso del r√≠o. Quiz√°s se not√≥ un poco que acaban de abrir.. falta por ultimar peque√±os detalles. El hotel es caro, pero merece la pena comparado con el resto de hoteles de su categor√≠a. Recomendado 100%.",5,2013,02,20
148,mai visto un hotel cos√¨,"√® semplicemente bellissimo ....a livello di servizi niente di speciale , ci sono anche hotel migliori , ma a livello di design √® uno degli hotel pi√π incredibili che abbia mai visto ...da vedere la reception che √® indescrivibile ...ache le camere stupende per non parlare del roof garden , da cui si gode una vista di Londra unica ...bellissimo anche se caro ..........",5,2013,02,12
148,Excelente hotel con perfecta ubicaci√≥n,"Me aloje en el hotel solo una noche porque ten√≠a escala nocturna en Londres. El hotel es s√∫per moderno para ser Londres, ya que generalmente en esta ciudad los hoteles son caros y antiguos. La ubicaci√≥n es muy buena. La habitaci√≥n no es de las m√°s amplias en las que he estado pero est√°n s√∫per bien decoradas y el ba√±o est√° tambi√©n genial. Sin lugar a dudas volver√© en la pr√≥xima visita a Londres. Es caro pero merece la pena compar√°ndolo con el resto de 5 estrellas de la capital.",5,2013,02,09
